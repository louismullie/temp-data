## Question

What is the differential diagnosis for hematuria in a patient with an ileal conduit?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of hematuria in a patient with an ileal-conduit urinary diversion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming that the discoloration represents true hematuria and that the urine specimen is valid in a conduit patient. Then, I should classify gross versus microscopic hematuria and apply risk stratification. Next, I will review infection as a common benign cause, followed by risk-based imaging and endoscopic evaluation. After that, I need to consider stones and foreign-body irritation, malignant etiologies, and rare but life-threatening vascular fistulas. Finally, I will address structural and functional complications of the diversion and clarify the role of cytology, nephrologic clues, and follow-up plans [^115xN5G8] [^114N69ay] [^117DFb2D].

> Let me first confirm the basics: is this true hematuria or a look-alike such as pigmenturia or contamination, and is the sample reliable from an ileal conduit. I should confirm with microscopic urinalysis demonstrating at least 3 RBCs per high power field to establish microhematuria, and I must remember that dipstick heme positivity should be confirmed with microscopy before proceeding, especially in asymptomatic adults, to avoid unnecessary workups [^115xN5G8] [^113VR3kr]. Wait, let me verify the collection method in a conduit patient, since stomal bags can be contaminated by skin flora or stool; a catheterized sample directly from the conduit is preferred to reduce contamination and improve culture validity, and understanding diversion anatomy helps avoid misinterpretation of imaging and endoscopic findings [^117R1XY6] [^114Ar3mJ].

> Next, I should classify the bleeding as gross or microscopic and apply risk stratification, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Gross hematuria carries a higher pretest probability of significant pathology including malignancy and mandates prompt urologic evaluation, while microscopic hematuria requires risk-based evaluation using the AUA/SUFU framework that incorporates age, sex, degree of hematuria, smoking, and prior gross hematuria to guide testing intensity [^112AjDdC] [^114N69ay] [^112vyxyX]. I need to ensure I account for the diversion context: many ileal-conduit patients are intrinsically high risk due to prior urothelial carcinoma and pelvic surgery, so a full evaluation with lower-tract endoscopy of the conduit and upper-tract imaging is generally indicated rather than deferred [^114N69ay].

> I will now examine infectious etiologies, because urinary tract infection is common after urinary diversion and can present atypically without classic lower urinary tract symptoms. I should obtain urinalysis with microscopy and urine culture from a catheterized conduit specimen, treat a documented infection, and then repeat urinalysis to confirm resolution; persistent hematuria after appropriate therapy warrants full hematuria evaluation to avoid missing coexisting malignancy or stones [^114Ar3mJ] [^114N69ay]. But wait, what if the culture returns mixed flora from a bag sample? I should double-check that the sample was obtained properly from the conduit and not the appliance to avoid false positives driving unnecessary antibiotics [^117R1XY6].

> Next, I should review the imaging strategy and endoscopic approach in a risk-aligned manner. For high-risk microscopic or gross hematuria, CT urography is recommended as initial upper-tract imaging when renal function and contrast risk permit, given its superior diagnostic performance for upper tract urothelial carcinoma, whereas renal/bladder ultrasound can be considered in intermediate-risk settings or when contrast is contraindicated with the understanding that sensitivity for UTUC is lower [^117DFb2D] [^113n7Gwo] [^112MZhiB]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said CT urography is the most sensitive test for stones; that would be misleading — noncontrast CT of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder is the preferred modality for detecting calculi, while CT urography provides high sensitivity and specificity for UTUC detection and evaluation of urothelial lesions, so I should tailor the protocol to the suspected pathology and the patient's risk and renal status [^111Y8aYW] [^114netsa] [^117DFb2D].

> Let me consider stones and foreign-body irritation next. Patients with ileal conduits have a notable burden of upper-tract complications, including urolithiasis, and they are also at risk for encrusted indwelling stents that can provoke hematuria or infection; if stones or encrustation are suspected, noncontrast CT is most informative, and management often involves ureteroscopic extraction or stent exchange depending on location and burden [^117CFjiR] [^111Y8aYW]. Hold on, I should verify access considerations: retrograde ureteroscopy via the conduit can be technically challenging due to long, tortuous segments, with successful access in a substantial but not universal proportion of cases, so an antegrade approach may be needed when retrograde access fails [^117CFjiR].

> Now, malignant etiologies require high vigilance in this population. I should confirm that upper-tract urothelial carcinoma remains a key concern; CT urography offers around 93% sensitivity and 99% specificity for UTUC in meta-analytic data, and diagnostic ureteroscopy can clarify equivocal imaging, while conduit-end cystoscopy with directed biopsies evaluates urothelial recurrence within the conduit or at the anastomosis [^113n7Gwo] [^114netsa] [^114N69ay]. I need to check the role of urine cytology here: AUA/SUFU advises against routine cytology when cystoscopy is normal, reserving cytology for high-risk patients with equivocal cystoscopic findings, persistent microhematuria with irritative symptoms, or risk factors for carcinoma in situ after a negative work-up, which fits this high-risk context but should still be used judiciously [^114N69ay] [^115vWpps]. Finally, let me not forget late adenocarcinoma arising at the uro-intestinal anastomosis, a rare but recognized late complication that can present with hematuria years after diversion, prompting cross-sectional imaging and targeted biopsy when suspected [^1154frYt].

> I should also consider a vascular fistula, a rare but life-threatening cause of massive hematuria in conduit patients with indwelling stents or prior pelvic radiation. The clinical clue is sudden, profuse, bright-red bleeding with hemodynamic instability, and the work-up should include emergent CT angiography or digital-subtraction angiography, with endovascular embolization as the usual definitive therapy; I need to keep in mind that most ureterovascular fistulas involve the iliac system, but rare fistulas to branches such as the superior rectal artery have been reported and require a high index of suspicion [^113bhTgd] [^113LzrDP] [^112rB5Aa] [^112sYx2G]. Hold on, I should verify stent history and radiation exposure in the chart to prioritize this diagnosis during active bleeding because delays can be catastrophic [^112sYx2G].

> The original outline mentioned structural and functional complications but left that section unfinished, so let me reconsider and complete it here. Structural causes include stomal or conduit mucosal inflammation, bleeding granulation tissue, anastomotic strictures causing upstream irritation, and parastomal trauma, any of which can manifest with hematuria; imaging and endoscopy tailored to the diversion anatomy help differentiate these from malignant or vascular causes, and rare neoplasms of the conduit segment such as carcinoid have been described [^117R1XY6] [^117CFjiR] [^114odWRX]. I need to check for fistulous complications to adjacent bowel or skin, which may present atypically; in complex cases, multimodality imaging and multidisciplinary review improve diagnostic yield and guide whether medical or surgical management is indicated [^114deBKs] [^116SQuQL].

> Next, I should review the endoscopic pathway specific to diversions, since standard cystoscopy differs here. Evaluation includes flexible or rigid endoscopy of the ileal conduit with careful inspection and biopsies of suspicious areas, and when upper-tract lesions are suspected, retrograde access via the conduit for diagnostic ureteroscopy and potential intervention is attempted, acknowledging its technical limitations and the need for antegrade routes when retrograde access is not feasible [^114N69ay] [^117CFjiR]. Let me verify local expertise and equipment for these advanced approaches before committing to a route, as outcomes depend heavily on center experience [^117CFjiR].

> I should confirm the role of ancillary tests and nephrologic clues. Routine urinary cytology has low yield in the initial evaluation of microscopic hematuria and should not be used indiscriminately, aligning with AUA/SUFU 2025 guidance to reserve cytology for specific high-risk scenarios or equivocal endoscopy, and to avoid it when cystoscopy is normal [^1127MwzE] [^115vWpps]. If I find proteinuria, dysmorphic RBCs, casts, or AKI without another explanation, I need to pivot and consider glomerular disease and coordinate nephrology input, because in that setting hematuria may be renal in origin and requires a different diagnostic pathway and urgency, especially if rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is suspected [^112PEUde] [^113BSiLJ] [^115xN5G8]. Hold on, I should verify blood pressure and serum creatinine at baseline, as recommended by AUA/SUFU for initial evaluation to inform risk and next steps [^116SrBWt].

> Finally, I need to ensure appropriate follow-up based on risk category and initial findings. For patients categorized as low or intermediate risk who defer some testing, repeat urinalysis and dynamic reclassification guide when to escalate evaluation, whereas high-risk conduit patients generally proceed with full evaluation and then tailored surveillance depending on identified pathology and ongoing risk; these steps reflect the updated AUA/SUFU recommendations emphasizing risk-based care and shared decision-making [^115HdPpN] [^112YRYTT] [^114N69ay]. If infection was the initial diagnosis, I should confirm clearance of hematuria post-treatment; persistence necessitates completing the risk-based workup to avoid missed malignancy or structural disease [^114N69ay].

In patients with an ileal conduit, hematuria [^114Ar3mJ] most often results from **infection, stones [^117CFjiR], or malignancy** [^1154frYt]. The differential includes:

- **Infection**: UTIs are common and can cause hematuria [^114Ar3mJ].
- **Stones**: Conduit or upper tract calculi are frequent and often bleed [^117CFjiR].
- **Malignancy**: Recurrent urothelial carcinoma or adenocarcinoma at the ureteroenteric anastomosis or within the conduit [^1154frYt].
- **Anastomotic strictures**: Bleeding from strictures or ischemic segments [^117CFjiR].
- **Ureteroarterial fistula**: Rare, life-threatening cause of severe hematuria [^113bhTgd] [^113LzrDP].
- **Conduit mucosal irritation**: From chronic catheterization or stoma trauma [^117R1XY6].
- **Coagulopathy**: Anticoagulation or bleeding disorders [^113VR3kr].

Evaluation should include **urinalysis, culture, CBC, renal function testing [^116SrBWt], and imaging (CT urography [^117DFb2D] or ultrasound [^113n7Gwo])**. Conduit endoscopy is indicated for persistent or unexplained bleeding [^117CFjiR]. Management targets the **underlying cause**, with urgent intervention for severe bleeding or suspected fistula [^112sYx2G].

### Hematuria [^116UCChT]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The emergency physician can expect to commonly evaluate patients with hematuria, and the differential diagnosis will include both benign and life-threatening causes. This differential is divided into the following categories: glomerular or nonglomerular, coagulopathy-related, traumatic, and factitious causes. Nonglomerular causes account for the majority of hematuria evaluated in the ED, with infection and stones being the most prevalent diagnoses. Glomerular causes will have associated red cell casts and proteinuria present on urinalysis. Painless atraumatic gross hematuria in the elderly is considered to be caused by a malignancy until proven otherwise. A focused history, physical exam, and appropriate diagnostic testing in the ED usually yield a diagnosis. If the patient is discharged home, proper follow-up with the primary care physician, urologist, or nephrologist is indicated, depending upon the diagnosis.

### Late uro-ileal cancer after incorporation of ileum into the urinary tract [^1154frYt]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Development of late uro-intestinal malignancy after bowel incorporation into the urinary tract is a constant long-term hazard, even in the absence of fecal material. We report six such cases.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 350 patients treated with an ileal conduit, 260 with ileal replacement of the ureter, and 55 with ileocystoplasty were evaluated and followed for a minimum of four years. The methods of evaluation included urine analysis for microscopic hematuria, urine culture, serum creatinine, and abdominal ultrasonography. These evaluations were performed every two months after cystectomy for bladder cancer and every six months in other cases. Annual urinary cytology and excretory urography were conducted. Computerized tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging was performed annually after radical cystectomy or if there was evidence of hematuria, ureteral obstruction, or a filling defect in the bladder, pouch, or conduit on excretory urography. Endoscopic evaluation was conducted in some cases. If malignancy was diagnosed, chest x-ray and bone scintigraphy were performed.

- **Results**: A total of 645 patients were evaluable. Of these patients, late cancer developed at the uro-intestinal anastomotic site in six (0.9%), including 1 of 348 (0.3%) who underwent ileal conduit, 3 of 54 (5.5%) ileocystoplasty, and 2 of 258 (0.8%) ileal replacement of ureter. The latent period from the time of original surgery till the development of cancer ranged from four to 32 years (mean ± standard deviation 20.2 ± 10.9). The pathological type of cancer was adenocarcinoma in three patients.

### Retrograde endourological management of upper urinary tract abnormalities in patients with ileal conduit urinary diversion: A dual-center experience [^117CFjiR]. Journal of Endourology (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with ileal conduit urinary diversions are at an increased risk of long-term upper urinary tract (UUT) complications, including anastomotic strictures, infections, and urolithiasis. The reconstructed urinary system poses challenges for endoscopic manipulation. We present and describe our dual-center experience in performing retrograde ureteroscopy to treat or diagnose UUT abnormalities in patients with ileal conduit incontinent diversion.

- **Patients and methods**: We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records for all patients with previous urinary diversion who underwent retrograde ureteroscopic procedures via the ileal loop in our institutions over a nine-year period (between June 2007 and August 2016).

- **Results**: Fifty-four procedures were performed involving 36 patients. The mean age was 61 years (ranging from 28 to 90). The average time from diversion to ureteroscopic procedure was 13.0 years (ranging from 0.08 to 53). Stone disease was the most common indication for intervention in 35.2% (19/54) of cases, with a stone-free rate of 78.9% (15/19). Other indications included surveillance of transitional-cell carcinoma in 22.2% (12/54), diagnostic flexible ureteroscopy (fURS) in 20.4% (11/54), stricture management in 11.1% (6/54), removal of encrusted stent/nephrostomy in 7.4% (4/54), urine leak after diversion in 1.9% (1/54), and miscellaneous in 1.9% (1/54). Successful retrograde access was achieved in 74% (40/54) of cases. A long and tortuous ileal segment, too difficult to negotiate, was the most common cause of failure to access the UUT.

### Can renal and bladder ultrasound replace computerized tomography urogram in patients investigated for microscopic hematuria [^113n7Gwo]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria is a cardinal clinical symptom with an associated risk of urinary tract cancer. The risk of malignancy in patients who present with macroscopic hematuria is 20.4%, compared to a 5.2% risk in those with microscopic hematuria. Bladder cancer is the most common cancer detected in cases of microscopic hematuria, accounting for 4.8% of those investigated. Renal cancer and upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) are less common, with incidences of 0.3% and 0.1% respectively.

Recommendations on who should be investigated for microscopic hematuria differ across guideline bodies. While there is consensus that cystoscopy remains the investigation of choice to visualize the bladder, there is a lack of consensus on the optimal upper tract imaging. Renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS) and computerized tomography urogram (CTU) are the most commonly used imaging modalities. The American Urological Association (AUA) recommends CTU for both macroscopic and microscopic hematuria, while the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the American College of Physicians (ACP) do not specify a preferred imaging modality. Similarly, the role of upper tract imaging in patients newly diagnosed with bladder cancer differs among guidelines.

CTU has the highest diagnostic performance for identifying upper tract disease. A meta-analysis suggested that CTU achieves 93% sensitivity and 99% specificity for UTUC. However, the diagnostic performance of CTU should be balanced against the risk associated with intravenous contrast medium. Administration of intravenous contrast is linked to a 3% risk of contrast-induced nephropathy in high-risk patients.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for microhematuria, more specifically with respect to initial imaging and cystoscopy, ACR 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining CT urography without and with IV contrast as initial imaging for microhematuria in patients with risk factors and without any of the following: history of recent vigorous exercise, presence of infection or viral illness, present or recent menstruation, or renal parenchymal disease.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA/SUFU guideline (2025) [^114N69ay]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for microhematuria, specifically concerning urine cytology, the AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend considering obtaining urine cytology in high-risk patients with equivocal findings on cystoscopic evaluation. This is also advised for patients with persistent microscopic hematuria and irritative voiding symptoms, or those with risk factors for carcinoma in situ following a negative workup.

### Can renal and bladder ultrasound replace computerized tomography urogram in patients investigated for microscopic hematuria [^117WgheX]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Further, cost-effectiveness analysis recommended performing RBUS instead of CTU to evaluate patients with microscopic hematuria. A comparison of four diagnostic approaches, including CT alone, cystoscopy alone, CT with cystoscopy, and RBUS with cystoscopy, suggested that the combination of RBUS with cystoscopy represents the most cost-effective combination at $53,810 per each cancer detected. Replacing RBUS with CTU would cost $6,480,484 per each cancer identified. It was estimated that using RBUS instead of CTU would result in a cost savings of $390 million, which is much needed in an era of escalating health care costs.

The role of cystoscopy to visualize the bladder remains the gold standard. Even after excluding suboptimal scans, a patient with a normal CTU or RBUS still requires cystoscopy due to the high risk of false-negative findings. This is similar to the diagnostic ability of FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved urinary biomarkers to detect bladder cancer, which have a reported sensitivity of 57% to 82% and a specificity of 74% to 88%. While larger tumors would be easily identifiable, smaller tumors might be missed. It is likely that optimized CTU with the bladder well distended and contrast material, which fully opacifies the bladder lumen, would improve diagnostic accuracy. However, such scans may be difficult to achieve in clinical practice.

### Committee opinion No.703: Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^111iUVwE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is an important clinical sign of urinary tract malignancy. It has been variably defined over the years. The evidence is primarily based on data from male patients; however, the patient's sex influences the differential diagnosis. The risk of urinary tract malignancy (bladder, ureter, and kidney) is significantly less in women than in men. Among women, being older than 60 years, having a history of smoking, and having gross hematuria are the strongest predictors of urologic cancer.

In low-risk, never-smoking women younger than 50 years, without gross hematuria and with fewer than 25 red blood cells per high-power field, the risk of urinary tract malignancy is less than or equal to 0.5%. In these cases, evaluation may result in more harm than benefit and is unlikely to be cost-effective. Thus, data support changing hematuria recommendations in this low-risk group.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Urogynecologic Society encourage organizations producing future guidelines on the evaluation of microscopic hematuria to perform sex-specific analyses and produce practical sex-specific recommendations. In the meantime, they recommend that asymptomatic, low-risk, never-smoking women aged 35–50 years undergo evaluation only if they have more than 25 red blood cells per high-power field.

### Computed tomography-urography for upper urinary tract imaging: Is it required for all patients who present with hematuria [^114netsa]. Journal of Endourology (2011).

- **Purpose**: To define in which patients who present with microscopic or macroscopic hematuria computed tomography urography (CTU) is indicated as an imaging mode for the upper urinary tract (UUT).

- **Patients and Methods**: We conducted a prospective study on consecutive patients who attended a modern protocol-driven hematuria clinic from January 2006 to February 2010. Standard tests, including history taking, physical examination, urinalysis via the dipstick method, ultrasonography of kidneys and bladder performed by urologists, cystoscopy, and cytology, were directed to all patients. The mode of additional UUT imaging (ultrasonography by a radiologist or four-phase CTU/magnetic resonance (MR) urography (MRU) when CTU was contraindicated) was selected according to a risk factor-based management algorithm. The added value of cross-sectional urography (CTU/MRU) supplementary to ultrasonography (by urologists) to detect renal masses, UUT tumors, and stones was assessed. Univariate and multivariate analysis on predictive factors for cross-sectional urography result was performed.

- **Results**: From the total of 841 patients, lesions that might account for hematuria could not be identified in 462 (54.9%), whereas in 250 (29.7%) and 124 (14.7%) patients, hematuria was from benign and malignant disease, respectively. Cross-sectional urography revealed relevant UUT lesions in 73 of 525 (13.9%) patients. Only the result of ultrasonography (odds ratio [OR] 7.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0–14.9, P < 0.001) and the type of hematuria (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3–5.1, P = 0.01) were significant predictors for cross-sectional urography.

### Patterns of hematuria referral to urologists: Does a gender disparity exist [^1126RPVY]? Urology (2008). Low credibility.

To examine the referral patterns of hematuria within a nonprofit healthcare organization, this study aimed to determine the factors influencing referral. Hematuria remains a significant indicator of urologic disease, such as urothelial malignancy. The increasing awareness of gender differences in tumor stage at bladder cancer presentation has led to speculation about delayed referral and diagnosis in women. However, little is known about the referral patterns of hematuria and whether gender differences exist.

The insurance records of 926 consecutive adult health plan participants (559 men and 367 women) with newly diagnosed hematuria from 1998 to 2002 were examined. The patterns of urologic referral were evaluated, and a Cox multivariate regression model was used to examine the relationship between urologic referral and relevant variables.

Overall, 263 men (47%) and 102 women (28%) were referred for urologic evaluation of hematuria, with a median follow-up of 27 and 26 months, respectively. Referral was initiated by the primary care physician in 80% of the cohort. Increased urologic referral was associated with advancing age, repeated hematuria, provider type, and male gender. The adjusted hazard ratio of male referral was 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.31–2.08) compared with female referral.

Primary care physicians practicing in a managed care setting are less likely to refer women for a urologic evaluation of new or first episodes of hematuria than to refer men in all patient age categories, except for 40–49 years.

### Urethral mucinous adenocarcinoma of the prostate: An uncommon and diagnostically complex disease [^111wuaer]. Urology (2020). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old male presented with hematuria and mucosuria. A transurethral resection of the prostate revealed adenocarcinoma in situ with mucinous features. He underwent a robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with lymph node dissection. Pathology confirmed T2 primary mucin-producing urothelial type adenocarcinoma in the prostatic urethra. Urothelial adenocarcinoma arising in the prostatic urethra is an uncommon disease that warrants clear differentiation from other malignancies due to its aggressive nature. The differential includes urologic and gastrointestinal malignancies, making the diagnosis complex. Accurate diagnosis is critical to providing appropriate treatment, as these patients are at high risk of developing recurrence and metastatic disease.

### Assessment of microscopic hematuria in adults [^115UnMZX]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria, a common finding on routine urinalysis of adults, is clinically significant when three to five red blood cells per high-power field are visible. Etiologies of microscopic hematuria range from incidental causes to life-threatening urinary tract neoplasm. The lack of evidence-based imaging guidelines can complicate the family physician's decision about the best way to proceed.

Patients with proteinuria, red cell casts, and elevated serum creatinine levels should be referred promptly to a nephrology subspecialist. Microscopic hematuria with signs of urinary tract infection should resolve with appropriate treatment of the underlying infection. Patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or with hematuria persisting after the treatment of a urinary tract infection also need to be evaluated. Because upper and lower urinary tract pathologies often coexist, patients should be evaluated using cytology plus intravenous urography, computed tomography, or ultrasonography. When urine cytology results are abnormal, cystoscopy should be performed to complete the investigation.

### Does small-cell phenotype predict the natural history of prostate cancer? A case study in disease behavior [^111qYXWp]. Nature Clinical Practice Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

A 52-year-old man presented to his urologist with hematuria and symptoms of frequency and incomplete voiding. The patient received antibiotics without symptom resolution. His prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 6.6 ng/ml, and a digital rectal examination revealed a normal-sized firm prostate gland. A biopsy obtained by transurethral resection revealed poorly differentiated Gleason 9 adenocarcinoma of the prostate with small-cell/neuroendocrine features. Pure small-cell cancer or poorly differentiated prostate cancer may secrete little or no PSA. One should be alerted to this phenotype in a patient with large-volume disease on biopsy or examination and a low PSA or PSA not in proportion to tumor burden.

- **Investigations**: Digital rectal examination, laboratory tests, cystoscopy, prostatic chips obtained from transurethral resection, prostate biopsy, bone scan, CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

- **Diagnosis**: Poorly differentiated Gleason 9 adenocarcinoma of the prostate with small-cell/neuroendocrine features.

- **Management**: Transurethral resection, androgen blockade with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog and antiandrogen flutamide, oral bicalutamide, docetaxel, and oral estramustine. Total pelvic exenteration with ileal conduit urinary diversion and permanent end-colostomy formation, percutaneous nephrostomy placement, cisplatin combined with etoposide.

### Delayed ileal neobladder fistula caused by bladder stones: a case report [^116SQuQL]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Ileal neobladder fistula is a rare complication after radical cystectomy, with an incidence of approximately 0.7%. At present, there are scattered reports of vesicoileal fistula, but there are no reports of ileal neobladder fistula (INF) caused by bladder stones. In this paper, a case of ileal neobladder fistula caused by chronic stimulation of bladder stones was successfully diagnosed and treated.

- **Case presentation**: A 68-year-old man who had undergone radical cystectomy and an orthotopic ileal neobladder procedure 10 years prior presented with refractory diarrhea and oliguria and was diagnosed with ileal neobladder fistula caused by chronic stimulation of bladder stones. We performed fistulectomy, cystotomy, partial ileectomy, and end-to-end ileal anastomosis, and the patient recovered and was discharged after the operation.

- **Conclusion**: Urinary calculi are delayed complications of orthotopic neobladder construction after total cystectomy. Bladder stones are a rare complication of ileal neovesical fistula, which can cause neovesical cutaneous fistula. It is difficult to diagnose through routine examination and easily misdiagnosed as acute gastroenteritis. Surgery is an effective treatment for INF and can achieve a good prognosis.

### Incidence of recurrent frank hematuria and urological cancers: prospective 6.9 years of followup [^113RuxKu]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

The majority of patients presenting with frank hematuria have no diagnosis. There is a paucity of literature on the recurrence of frank hematuria and the incidence of urological cancers in these patients, and this study addresses both issues.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a prospective cohort study of 578 consecutive patients referred with frank hematuria between 1999 and 2001 who underwent full investigations with a mean followup of 6.9 years. The primary outcome measure was the probability of frank hematuria recurrence after the initial negative investigations and the incidence of urological cancers in these patients.

- **Results**: Diagnosis was made in 206 (35.6%) patients at initial presentation. Diagnosis was not made at initial presentation in the remaining 372 (64.4%) patients, of whom 81 died without a diagnosis during follow-up (32 within 2 years of presentation). A questionnaire was mailed to the remaining 291 patients, and 202 (69.4%) responded. Of the responders, 41 (20.3%) reported frank hematuria recurrence (single episode in 10 and multiple episodes in 31). A significant urological diagnosis was made upon repeat evaluation in 21 (10.4%) patients, which included urological malignancy in 4 (2%).

- **Conclusions**: Approximately 80% of cases cleared by initial investigation remained clear, and 9.8% with frank hematuria recurrence were diagnosed with a urological malignancy. Frank hematuria recurrence requires vigilance and repeat investigation.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^1127MwzE]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Our study indicates that the prevalence of bladder cancer in patients presenting with microscopic hematuria is low (7%). A key question is what is the proportion of subjects in whom a positive cytology prompted a biopsy that was positive for cancer, in whom a biopsy would not otherwise have been performed? None of our patients had a positive cytology and a negative cystoscopic/radiologic evaluation. This is consistent with our previous study that demonstrated an extremely low yield of urinary cytology in the evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria. To our knowledge, this is the first contemporary report bringing the utility of urinary cytology in patients with microscopic hematuria into question.

As for the application of serial urinary cytologies, previous studies demonstrated a marginal improvement by serial examinations, which was confirmed in our study. Because of this low prevalence and the low sensitivity, the utility of urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of patients with microscopic hematuria is minimal, especially since all high-risk patients proceeded to cystourethroscopy and upper urinary tract radiologic evaluation.

AUA guidelines recommend that patients presenting with microscopic hematuria should undergo upper tract evaluation along with cystoscopy. When the CT scan is not feasible, MRI or renal ultrasound with bilateral retrograde pyelograms can be substituted. This evaluation is adequate in assessing the kidneys, collecting system, ureters, bladder, and urethra as the cause of the hematuria.

### Comparison of the harms, advantages, and costs associated with alternative guidelines for the evaluation of hematuria [^113RAdLf]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Existing recommendations for the diagnostic testing of hematuria range from uniform evaluation of varying intensity to patient-level risk stratification. Concerns have been raised about not only the costs and advantages of computed tomography (CT) scans but also the potential harms of CT radiation exposure.

- **Objective**: To compare the advantages, harms, and costs associated with five guidelines for hematuria evaluation.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A microsimulation model was developed to assess each of the following guidelines (listed in order of increasing intensity) for initial evaluation of hematuria: Dutch, Canadian Urological Association (CUA), Kaiser Permanente (KP), Hematuria Risk Index (HRI), and American Urological Association (AUA). Participants comprised a hypothetical cohort of patients (n = 100,000) with hematuria aged 35 years or older. This study was conducted from August 2017 through November 2018.

- **Exposures**: Under the Dutch and CUA guidelines, patients received cystoscopy and ultrasonography if they were 50 years or older (Dutch) or 40 years or older (CUA). Under the KP and HRI guidelines, patients received different combinations of cystoscopy, ultrasonography, and CT urography or no evaluation on the basis of risk factors. Under the AUA guidelines, all patients 35 years or older received cystoscopy and CT urography.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Urinary tract cancer detection rates, radiation-induced secondary cancers from CT radiation exposure, procedural complications, false-positive rates per 100,000 patients, and incremental cost per additional cancer detected were assessed.

### Urinary tract infections in patients with urinary diversion [^114Ar3mJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Several surgical techniques have been used to provide urinary diversion after radical cystectomy. The noncontinent type of urinary diversion, which utilizes an intestinal conduit, and the continent urinary diversion, such as ureterosigmoidostomy or the construction of an intestinal pouch that serves as a reservoir for urine, were commonly practiced in the past. This has resulted in a substantial number of patients encountered in clinical practice. In recent years, the orthotopic urinary diversion, also known as the neobladder, has gained widespread use. The incidence and characteristics of urinary tract infections in patients with different types of urinary diversion are reviewed here. Clinicians should be aware that urinary tract infection is a frequent cause of fever in these patients, occurring at a significant rate. Additionally, symptoms from the lower urinary tract may not be prominent in this population.

### Endovascular coil embolization of inferior mesenteric artery to ileal-conduit fistula: A case report [^112rB5Aa]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Uretero-arterial fistulas (UAFs) are uncommon and pose a diagnostic dilemma, making them life-threatening if not recognized and treated expediently. UAFs involving small arteries such as a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) are particularly rare, presenting further diagnostic and treatment challenges. There should be a high index of suspicion for UAFs when intervening on patients with a history of treated pelvic cancers and long-standing ureteric stents presenting with hematuria not attributable to another cause.

- **Case presentation**: We present a case of a fistula formed between a distal branch of the IMA — the superior rectal artery — and an ileal-conduit in a patient with a long-standing reverse nephroureterostomy (Hobbs) catheter, presenting with abdominal pain and hematuria through the conduit. During a tube exchange, contrast injection demonstrated a fistula with the superior rectal artery, multiple ileal intraluminal blood clots, and active extravasation. The patient became tachycardic and hypotensive, actively bleeding through the ileal-conduit, prompting a massive transfusion protocol. Successful endovascular coiling of the superior rectal artery was performed, resulting in the resolution of active extravasation and stabilization of the patient. The patient recovered and was discharged in stable condition 10 days later.

- **Conclusions**: Although UAFs are uncommon, our case demonstrates key predisposing risk factors for fistula development: pelvic cancer surgery, pelvic radiation, and a prolonged ureteric stent through the ileal-conduit.

### Evaluation of the patient with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^112zzZRS]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) is relatively common in clinical practice, but the etiology remains unclear in the majority of patients; it is rarely related to genitourinary malignancies. The 2012 guidelines of the American Urological Association recommend an evaluation following a single positive urinalysis, with mandatory upper tract evaluation in all patients, preferably with CT urography (CTU). The likelihood of detecting significant upper tract abnormalities, particularly malignancies, is low with CTU. Meanwhile, incidental extraurinary abnormalities are often found, the majority of which are not clinically significant. The workup for these incidental findings has significant financial and clinical implications.

Primary care physicians, who are most apt to encounter patients with AMH, have a low rate of adherence to the AUA guidelines. This might result from the broadening of criteria for AMH evaluation by the AUA, resulting in uncertainty among primary care physicians about the appropriate candidates for such evaluation. Selection of subgroups of patients with risk factors for GU malignancies, who may benefit from a complete evaluation, is essential as opposed to evaluating all patients classified as having AMH.

### Upper tract urothelial cancer [^115jB8op]. European Journal of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

While urothelial carcinoma is a very common tumor, involvement of the upper tract is relatively uncommon. Consequently, there are no consensus imaging recommendations for upper tract disease. CT urography is the dominant imaging modality for the upper tract, but despite its excellent performance characteristics and being widely accepted as standard of care, there is great variability in how CTU exams are performed across practices. MR urography has limited application, but it has the potential to become more mainstream in the future with continued technical advances.

Upper tract urothelial carcinoma can manifest as a variety of appearances: a papillary lesion, focal wall thickening, focal enhancement, or as an infiltrative lesion. The pelvicalyceal location is about twice as common as in the ureter. Tumors in the pelvicalyceal location often manifest as an irregular enhancing soft tissue attenuation filling defect and may be sessile or polypoid in morphology. Within the ureter, 73% are located in the distal segment.

### Committee opinion no. 703 summary: Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^114EWx1u]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is an important clinical sign of urinary tract malignancy. It has been variably defined over the years and the evidence primarily is based on data from male patients. However, the differential diagnosis of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is influenced by the patient's sex, with the risk of urinary tract malignancy (bladder, ureter, and kidney) significantly less in women than in men. Among women, being older than 60 years, having a history of smoking, and having gross hematuria are the strongest predictors of urologic cancer. In low-risk, never-smoking women younger than 50 years without gross hematuria and with fewer than 25 red blood cells per high-power field, the risk of urinary tract malignancy is less than or equal to 0.5%. Furthermore, the evaluation may result in more harm than benefit and is unlikely to be cost-effective. Thus, data support changing hematuria recommendations in this low-risk group.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Urogynecologic Society encourage organizations producing future guidelines on the evaluation of microscopic hematuria to perform sex-specific analysis of the data and produce practical sex-specific recommendations. In the meantime, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Urogynecologic Society recommend that asymptomatic, low-risk, never-smoking women aged 35–50 years undergo evaluation only if they have more than 25 red blood cells per high-power field.

### Urinary diversion: Ileal conduit to neobladder [^113ssgUt]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

The goals of urinary diversion have evolved from simply diverting the urine through a conduit to orthotopic reconstruction, which provides a safe and continent means to store and eliminate urine, with efforts to provide an improved quality of life. We address meaningful points that may help optimize clinical results in patients with an orthotopic bladder substitute.

The review involved an objective evaluation of the basic science literature on the functional, structural, and physiological characteristics of gastrointestinal tissue as a substitute for the bladder. Potential problems that may be associated with particular parts of the gut for use in reconstruction are discussed. We also summarize the clinical results and complications of orthotopic reconstruction.

In the last 10 years, the paradigm for choosing urinary diversion has changed substantially. In 2002, all patients undergoing cystectomy were neobladder candidates. It is critically important to understand the phenomenon of maturation, as the motor and pharmacological response of the implanted gut changes dramatically toward that of the bladder. Structural and ultrastructural changes in the ileal mucosa lead to a primitive epithelium similar to urothelium. The need for reflux prevention is not the same as in ureterosigmoidostomy conduit or continent diversion. Reflux prevention in neobladders is even less important than in a normal bladder. When using nonrefluxing techniques, the risk of obstruction is at least twice that after direct anastomosis. Kidney function is not impaired by diversion.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA/SUFU guideline (2025) [^115HdPpN]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for microhematuria, specifically with respect to repeat urinalysis, the AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend reclassifying low/negligible-risk patients as intermediate- or high-risk based on hematuria on repeat urinalysis. It is advised to obtain a risk-based evaluation in accordance with recommendations for these respective risk strata.

### Gender disparities in hematuria evaluation and bladder cancer diagnosis: a population based analysis [^116UvPUr]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Men are diagnosed with bladder cancer at three times the rate of women. However, women often present with advanced disease and have poorer survival, suggesting delays in the diagnosis of bladder cancer. Hematuria is the presenting symptom in most cases. This study assessed gender differences in the evaluation of hematuria in older adults with bladder cancer.

Using the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) cancer registry linked with Medicare claims, we identified Medicare beneficiaries 66 years old or older who were diagnosed with bladder cancer between 2000 and 2007, with a claim for hematuria in the year before diagnosis. We examined the impact of gender, as well as demographic and clinical factors, on the time from the initial hematuria claim to a urology visit and the time from the initial hematuria claim to hematuria evaluation, including cystoscopy, upper urinary tract imaging, and urine cytology.

Of 35,646 patients with a hematuria claim in the year preceding bladder cancer diagnosis, 97% had a urology visit claim. The mean time to a urology visit was 27 days (range 0 to 377). Time to a urology visit was longer for women than for men (adjusted HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.87–0.92). Women were more likely to undergo delayed (after more than 30 days) hematuria evaluation (adjusted OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07–1.21).

We observed a longer time to a urology visit for women than for men presenting with hematuria. These findings may explain stage differences in bladder cancer diagnosis and inform efforts to decrease gender disparities in bladder cancer stage and outcomes.

### Half of visible and half of recurrent visible hematuria cases have underlying pathology: Prospective large cohort study with long-term followup [^1179ywb6]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Visible hematuria has a cancer yield of up to 24.2% and a large proportion of cases will have no etiology. In this study, we determined the incidence of pathology (benign and malignant) in patients with visible hematuria and those with persistent and recurrent visible hematuria, and evaluated the policy for investigations.

Data were prospectively collected for 1,804 patients with visible hematuria at a United Kingdom teaching hospital from January 1999 to September 2007. In October 2010, the comprehensive hospital electronic database was checked for every individual patient to ensure no urological pathology was missed. All patients underwent standard hematuria investigations, including renal tract ultrasound and excretory urography or contrast-enhanced computer tomography urogram, flexible cystoscopy, and urine cytology.

The male-to-female ratio was 4.8:1. Median age ± SD was 67 ± 17.0 years (range 21 to 109). The median followup was 6.6 ± 2.5 years (range 1.5 to 11.6). No urological pathology was found in 965 (53.5%) patients. Malignant urological disease was found in 386 (21.4%) patients, of whom 329 had bladder tumors. There were 32 patients with persistent visible hematuria and no malignancy. Repeat investigation was performed in 69 patients reporting recurrence. Of these patients, 35 received a significant urological diagnosis, including 12 (17.4%) urological malignancies, while 34 (49.3%) still had no diagnosis. Limitations include the possibility of missing pathology.

Almost 50% of patients present with visible hematuria.

### Clinical practice guideline acute kidney injury [^112PEUde]. UKKA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute kidney injury, specifically in the context of differential diagnosis, the UKKA 2019 guidelines recommend suspecting RPGN when a patient with no obvious cause of progressive or non-resolving AKI presents with urine dipstick results showing hematuria and proteinuria, without urinary tract infection (UTI) or trauma due to catheterization.

### Assessment of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults [^111xfM7J]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Although routine screening for bladder cancer is not recommended, microscopic hematuria is often incidentally discovered by primary care physicians. The American Urological Association has published an updated guideline for the management of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, which is defined as the presence of three or more red blood cells per high-power field visible in a properly collected urine specimen without evidence of infection.

- **Common causes**: The most common causes of microscopic hematuria are urinary tract infection, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and urinary calculi. However, up to 5% of patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria are found to have a urinary tract malignancy. The risk of urologic malignancy is increased in men, persons older than 35 years, and persons with a history of smoking.

- **Management considerations**: Microscopic hematuria in the setting of urinary tract infection should resolve after appropriate antibiotic treatment; persistence of hematuria warrants a diagnostic workup. Dysmorphic red blood cells, cellular casts, proteinuria, elevated creatinine levels, or hypertension in the presence of microscopic hematuria should prompt nephrologic and urologic referral.

- **Diagnostic evaluations**: The upper urinary tract is best evaluated with multiphasic computed tomography urography, which identifies hydronephrosis, urinary calculi, and renal and ureteral lesions. The lower urinary tract is best evaluated with cystoscopy for urethral stricture disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and bladder masses. Voided urine cytology is no longer recommended as part of the routine evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria.

### Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women requires separate guidelines [^1121WUDr]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The guidelines recently updated by the American Urological Association for the evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) are based on data derived predominantly from men. They cannot be reliably applied to females as the epidemiology of AMH is gender dependent. The research on women in this area has been limited. It is incumbent on the experts in the field of female pelvic medicine to advance the science and develop management algorithms for AMH in women.

### The application of new complex indicators in the detection of urine [^113BSiLJ]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Hematuria, defined as the presence of red blood cells (RBCs) in urine, was identified through urinalysis of a concentrated urine sediment specimen. A prompt referral to a nephrologist is indicated when hematuria does not resolve within weeks of onset. Effective and accurate urine RBC-based hematuria measurements provide explainable insights into hematuria resolution and chronic disease management. Our study investigated new complex indicators to improve the detection of RBCs, confirmed by a particular renal biopsy.

Urine RBC counts can be measured using automated urine sediment analyzers. A previous study suggested that the determination of urinary RBC distribution with an automated analyzer and analysis of the distribution curves may be a more reliable measure of erythrocyte morphology. Renal biopsy, the gold standard for the diagnosis of kidney diseases, can be used to verify the sources of urinary RBCs. Furthermore, the count and morphology of urinary RBCs can provide important information on patients' renal pathological changes. In our study, we focused on hematuria originating from kidney diseases.

### Intravenous urography in evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^114DNsA7]. Journal of Endourology (2005). Low credibility.

In 2001, the American Urologic Association Best Practice Policy Panel recommended computed tomography (CT) or intravenous urography (IVU) over ultrasonography as the initial imaging modality in patients with asymptomatic microhematuria. We present results of a study initiated many years ago and completed prior to 2001 that provides information pertinent to the use of IVU as the initial imaging modality for such patients.

- **Patients and methods**: This study compared the results of IVU and ultrasonography in patients aged 40 years and above who were referred to a single urology department for evaluation of microscopic hematuria between 1994 and 2000. A total of 290 patients agreed to participate by undergoing ultrasonography in addition to IVU, with 247 completing both tests. The cohort consisted of 81 men and 166 women, with a mean age of 56.4 years (range 40–86 years). Thirty patients (12%) were smokers.

- **Results**: A renal lesion or mass suggestive of a tumor was found in 8 patients (3.2%); 3 patients exhibited this finding on the IVU examination and 5 on ultrasonography. None of the patients had such a lesion or mass on both examinations. Two patients with suspect lesions were ultimately diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma. Both patients with renal cancer had a suspect lesion on the ultrasound examination but not on the contemporaneous IVU.

- **Conclusion**: Intravenous urography may miss lesions or masses that lead to a diagnosis of upper-tract neoplasia.

### Gross hematuria as the presentation of ureteral paraganglioma: A case report and literature review [^1117f5p4]. BMC Urology (2023). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of a ureteral tumor with gross hematuria raises the suspicion of urothelial carcinoma rather than paraganglioma. However, the differential diagnosis of paraganglioma should be considered if blood pressure surges occur while manipulating around the main tumor during ureteroscopy or surgical procedures. Even if gross hematuria is the only initial sign, the diagnosis of paraganglioma should not be overlooked. Anatomical or functional studies should always be conducted before invasive procedures when clinically available. Additionally, a thorough anesthesia consultation is essential before surgery. Post-operatively, follow-up imaging studies, renal function, and urine tests should be diligently monitored.

### Renal and urological disorders associated with inflammatory bowel disease [^114deBKs]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Diagnosis of entero-vesical fistulae can be challenging, as the onset can be insidious and nonspecific. Therefore, having a high index of suspicion is important. Presentation may only be with fever and abdominal pain, without the classical features such as pneumaturia and fecaluria.

Early multispecialty discussion involving a gastroenterologist, surgeon, radiologist, and pathologist is recommended to devise an optimal, individualized management plan. Multimodality imaging is often required, and management may necessitate both medical and surgical approaches, including anti-TNF treatment.

### Approach to the child with hematuria [^1119aojP]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

The causes of macroscopic and microscopic hematuria overlap; both are often caused by urinary tract infections or urethral/bladder irritation. Coexistent hypertension and proteinuria should prompt investigation for glomerular disease. The most common glomerulonephritis in children is postinfectious glomerulonephritis. In most patients, especially those with isolated microscopic hematuria, the diagnostic workup reveals no clear underlying cause. In cases where a diagnosis is made, the most common causes of persistent microscopic hematuria are thin basement membrane nephropathy, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or idiopathic hypercalciuria. Treatment and long-term prognosis vary with the underlying disease.

### Flank pain and hematuria is not always a kidney stone [^116kWkn6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with flank pain and hematuria commonly present to the emergency department with nephrolithiasis. However, relying solely on this diagnosis might cause other, less common differentials to be overlooked. Here, we present a case of a patient manifesting symptoms typical of nephrolithiasis, who was ultimately diagnosed with a Page kidney causing secondary hypertension.

A 50-year-old male with no significant past medical history visited the Emergency Department, reporting severe left-sided flank pain, vomiting, and blood-tinged urine. While initially pursuing a diagnosis of nephrolithiasis, a left renal subcapsular hematoma was discovered on a non-contrast CT scan. A CTA showed no active hemorrhage. Despite having no history of recent trauma, the patient exhibited hypertension upon evaluation. Urology consultation led to the initiation of hypertension management. The diagnosis of Page kidney was confirmed, and the patient was admitted for observation and hypertension management with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

- **Page kidney**: This diagnosis involves compression of the renal parenchyma by a hematoma or mass, causing secondary hypertension through activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Causes can include traumatic subcapsular hematoma, renal cyst rupture, tumor, hemorrhage, and arteriovenous malformation, among others. Treatment strategies may range from conservative measures like hypertension management to more invasive procedures such as hematoma evacuation or nephrectomy.

We describe the case of this patient, initially presumed to have nephrolithiasis due to typical left-sided flank pain, but ultimately diagnosed with Page kidney.

### Can renal and bladder ultrasound replace computerized tomography urogram in patients investigated for microscopic hematuria [^114xqk7q]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

The majority of bladder lesions are considered cancer until proven otherwise. However, we report that a visual diagnosis of malignancy had an 83.9% positive predictive value (PPV) following white light cystoscopy. In the setting of surveillance cystoscopy, urologists were able to distinguish 99% of low grade bladder cancers from high grade cancers. Cystoscopy is operator-dependent, and when performed by a more experienced cystoscopist, specificity would be higher. Thus, it is essential that suspicious bladder lesions be biopsied due to the high likelihood of malignancy. Bladder biopsy could be performed by flexible cystoscopy at the initial diagnosis, which could reduce the need for general anesthesia.

There are several limitations to this study. While we did not identify any upper tract urothelial cancer (UTUC) that presented as microscopic hematuria, it is plausible that these patients might have initially presented with microscopic hematuria if screening for microscopic hematuria had been performed, although this is not recommended by any consensus. While sonographers normally visualize the renal tract with the bladder distended to adequately visualize the bladder, this was not performed in all cases. Similarly, bladder assessment was limited on some computerized tomography urogram (CTU) scans when the contrast medium did not opacify the bladder or when artifacts were due to metalwork in the pelvis. To account for such suboptimal scans, we excluded these scans to determine the diagnostic accuracy of imaging to identify bladder cancer. Additionally, we could not determine the sensitivity of cystoscopy since we were unable to determine whether tumors were missed because of uncompleted data.

### Comparison of the diagnostic yield of routine versus indicated flowmetry, ultrasound and cystoscopy in women with recurrent urinary tract infections [^114JmR54]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Low credibility.

None of the guidelines advocate routine diagnostic cystoscopy. It is instead preferred for atypical cases, gross hematuria in the absence of UTI, persistent microscopic hematuria, previous bladder calculi, pneumaturia/fecaluria, and obstructive symptoms (i.e. straining, weak stream, and low flowmetry). In our study, the diagnostic yield did not differ significantly between routine and indication-based cystoscopy, with both yielding few abnormalities. Although this may imply that routine cystoscopy will not detect more abnormalities, we do not know the indications. Indeed, we suspect that several cystoscopies were performed to reassure the patient and/or the urologist, potentially biasing this result.

The role of cystoscopy has previously been investigated in 656 patients, and although abnormalities were found in 165 (23%) patients, it should be noted that 115 (70%) of these indicated inflammatory changes. In the absence of these and other incidental abnormalities, they found that only 20 abnormalities were clinically relevant, and only one abnormality was potentially life-threatening (carcinoma). Combining our results adds only a single potentially life-threatening abnormality (carcinoma). As such, we feel comfortable in advising that urologists can omit cystoscopy for most patients with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI), typically reserving its use for cases of gross hematuria, where it is appropriate for excluding UCC. Even then, however, it may still be safely omitted in the presence of positive urine cultures if there are no other risk factors. Urologists should therefore be reluctant to perform cystoscopy in routine cases of rUTI.

### Urinary tract bleeding from a urethral caruncle mimicking genital tract bleeding [^112xdpDZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Genital tract bleeding can be falsely assumed when patients bleed from sources outside the genital tract, such as the urethra, bladder, anus, rectum, sigmoid colon, or large intestine. Bleeding may also stem from systemic diseases, including bleeding disorders, liver and renal diseases, or benign and malignant neoplasms. Diagnostic errors regarding the bleeding source can lead to inappropriate consultations, unnecessary testing, and prolonged symptoms. Therefore, accurately locating the bleeding source through direct observation is essential to ensure timely specialist consultation.

### Can renal and bladder ultrasound replace computerized tomography urogram in patients investigated for microscopic hematuria [^111Y8aYW]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Our results suggest that CTU can safely be replaced by RBUS to image the upper tracts in conjunction with cystoscopy as part of investigations following a presentation of microscopic hematuria. The risk of UTUC in patients with microscopic hematuria is extremely low, and RBUS can identify renal parenchymal cancer with high sensitivity. When renal calculi is suspected, noncontrast CT of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder with RBUS or CTU is necessary. Cystoscopy remains the diagnostic test of choice to detect bladder cancer.

### Prevalence and associated factors for dipstick microscopic hematuria in men [^111M5miS]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

How would the identification of factors associated with MH help counseling the patient? The yield of finding malignancy in patients with MH is very low. AUA meta-analysis found that the incidence of malignancy upon workup of asymptomatic MH was 3.3% when based on one positive urine sample. According to guidelines, MH prompts a workup of the lower and upper tracts with cystoscopy and abdominal imaging, representing a significant cost to health care systems. Further prospective studies are needed to evaluate whether the identification of factors associated with increased risk of MH may help stratify patients who can obviate investigations with invasive procedures.

Some limitations exist in our study. All past medical history was self-reported by patients and may thus induce bias. The population presenting to this health fair may not be representative of the general population, as patients with specific concerns or who do not have regular medical follow-up may have been overrepresented. However, the prevalence of smoking and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease was similar to rates in the general Canadian population. Furthermore, this was a single institution experience, and this may limit the generalizability of our findings. Another limitation is that the dipstick microhematuria was not confirmed with microscopy in this study. Several studies have confirmed that dipstick urinalysis has good specificity (65–95%) and sensitivity (91–100%) in detecting microhematuria, but should still be confirmed with microscopy before ordering costly procedures.

### Differential diagnosis of glomerular disease: A systematic and inclusive approach [^113VyNbU]. American Journal of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Glomerular disease is a complex and evolving topic. In evaluating a specific case, it is not unusual for the clinician to ask: 'Am I missing something? Should I biopsy? When? Should I treat first, then biopsy?' This work, which is both evidence- and experience-based, is intended to address each of these concerns and many other issues relevant to the differential diagnosis of glomerular disease.

- **Summary**: The central approach is the use of diagnostic algorithms that are based on quantitative measures routinely obtained early in the course of the diagnostic evaluation. The algorithms are designed to be easy to navigate, systematic, and inclusive. Also provided is a detailed and prioritized list of recommended diagnostic testing, and the rationale for each test.

- **Key message**: This work is intended to facilitate accurate diagnosis in the individual patient presenting with evidence of glomerular disease.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^112pWPvw]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Institutional review board approval was obtained to query medical records for pertinent clinical information in 239 consecutive patients evaluated between January 2003 and August 2005 for microscopic hematuria at a urology outpatient clinic in a tertiary-care inner-city hospital. Microscopic hematuria was characterized as microscopic hematuria [≥ 3 red blood cells (RBC) per high power field (hpf)]. Initial evaluations included medical history, physical examination, urinalysis, and voided urinary cytology. Urine cultures were obtained in patients if there was high suspicion of a urinary tract infection as the cause of the hematuria.

- **Study population**: Clinic and hospital records were reviewed for several key factors including tobacco usage, voiding symptoms (American Urologic Association, AUA, symptom score), urinalysis, urinary cytology, cystoscopic/radiologic evaluation, and pathologic outcomes. Median follow-up was 40 months (range 1–66 months).

- **Urinary cytologies evaluation**: Based on AUA guideline criteria on the use of urinary cytology, voided urinary cytologies were collected over a seven-day period prior to radiologic and cystoscopic evaluation. Of the 239 patients, 182 patients had one cytology available for review, whereas 125 and 96 patients had two and three cytologies, respectively, available for evaluation. Thus, a total of 403 urinary cytologies were reviewed by our cytopathologists. In accordance with accepted nomenclature, final cytologic testing results were classified by the cytopathologists into one of four categories: normal, atypical/indeterminate, suspicious, or malignant.

### Diagnosis of urologic malignancies in patients with asymptomatic dipstick hematuria: Prospective study with 13 years' follow-up [^111rXYni]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

The study aimed to appraise the outcomes, determine the natural history, and instigate a rationale plan for the follow-up of patients with asymptomatic dipstick hematuria.

A total of 292 consecutive patients with asymptomatic dipstick hematuria, referred between January 1992 and December 1994, were investigated and prospectively followed up. The initial investigations included urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity, cytology, intravenous urography with or without ultrasonography, and cystoscopy. Baseline data and follow-up events, particularly the development of urologic malignancy, were recorded over a 13-year period.

Sixteen patients (5.4%) were found to have urologic malignancies on initial evaluation. Of these, 11 died. During the 13-year follow-up, 21 patients (7%) were lost to follow-up, and 42 died of various unrelated causes — other than urologic malignancies. Of the remaining 213 patients, 180 (84.5%) subsequently had negative urinalysis results; none of these patients developed a urologic malignancy during follow-up. Dipstick hematuria persisted in 33 patients: 10 had nephrologic causes, 8 had urinary tract infections, and in 15, no pathologic cause was identified despite repeat investigations. One patient, discharged with negative findings after full initial investigations, presented 2 years later with frank hematuria and was found to have a new bladder tumor.

The study concluded that patients presenting with asymptomatic dipstick hematuria, who have undergone thorough initial negative investigations, can be discharged from tertiary care.

### Endovascular coil embolization of inferior mesenteric artery to ileal-conduit fistula: A case report [^115cK1Lj]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Uretero-arterial fistulas (UAFs) are uncommon and pose a diagnostic dilemma, making them life-threatening if not recognized and treated expediently. UAFs to small arteries, such as a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), are very uncommon and present a further diagnostic and treatment challenge. There should be a high index of suspicion for UAFs when intervening on patients with a history of treated pelvic cancers and long-standing ureteric stents experiencing hematuria not attributable to another cause.

- **Case presentation**: We present a case of a fistula formed between a distal branch of the IMA, specifically the superior rectal artery, and an ileal-conduit in a patient with a long-standing reverse nephroureterostomy (Hobbs) catheter. The patient presented with abdominal pain and hematuria through the conduit. During a tube exchange, contrast injection demonstrated a fistula with the superior rectal artery, multiple ileal intraluminal blood clots, and active extravasation. The patient became tachycardic and hypotensive, actively bleeding through the ileal-conduit, prompting a massive transfusion protocol. Successful endovascular coiling of the superior rectal artery was performed, resulting in the resolution of active extravasation and stabilization of the patient. The patient recovered and was discharged in stable condition 10 days later.

- **Conclusions**: Although UAFs are uncommon, our case demonstrated key predisposing risk factors to fistula development: pelvic cancer surgery, pelvic radiation, and a prolonged ureteric stent through the ileal-conduit. Typically, UAFs arise from communication with…

### Evaluating hematuria: Impact of guideline adherence on urologic cancer diagnosis [^111CefoR]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess physician adherence to the 2001 American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines for evaluating patients with asymptomatic hematuria and its impact on the diagnosis of urologic cancer.

In this institutional review board-approved retrospective study of patients with asymptomatic hematuria evaluated in a large academic health center in 2004 (allowing for long-term follow-up), we randomly selected 100 of 1771 patients with asymptomatic hematuria (52 men; mean age 54 years; 58 microscopic, 39 macroscopic, three unknown-type hematuria; median follow-up 89 months, interquartile range 33–97 months). Multivariate logistic regression assessed effects of age, sex, hematuria type, and physician specialty on guideline adherence, the primary outcome. Secondary outcome measures were variability in evaluation among physician specialists and the proportion of patients developing urologic cancer.

Only 36 of 100 patients had a guideline-adherent evaluation, of which 5 were diagnosed with urologic cancer (median 1 month, range 0–11). No urologic cancers were diagnosed in 64 patients with nonadherent evaluations. Only evaluation by a urologist significantly predicted guideline adherence (P < 0.0001). Patients with gross hematuria more often underwent intravenous or computed tomography urography (P = 0.009); urologist evaluation more often led to intravenous or computed tomography urography (P < 0.0001), cystoscopy (P < 0.0001), cytology (P = 0.009), and guideline-adherent evaluation (P < 0.0001).

Although most physicians did not adhere to the guidelines, urologists were more likely to conduct guideline-adherent evaluations and utilize advanced diagnostic procedures.

### Can renal and bladder ultrasound replace computerized tomography urogram in patients investigated for microscopic hematuria [^112r2d9G]? The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Between March 2016 and June 2017, DETECT I recruited patients from 40 hospitals throughout the United Kingdom with one-stop hematuria investigation clinics. All patients were referred to secondary care following presentation with hematuria. Macroscopic hematuria was defined as visible hematuria reported by the patient or the primary care physician. Microscopic hematuria was defined as one or greater red blood cells on urine dipstick on two or more occasions. The study inclusion criterion was male or female patients 18 years old or older who were willing to provide consent. All patients underwent cystoscopy and upper tract imaging within 12 weeks after study registration. Determining the diagnostic accuracy of RBUS and CTU represents a post hoc analysis.

The study protocol was approved by the Health Research Authority, North West Liverpool Central Research Ethics Committee, in March 2016 (Integrated Research Application System Project ID 179245, Research Ethics Committee reference 16/NW/0150). The full study protocol has been previously described.

Medical history was obtained, and physical examination was performed in all patients. Patient demographics were collected, including age, gender, occupation, ethnicity, and smoking history. Patients with a suspicion of bladder cancer underwent transurethral resection of bladder cancer or bladder biopsy under general anesthesia. The reference standard for bladder cancer was histopathological examination as classified according to the WHO TNM tumor classification. Bladder cancer was risk-stratified based on clinicopathologic factors.

### Radiologic evaluation of hematuria: Guidelines from the American College of Radiology's appropriateness criteria [^113GY6dd]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Hematuria, whether symptomatic or incidental, that includes more than three red blood cells per high-power field on two of three properly collected urinalysis specimens warrants some type of imaging to evaluate the upper tracts. Traditionally, excretory urography, or the intravenous pyelogram, has been the mainstay of the hematuria work-up. However, computed tomography (CT) urography has more recently been recognized to have significant advantages. Multidetector CT urography, a cross-sectional technique, is less susceptible to overlying bowel gas and is more sensitive for detecting small tumors and calculi. Moreover, intravenous-pyelogram-like images can be obtained using reconstruction techniques.

In specific cases, ultrasound examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also be useful and are particularly helpful in children and pregnant women. Neither modality has the sensitivity of CT for calculi, but small tumors may be visible on MRI. This article reviews the appropriateness criteria for the various radiologic imaging tests used in the evaluation of hematuria, as proposed by the American College of Radiology.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA/SUFU guideline (2025) [^112YRYTT]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for microhematuria, specifically concerning repeat urinalysis, the AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a repeat urinalysis within 12 months for patients with intermediate-risk microscopic hematuria who do not undergo cystoscopy based on urinary marker results.

### Endovascular coil embolization of inferior mesenteric artery to ileal-conduit fistula: a case report [^113LzrDP]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Uretero-arterial fistula (UAF) is relatively rare, with only 150–162 cases described in the literature. The incidence of UAF is increasing due to improved pelvic cancer treatment and survival rates. Reported UAFs predominantly communicate with the iliac arterial system. Roderick et al. described 139 UAFs in a literature review, with 132 (95%) communicating with the iliac artery or vascular graft material in the aortoiliac trajectory; the remaining 7 cases communicated with the aorta.

The diagnosis of UAF should be considered in patients presenting with hematuria not attributable to a specific cause, with or without pain, fever, and hydronephrosis.

Since the early 2000s, endovascular treatment has become the preferred management method, reserving open surgery for cases of enteric contamination, abscess formation, and infected stents or failed endovascular treatment.

Here we present a unique case of fistulous communication between an ileal conduit and the superior rectal artery (a distal branch of the IMA), with resuscitation and prompt endovascular treatment. A review of the literature is provided.

### Selected common diagnostic problems in urologic pathology: Perspectives from a large consult service in genitourinary pathology [^1168oKrU]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Several common differential diagnoses are encountered in urologic pathology, frequently causing patient referrals for a second opinion.

- **Objectives**: To review three common differential diagnoses encountered in a large consultation service in genitourinary pathology. These include partial atrophy versus prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma, oncocytoma versus chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma in situ versus normal urothelium and reactive atypia. The discussion will cover the detailed, morphologically distinctive features and the usefulness of immunohistochemistry.

- **Data sources**: Personal experience and review of the literature.

- **Conclusions**: Careful morphologic assessment and awareness of diagnostic pitfalls are fundamental in reaching a definitive diagnosis in most cases. Immunohistochemistry is useful but should be used only in conjunction with the morphologic impression.

### Clinical utility of a non-invasive urine test for risk assessing patients with no obvious benign cause of hematuria: A physician-patient real world data analysis [^111XgVP3]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Transition probability analyses indicate a de-escalation of procedures following a negative result from Cxbladder Triage. For example, 72.5% (29/40) of patients with negative results who were allocated a contrast CT scan at baseline had this procedure substituted with ultrasound.

- **Transition probabilities for diagnostic tests**: Following disclosure of results from Cxbladder Triage and Detect, transition analyses indicate an escalation of diagnostic procedures for patients following a physician-directed protocol result. All five patients with these results who were allocated an ultrasound at baseline had this procedure substituted with a contrast CT scan. Additionally, six out of seven (85.7%) patients allocated a flexible cystoscopy at baseline were escalated to rigid cystoscopy. ✱ p < 0.05; ✱✱ p < 0.01

### Hematuria as a marker of occult urinary tract cancer: Advice for high-value care from the American College of Physicians [^113VR3kr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The presence of blood in the urine, or hematuria, is a common finding in clinical practice and can sometimes be a sign of occult cancer. This article describes the clinical epidemiology of hematuria, the state of practice, and the science in this context. It provides suggestions for clinicians evaluating patients with hematuria.

- **Methods**: A narrative review of available clinical guidelines and relevant studies on the evaluation of hematuria was conducted, with particular emphasis on considerations for urologic referral.

- **High-value care advice 1**: Clinicians should include gross hematuria in their routine review of systems and specifically ask all patients with microscopic hematuria about any history of gross hematuria.

- **High-value care advice 2**: Clinicians should not use screening urinalysis for cancer detection in asymptomatic adults.

- **High-value care advice 3**: Clinicians should confirm heme-positive results of dipstick testing with microscopic urinalysis that demonstrates three or more erythrocytes per high-powered field before initiating further evaluation in all asymptomatic adults.

- **High-value care advice 4**: Clinicians should refer for further urologic evaluation in all adults with gross hematuria, even if self-limited.

- **High-value care advice 5**: Clinicians should consider urology referral for cystoscopy and imaging in adults with microscopically confirmed hematuria in the absence of some demonstrable benign cause.

- **High-value care advice 6**: Clinicians should pursue evaluation of hematuria even if the patient is receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.

### Microhematuria: AUA/SUFU guideline [^115xN5G8]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with microhematuria represent a heterogeneous population with a broad spectrum of risk for genitourinary malignancy. Recognizing that patient-specific characteristics modify the risk of underlying malignant etiologies, this guideline sought to provide a personalized diagnostic testing strategy.

The systematic review incorporated evidence published from January 2010 through February 2019, with an updated literature search to include studies published up to December 2019. Evidence-based statements were developed by the expert panel, with statement types linked to evidence strength, level of certainty, and the panel's judgment regarding the balance between benefits and risks/burdens.

Microhematuria should be defined as ≥ 3 red blood cells per high power field on microscopic evaluation of a single specimen. In patients diagnosed with gynecologic or non-malignant genitourinary sources of microhematuria, clinicians should repeat urinalysis following resolution of the gynecologic or non-malignant genitourinary cause. The panel created a risk classification system for patients with microhematuria, stratified as low-, intermediate-, or high-risk for genitourinary malignancy. Risk groups were based on factors including age, sex, smoking, and other urothelial cancer risk factors, degree and persistence of microhematuria, as well as prior gross hematuria. Diagnostic evaluation with cystoscopy and upper tract imaging was recommended according to patient risk and involves shared decision-making. Statements also inform follow-up.

### Diversion ahead: Imaging appearance of urinary diversions and reservoirs [^117R1XY6]. Clinical Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

The imaging appearance of urinary diversion is determined by the indication and type of surgical procedure performed. These patients often undergo imaging follow-up to detect complications or recurrence. Understanding the postoperative anatomy and the early detection of complications are keys to the adept interpretation of radiological evaluations of urinary reservoirs. The purpose of the following review is to offer a brief account of commonly used surgical techniques, relevant anatomy, and a concise overview of the imaging techniques for the evaluation of urinary diversions and features of their complications.

### Anatomic locations of ureterovascular fistulae: A review of 532 patients in the literature and a new series of 8 patients [^112sYx2G]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Low credibility.

The occurrence of unexplained gross hematuria, accompanied by variable clot passage and flank pain in a patient with a history of pelvic surgery, a chronic ureteral stent, and/or history of pelvic radiotherapy, is highly suspicious for a ureterovascular fistula (UVF). It is important to consider that the source of urinary tract bleeding through the ureteral orifice is not always the kidney. If the urologist and interventional radiologist do not keep that in mind, it could lead to unnecessary renal embolization or even nephrectomy due to misdiagnosis. A high degree of suspicion in patients with known risk factors for UVF is key to a correct diagnosis.

In our hospital, a comprehensive history would be taken, as well as a clinical urological examination of the patient, to exclude other more common causes of macrohematuria such as trauma, recent renal surgery, kidney stones, renal tumor, and urinary tract infection. If, based on history and examination, UVF was suspected, the side of the bleeding was always initially identified using endoscopy. This step is crucial to help minimize the planning time of the procedure by focusing only on the course of the bleeding ureter during examination of the subsequent CT scan. During angiography, examining only the bleeding side instead of the normal side minimizes the intraprocedural time, reducing both the time to stop the bleeding and radiation exposure. Lock et al. demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the location concerning the side of the UVF.

### Practical use of investigations in patients with hematuria [^113BwAik]. Journal of Endourology (2008). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with microscopic hematuria undergo a complete evaluation resulting in negative findings. The outcome of patients with hematuria was analyzed in an effort to optimize the use of investigations.

- **Patients and methods**: The records for 404 patients who presented with hematuria were reviewed. Data were collected on demographics, type of hematuria, investigations, and final diagnosis.

- **Results**: The hematuria was microscopic in 140 patients (35%) and gross in 264 patients (65%). In gross hematuria patients, 10% had urinary tract tumors and 12% had calculi. All patients with genitourinary tumors and 87% of patients with calculi had gross hematuria and/or ≥ 5 RBCs/HPF (red blood cells per high-power microscopic field) on urinalysis. The sensitivity and specificity were 94% and 6% for the dipstick urine test, 37% and 71% for urine cytology, 92% and 93% for computed tomography (CT), 50% and 95% for ultrasound scans, and 38% and 90% for intravenous pyelography, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that age and number of RBCs/HPF in the urinalyses were the only significant factors predicting genitourinary cancer. In patients ≤ 40 years old, there was one patient with malignancy and seven patients with stones. In older patients, there were 31 patients with malignancy and 32 patients with stones.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with < 5 RBCs/HPF on three urinalyses are unlikely to have significant pathology and could possibly be followed up conservatively. Patients ≤ 40 years of age should have a noncontrast CT or ultrasound study if they…

### Urinalysis: Case presentations for the primary care physician [^112tVSnf]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Urinalysis is useful in diagnosing systemic and genitourinary conditions. In patients with suspected microscopic hematuria, urine dipstick testing may suggest the presence of blood, but results should be confirmed with a microscopic examination. In the absence of obvious causes, the evaluation of microscopic hematuria should include renal function testing, urinary tract imaging, and cystoscopy. In a patient with a ureteral stent, urinalysis alone cannot establish the diagnosis of urinary tract infection. Plain radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder can identify a stent and is preferred over computed tomography. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is the isolation of bacteria in an appropriately collected urine specimen obtained from a person without symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended in nonpregnant adults, including those with prolonged urinary catheter use.

### Ct urography for hematuria [^1155YdgJ]. Nature Reviews Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Hematuria can signify serious diseases such as bladder cancer, upper urinary tract urothelial cell carcinoma (UUT-UCC), renal cell cancer, or urinary tract stones. CT urography, a rapidly evolving technique made possible by recent advances in CT technology, is defined as a CT examination of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder with at least one series of images acquired during the excretory phase after intravenous contrast administration. The reasoning for using CT urography to investigate hematuria is based on its high diagnostic accuracy for urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) and favorable comparison with other imaging techniques.

The optimum diagnostic imaging strategy for patients with hematuria at high risk for UCC involves the use of CT urography as a replacement for other imaging tests (such as ultrasonography, intravenous urography, or retrograde ureteropyelography) and as a triage test for cystoscopy. This results in earlier diagnoses and improved prognoses of bladder cancer, UUT-UCC, renal cell cancer, and stones.

Problems with CT urography for investigating hematuria might be addressed with a formative educational program simulating clinical reporting to reduce reader error. A new technique for image-guided biopsy of UUT-UCC detected by CT urography could offer histopathological confirmation of diagnosis and eliminate false-positive results. CT urography is recommended as the initial imaging test for hematuria in patients at high risk for UCC.

### Evaluation of the new American Urological Association guidelines risk classification for hematuria [^112vyxyX]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Microhematuria is a prevalent condition, and the American Urological Association has developed a new risk-stratified approach for the evaluation of patients with microhematuria. Our objective was to provide the first evaluation of this important guideline.

This multinational cohort study combines contemporary patients from five clinical trials and two prospective registries who underwent urological evaluation for hematuria. Patients were stratified into American Urological Association risk strata (low, intermediate, or high risk) based on sex, age, degree of hematuria, and smoking history. The primary endpoint was the incidence of bladder cancer within each risk stratum.

A total of 15,779 patients were included in the analysis. Overall, 727 patients (4.6%) were classified as low risk, 1,863 patients (11.8%) were classified as intermediate risk, and 13,189 patients (83.6%) were classified as high risk. The predominance of high-risk patients was consistent across all cohorts. A total of 857 bladder cancers were diagnosed, with a bladder cancer incidence of 5.4%. Bladder cancer was more prevalent in men, smokers, older patients, and patients with gross hematuria. The cancer incidence for low, intermediate, and high-risk groups was 0.4% (3 patients), 1.0% (18 patients), and 6.3% (836 patients), respectively.

The new risk stratification system effectively separates hematuria patients into clinically meaningful categories with differing likelihoods of bladder cancer, which would justify evaluating the low, intermediate, and high-risk groups with appropriate clinical approaches.
