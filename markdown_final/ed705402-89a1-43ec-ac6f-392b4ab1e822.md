## Question

can bioprosthetic valve undergo mri

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether patients with a bioprosthetic (tissue) heart valve can safely undergo MRI, and under what conditions this is appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the MR safety categories for implants and how bioprosthetic valves are typically labeled. Then, I should verify experimental and clinical MRI data for these valves at common field strengths. Next, I will review relevant society guidelines for any contraindications or conditions. After that, I need to consider practical caveats like artifacts, RF heating, and field strength limits. Finally, I will integrate considerations for concurrent devices such as pacemakers and outline a practical, stepwise approach to scanning safely, confirming manufacturer labeling along the way [^114WNyZY] [^1148eEoB] [^113JhbJW] [^113NJP3b].

> Let me first confirm the MR safety framework. Implants are categorized as MR Safe, MR Conditional, or MR Unsafe, and the practical reality for bioprosthetic valves is that they are rarely labeled MR Safe; rather, most contemporary surgical and transcatheter bioprosthetic valves are MR Conditional with specified field strengths and SAR limits after standardized testing, which sets the stage for safe scanning if those conditions are met [^114y9rJw] [^1148eEoB] [^114WNyZY].

> Wait, let me verify device-level evidence at higher field strengths. A standardized 3 T evaluation of a TAVR bioprosthesis (Hydra) demonstrated negligible magnetic interactions, minimal heating with a maximum 2.5 °C rise at relatively high SAR, and only small artifacts, supporting an MR Conditional designation up to and including 3 T for that specific device; however, I should not overgeneralize those findings to all valves without checking their labeling and testing data [^1148eEoB].

> Next, I should review in vivo feasibility and safety signals at clinical field strengths. Multiple 4D flow MRI studies in patients with stented and stentless surgical bioprosthetic valves at 1.5 T reported successful acquisitions without adverse device-related events, and CMR planimetry of aortic bioprostheses was feasible in the majority of cases with artifacts typically localized, reinforcing that clinical scanning is achievable with acceptable image quality under standard cardiac MRI protocols [^115cp15x] [^1176MQ3A] [^114MEsHw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; guidelines provide important context. The ESC CMR working group explicitly notes that prosthetic valves in the chest are generally safe at 1.5 T with local artifact, and it emphasizes adherence to device-specific safety information and institutional protocols, which I need to ensure are followed rigorously [^113JhbJW]. The 2021 ACC/AHA valvular heart disease guideline does not list MRI as a contraindication for bioprosthetic valves and supports multimodality imaging when clinically indicated, while surveillance remains TTE-centric, which aligns with using CMR selectively when it adds value [^113NJP3b] [^113skViS] [^116k2iha]. The 2022 ESC/EACTS guideline similarly does not restrict MRI and underscores following manufacturer labeling, which I should double-check for each device prior to scanning [^114X47tj].

> I will now examine practical caveats that could affect safety and diagnostic yield. Susceptibility artifacts from metallic stent frames may degrade local visualization or flow quantification near the sewing ring, though they are usually confined and manageable, and newer designs tend to reduce artifact burden, which I should consider when planning sequences and measurement planes [^113JhbJW]. Regarding RF heating, bench testing in a representative TAVR system showed small temperature rises under high SAR, a finding that supports low clinical risk under standard SAR limits, but I should confirm device-specific SAR constraints and favor conservative protocols when uncertain, particularly at 3 T where labeling may be more restrictive than at 1.5 T [^1148eEoB]. Evidence beyond 3 T is lacking for these devices, so I should avoid ultra-high-field MRI unless device-specific testing exists, and default to 1.5 T when labeling is unknown or incomplete [^1148eEoB] [^114WNyZY].

> But wait, what if the patient also has a pacemaker or ICD. I need to ensure separate compliance with CIED MRI workflows, including device identification, programming, monitoring, and SAR constraints; importantly, the presence of an MR Conditional CIED does not make the valve unsafe, but both device and valve conditions must be met simultaneously, and abandoned or retained leads introduce distinct RF heating hazards that warrant specialized protocols or deferral if labeling is an absolute contraindication [^116vFteW] [^115rY9vz] [^1117yo4H] [^113SXsex].

> Let me think about a stepwise safe-scanning approach. First, I should confirm the exact valve model, implant date, and MR labeling from the manufacturer or implant card, and if uncertain, prefer 1.5 T with conservative SAR and careful monitoring under institutional MR safety procedures; second, I should tailor sequences to minimize artifact near the prosthesis while still answering the clinical question; third, I should document adherence to labeling conditions, including field strength, spatial gradient limits if specified, and SAR, and ensure appropriate supervision and emergency readiness during the scan [^113JhbJW] [^114WNyZY]. If concurrent CIEDs are present, I must layer in the established device protocol steps and team coordination with electrophysiology before, during, and after the scan, which I should verify case-by-case [^116vFteW] [^1117yo4H].

> Hmm, wait a minute, does CMR add diagnostic value beyond safety in this population. Yes, when echocardiography is limited, CMR can quantify transprosthetic flow, orifice area, and regurgitation, and can contribute to comprehensive hemodynamic assessment; feasibility data show good agreement with echo in many cases, though artifact may occasionally preclude planimetry, which I should anticipate in pre-scan planning and consent [^114MEsHw] [^112jLbxy] [^116k2iha].

> In summary, I should emphasize that most modern bioprosthetic heart valves are MR Conditional and can be scanned safely at 1.5 T, and many at 3 T, provided manufacturer conditions, institutional safety procedures, and prudent sequence selections are followed; experimental and clinical data support negligible magnetic interactions, minimal heating under controlled SAR, and typically localized artifacts, while guidelines encourage consulting device-specific labeling and do not contraindicate MRI for these valves, so confirmation of labeling and protocolized execution are the keys to safe practice [^113JhbJW] [^1148eEoB] [^113NJP3b] [^114X47tj].

Yes, bioprosthetic valves **can safely undergo MRI** [^114WNyZY] because they are made of non-ferromagnetic materials and produce minimal artifacts [^1148eEoB]. MRI at **1.5 T or 3 T** is **generally safe** [^116fkg8f], with negligible heating or displacement [^1148eEoB], and no clinically significant valve dysfunction has been reported [^114WNyZY]. MRI is useful for assessing valve function, regurgitation [^114MEsHw], and structural degeneration [^116k2iha], but **echocardiography remains first-line** for routine surveillance [^113NJP3b]. Always verify the specific valve model and follow manufacturer guidelines before scanning [^114WNyZY] [^113JhbJW].

## MRI safety considerations for bioprosthetic valves

### Magnetic field interactions

**Ferromagnetism**: Bioprosthetic valves are non-ferromagnetic [^113JhbJW], so MRI-related displacement and torque are negligible [^114WNyZY]. **Clinical evidence**: At 3 T, magnetic interaction was minimal (deflection angle 3°, torque 0) [^1148eEoB].

---

### RF-induced heating

**Heating risk**: Metallic components (e.g. stents) can cause RF heating [^114WNyZY], but bioprosthetic valves show minimal heating [^1148eEoB]. **Clinical evidence**: At 3 T, the maximum temperature rise was 2.5°C (background 1.7°C), indicating minimal risk [^1148eEoB].

---

### Image artifacts

**Artifact severity**: Bioprosthetic valves cause minimal artifacts, allowing diagnostic imaging [^114MEsHw]. **Clinical evidence**: Artifacts were small relative to implant size and shape [^1148eEoB].

---

### Valve function and integrity

**Functionality**: No clinically significant dysfunction or structural damage has been reported after MRI [^1148eEoB] [^114WNyZY].

---

## MRI field strength considerations

MRI at **1.5 T and 3 T** is **generally safe** for bioprosthetic valves [^114WNyZY], with minimal heating and artifacts [^1148eEoB]. Higher fields (> 3 T) are **less well studied** and should be **approached with caution** [^116fkg8f].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines support MRI in patients with bioprosthetic valves, with **no absolute contraindications** [^114WNyZY]. Always verify the **specific valve model** and follow **manufacturer instructions** [^113JhbJW] [^116fkg8f].

---

## Clinical scenarios where MRI is beneficial

MRI is particularly useful for:

- **Valve function**: Assessing regurgitation and stenosis [^112jLbxy].

- **Structural degeneration**: Detecting calcification, fibrosis, and pannus.

- **Perivalvular complications**: Identifying abscesses and pseudoaneurysms [^112JmspP] [^1159ZimX].

- **Hemodynamics**: Quantifying flow and pressure gradients [^114MEsHw] [^115cp15x].

---

## Limitations and precautions

- **Artifacts**: Minimal but possible, especially with metallic stents [^1148eEoB].

- **Patient factors**: Claustrophobia and inability to lie still may limit MRI [^113ruMAK].

- **Valve verification**: Confirm valve type and follow manufacturer guidelines [^114WNyZY].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

- **Echocardiography**: First-line for routine surveillance and initial assessment [^113NJP3b] [^11732JYY].

- **CT**: Useful for structural assessment and detecting calcification or thrombosis [^115Mwm3G] [^1114vi1z].

- **Fluoroscopy**: Helpful for evaluating leaflet motion and mechanical function [^116k2iha].

## Summary of MRI safety considerations for bioprosthetic valves

| **Safety consideration** | **Clinical evidence** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|-|
| Magnetic field interactions | Negligible (deflection angle 3°, torque 0) [^1148eEoB] [^114WNyZY] | Safe |
| RF-induced heating | Minimal (max 2.5°C) [^1148eEoB] [^114WNyZY] | Safe |
| Image artifacts | Minimal [^114MEsHw] [^1148eEoB] | Diagnostic imaging feasible |
| Valve function and integrity | No dysfunction or damage reported [^1148eEoB] [^114WNyZY] | Safe |

---

Bioprosthetic valves are **MRI-safe at 1.5 T and 3 T** [^114WNyZY], with minimal heating and artifacts and no reported dysfunction [^1148eEoB]. MRI is valuable for functional and structural assessment [^116k2iha], but **echocardiography remains the primary surveillance tool** [^113NJP3b]. Always confirm the **valve model** and adhere to **manufacturer guidelines** [^113JhbJW].

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) safety considerations are paramount.

- **Metallic objects and implantable devices**: No patient or accompanying person with a pacemaker or implanted defibrillator should approach the magnet, nor anyone with a ferromagnetic clip or steel fragment that might lie adjacent to soft tissue of the brain or retina. However, almost all sternal wires, clips, stents, occlusion devices, and prosthetic valves within the chest are safe in a 1.5 T magnet, causing only local image artefact. Newer devices that cause less artefact may facilitate follow-up by CMR. Safety information relating to specific implants or situations should be consulted as necessary. Vigilance and strict institutional safety procedures are needed to prevent medical staff or patients from inadvertently approaching the magnet with ferromagnetic objects such as a gas cylinder, wheelchair, trolley, scissors, or other equipment that could cause harm to themselves or a patient in the magnetic field.

- **Gadolinium chelates**: These contrast agents are widely used for CMR angiography or myocardial viability studies. They are generally associated with fewer adverse reactions than iodine-based agents. However, in patients with renal failure, especially if advanced, gadolinium administration has been linked to cases of the severe complication of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. In cases where a contrast agent is indicated, renal function needs to be tested, and the potential risks weighed against the benefits of contrast-enhanced rather than non-contrast CMR imaging.

### Evaluation of MRI issues at 3-Tesla for a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) bioprosthesis [^1148eEoB]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The replacement of the aortic heart valve typically requires open-heart surgery. A new transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) bioprosthesis made from metallic material was recently developed as a minimally invasive alternative. Due to the presence of metal, there are safety issues related to MRI. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to use standardized testing techniques to evaluate MRI issues for this TAVR bioprosthesis with a 3-Tesla MR system.

- **Methods**: The TAVR bioprosthesis (Hydra Aortic Valve, Percutaneous Heart Valve Prosthesis, Vascular Innovations Company, Ltd, Thailand) was evaluated for magnetic field interactions, including translational attraction and torque, MRI-related heating at a relatively high specific absorption rate level (whole body average SAR, 2.9-W/kg), and artifacts in T1-weighted, spin echo, and gradient echo pulse sequences at 3-Tesla.

- **Results**: The TAVR bioprosthesis demonstrated negligible magnetic field interactions, with a deflection angle of 3 degrees and torque of 0. It showed minimal heating, with a maximum temperature rise of 2.5°C and a background temperature rise of 1.7°C. Artifacts were relatively small in relation to the size and shape of the implant.

- **Conclusions**: The TAVR bioprosthesis evaluated in this investigation is acceptable, or "MR Conditional", for patients undergoing MRI at 3-Tesla or less.

### Multimodality imaging for prosthetic valves evaluation: Current understanding and future directions [^116k2iha]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

The number of patients requiring heart valve surgery continues to increase with growing life expectancy and the expansion of both surgical and transcatheter valves. In patients with prosthetic heart valves (PHV), transthoracic echocardiography serves as the primary method for initial assessment and serial surveillance. However, multimodality imaging, including three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance, fluoroscopy, and nuclear imaging, is becoming more commonly utilized in clinical practice to aid in diagnosis and to identify the mechanism of PHV dysfunction.

This review aims to provide an updated overview of the use of multimodality imaging in the evaluation of PHVs, to illustrate the imaging appearance of different complications, and to highlight a practical approach to assist clinical decision-making in challenging cases of PHV dysfunction.

### Magnetic resonance imaging safety in pacemaker and implantable cardioverter defibrillator patients: How far have we come [^117WfNcG]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for patients with pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators has been historically challenging due to potential risks. Recent advancements, however, have improved our understanding of how to safely conduct MRI in these patients, although there remain some limitations and areas requiring further study.

- **Safety considerations**: Significant progress has been made in device technology to allow MRI compatibility, reducing safety concerns. The development of MR-conditional devices has greatly expanded the capability to safely perform MRI scans under specific conditions.

- **Clinical guidelines**: Current guidelines and protocols provide a framework for evaluating patient eligibility for MRI. These protocols emphasize the importance of following manufacturer-specific instructions and implementing safeguards to mitigate risks during the MRI procedure.

- **Limitations and future directions**: Despite these advancements, not all devices are MRI-compatible, and patient-specific factors can further complicate the process. Ongoing research into improving device compatibility and expanding indications for MRI use is essential for further progress in this field.

The increasing availability of MR-conditional devices offers new possibilities for patient care, but careful consideration of risks and adherence to guidelines remain crucial to ensure patient safety.

### Real-time magnetic resonance imaging-guided transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^112K3yex]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

To demonstrate the feasibility of real-time magnetic resonance imaging (rtMRI)-guided transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), an active guidewire and an MRI-compatible valve delivery catheter system were used in a swine model. The CoreValve system was minimally modified to be MRI-compatible by replacing the stainless steel components with fluoroplastic resin and high-density polyethylene components. Eight swine, weighing 60–90 kg, underwent rtMRI-guided TAVR with an active guidewire through a left subclavian approach.

Two imaging planes (long-axis view and short-axis view) were used simultaneously for real-time imaging during implantation. Successful deployment was performed without rapid ventricular pacing or cardiopulmonary bypass. Postdeployment images were acquired to evaluate the final valve position and the valvular and cardiac function.

Our results show that the CoreValve can be easily and effectively deployed through a left subclavian approach using rtMRI guidance, a minimally modified valve delivery catheter system, and an active guidewire. This method allows superior visualization before deployment, thereby allowing placement of the valve with pinpoint accuracy. rtMRI has the added benefit of the ability to perform immediate postprocedural functional assessment, while eliminating the morbidity associated with radiation exposure, rapid ventricular pacing, contrast media renal toxicity, and a more invasive procedure. The use of a commercially available device brings this rtMRI-guided approach closer to clinical reality.

### Long-term comparison between pulmonary homograft versus bioprosthesis for pulmonary valve replacement in tetralogy of Fallot [^117YLhZe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

- **Freedom from structural valve deterioration**: Observed in patients treated with homografts and bioprostheses. Cardiac MRI findings are summarized indicating that a total of 21 and 85 patients with homograft and bioprosthesis, respectively, underwent baseline cardiac MRI. Among these, 17 and 40, respectively, underwent follow-up MRIs, and 9 and 16, respectively, had late follow-up MRIs.

	- A significant reduction in indexed end-diastolic and end-systolic right ventricular (RV) volumes was observed in patients treated with either homografts or bioprostheses, without significant differences between the two groups. A repeated measures mixed model confirmed that the type of prosthesis (homograft versus bioprosthesis) did not significantly influence the reduction in RV volumes (indexed end-diastolic RV volume, −8.5 ± 7.8 mL/m² [P = 0.27]; indexed end-systolic RV volume, −3.1 ± 5.1 mL/m² [P = 0.53]).

- **Postoperative changes in right ventricle volumes**: Reviewed through cardiac MRI examinations revealing no substantial differences attributable to the prosthesis type in the reduction of RV volumes for patients treated with homografts versus bioprostheses.

### Implantable electronic cardiac devices and compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging [^116sjAHC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

There is a growing population of patients with implanted electronic cardiac devices and a concomitant increase in the use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Theoretically, MR poses safety risks to such devices. However, considerable laboratory data and clinical experience now demonstrate safety in this setting, assuming appropriate device selection and patient monitoring.

Herein, we review these data, our safety protocol, and the new generation of devices prospectively designed and tested to be safe for MR scanning under certain conditions (i.e. devices that are MR-conditional). We also argue that the available data do not support a complete transition to the implantation of MR-conditional devices.

### Safe use of MRI in people with cardiac implantable electronic devices [^1117yo4H]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

MR scanning in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) was formerly felt to be contraindicated. However, an increasing number of patients now have an implanted MR conditional device, allowing them to safely undergo MR scanning, provided the manufacturer's guidance is adhered to. Additionally, some patients with non-MR conditional devices may undergo MR scanning if no other imaging modality is deemed suitable and there is a clear clinical indication for scanning that outweighs the potential risks.

The following guidance has been formulated by the British Heart Rhythm Society and endorsed by the British Cardiovascular Society, among others. It describes the protocols that should be followed for patients with CIEDs undergoing MR scanning. These recommendations, principles, and conclusions are supported by the Royal College of Radiologists.

### Cardiovascular implantable electronic devices: A review of the dangers and difficulties in MR scanning and attempts to improve safety [^116H3vs2]. Insights into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

An increasing number of patients are being treated with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), many of which are MR conditional. There is a lack of literature on the safe scanning of MR conditional CIEDs. This review article discusses MR imaging safety in patients with implanted CIEDs. Guidelines on the safe use and indications of imaging patients with MR conditional CIEDs are described, followed by a pictorial essay of the radiographic features of these devices. We also discuss the challenges of monitoring the patient in the MR environment, advances in MRI conditional imaging of devices, availability, limitations, and workflow, including vendor-specific and other collaborative efforts to simplify the scanning process. Radiologists must be able to facilitate the safe utilization of MR imaging in patients who have CIEDs. A thorough knowledge of the hazards of imaging non-MR compatible devices is required, as well as knowing how to correctly identify and manage the imaging of patients with MR conditional CIEDs. Finally, we propose steps required to facilitate the safe scanning of patients with MR conditional CIEDs adopted in our institution and a contingency plan in the event that an inadvertent MR scan of a patient with an MRI unsafe CIED should occur.

- **Main messages**:
	- Risks of MR imaging in patients who have CIEDs have been worked around.
	- There are many technical limitations in enabling safe MR scanning of CIEDs.
	- Radiological identification of MRI-conditional status of CIEDs is useful.
	- Standardizing conditions for safe MRI scanning is important.

### 4d flow MRI hemodynamic benchmarking of surgical bioprosthetic valves [^117PM7nx]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

We exploited 4-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D Flow), combined with a standardized in vitro setting, to establish a comprehensive benchmark for the systematic hemodynamic comparison of surgical aortic bioprosthetic valves (BPVs).

- **Materials and methods**: 4D Flow analysis was performed on two small sizes of three commercialized pericardial BPVs (Trifecta™ GT, Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna, and Crown PRT®). Each BPV was tested over a clinically pertinent range of continuous flow rates within an in vitro MRI-compatible system equipped with pressure transducers. In-house 4D Flow post-processing of the post-valvular velocity field included the quantification of BPV effective orifice area (EOA), transvalvular pressure gradients (TPG), kinetic energy, and viscous energy dissipation.

- **Results**: The 4D Flow technique effectively captured the 3-dimensional flow pattern of each device. Trifecta exhibited the lowest range of velocity and kinetic energy, maximized EOA (p < 0.0001), and minimized TPGs (p ≤ 0.015) when compared with Magna and Crown, which showed minor EOA differences (p ≥ 0.042) and similar TPGs (p ≥ 0.25). 4D Flow TPGs estimations strongly correlated against ground-truth data from pressure transducers; viscous energy dissipation proved to be inversely proportional to the fluid jet penetration.

- **Conclusion**: The proposed 4D Flow analysis pinpointed consistent hemodynamic differences among BPVs, highlighting the significant effect of device size on the fluid dynamic outcomes. The efficacy of the non-invasive 4D Flow MRI protocol could shed light on further applications and developments.

### Four-dimensional flow MRI of stented versus stentless aortic valve bioprostheses [^115cp15x]. European Radiology (2018). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate aortic velocity, wall shear stress (WSS), and viscous energy loss (EL) of stented and stentless bioprostheses using 4D flow MRI one year after surgical aortic valve replacement.

- **Methods**: In this cross-sectional study, 28 patients with either stented (n = 14) or stentless (n = 14) bioprosthesis underwent non-contrast-enhanced 4D-flow MRI at 1.5 T. Analyses included a comparison of velocity, WSS, and EL in the ascending aorta during peak systole for both spatially averaged values and local differences using per-voxel analysis.

- **Results**: No significant differences were found in peak and mean velocity between stented and stentless bioprostheses: 2.45 m/s vs. 2.11 m/s (p = 0.09) and 0.60 m/s vs. 0.62 m/s (p = 0.89), WSS (0.60 Pa vs. 0.59 Pa; p = 0.55), and EL (10.17 mW vs. 7.82 mW; p = 0.10). Per-voxel analysis revealed a significantly higher central lumen velocity and lower outer lumen velocity, WSS, and EL in stentless versus stented prostheses.

- **Conclusion**: One year after aortic valve implantation with either stented or stentless bioprostheses, velocity, WSS, and EL were comparable when assessed for averaged values in the ascending aorta. However, the flow profile described with local analysis for stentless prostheses is potentially favorable, with a significantly higher central velocity profile and lower values for outer lumen velocity, WSS, and EL.

- **Key points**:
	- Stentless bioprostheses can be implanted instead of stented aortic valve bioprostheses.
	- Haemodynamic performance of valve prostheses can be assessed using 4D flow MRI.
	- Averaged ascending aorta PSV, WSS, and EL are comparable.

### Cardiovascular implantable electronic devices: A review of the dangers and difficulties in MR scanning and attempts to improve safety [^114y9rJw]. Insights into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has steadily increased in use worldwide. There is a foreseeable increase in the number of patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) requiring an MRI. It is estimated that 75% of patients with CIEDs will need an MRI at some point during their lifetime.

This review article discusses the safe use of MRI in patients who have implanted CIEDs. Radiologists should have a basic understanding of the principles behind the redesign and engineering of these devices, which were once considered an absolute contraindication to scanning.

- **Known hazards**: MRI-unsafe CIEDs are described, followed by guidelines on safe use, indications, and limitations of imaging patients with MR-conditional CIEDs. This includes a brief pictorial essay of the radiographic features of these devices.

- **Proposed guideline**: We offer steps to facilitate the safe scanning of patients with MR-conditional CIEDs through a proposed guideline adopted in our institution. This includes a contingency plan in case an inadvertent MR scan of a patient with an MRI-unsafe CIED occurs. These guidelines have been ratified by the authors' institutional medical board review process and have been implemented successfully at the time of writing.

What are MRI-safe devices? Implants, devices, or materials should routinely undergo evaluation prior to an MRI procedure if known, and are categorized as safe, conditional, or unsafe. Safe devices are considered safe within the MR environment. The object is usually made from non-ferromagnetic components.

### Midterm results of transapical aortic valve replacement via real-time magnetic resonance imaging guidance [^111U5mDQ]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Percutaneous valve replacements are presently being evaluated in clinical trials. As delivery of the valve is catheter based, the safety and efficacy of these procedures may be influenced by the imaging used. To assist the surgeon and improve the success of the operation, transapical aortic valve replacements have been performed using real-time magnetic resonance imaging guidance.

- **Methods**: Twenty-eight swine underwent aortic valve replacement by real-time magnetic resonance imaging on the beating heart. Stentless bioprostheses mounted on balloon-expandable stents were used. Magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 T) was utilized to identify the critical anatomical landmarks. In addition to anatomical confirmation of adequate placement of the prosthesis, functional assessment of the valve and left ventricle, as well as perfusion imaging, were also obtained with magnetic resonance imaging. A series of short-term feasibility experiments were conducted (n = 18) wherein the animals were humanely killed after valve placement and assessment by magnetic resonance imaging. Ten additional animals were allowed to survive and had follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans and confirmatory echocardiography at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively.

- **Results**: Real-time magnetic resonance imaging provided superior visualization of the needed landmarks. The time to implantation after apical access was 74 ± 18 seconds. Perfusion scanning demonstrated adequate coronary flow, and functional imaging documented preservation of ventricular contractility in all animals after successful deployment. Phase contrast imaging was used effectively to assess flow dynamics post-operation.

### Advances in clinical applications of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging [^112jLbxy]. Heart (2008). Low credibility.

CMR provides non-invasive, clear anatomical valvular information that can impact the clinical management of a patient. It is possible to differentiate between a bicuspid and a tricuspid aortic valve, as illustrated in Figures 5 and 6. CMR reproducibly characterizes aortic valve anatomy, and the determined aortic valve area correlates well with cardiac catheterization.

- **Figure 5**: Black-blood fast spin echo technique to visualize the aortic valve.
- **Figure 6**: During diastole cine imaging, an aortic valve appears tricuspid; however, during systole, it is apparent that the valve is functionally bicuspid with fusion of the right and left cusps.

Phase contrast techniques can reliably measure peak velocity and thus peak gradient in aortic stenosis. Valvular information, in combination with accurate left ventricular volumes and assessment of thoracic aortic dilatation, can assist in planning valvular replacement and, importantly, determine whether the aorta needs intervention as well. Similar data can be obtained in an assessment of the pulmonic valve, which is not always well-defined by transthoracic echocardiography.

While most valvular lesions seen by echocardiography can be assessed by CMR, echocardiography has the advantages of widespread availability and validation. CMR provides additional information in patients who have poor echocardiographic windows and is useful in patients who are poor candidates for invasive transoesophageal echocardiography or when additional surgery beyond the valve is contemplated.

### Safety evaluation of a leadless transcatheter pacemaker for magnetic resonance imaging use [^112KKcLH]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Increased magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) adoption and demand are driving the need for device patients to have safe access to MRI.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to address the interactions of MRI with the Micra transcatheter pacemaker system.

- **Methods**: A strategy was developed to evaluate potential MRI risks, including device heating, unintended cardiac stimulation, force, torque, vibration, and device malfunction. Assessment of MRI-induced device heating was conducted using a phantom containing gelled saline, and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to incorporate these results. These simulations simulated numerous combinations of human body models, position locations in the MRI scanner bore, and a variety of coil designs. Lastly, a patient with a Micra pacemaker who underwent a clinically indicated MRI scan is presented.

- **Results**: Compared to traditional MRI conditional pacemakers, the overall risk with Micra was greatly reduced because of the small size of the device and the absence of a lead. The modeling results predicted that the nonperfused temperature rise of the device would be less than 0.4°C at 1.5 T and 0.5°C at 3 T. The risk of device heating with multiple device implants was not increased compared with a single device. The clinical case study revealed no MRI-related complications.

- **Conclusion**: The MRI safety assessment tests conducted for the Micra pacemaker demonstrate that patients with a single device or multiple devices can safely undergo MRI scans in both 1.5- and 3-T MRI scanners. No MRI-related complications were observed in a patient.

### Four-dimensional flow MRI of stented versus stentless aortic valve bioprostheses [^113rUinc]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

**Conclusion**: Stented and stentless aortic valve prostheses exhibit comparable flow velocity and wall shear stress when assessed for averaged values in the ascending aorta. However, for stentless prostheses, the local flow profiles described with a per-voxel analysis revealed a less obstructed profile more similar to the native aortic valve. This includes a significantly higher central velocity profile and lower values for outer lumen velocity, wall shear stress, and energy loss.

### Cardiovascular implantable electronic devices: A review of the dangers and difficulties in MR scanning and attempts to improve safety [^112nBttG]. Insights into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

An increasing number of patients are being treated with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), many of which are MR conditional. There is a lack of literature on the safe scanning of MR conditional CIEDs. This review article discusses MR imaging safety in patients with implanted CIEDs. Guidelines on safe use and indications of imaging patients with MR conditional CIEDs are described, followed by a pictorial essay of the radiographic features of these devices.

We also discuss the challenges of monitoring the patient in the MR environment, advances in MRI conditional imaging of devices, availability, limitations, and workflow, including vendor-specific and other collaborative efforts to simplify the scanning process. Radiologists must be able to facilitate the safe utilization of MR imaging in patients who have CIEDs. A thorough knowledge of the hazards of imaging non-MR compatible devices is required, as well as knowing how to correctly identify and manage the imaging of patients with MR conditional CIEDs. Finally, we propose steps required to facilitate the safe scanning of patients with MR conditional CIEDs adopted in our institution and a contingency plan in the event that an inadvertent MR scan of a patient with an MRI unsafe CIED should occur.

- **Main messages**:
	- Risks of MR imaging in patients who have CIEDs have been worked around.
	- There are many technical limitations in enabling safe MR scanning of CIEDs.
	- Radiological identification of MRI-conditional status of CIEDs is useful.
	- Standardizing conditions for safe MRI scanning is important.

### Recommendations for cardiovascular magnetic resonance in adults with congenital heart disease from the respective working groups of the European Society of Cardiology [^113ruMAK]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Other limitations and considerations:

Claustrophobia and patient compliance: CMR studies require the patient to lie still in the tubular bore of a magnet, which may not be tolerated by a small percentage of patients (approximately 5%) due to claustrophobia. Anxiolytics, such as oral benzodiazepine, can be considered in individuals with mild or moderate claustrophobia. Limited ability to comply with breath-hold instructions can be an additional problem in patients with Down syndrome or other cognitive or behavioral issues, although this is less often a problem in adults than in the pediatric population. Neither sedation nor anesthesia can be recommended for CMR of ACHD unless undertaken in an appropriately equipped and staffed center that maintains regular relevant experience in accordance with local practice guidelines. The relative safety and diagnostic efficacy of anesthesia with intubation compared with sedation remains almost impossible to determine, given the rarity but potential severity of the hazards in the CMR environment. Alternative imaging by repeat echocardiography or CT may be preferable.

Intravascular pressures and jet velocities: CMR does not, on its own, provide measurements of pressure. Pressure differences across stenoses of heart valves or large vessels can be estimated by applying the modified Bernoulli equation from measurements of jet velocities. However, CMR jet velocity mapping requires skill. The acquisition slice, with adequate temporal and spatial resolution and appropriate velocity encoding range (VENC), should be located to transect the core of the jet.

### The emerging applications of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging in transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^114NC9o8]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement in selected patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) and high surgical risk. The planning and follow-up of TAVI require an array of imaging techniques, each with its own advantages and limitations. Echocardiography and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) have established applications in patient selection and procedure guidance, but are limited in some patients. The applications of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) for TAVI are emerging.

CMRI can provide structural and functional imaging details required for the TAVI procedure in a way comparable or superior to that obtained by echocardiography and MDCT combined. In this review, we examine the continuously evolving role of CMRI as a complementary or alternative tool to more established imaging techniques, and address the advantages and disadvantages of CMRI in this setting. We discuss the role of CMRI in selecting anatomically suitable patients for TAVI and the post-TAVI follow-up, with particular emphasis on its applications for assessing AS severity and hemodynamic impact, vascular imaging for TAVI access routes, quantification of paravalvular leaks, and left ventricular (LV) remodeling in the post-TAVI setting. Additionally, CMRI provides an imaging biomarker tool for AS risk stratification.

### Four-dimensional flow MRI of stented versus stentless aortic valve bioprostheses [^114vrvVD]. European Radiology (2018).

The Institutional Ethics Committee approved this exploratory cross-sectional study. All consecutive patients who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement within the previous 9–15 months were screened for exclusion criteria. In addition to standard MRI exclusion criteria, patients with a history of multiple heart valve replacements or known persistent atrial fibrillation were excluded. All eligible patients were asked to participate. After obtaining informed consent, the MRI exam was conducted in 30 patients with either a stented Mitroflow (Sorin, Saluggia, Italy; Fig. 1a) or stentless Freedom Solo (Sorin, Saluggia, Italy; Fig. 1b) bioprosthesis.

- **Figure 1**: Example of the stented and stentless bioprosthesis. (a) Mitroflow prosthesis (Sorin, Saluggia, Italy); (b) Freedom Solo prosthesis (Sorin, Saluggia, Italy).

All participants underwent a cardiovascular MRI at 1.5-Tesla (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany; software version B17). No contrast agent was used. The examination included a standard-of-care prospective electrocardiogram-triggered and respiratory-gated short axis time-resolved (CINE) MRI for the evaluation of cardiac dimensions and function. For the assessment of aortic blood flow, time-resolved 3D phase-contrast MRI with three-directional flow encoding (4D flow) was obtained in a sagittal oblique 3D volume covering the aortic valve bioprosthesis and the thoracic aorta using electrocardiogram gating during free breathing with a respiratory navigator placed at the lung-liver interface.

### Four-dimensional flow MRI of stented versus stentless aortic valve bioprostheses [^1151wEFx]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Since the development of stentless bioprostheses, it is believed that this type of prosthesis mimics the native flow pattern better than a stented prosthesis. The absence of the stent should contribute to lower velocity, wall shear stress, and energy loss of the valve. However, previous echocardiography studies did not display a hemodynamic benefit in terms of left ventricular mass regression or postoperative mean gradients. Furthermore, we did not find a difference in the averaged peak systolic velocities.

Von Knobelsdorff-Brenkenhoff and colleagues, who used 4D flow MRI, demonstrated differences in vorticity, helicity, and eccentricity among a heterogeneous group of controls and patients with autografts, mechanical, stentless, and stented aortic valve prostheses. Their comparison of eight patients with a stented bioprosthesis with 14 patients with a stentless bioprosthesis revealed that stentless prostheses were associated with larger effective orifice areas and less vorticity and helicity. This is in agreement with our per-voxel analysis that yielded higher central lumen flow velocities in the stentless group, which implies the occurrence of less vorticity and helicity. However, a per-voxel analysis was not performed in their study, inhibiting further comparison of data.

This study has limitations, mainly related to the small sample size as a consequence of the study design. We describe a tendency towards lower peak velocities across the stentless prosthesis. A larger sample size could have influenced those results. However, for this exploratory study, we did not use sample size calculations.

### Prevalence and evolution of susceptibility-weighted imaging lesions in patients with artificial heart valves [^1146EDk9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

In patients with mechanical heart valves, cerebral susceptibility‐weighted imaging lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, postulated to be caused by degenerative metallic abrasion, are frequently referred to as valve abrasion. It remains unclear whether valve implantation not requiring cardiopulmonary bypass or biological heart valves also shows those lesions.

- **Methods and results**: Two blinded readers rated lesions and cerebral amyloid angiopathy probability according to established criteria on brain magnetic resonance imaging pre‐ and postinterventionally. We assessed the association between valve type/cardiopulmonary bypass use and lesion count on the first postinterventional scan using multivariable logistic regression. On postinterventional magnetic resonance imaging, 57 out of 58 (98%) patients with mechanical heart valves had at least one lesion, and 46 out of 58 (79%) had three or more lesions, while 92 out of 97 (95%) patients with biological heart valves had at least one lesion, and 72 out of 97 (74%) had three or more lesions. On multivariate analysis, the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass during implantation significantly increased the odds of having lesions on the first postinterventional magnetic resonance imaging (β per 10 minutes 0.498; 95%, 0.116–0.880; P = 0.011), whereas valve type showed no significant association (P = 0.338). Thirty-seven of 155 (23.9%) patients fulfilled the criteria for possible/probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

- **Conclusions**: Lesions in patients with artificial heart valves evolve around the time point of valve implantation, and the majority of patients have multiple lesions.

Regarding medical management for prosthetic heart valves, specifically concerning antiplatelet therapy for mechanical prostheses, the ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend considering the addition of aspirin (75–100 mg/day) to VKAs in patients with a mechanical SAVR or mitral valve replacement who have an indication for antiplatelet therapy, provided the bleeding risk is low.

### Real-time interactive MRI-guided cardiac surgery: aortic valve replacement using a direct apical approach [^1164nDca]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Minimally invasive cardiac surgery requires arresting and emptying of the heart, which compromises visualization of the surgical field. In this feasibility study, a novel surgical procedure is demonstrated in which real-time MRI is used to guide the placement of a prosthetic aortic valve in the beating heart via direct apical access in eight porcine hearts. A clinical stentless bioprosthetic valve affixed to a platinum stent was compressed onto a balloon-tipped catheter. This was fed through a 15–18 mm delivery port inserted into the left ventricular (LV) apex via a minimally invasive subxyphoid incision. Using interactive real-time MRI, the surgeon implanted the prosthetic valve in the correct location at the aortic annulus within 90 seconds. In four of the animals, immediately after implantation, ventricular function, blood flow through the valve, and myocardial perfusion were evaluated with MRI. MRI-guided beating-heart surgery may provide patients with a less morbid and more durable solution to structural heart disease.

### MR safety and compatibility of a noninvasively expandable total-joint endoprosthesis [^112BFctn]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2005). Low credibility.

A noninvasively expandable total-joint endoprosthesis is now available for pediatric patients; the prosthesis can be lengthened by the external application of a magnetic field. We investigated the risks of unintentional heating or lengthening of the prosthesis during MR imaging and evaluated the effect of the device on the diagnostic efficacy of MR imaging of surrounding tissues. We performed MR imaging at 1.5 T by using standard pulse sequences and pulse sequences with high-gradient and high-radiofrequency duty cycle. MR imaging caused no measurable change in prosthesis length, and the temperature of the prosthesis increased by less than 1 degree Celsius during repeated 14-minute exposures. Despite significant signal loss and image distortion around the prosthetic joint, clinically useful images were obtained as close as 12 cm from the ends of the prosthetic stems, measured toward the body of the device. Thus, the prosthesis can be safely exposed to MR imaging pulse sequences at 1.5 T, and the visualization of some tissue surrounding the device is clinically useful.

### CT and MR imaging prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Standardisation of scanning protocols, measurements and reporting - a consensus document by the European Society of Cardiovascular Radiology (ESCR) [^113Gzb1Y]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Coronary obstruction secondary to migrated calcified and non-calcified native valve components during device deployment is a rare procedural complication with a reported incidence of 0.8%, increasing to 3.5% in valve-in-valve procedures. It usually occurs during the procedure but has been reported up to 24 hours after device deployment. Patients with a more susceptible anatomy for this complication have a combination of a low-lying ostia of the coronary arteries (OCA) with a large native aortic valve leaflet.

Distance should be measured by tracing a perpendicular line connecting the inferior edge of the OCA with the aortic annulus plane, as the risk of obstruction is considered to be low if this height is more than 10–14 mm. The minimum distance to OCA should also be calculated in relation to the length of the aortic valve cusps.

- **Standardised measurement procedure**: A stepwise approach to measure the minimum distance of the OCA is recommended. Standardised ways to perform these measurements include assessing the distance of the annular plane to the ostium of the right coronary artery and left main. Start with annular plane images, obtained through outlined steps, and locate the origin of the RCA by scrolling through images in the direction of the aorta. Reference lines are then rotated accordingly.

### MRI evaluation prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI): When to acquire and how to interpret [^115yo9Mj]. Insights into Imaging (2016).

The aortic annulus is a virtual ring formed by connecting the basal hinge points of the aortic valve leaflets. It is not a distinct histological entity or anatomical boundary but represents the smallest diameter in the blood path between the left ventricle and aorta. This structure is crucial for positioning the implanted prosthetic valve. A bright blood (SSFP = steady state free precession) aortic root cine stack of 8–10 slices from diastole to systole is acquired parallel to the valve plane. This can be done by planning the acquisition perpendicular to the direction of flow in the aortic sinus on the coronal aorta and left ventricle outflow tract planes. This approach is similar to the suggested method for performing planimetric assessments of the aortic orifice and for conducting 2-D phase contrast MRI measurements of aortic flow. Ensuring that the annular area and diameter measurements are taken perpendicular to the axis of blood flow in the LVOT and aorta is essential.

As there is systolic descent of the annular plane, acquisition should always begin in the left ventricle outflow tract. The annular plane is identified by the end systolic image below the insertion of leaflets through this cine stack. This slice is utilized for assessing the minor and major diameters, area, and perimeter of the annulus. Additionally, annular diameters can be obtained from a navigator-assisted free breathing diastolic phase 3-D SSFP sequence.

Regarding medical management for prosthetic heart valves, specifically anticoagulant therapy, after surgical mechanical prosthesis implantation, ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend initiating VKAs to achieve an INR of 2.5 in patients with a mechanical bileaflet or current-generation single-tilting disk aortic valve replacement and no risk factors for thromboembolism.

### LV reverse remodeling imparted by aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis; is it durable? A cardiovascular MRI study sponsored by the American Heart Association [^116G6ikU]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with advanced aortic stenosis (AS), upon surgical relief of valvular afterload, undergo rapid regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). This results in corresponding improvements in many left ventricular (LV) metrics measurable by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), which is in conjunction with improvements in clinical sequelae.

However, the majority of the surgical benefits appear early, almost truncated within the first 6 months. While these benefits are durable, they only minimally continue long-term, out to 4 years. The long-term expected reverse remodeling appears thwarted by a myriad of factors, rendering incomplete the otherwise beneficial post-aortic valve replacement (AVR) effects.

From a surgical perspective, it would seem initially apparent that any 'less than complete' normalization of LV mass after such an extended follow-up would be perceived potentially as a shortcoming of the surgical technique. From this data, we can provide substantial evidence to support that this is an incorrect supposition. Whether longer-term follow-up would eventually reveal a normalized trajectory on course with historic controls is unknown but worthy of further investigation.

Magnetic resonance imaging is a safe procedure when performed within the appropriate safety boundaries; however, it is not free of potential risks. In some patient categories, which are less commonly encountered in daily practices, these risk factors are heightened, and special care needs to be taken when evaluating the correct procedure to perform, to minimize the risks and maximize the benefit to the patient.

### Quantification of periprosthetic valve leakage with multiple regurgitation jets by magnetic resonance imaging [^112fEHok]. Pediatric Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

A patient with aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis required replacement of the prosthesis. After initial recovery, his left ventricular function gradually declined, and echocardiography revealed minor paravalvular leakage and a cavern around the prosthesis. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed; flow-imaging and volume-based measurements showed high-grade paravalvular leakage of 45% and 58% regurgitant fraction, respectively. Intraoperatively, the dehiscence of more than half of the circumference of the aortic prosthesis was seen. This study shows that MRI can accurately assess even periprosthetic valve leakage with multiple regurgitation jets.

The 2021 ACC/AHA guidelines on medical management for prosthetic heart valves, particularly in the context of anticoagulant therapy after surgical bioprosthesis implantation, recommend considering the initiation of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). The goal is to achieve an INR of 2.5 for a duration of at least three months following bioprosthetic SAVR (surgical aortic valve replacement) or mitral valve replacement. In patients at low risk of bleeding, this period may extend to six months after surgical replacement.

### Feasibility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance to assess the orifice area of aortic bioprostheses [^114MEsHw]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

Prosthetic orifice area, usually calculated by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), provides important information regarding the hemodynamic performance of aortic bioprostheses. However, both TTE and TEE have limitations; therefore, accurate and reproducible determination of the orifice area often remains a challenge. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to assess the orifice areas of aortic bioprostheses.

- **Methods and results**: CMR planimetry of the orifice area was performed in 65 patients (43/22 stented/stentless prostheses; mean time since implantation, 3.1 ± 2.8 years; mean orifice area [TTE], 1.70 ± 0.43 cm²; 62 normally functioning prostheses, 2 severe stenoses, and 1 severe regurgitation). This was done using an imaging plane perpendicular to the transprosthetic flow with steady-state free-precession cine imaging under breath-hold conditions on a 1.5-T MR system. CMR results were compared with TTE (continuity equation, n = 65) and TEE (planimetry, n = 31).

	- CMR planimetry was readily feasible in 80.0% of cases; it was feasible with limitations in 15.4% due to stent, flow, and sternal wire artifacts; and it was impossible in 4.6% due to flow artifacts. Correlations of the orifice areas by CMR with TTE (r = 0.82) and CMR with TEE (r = 0.92) were significant. The average difference between the methods was -0.02 ± 0.24 cm² (TTE) and 0.05 ± 0.15 cm² (TEE). Agreement was present for both stented and stentless devices, independent of orifice size.

Regarding medical management for prosthetic heart valves, specifically concerning anticoagulant therapy, the ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend initiating VKAs to achieve an INR of 3.0 in patients who have undergone surgical mechanical prosthesis implantation. This recommendation applies to patients with a mechanical aortic valve replacement and additional risk factors for thromboembolism, including atrial fibrillation, previous thromboembolism, left ventricular dysfunction, and hypercoagulable state. It also applies to those with an older-generation prosthesis, such as a ball-in-cage design.

### Performing MRI on patients with MRI-conditional and non-conditional cardiac implantable electronic devices: An update for radiologists [^115rY9vz]. Clinical Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators are commonly encountered in clinical practice and entail special consideration when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is required. It is estimated that 50–75% of patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) will have an indication for MRI during their lifetime. Radiologists may want to recommend MRI or may be consulted about the need to perform MRI in a patient with a CIED, at which point they may need to approve or at least provide guidance as to whether MRI may be performed safely.

Even in situations where final clearance will not be provided by the radiologist, he or she can provide valuable information by reviewing radiographs and determining: (a) whether a device is MRI-conditional and MRI may ultimately be permitted, (b) is not MRI-conditional, and MRI using the standard workflow will therefore not be approved, or (c) when additional information will clearly be required. CIED identification and verification of leads can be accomplished through review of the medical record and/or evaluation of a chest radiograph.

In patients with MRI-conditional CIEDs (as well as with legacy CIEDs in those institutions that perform MRI of these patients), specific imaging protocols must be adhered to in order to prevent death or injury to the patient or damage to the device. In this update, we provide details regarding the above topics and provide an algorithm for integrating this information into a clinical workflow to efficiently triage patients with CIEDs who are being considered for MRI.

### CT and MR imaging prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Standardisation of scanning protocols, measurements and reporting - A consensus document by the European Society of Cardiovascular Radiology (ESCR) [^114vLPJj]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

These devices cover a combined aortic annular diameter range of 16–30 mm, thereby allowing application in the vast majority of patients. They also have different physical properties, potential access routes for delivery, and choice of delivery systems. All these factors may play a role in the final choice of valve and delivery route.

There are currently no guidelines regarding the choice between self-expandable and balloon-expandable valves. In general, many centres acquire experience using primarily one type of valve to achieve the highest procedural success. The selection of a valve type mainly depends on the range of valve sizes available, the dimensions of the delivery device versus the native vessels, and the possible access routes.

There are some indications that a self-expandable valve may be preferable in an extremely oval-shaped annulus or a low implantation of coronary ostia. Conversely, a balloon-expandable device can be considered when patients have a dilated ascending aorta (> 43 mm) or a severely angulated aorta (aortoventricular angle > 70°). Despite the wide diffusion and favourable outcomes using the first generation of transcatheter heart valves, some limitations remain. These include, among others, the use of larger delivery systems increasing the risk for haemorrhagic and other vascular complications during endovascular transportation and a percentage of patients with annular dimensions outside the applicable range of these devices. Other complications include post-procedural paravalvular regurgitation and conduction disturbances.

### Four-dimensional flow MRI of stented versus stentless aortic valve bioprostheses [^115vBz7V]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Surgical aortic valve replacement is the standard treatment for patients with advanced aortic valve disease, including severe and symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. Nowadays, a bioprosthetic heart valve is used in more than three-quarters of surgical aortic valve replacements. Traditional bioprosthetic valves have a stented framework made of metal, with valve leaflets mounted on the stent to resemble a native tri-leaflet valve. Recently, bioprostheses have become available that replaced metal stents with polymer stents. Although the stented design facilitates easy implantation, it reduces the effective orifice area and obstructs laminar blood flow.

As an alternative, stentless bioprostheses have been introduced. Because of the absence of a space-consuming stent, stentless bioprostheses should improve haemodynamic performance compared to stented bioprostheses. Indeed, transthoracic echocardiography observations revealed lower valvular pressure gradients in stentless valves compared to stented valves. In addition, without obstruction due to space-consuming stents, flow profiles are expected to show lower flow velocities, lower wall shear stress (WSS), and less viscous energy loss (EL).

- **Wall shear stress (WSS)**: This is the tangential force of blood flow on the endothelial cells outlining the vessel wall. High aortic WSS can occur, for example, by obstructed flow and may lead to aortic dilation.

- **Energy loss**: Flow obstruction causes energy loss, and viscous EL can be used as a measure of aortic blood flow disturbance.

Evidence for a better haemodynamic performance of stentless bioprostheses is ongoing.

### Safety of MRI in patients with retained cardiac leads [^113SXsex]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Efforts to develop MRI-compatible cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) are recent, with newly approved devices allowing conditional MRI of patients with intact cardiac leads at both 1.5 T and 3 T scanners. However, there is a sizeable cohort of patients with abandoned or retained leads for whom MRI under labeling is an absolute contraindication, mostly because very little is known about the phenomenology of MRI-induced heating in the tissue in the presence of partially extracted leads.

The major challenge in quantifying implant-induced heating in this case is that the problem has a large parameter space with many variables that interact with each other. This includes the frequency and geometry of the MRI RF coil, the length, trajectory, and structure of the abandoned/retained lead, the imaging landmark, and the patient's anatomy. Such complexity precludes the application of a systematic experimental approach to infer the worst-case heating scenario.

Numerical simulations, on the other hand, provide an exquisite methodology for exploring thousands of variable combinations in a holistic manner, allowing analysis of parameter extremes outside the bounds of normal clinical practice. This work provides the first comprehensive simulation study of MRI hazards in patients with retained leads, focusing on RF heating and unintended tissue stimulation. We performed a total of 1800 simulations with ten patient-derived models of retained cardiac leads registered to body models with a range of low to high relative permittivities (εr = 40–80) and conductivities (σ = 0.1–1.0 S/m), positioned in MRI RF coils tuned to 64 and 127 MHz.

### Comparison of hemodynamics after aortic root replacement using valve-sparing or bioprosthetic valved conduit [^115bouDZ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to compare aortic hemodynamics and blood flow patterns using in-vivo four-dimensional (4D) flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients after valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR) and aortic root replacement with bioprosthetic valves (BIO-ARR).

- **Methods**: In-vivo 4D flow MRI was performed in 11 patients after VSARR (47 ± 18 years, 6 bicuspid aortic valves, 5 trileaflet aortic valves), 16 patients after BIO-ARR (52 ± 14 years), and 10 healthy controls (47 ± 16 years). Analysis included three-dimensional blood flow visualization and grading of helix flow in the ascending aorta (AAo) and arch. Peak systolic velocity was quantified in 9 analysis planes in the AAo, aortic arch, and descending aorta. Flow profile uniformity was evaluated in the aortic root and ascending aorta.

- **Results**: Peak systolic velocity (2.0 to 2.5 m/second) in the aortic root and AAo in both VSARR and BIO-ARR were elevated compared with controls (1.1 to 1.3 m/second, p < 0.005). Flow asymmetry in BIO-ARR was increased compared with VSARR, evidenced by more AAo outflow jets (9 of 16 BIO-ARR, 0 of 11 in VSARR). The BIO-ARR exhibited significantly (p < 0.001) increased helix flow in the AAo as a measure of increased flow derangement. Finally, peak systolic velocities were elevated at the aortic root for BIO-ARR (2.5 vs. 2.0 m/second, p < 0.05) but lower in the distal AAo when compared with VSARR.

- **Conclusions**: The VSARR results in improved hemodynamic outcomes when compared with BIO-ARR, as indicated by reduced peak velocities in the aortic root and less helix.

### Incremental value of PET and MRI in the evaluation of cardiovascular abnormalities [^112JmspP]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Valve abscess is considered a complication of infective endocarditis (IE), either in a native or prosthetic valve, and requires urgent surgery with debridement of all infected and necrotic tissues. Echocardiography identifies only 40% of surgically proven myocardial abscesses. On MRI, morphological and functional evaluation of the valve can be performed along with quantification of valvular lesions such as regurgitation or stenosis. Inflammation or abscess is seen as soft tissue surrounding the valve. Inflammatory tissue has high signal on T2-weighted sequences (Fig. 15a) and abscesses show fluid signal with peripheral enhancement.

- **Perivalvular abscess**: A three-chamber cine SSFP MRI image in a patient with a history of bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement who presented with acute onset chest pain shows a soft-tissue intensity lesion surrounding the aortic valve and the aortic root (arrow). Contrast was not administered due to severe renal dysfunction. Coronal FDG PET/CT in the same patient shows intense uptake along the lesion, which indicates that this is active inflammation or infection. Follow-up MRI obtained two days later showed liquefaction and formation of abscess. This was treated surgically.

PET-CT has been shown to have higher sensitivity than echocardiography in the detection of valve abscess, showing intense uptake in the affected valves (Fig. 15b). Hybrid PET/MR imaging can aid in the characterization and localization of the high uptake zone on PET due to the excellent spatial resolution capabilities of MRI.

### Detection and prediction of bioprosthetic aortic valve degeneration [^1145bhUX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Our study has several major strengths. This is a comprehensive multimodal imaging study using ultrasound, CT, and PET in patients with bioprosthetic aortic valves of varying implant ages. Uniquely, we have been able to correlate imaging findings with state-of-the-art ex vivo imaging and histological characterization of explanted valves, enabling us to validate our imaging technique and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of bioprosthetic valve degeneration. Moreover, our systematic prospective study design has allowed us to confirm the utility of baseline 18 F-fluoride PET in identifying patients at risk of developing future bioprosthetic dysfunction and overt valve failure.

- **Clinical challenge**: Although bioprosthetic valves offer important advantages over mechanical valves, they have only limited durability. Indeed, bioprosthetic valve degeneration has become a major clinical issue with the growing rate of bioprosthetic valve implantation and improved long-term patient survival. Although international guidelines recommend serial echocardiography for the detection of bioprosthetic degeneration, visualization of the valve is often poor due to acoustic artifacts from the prosthesis, limiting its sensitivity. This means that valve degeneration is frequently well advanced before clinically overt valve dysfunction is apparent. Moreover, valve obstruction often evolves rapidly, whereas the catastrophic development of valvular regurgitation due to leaflet tears is frequently unheralded and unpredictable. Novel techniques capable of detecting the earlier stages of valve degeneration are needed to address these challenges.

When managing patients with prosthetic heart valves, particularly concerning antiplatelet therapy and biological prostheses, the ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of aspirin (75–100 mg/day) for patients with a bioprosthetic TAVI who do not have other indications for oral anticoagulation.

### Magnetic resonance imaging versus echocardiography to ascertain the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy after bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement: results of the REST study [^116f73du]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2012). High credibility.

The study aimed to compare the decrease in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) versus transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) after aortic valve replacement (AVR) for severe aortic stenosis with Epic and Epic Supra stented porcine bioprostheses (St. Jude Medical, Inc, St. Paul, Minn).

This prospective multicenter study enrolled 149 patients who underwent AVR between January 2006 and February 2008. TTE and cardiac MRI measurements of LVMI were made at baseline and at 6 months of follow-up. Changes in mean pressure gradients were examined using TTE.

TTE measurements of LVMI were found to be 48% to 63% higher than MRI measurements. A decrease in LVMI from 137 ± 32 to 95 ± 16 g/m² with the Epic and from 139 ± 29 to 104 ± 28 g/m² with the Epic Supra valves was measured by TTE (P < .0001 for both comparisons). Cardiac MRI revealed decreases in LVMI from 84 ± 20 to 64 ± 12 g/m² and from 86 ± 27 to 64 ± 17 g/m² with the Epic and Epic Supra valves, respectively (P < .0001 for both comparisons). TTE revealed a significant regression of mean pressure gradients from 51.6 ± 15.3 to 15.5 ± 5.2 mm Hg with the Epic and from 46.7 ± 19.4 to 17.9 ± 12.8 mm Hg with the Epic Supra (P < .0001 for both comparisons).

A significant decrease in LVMI was measured after AVR with all sizes of both bioprosthetic models. Due to the overestimation of the decrease in LVMI by the Devereux formula, as well as the higher accuracy and reproducibility of cardiac MRI measurements, the latter should be preferred to TTE.

### The European MR safety landscape [^112dtDdv]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

This survey revealed a very heterogeneous European landscape in terms of MR safety. While the majority of institutions, at every level, have institutional guidelines to handle MR safety decisions and adverse events, coordination is lacking. This is probably not due to a lack of guidelines, as pointed out in the introduction, but rather to a lack of awareness of said guidelines, which is related to the lack of coordinated education of personnel at every level.

This uncertainty leads to potential under-providing for patients who could benefit from MR scans, as indicated by the low number of scans performed on patients with cardiac devices, and by the high number of scans refused due to uncertainty. This is based on the answers to the survey question, "Have you ever refused to perform a scan because you were unsure about the MR safety assessment of the patient in the last 12 months?"

However, the lack of scanning of patients with cardiac devices (assumed in our study to be representative of cases where safety management is complex) in outpatient facilities and smaller hospitals can also be explained by practical and economic considerations. This is due to the need for extra personnel and/or equipment, specifically, personnel able to reprogram the implanted device. In fact, a cardiologist is often responsible for the scanning of cardiac devices everywhere in Europe.

Our survey specifically focused on cardiac devices because they are widespread active implants, and there is now accepted evidence that even MR-unsafe devices can be safely scanned off-label.

### In-vivo assessment of the morphology and hemodynamic functions of the BioValsalva™ composite valve-conduit graft using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and computational modelling technology [^115GsCiS]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The evaluation of any new cardiac valvular prosthesis should go beyond the classical morbidity and mortality rates and involve hemodynamic assessment. As a proof of concept, the objective of this study was to characterize for the first time the hemodynamics and the blood flow profiles at the aortic root in patients implanted with the BioValsalva™ composite valve-conduit using comprehensive MRI and computer technologies.

- **Methods**: Four male patients implanted with BioValsalva™ and two age-matched normal controls (NC) underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Phase-contrast imaging with velocity mapping in three orthogonal directions was performed at the level of the aortic root and descending thoracic aorta. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were performed for all subjects with patient-specific flow information derived from phase-contrast MR data.

- **Results**: The maximum and mean flow rates throughout the cardiac cycle at the aortic root level were very comparable between NC and BioValsalva™ patients (541 ± 199 vs. 567 ± 75 ml/s) and (95 ± 46 vs. 96 ± 10 ml/s), respectively. The maximum velocity (cm/s) was higher in patients (314 ± 49 vs. 223 ± 20; P = 0.06) due to the relatively smaller effective orifice area (EOA), 2.99 ± 0.47 vs. 4.40 ± 0.24 cm² (P = 0.06). However, the BioValsalva™ EOA was comparable to other reported prostheses. The cross-sectional area and maximum diameter at the root were comparable between the two groups. The BioValsalva™ conduit was stiffer than the native aortic wall; compliance (mm²
- mmHg⁻¹
- 10⁻³) values were (12.6 ± 4.2 vs. 25.3 ± 0.4; P = 0.06).

### Bioprosthetic mitral valve thrombosis: The role of cardiac CT in diagnosis and guiding the management [^1114vi1z]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A patient in his 60s with a bioprosthetic aortic and mitral valve replacement presented with dyspnoea, tiredness, and dizziness two years postoperatively. Transthoracic echocardiography showed mitral valve stenosis and increased pulmonary artery pressure, suggesting bioprosthetic valve failure. Cardiac CT confirmed the diagnosis of bioprosthetic mitral valve thrombosis. Treatment with anticoagulation resulted in a remarkable improvement of the valve area and gradient, and complete resolution of the thrombus. Herein, we report a case of rare bioprosthetic mitral valve thrombosis.

### Making MRI available for patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices: Growing need and barriers to change [^116C4mc4]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Overall, MRI is an extremely safe imaging modality, with over 300 million scans performed worldwide at the time of writing. There have been reported safety events in patients who did not undergo CIED reprogramming prior to an MRI scan, most likely because radiology teams were not aware of the presence of a CIED, as it was not detected by staff or volunteered by the patient. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no deaths attributed to the performance of MRI in patients with CIEDs when performed intentionally with the correct protocols followed. In patients with CIEDs, the risk has been attributed to the interaction between the magnetic field and device components. Adequate patient monitoring and safety procedures are therefore paramount, and scanning guidelines for CIED patients have recently been published in the UK, Europe, and the United States.

### Magnetic resonance imaging in patients with implanted devices [^11187Kc3]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2012). Low credibility.

Use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging as a diagnostic technique is rapidly expanding. In parallel, the number of patients with cardiac devices is constantly growing, and many of them may be referred for MR examinations. However, implantable cardiac devices are subject to multiple effects from MR, and numerous safety issues need to be considered prior to scanning. In this review, we summarize our experience with MR imaging of patients with implantable cardiac devices and outline our safety protocol.

### Recommendations for cardiovascular magnetic resonance in adults with congenital heart disease from the respective working groups of the European Society of Cardiology [^113pPnJ8]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Congenital mitral or aortic valve disease, before and after surgery, remains primarily investigated through echocardiography. However, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can significantly contribute to measuring regurgitation and assessing myocardial or other pathology associated with heart valve disease. In patients with bicuspid aortic valve (AoV), CMR allows for the assessment of any ascending aortic ectasia, aneurysm, or dissection. Cine imaging can make regurgitant or stenotic jets visible, although appearance depends on the jet size and characteristics, as well as the relative location and orientation of the imaging slice. It is important to note that the visibility extent of a jet does not necessarily indicate the severity of a lesion.

- **Planimetry and jet assessment**: Planimetry of an orifice, or of the cross-section of the jet immediately downstream of the orifice, is feasible in some cases but not in all, depending on the jet's structure and the relative thickness and location of the imaging slice. Jet velocity mapping can help quantify stenosis, but velocities may be underestimated if the slice is not optimally located, or if the coherent core of the jet is too narrow or fragmented to include several whole voxels.

- **Quantification of regurgitation**: Quantification of regurgitation of the inflow valves is possible using ventricular stroke volume difference in the case of a single valve lesion or by subtracting the outflow volume — measured by mapping velocities through a plane transecting the relevant great artery — from the corresponding ventricular stroke volume.

CMR enhances the identification of tethering, prolapse, or failure of coaptation of all parts of the heart valves.

### Safety of magnetic resonance imaging in patients with cardiovascular devices: An American Heart Association scientific statement from the Committee on Diagnostic and Interventional Cardiac Catheterization, Council on Clinical Cardiology, and the Council on Cardiovascular Radiology and Intervention: Endorsed by the American College of Cardiology Foundation, the North American Society for Cardiac Imaging, and the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^114WNyZY]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Advances in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging over the past two decades have led to MR becoming an increasingly attractive imaging modality. With the growing number of patients treated with permanent implanted or temporary cardiovascular devices, it is becoming ever more important to clarify safety issues regarding MR examinations for patients with these devices. Extensive, although not complete, ex vivo, animal, and clinical data are available from which to generate recommendations regarding the safe performance of MR examinations in patients with cardiovascular devices, as well as to ascertain caveats and contraindications regarding MR examination for such patients.

Safe MR imaging involves a careful initial patient screening, accurate determination of the permanent implanted or temporary cardiovascular device and its properties, a thoughtful analysis of the risks and benefits of performing the examination at that time, and, when indicated, appropriate physician management and supervision. This scientific statement is intended to summarize and clarify issues regarding the safety of MR imaging in patients with cardiovascular devices.

### Four-dimensional flow MRI of stented versus stentless aortic valve bioprostheses [^1176MQ3A]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate aortic velocity, wall shear stress (WSS), and viscous energy loss (EL) of stented and stentless bioprostheses using 4D flow MRI one year after surgical aortic valve replacement.

- **Methods**: For this cross-sectional study, 28 patients with either stented (n = 14) or stentless (n = 14) bioprostheses underwent non-contrast-enhanced 4D-flow MRI at 1.5 T. Analyses included a comparison of velocity, WSS, and EL in the ascending aorta during peak systole for both spatially averaged values and local differences using per-voxel analysis.

- **Results**: No significant differences were found in peak and mean velocity (stented vs. stentless: 2.45 m/s vs. 2.11 m/s, p = 0.09 and 0.60 m/s vs. 0.62 m/s, p = 0.89), WSS (0.60 Pa vs. 0.59 Pa, p = 0.55), and EL (10.17 mW vs. 7.82 mW, p = 0.10). Per-voxel analysis revealed significantly higher central lumen velocity, and lower outer lumen velocity, WSS, and EL for stentless versus stented prostheses.

- **Conclusion**: One year after aortic valve implantation with stented and stentless bioprostheses, velocity, WSS, and EL were comparable when assessed for averaged values in the ascending aorta. However, the flow profile described with local analysis for stentless prostheses is potentially favorable, with a significantly higher central velocity profile and lower values for outer lumen velocity, WSS, and EL.

- **Key Points**
- Stentless bioprostheses can be implanted instead of stented aortic valve bioprostheses.
- Hemodynamic performance of valve prosthesis can be assessed using 4D flow MRI.

### Safety of magnetic resonance imaging immediately following Palmaz stent implant: A report of three cases [^113gk2aj]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2001). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide important information on patients with congenital heart defects. There is some reluctance to perform MRI acutely following intravascular stent implants due to concerns of distortion or movement of the stent in the magnetic field. We report on three patients who underwent MRI evaluation less than 14 days following Palmaz stent implant in the pulmonary arteries and superior vena cava, with no acute adverse outcomes or long-term problems.

### Magnetic resonance imaging safety in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices [^116vFteW]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2022). High credibility.

High-strength magnetic and electric fields used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) render images with unmatched soft tissue contrast. These imaging attributes have made MRI an increasingly preferred diagnostic tool in many medical conditions. Initially, there was substantial concern regarding the safety of performing these imaging studies in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), which have the potential to be affected by the intense electric and magnetic fields of the MRI.

More recently, there has been increasing evidence that MRI can be performed safely in patients with devices that have not been specifically labeled by regulatory agencies for use in an MRI environment (MRI non-conditional devices), which has allowed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to start providing reimbursement for MRIs of patients with MRI non-conditional devices. For CMS to reimburse scans, a rigorous protocol must be followed, which recognizes that there are still potential adverse effects that can be mitigated by appropriate procedures.

In this review, we will survey the initial experiences and efforts to understand the magnitude of risk for device malfunction and harm, as well as efforts to minimize the potential risks of MRI effects on devices and leads, such as heating, device movement, lead dislodgement, and device malfunction. The latter includes the inhibition of pacing and generation of arrhythmias.
