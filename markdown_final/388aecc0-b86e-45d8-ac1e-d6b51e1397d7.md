## Question

Glucosamine benefits and risks. Also how does it work

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the benefits, risks, and mechanism of action of glucosamine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic identity and pharmacokinetics to anchor plausibility. Then, I should review the clinical efficacy data by joint and formulation, separating signal from noise. Next, I will examine safety, including glucose metabolism and drug interactions. After that, I should reconcile guideline positions and cost considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation and outline knowledge gaps that could change practice, making sure I double-check areas of controversy as I go.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic identity and basic pharmacokinetics. Glucosamine is an amino sugar and a precursor for glycosaminoglycans in cartilage; oral formulations include sulfate and hydrochloride salts, with the sulfate salt historically linked to more consistent clinical effects in some trials, though this remains debated and formulation-specific data matter for interpretation [^112V1uFg] [^111SjBbe]. Wait, let me verify bioavailability: a human PK study of crystalline glucosamine sulfate shows linear absorption up to 1500 mg/day, achieving micromolar plasma concentrations at steady state with an estimated half-life around 15 hours, supporting once-daily dosing and biologic plausibility at standard doses [^114WhETC]. Hold on, I should also note that endogenous plasma glucosamine is detectable at low levels, which complicates interpretation of supplement exposure and potential tissue effects [^114WhETC].

> Now, I will examine the clinical efficacy landscape, but I need to be careful to separate high-quality evidence from lower-quality signals. Large, methodologically rigorous trials and network meta-analyses consistently show no clinically meaningful benefit of glucosamine for pain or function in knee and hip osteoarthritis, with pooled differences versus placebo around 0.3–0.5 cm on a 10 cm VAS, below the prespecified minimal clinically important difference of 0.9 cm, and no significant effect on radiographic progression [^113uiTtm] [^116CEGrx] [^1148EVrE]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially recalled a larger pooled effect, but I should correct that: the BMJ network meta-analyses repeatedly found small, statistically detectable effects that are not clinically relevant, and industry-independent trials show even smaller effects than industry-sponsored trials, reinforcing the lack of robust efficacy [^113uiTtm] [^112LEWr3]. The GAIT trial similarly found no overall benefit, with a possible signal only in the subgroup with moderate-to-severe pain receiving the combination, which warrants caution as a post hoc observation [^1148WTrD].

> But wait, what if a specific formulation changes the story? Let me consider the Rotta preparation of glucosamine sulfate. Some earlier meta-analyses and reviews suggested clinically relevant benefits for pain and possibly structure modification with this product, including a 3-year RCT showing slowed joint space narrowing, whereas non-Rotta preparations generally fail to replicate these effects, indicating potential product-specific pharmacokinetic or manufacturing factors [^112iHzvz] [^112Pf2uP]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: more recent high-quality syntheses still conclude that even glucosamine sulfate shows, at best, small effects that do not meet clinical relevance thresholds, so any product-specific benefit remains unproven in contemporary, large-scale, independent trials [^113uiTtm] [^116CEGrx]. I should double-check that guideline bodies have largely moved away from endorsing glucosamine even for knee OA, aligning with this interpretation [^115BKdre].

> Next, I should review data by joint, because effects may vary anatomically. For knee OA, evidence is most abundant but remains mixed and generally negative for clinically meaningful benefit in high-quality trials, with some older or lower-quality studies suggesting symptomatic improvement, which likely reflects bias and placebo effects rather than true efficacy [^113uiTtm] [^1148WTrD]. For hip OA, a 2-year randomized trial found no benefit of glucosamine sulfate on symptoms or radiographic progression, and guideline panels consistently advise against its use in hip OA, so I should be cautious not to extrapolate any knee signals to the hip [^116pqwJq] [^115BKdre]. For hand OA, evidence is sparse and not supportive, and guidelines similarly recommend against glucosamine in hand OA, so routine use there is not justified [^115o2Eud].

> I will now examine safety, and I need to ensure I separate mechanistic concerns from clinical outcomes. Mechanistically, glucosamine can enter the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, which in animal models can induce insulin resistance; however, human data are mixed, with some studies showing transient reductions in insulin sensitivity in predisposed individuals, while others, including the large GAIT trial and long-term trials, show no clinically significant effects on fasting glucose or HbA1c in people with or at risk for diabetes [^117TFLYp] [^114XKaBZ] [^1148WTrD]. Wait, let me verify a potential inconsistency: one review cites a 3-year trial suggesting a slight glucose-lowering effect, but I should confirm the source and context; given the broader neutral signal in controlled studies, a conservative approach is prudent in patients with diabetes or prediabetes, with monitoring if used [^115QfZYL] [^111hFRX2]. Clinically, adverse events are generally mild and similar to placebo, including gastrointestinal symptoms and rare allergic reactions, with no clear increase in serious adverse events in pooled analyses [^112c49PL] [^114naGLQ].

> I should confirm potential drug interactions and special cautions. Theoretical concerns about warfarin interaction have been described, but robust clinical evidence is limited; nonetheless, given INR lability with supplements, caution and INR monitoring are reasonable if a patient on warfarin elects to use glucosamine, and shellfish allergy is a consideration for some formulations, though many products are now shellfish-free [^114naGLQ]. Hold on, I should verify that no major supplement–drug interaction signals have emerged in large trials; indeed, GAIT and other large studies did not report significant safety signals beyond mild GI effects, supporting a generally favorable tolerability profile when used at standard doses [^1148WTrD] [^112c49PL].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my synthesis aligns with consensus. The 2019 ACR/Arthritis Foundation guidelines strongly recommend against glucosamine for hand, hip, and knee OA due to lack of efficacy, and the VA/DoD guideline concludes there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against supplements and advises clinicians not to prescribe glucosamine or chondroitin for hip/knee OA, reflecting low confidence in the evidence base [^115BKdre] [^117GaWm7]. OARSI places glucosamine in the "uncertain" category for knee OA, whereas ESCEO gives a conditional recommendation for pharmaceutical-grade crystalline glucosamine sulfate, highlighting the ongoing controversy and the potential influence of product quality and regulatory status on outcomes and recommendations [^114DSvSn] [^11219DcZ]. I need to ensure I communicate that these differences reflect heterogeneity in evidence and guideline methodology, not proof of efficacy.

> Let me consider cost and access, because these influence shared decision-making. Glucosamine is widely available OTC in the US, with typical doses of 1500 mg/day, and costs are generally modest but paid out-of-pocket; given the lack of robust efficacy, payers and health systems often do not cover these products, and clinicians should discuss this financial reality with patients who perceive benefit, to avoid prolonged use without expected returns [^114naGLQ] [^113uiTtm]. Hold on, I should verify that the small effects seen in some analyses would not justify coverage even if statistically significant; the BMJ analyses explicitly argue that observed differences are too small to be clinically actionable, reinforcing a conservative stance on coverage and new prescriptions [^113uiTtm] [^116CEGrx].

> I will now examine the mechanism of action, but I should be careful to distinguish hypothesis from established clinical effect. Proposed mechanisms include provision of cartilage matrix precursors, anti-inflammatory effects via NF-κB modulation, and influences on chondrocyte metabolism; however, human data linking these mechanisms to clinically meaningful joint outcomes remain limited, and the low bioavailability of some formulations raises questions about direct chondral effects at therapeutic doses [^114bF7pq] [^1178uafn]. Wait, let me verify whether any human data tie mechanism to outcomes: while in vitro and animal data suggest biologic activity, large clinical trials have not reliably translated these into consistent symptom or structure modification, so mechanism remains plausible but unproven as a driver of clinical benefit in OA [^113uiTtm] [^116CEGrx].

> But wait, what about observational signals outside OA that might influence risk–benefit discussions? Large prospective cohorts suggest habitual glucosamine use is associated with lower risks of cardiovascular disease and total mortality, and a recent analysis links glucosamine use with fewer microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes, though these are observational and susceptible to confounding by healthy lifestyle and supplement-use patterns, so causality remains unproven [^11471MBq] [^1123jZnB] [^113H75Bd]. Hold on, I should verify limitations: these studies lack dose, duration, and formulation details, and cannot establish causation, so they should not override trial-based conclusions on OA efficacy but may inform hypothesis generation for future trials [^114XKaBZ] [^113H75Bd].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that my practical recommendation aligns with evidence and patient preferences. For patients with symptomatic knee, hip, or hand OA, I do not recommend routine glucosamine use given the absence of clinically meaningful benefit in high-quality trials and guideline recommendations against its use; however, if a patient is already taking a pharmaceutical-grade glucosamine sulfate product, perceives benefit, and accepts the cost, a time-limited trial with predefined stop criteria is reasonable, with counseling about the likely placebo response and the lack of proven disease-modifying effect [^115BKdre] [^113uiTtm]. I need to ensure safety is addressed: in patients with diabetes or on warfarin, monitor glucose or INR if glucosamine is used, and reassess at 6–12 weeks for efficacy and tolerability to avoid prolonged ineffective therapy [^114naGLQ] [^113DNbRg].

> Finally, I should review knowledge gaps and future directions, and I need to ensure I am not overstating what is known. Definitive, large, independently funded trials using standardized, high-quality preparations and clinically relevant populations could still clarify whether a subset or a specific formulation has reproducible benefit, and ongoing work on the gut–joint axis may illuminate indirect mechanisms whereby oral joint-targeted supplements could modulate inflammation and symptoms, though this remains speculative at present [^116CLwxX] [^114hG9zo]. Hold on, I should verify that current guideline panels acknowledge uncertainty while advising against routine use; yes, both ACR and VA/DoD emphasize the lack of efficacy and call for higher-quality, less biased trials before reconsidering recommendations, which frames future research priorities [^115BKdre] [^117GaWm7].

Glucosamine is a dietary supplement used for osteoarthritis, with **modest, inconsistent benefits** for pain and function and **no clear disease-modifying effect** [^113uiTtm] [^116CEGrx]. It is **generally safe**, with mild GI effects and rare hypersensitivity; concerns about glucose metabolism are not supported in most clinical data, though caution is reasonable in diabetes [^113DNbRg] [^114naGLQ]. Major guidelines (ACR, AAOS, VA/DoD) **do not recommend routine use** due to limited efficacy, but a short trial may be reasonable for some patients [^115BKdre] [^117GaWm7] [^1175R7Qv]. Mechanistically, glucosamine may reduce inflammation and support cartilage matrix, but clinical relevance remains uncertain [^114bF7pq].

---

## Mechanism of action

Glucosamine is an amino sugar and a precursor to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are essential components of cartilage and synovial fluid. Proposed mechanisms include:

- **Cartilage matrix synthesis**: Stimulates chondrocytes to produce proteoglycans and collagen, potentially aiding cartilage repair [^notfound].

- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: May inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1β, TNF-α) and reduce nitric oxide synthesis, potentially decreasing joint inflammation [^115oWPiC].

- **Hexosamine pathway modulation**: Alters protein glycosylation, which may influence cellular metabolism and inflammation, though clinical relevance is unclear [^113DNbRg].

---

## Clinical benefits

### Symptomatic relief

Evidence for pain and function improvement is **mixed and generally modest**:

- **Knee osteoarthritis**: Some trials and meta-analyses report small improvements in pain and function, particularly with glucosamine sulfate, but results are inconsistent [^112iHzvz] [^113uiTtm].

- **Hip osteoarthritis**: Evidence is limited and generally negative, with no significant benefit over placebo [^116pqwJq].

- **Hand osteoarthritis**: Minimal evidence; no consistent benefit demonstrated [^113iFgMj].

---

### Disease modification

Evidence for structural benefits is limited and controversial. Some studies suggest **potential slowing of joint space narrowing**, particularly with long-term glucosamine sulfate use, but these findings are not consistently replicated [^112Pf2uP] [^114E8iqj]. Overall, there is **no definitive evidence** that glucosamine significantly alters disease progression [^113uiTtm].

---

## Clinical risks and adverse effects

Glucosamine is **generally well tolerated**, with mild gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain) as the most common adverse effects. Rare hypersensitivity reactions, including allergic reactions and exacerbation of asthma, have been reported, particularly in individuals with shellfish allergies [^114naGLQ]. Concerns about impaired glucose metabolism stem from animal data; however, human studies show **no consistent effect on insulin sensitivity or glycemic control**, though caution is advised in patients with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance [^113DNbRg] [^111hFRX2]. No significant drug interactions have been reported, but caution is advised with anticoagulants due to potential additive effects [^114naGLQ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines provide **cautious or negative recommendations**:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2019 | Strongly recommends against glucosamine for knee, hip, and hand osteoarthritis due to lack of efficacy [^115BKdre] |
| American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) 2022 | Insufficient evidence to support routine use; may be considered for mild-to-moderate knee OA with limited evidence [^111c2jsC] [^113MfTnZ] |
| VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline 2020 | Insufficient evidence to recommend for or against use; clinicians should not prescribe glucosamine [^117GaWm7] |

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

- **Mild-to-moderate knee OA**: A short-term trial (6–12 weeks) may be reasonable for patients seeking alternatives to NSAIDs, with discontinuation if no benefit is observed [^114naGLQ].

- **Severe OA or advanced disease**: Unlikely to benefit significantly; not recommended as primary therapy [^115BKdre].

- **Patients with shellfish allergy**: Avoid glucosamine due to potential allergic reactions [^notfound].

- **Patients with diabetes**: Use with caution and monitor glucose levels, although evidence for adverse glycemic effects is limited [^113DNbRg].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Glucosamine may offer modest symptomatic relief in some patients with mild-to-moderate knee osteoarthritis, but **evidence is inconsistent and generally modest**. It is **unlikely to provide significant benefit** in severe OA or in hip and hand OA. It is **generally safe**, with minimal adverse effects and no consistent evidence of impaired glucose metabolism. Major guidelines **do not recommend routine use**, but a short-term trial may be reasonable for select patients.

### Chondroprotection and the prevention of osteoarthritis progression of the knee: a systematic review of treatment agents [^117XdZEC]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Structure-modifying medications or nutraceuticals may be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis. This study identified 12 treatments that may possess chondroprotective properties: oral glucosamine; chondroitin; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); polyunsaturated fatty acids; S-adenosylmethionine; avocado and soybean unsaponifiable fractions; methylsulfonylmethane; vitamins C, D, and E; intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid; and platelet-rich plasma (PRP).

Purpose

To perform a systematic review of randomized controlled trials for the effectiveness of each agent in preserving articular cartilage of the knee and delaying the progression of osteoarthritis.

Study Design

Systematic review; Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

A literature search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Searches were performed using "treatment", "osteoarthritis", and "knee" as keywords. Selection criteria included randomized controlled trials of ≥ 12 months, with a placebo control, measuring radiographic changes in joint space width, cartilage volume, or radiographic progression of osteoarthritis. The primary outcome was changes in joint integrity measures.

Results

A total of 3514 studies were identified from the initial search, 13 of which met inclusion criteria. Treatment with chondroitin sulfate showed a significant reduction in cartilage loss in 3 of 4 studies identified compared with placebo. Two of 3 trials identified for glucosamine also reported significant structural effects relative to placebo. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid was effective in lowering the rate of cartilage loss in only 1 of 3 studies identified versus placebo. Of the 6 studies identified for NSAIDs, vitamin E, and vitamin D, none showed any structural effect compared with placebo. No studies were found that met the inclusion criteria for polyunsaturated fatty acids, S-adenosylmethionine, avocado and soybean unsaponifiable fractions, methylsulfonylmethane, vitamin C, or PRP.

Conclusion

For patients with or at risk for osteoarthritis, the use of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate may serve as a nonoperative means to protect joint cartilage and delay osteoarthritis progression. Hyaluronic acid injections showed variable efficacy, while NSAIDs and vitamins E and D showed no effect on osteoarthritis progression. The other agents evaluated had no evidence in the literature to support or refute their use for chondroprotection.

### Association of habitual glucosamine use with risk of cardiovascular disease: prospective study in UK biobank [^115oWPiC]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Glucosamine is a non-vitamin, non-mineral supplement widely used to relieve osteoarthritis and joint pain. Glucosamine is closely regulated in most European countries, where it is only sold with a prescription. However, in other countries such as the United States and Australia, it is a popular dietary supplement and approximately 20% of adults consume it daily.

The effectiveness of glucosamine in patients with osteoarthritis and joint pain continues to be debated. Emerging evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that glucosamine could have a role in preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD)and reducing mortality. A previous animal study reported that glucosamine extended life span by mimicking a low carbohydrate diet, and studies in humans have consistently shown the protective effect of a low carbohydrate diet on the development of CVD. Other animal studies have reported that the anti-inflammatory properties of glucosamine might have a preventive role in atherosclerosis development.

In this prospective cohort study, we examined the association between habitual glucosamine supplement use and risk of CVD events (CVD death, coronary heart disease (CHD), and stroke) in nearly half a million adults in the UK Biobank. We also analyzed potential effect modification by other known risk factors for CVD.

### Meta-analysis: chondroitin for osteoarthritis of the knee or hip [^11739V7C]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Previous meta-analyses described moderate to large benefits of chondroitin in patients with osteoarthritis. However, recent large-scale trials did not find evidence of an effect.

Purpose

To determine the effects of chondroitin on pain in patients with osteoarthritis.

Data Sources

The authors searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1970 to 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to 2006), EMBASE (1980 to 2006), CINAHL (1970 to 2006), and conference proceedings; checked reference lists; and contacted authors. The last update of searches was performed on 30 November 2006.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they were randomized or quasi-randomized, controlled trials that compared chondroitin with placebo or with no treatment in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. There were no language restrictions.

Data Extraction

The authors extracted data in duplicate. Effect sizes were calculated from the differences in means of pain-related outcomes between treatment and control groups at the end of the trial, divided by the pooled SD. Trials were combined by using random-effects meta-analysis.

Data Synthesis

20 trials (3846 patients) contributed to the meta-analysis, which revealed a high degree of heterogeneity among the trials (I² = 92%). Small trials, trials with unclear concealment of allocation, and trials that were not analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle showed larger effects in favor of chondroitin than did the remaining trials. When the authors restricted the analysis to the 3 trials with large sample sizes and an intention-to-treat analysis, 40% of patients were included. This resulted in an effect size of -0.03 (95% CI, -0.13 to 0.07; I² = 0%) and corresponded to a difference of 0.6 mm on a 10-cm visual analogue scale. A meta-analysis of 12 trials showed a pooled relative risk of 0.99 (CI, 0.76 to 1.31) for any adverse event.

Limitations

For 9 trials, the authors had to use approximations to calculate effect sizes. Trial quality was generally low, heterogeneity among the trials made initial interpretation of results difficult, and exploring sources of heterogeneity in meta-regression and stratified analyses may be unreliable.

Conclusions

Large-scale, methodologically sound trials indicate that the symptomatic benefit of chondroitin is minimal or nonexistent. Use of chondroitin in routine clinical practice should therefore be discouraged.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^112keJWn]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Study characteristics

The 10 included trials had randomly allocated a total of 3803 patients to either of the experimental interventions or placebo. Figure 1 shows the network of interventions. Five trials (1104 randomised patients) compared glucosamine sulphate with placebo. In another placebo controlled trial (205 patients), the investigators were forced to change from glucosamine sulphate to glucosamine hydrochloride after 80% of the patients had been treated with glucosamine sulphate because the manufacturer of glucosamine sulphate declined to supply matching placebos. Three trials (1229 patients) compared chondroitin sulphate with placebo, and one trial (1265 patients) compared glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin sulphate, and their combination with placebo. Tables 1 and 2 show the characteristics of trials.

Six trials described adequate concealment of allocation, nine trials reported adequate blinding of patients, and in one trialit was unclear. Seven trials performed an intention to treat analysis. Eight trials included patients with osteoarthritis of the knee only, one trial included patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, and one trial included patients with osteoarthritis of the hip only. All except three trialswere funded by manufacturers of supplements. In eight trials, experimental preparations had undergone quality control to ensure adequate concentrations of glucosamine or chondroitin, and in two trialsit was unclear. The average age of patients was 58–66 (median 62), and the percentage of women ranged from 27% to 86% (median 68%). The average duration of symptoms ranged from a minimum of six months to more than 10 years. All treatments were administered on consecutive days in all trials. Duration of follow-up varied substantially between trials, from one monthto 36 months, and the number of follow-up visits from oneto 12(table 1).

### Hip pain and mobility deficits-hip osteoarthritis: revision 2017 [^114Wq7uc]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis — alternative/complementary medication: The guideline notes "some evidence to support the short-term use of injectable viscosupplementation with hyaluronic acid into the hip joint of patients with hip OA", yet also that "a recent published meta-analysis suggests the benefit of hyaluronan for the treatment of hip OA, but so far it is only approved by the Federal Drug Administration for the knee. More controlled studies are needed to show its effectiveness". An evidence update reports that Rozendaal et al "studied 222 patients… treated with glucosamine or placebo once daily for 2 years", with "no differences… after 2 years in joint space on radiographs or in WOMAC physical function score", while a meta-analysis by Wandel et al found "pain was not improved, nor did glucosamine have an effect on joint space narrowing". It further states, "The efficacy of intra-articular hyaluronic acid in treating hip OA has still not been established in high-quality randomized clinical trials (RCTs)", and the 2017 summary concludes, "There is insufficient evidence to support the use of supplements such as glucosamine, chondroitin, hyaluronic acid (injectable), or similar substances for the treatment of hip OA".

### Nutritional factors and osteoarthritis: recent developments [^115dDX5m]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The role of nutrition and nutritional supplements in the development and progression of osteoarthritis is now a topic of considerable public, industry, and academic interest. This review focuses on how the evidence for a role of nutritional factors or nutritional supplements in the management of knee osteoarthritis has been changed by recent research.

Recent Findings

Recent studies include clinical trials of weight loss and exercise as interventions for osteoarthritis of the knee, the elucidation of mechanisms of oxidative stress on the chondrocyte genome, further study of vitamin C supplementation in an animal with spontaneous osteoarthritis, and further clinical and pharmacodynamic evaluations of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate. Perplexing findings among these studies include the deleterious effects of vitamin C on osteoarthritis in the Hartley guinea pig, the low levels of glucosamine achieved in serum after an oral dose, recent negative clinical studies of glucosamine, and the heterogeneity of results among glucosamine trials.

Summary

With an intensification of research in this field come new clinical and basic science data, sometimes with surprising results. These confirm the considerable potential for a role of nutritional interventions for osteoarthritis, but they emphasize the need for systematic scientific evaluation of the claims made for such products.

### Long-term effects of glucosamine sulphate on osteoarthritis progression: a randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^112Pf2uP]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Treatment of osteoarthritis is usually limited to short-term symptom control. We assessed the effects of the specific drug glucosamine sulphate on the long-term progression of osteoarthritis joint structure changes and symptoms.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind placebo controlled trial, in which 212 patients with knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned 1500 mg sulphate oral glucosamine or placebo once daily for 3 years. Weightbearing, anteroposterior radiographs of each knee in full extension were taken at enrolment and after 1 and 3 years. Mean joint-space width of the medial compartment of the tibiofemoral joint was assessed by digital image analysis, whereas minimum joint-space width — ie, at the narrowest point — was measured by visual inspection with a magnifying lens. Symptoms were scored by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) osteoarthritis index.

Findings

The 106 patients on placebo had a progressive joint-space narrowing, with a mean joint-space loss after 3 years of -0.31 mm (95% CI -0.48 to -0.13). There was no significant joint-space loss in the 106 patients on glucosamine sulphate: -0.06 mm (-0.22 to 0.09). Similar results were reported with minimum joint-space narrowing. As assessed by WOMAC scores, symptoms worsened slightly in patients on placebo compared with the improvement observed after treatment with glucosamine sulphate. There were no differences in safety or reasons for early withdrawal between the treatment and placebo groups.

Interpretation

The long-term combined structure-modifying and symptom-modifying effects of gluosamine sulphate suggest that it could be a disease modifying agent in osteoarthritis.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^115MNq6y]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Finally, we performed pairwise meta-analyses with random effects at the level of trials and time points, as well as a simpler network meta-analysis including only one treatment effect per trial (absolute pain intensity at the longest follow-up available). Convergence of Markov chains was deemed to be achieved if plots of the Gelman-Rubin statistics indicated that widths of pooled runs and individual runs stabilised around the same value and their ratio around one. Accordingly, all analyses are based on 150 000 iterations, of which the first 50 000 were discarded as burn-in period. We used Stata (Stata Statistical Software: release 10; StataCorp LP 2005, College Station, TX) and WinBUGS (version 1.4; MRC Biostatistics Unit 2007, Cambridge, UK) for all analyses.

### Association of habitual glucosamine use with risk of microvascular complications among individuals with type 2 diabetes: a prospective cohort study in UK biobank [^112ytVVs]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study indicates that glucosamine use may help prevent nephropathy, although its effects on retinopathy and neuropathy appear less pronounced. This can be explained by inherent differences in the etiology of each microvascular complication that may influence the range of mechanisms potentially targeted by glucosamine. For instance, hyperglycemia plays a primary role in the onset of diabetic retinopathy, while nephropathy risk is influenced by hyperglycemia in combination with other metabolic factors such as obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Glucosamine has been shown to improve several of these metabolic risk factors, which may explain the more substantial risk reduction observed for kidney disease. The absence of a statistically significant association between glucosamine use and neuropathy may be result from the small number of participants who developed neuropathy.

The main strengths of this study are its use of prospective cohort data with a substantial sample size, the extensive information available on covariates, and the robust, consistent results across multiple sensitivity analyses. However, there are some limitations in our study. First, the UK Biobank did not collect comprehensive information regarding glucosamine use, such as dose and duration of use. And differences in nutrient intake doses can produce very different or even conflicting results. Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate this association. Second, the UK Biobank did not collect data on the side effects associated with glucosamine use. Nonetheless, glucosamine is considered one of the safest supplements for osteoarthritis, with only minimal side effects reported, including rare allergic reactions, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and heartburn. While some earlier studies suggested that glucosamine might impair glucose tolerance in those at high risk for diabetes, clinical trials have demonstrated that glucosamine does not affect glucose metabolism or lipid profiles at any oral dose in either healthy individuals or diabetes patients. Third, in an observational study, distinguishing the impact of a healthy lifestyle from the habitual use of supplements can be challenging. In this context, regular glucosamine use may serve as an indicator of a healthier lifestyle among participants. Consequently, we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed inverse associations may be influenced by healthy lifestyle factors among those using glucosamine, despite our thorough adjustments for potential confounders, including obesity, physical activity, smoking, and diet, in the analyses. In addition, microvascular complications were diagnosed based on cumulative hospital records and linkage to national death registries using ICD codes. Consequently, any misclassification of patients with these complications could dilute the study results, potentially underestimating the true strength of the association. Furthermore, due to the observational study design, residual or unknown confounders could not be excluded, although we endeavored to adjust for potential confounders. Finally, the UK Biobank study is known to have a selection bias toward healthy volunteers with healthy lifestyles and lower rates of diabetes; therefore, the findings may not be generalizable to other populations. Future research could strengthen these findings through randomized controlled trials to better assess the associations in more diverse and representative cohorts.

### Risks and benefits of multiple sclerosis therapies: need for continual assessment? [^113ciQew]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to describe and discuss the ongoing debate on how to balance an increase in clinical efficacy against a heightened risk of developing serious side-effects, as has surfaced recently with some novel therapies for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.

Recent Findings

New therapies are emerging that differ with regard to their mechanism of action, their mode of administration, their side-effect profile and the clinical benefits that they offer to patients in comparison with established therapeutic modalities in multiple sclerosis. Treating physicians will need to make choices on the best treatments for their patients on the basis of limited experience. This process requires optimal assessment of risks and benefits.

Summary

Careful assessment of the risk-benefit profile of the various options may allow treatment choices and perhaps ensure that patients obtain the most benefit from treatment without being exposed to unnecessary risk.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^116CEGrx]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of glucosamine, chondroitin, or the two in combination on joint pain and on radiological progression of disease in osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Design Network meta-analysis. Direct comparisons within trials were combined with indirect evidence from other trials by using a Bayesian model that allowed the synthesis of multiple time points.

Main Outcome Measure

Pain intensity. Secondary outcome was change in minimal width of joint space. The minimal clinically important difference between preparations and placebo was prespecified at -0.9 cm on a 10 cm visual analogue scale.

Data Sources

Electronic databases and conference proceedings from inception to June 2009, expert contact, relevant websites. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Large scale randomised controlled trials in more than 200 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip that compared glucosamine, chondroitin, or their combination with placebo or head to head. Results 10 trials in 3803 patients were included. On a 10 cm visual analogue scale the overall difference in pain intensity compared with placebo was -0.4 cm (95% credible interval -0.7 to -0.1 cm) for glucosamine, -0.3 cm (-0.7 to 0.0 cm) for chondroitin, and -0.5 cm (-0.9 to 0.0 cm) for the combination. For none of the estimates did the 95% credible intervals cross the boundary of the minimal clinically important difference. Industry independent trials showed smaller effects than commercially funded trials (P = 0.02 for interaction). The differences in changes in minimal width of joint space were all minute, with 95% credible intervals overlapping zero. Conclusions Compared with placebo, glucosamine, chondroitin, and their combination do not reduce joint pain or have an impact on narrowing of joint space. Health authorities and health insurers should not cover the costs of these preparations, and new prescriptions to patients who have not received treatment should be discouraged.

### Effects of diet on the outcomes of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs): systematic review and meta-analyses informing the 2021 EULAR recommendations for lifestyle improvements in people with RMDs [^115pXu9P]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A EULAR taskforce was convened to develop recommendations for lifestyle behaviours in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). In this paper, the literature on the effect of diet on the progression of RMDs is reviewed.

Methods

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were performed of studies related to diet and disease outcomes in seven RMDs: osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus, axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic sclerosis and gout. In the first phase, existing relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses, published from 2013 to 2018, were identified. In the second phase, the review was expanded to include published original studies on diet in RMDs, with no restriction on publication date. Systematic reviews or original studies were included if they assessed a dietary exposure in one of the above RMDs, and reported results regarding progression of disease (eg, pain, function, joint damage).

Results

In total, 24 systematic reviews and 150 original articles were included. Many dietary exposures have been studied (n = 83), although the majority of studies addressed people with OA and RA. Most dietary exposures were assessed by relatively few studies. Exposures that have been assessed by multiple, well conducted studies (eg, OA: vitamin D, chondroitin, glucosamine; RA: omega-3) were classified as moderate evidence of small effects on disease progression.

Conclusion

The current literature suggests that there is moderate evidence for a small benefit for certain dietary components. High-level evidence of clinically meaningful effect sizes from individual dietary exposures on outcomes in RMDs is missing.

### Effect of glucosamine sulfate on hip osteoarthritis: a randomized trial [^116pqwJq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of glucosamine sulfate as a symptom and disease modifier for osteoarthritis is still under debate.

Objective

To assess whether glucosamine sulfate has an effect on the symptoms and structural progression of hip osteoarthritis during 2 years of treatment.

Design

Randomized, controlled trial.

Setting

Primary care in the Netherlands.

Patients

222 patients with hip osteoarthritis who were recruited by their general practitioner. Patients were eligible if they met the American College of Rheumatology clinical criteria for hip osteoarthritis.

Intervention

2 years of treatment with 1500 mg of oral glucosamine sulfate or placebo once daily.

Measurements

Primary outcome measures were Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) pain and function subscales over 24 months and joint space narrowing after 24 months. The main secondary outcome measures were WOMAC pain, function, and stiffness after 3, 12, and 24 months.

Results

At baseline, both groups were similar in demographic and clinical variables. Overall, WOMAC pain did not differ (mean difference [glucosamine sulfate minus placebo], -1.54 [95% CI, -5.43 to 2.36]), nor did WOMAC function (mean difference, -2.01 [CI, -5.38 to 1.36]). Joint space narrowing also did not differ after 24 months (mean difference, -0.029 [CI, -0.122 to 0.064]). Only 1 of the sensitivity analyses, based on extreme assumptions regarding missing assessments due to total hip replacement, provided results consistent with a glucosamine effect.

Limitations

Twenty patients had total hip replacement during the trial. Half of the patients had a Kellgren and Lawrence score of 1.

Conclusion

Glucosamine sulfate was no better than placebo in reducing symptoms and progression of hip osteoarthritis. International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number: ISRCTN54513166.

### Clinical review of chondroitin sulfate in osteoarthritis [^115fNdPT]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2008). Low credibility.

Symptomatic slow-acting drugs for the treatment of osteoarthritis (SYSADOA; OA) are compounds which are prescribed as drugs in European countries since many years, whereas they are sold as nutraceuticals in USA. In Europe, the publication of the EULAR Recommendations for the Treatment of Knee OA in 2003 has listed oral chondroitin sulfate (CS) as evidence 1A and strength of recommendation A which represents the highest level for a therapeutic strategy. Symptomatic slow-acting drugs are intended to be used as ground therapy for OA; these compounds are not rapidly acting agents such as Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), and their clinical efficacy on algo-functional symptoms can only be demonstrated after a couple of weeks of regular intake. Interestingly, once the administration is stopped, they do show carry-over effects of various durations, from about 3 months with the oral formulations to 6–9 months with intra-articular formulations. The main rationale behind the use of the SYSADOA therapeutic class is the reduction of NSAIDs in the overall drug management of OA disease and therefore consequently to limit the very significant risks of upper Gastro-intestinal (GI) tract erosions, ulcers with bleeding and/or deleterious renal effects in elderly patients. The evidence for clinical efficacy of oral CS as a drug able to significantly improve the algo-functional symptoms of OA disease does come from a set of randomized clinical studies published a couple of years ago. Indeed, it was demonstrated that the drug was effective in knee and finger OA, whereas previous data suggested that hip OA patients could also benefit from it. In addition, oral CS supported the comparison with NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium in a medium/long-term clinical study in patients with knee OA. A dose-finding study in patients with knee OA did provide strong data supporting the administration of 800 mg of CS orally which had nearly the same effects as 1200 mg/day, whereas the use of a sequential 3 months administration mode, twice a year was also shown to provide the same results as a continuous treatment. The good tolerability and safety aspects of oral CS were largely documented in these CTs. Taking these important points into account, we definitively have enough clinical data available supporting the view that oral CS is a valuable and safe symptomatic treatment for OA disease. More recent data based on a couple of previous trials and two pivotal studies do provide further evidence that oral CS does also have structure-modifying effects in knee OA patients. A couple of other compounds such as hyaluronan, diacerein, avocado and soya unsaponifiables, doxycycline have also been tested with respect to their potential disease-modifying effects. Additional compounds including receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANK) ligand inhibitors, cathepsin K inhibitors, bisphosphonates are further assessed regarding their potential structure-modifying effect.

### Naturocetic (glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate) compounds as structure-modifying drugs in the treatment of osteoarthritis [^1119rEN4]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Several entities have been investigated carefully for the symptomatic and structural management of osteoarthritis. This review reports recent findings suggesting that such compounds may delay the structural progression of osteoarthritis.

Recent Findings

The most compelling evidence of a potential for inhibiting the structural progression of osteoarthritis has been obtained with glucosamine sulfate, whereas preliminary results obtained in patients with osteoarthritis of the hands also suggest that chondroitin sulfate could be used in the same indication. At any rate, these two compounds have clearly demonstrated a symptomatic action, mainly in osteoarthritis of the lower limbs. Patients with the less severe radiographic osteoarthritis will experience, in the long run, the most dramatic disease progression in terms of joint space narrowing. Such patients may be particularly responsive to structure-modifying drugs.

Summary

Glucosamine sulfate has demonstrated its ability to reduce the progression of osteoarthritis in the lower limbs. The preliminary results obtained in the hands suggest that chondroitin sulfate could also be of interest in this indication. An important issue is that all the conclusive studies with such chemical entities resulted from the use of prescription medicines, not over-the-counter pills or food supplements.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^114hG9zo]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Implications

We believe it unlikely that future trials will show a clinically relevant benefit of any of the evaluated preparations. Some will argue, however, that many patients included in the trials of our network were too ill in radiological terms to benefit and that their advanced radiological stage meant that the subtotal to total cartilage damage could not be influenced any more by the experimental preparations. Others will argue that many patients were not ill enough in clinical terms and that their small amount of experienced pain meant that they could not benefit from the analgesic effects of the preparations. To address these concerns, in addition to the trials by Clegg et al, Rozendaal et al, and McAlindon et al, some might consider the necessity for a fourth industry independent trial, which would exclusively include patients with an experienced pain intensity at baseline of at least 4 cm on a 10 cm visual analogue scale and moderate osteoarthritis, corresponding to a Kellgren and Lawrence score of 2. Inclusion of 150 to 200 patients in each comparison group would yield more than 90% power to detect a minimal clinically relevant difference of −0.9 cm on a 10 cm visual analogue scale for any of these preparations compared with placebo at a conventional two sided α level of 5%. The trial should use coded drug packs with preparations and placebos of identical appearance and taste to conceal treatment allocation and ensure blinding of patients and care givers, carefully control and monitor analgesic cointerventions, and fully adhere to the principle of intention to treat by the inclusion of all patients in the analysis in the groups to which they were originally allocated. The evaluated preparations should have undergone thorough quality control to ensure appropriate concentrations of chondroitin and glucosamine sulphate. The industry independent randomised Long Term Evaluation of Glucosamine Sulphate Study (LEGS) will probably satisfy most of these criteria. It allocated 600 patients to one of four treatment arms — chondroitin sulphate, glucosamine sulphate, their combination, or matching placebo — and closed recruitment in October 2009. First results will become available at the earliest in November 2011 (M Fransen, personal communication).

### Hip pain and mobility deficits – hip osteoarthritis: clinical practice guidelines linked to the international classification of functioning, disability, and health from the orthopaedic section of the American Physical Therapy Association [^116bT2yM]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis — alternative and complementary medications show mixed or minimal benefit, with discouraging recommendations for chondroitin and glucosamine. Glucosamine and other similar supplements are commonly suggested for individuals with hip OA, yet randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of glucosamines have shown mixed results and most of the positive results are for short-term improvement in pain and in function. A recent meta-analysis of chondroitin for OA of the hip indicates the symptomatic benefit of chondroitin is minimal or nonexistent and the use of chondroitin in clinical practice should be discouraged, and the short or long-term use of glucosamines is not recommended at this time in patients with hip OA.

### Chondroitin for osteoarthritis [^116XzmYV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis, a common joint disorder, is one of the leading causes of disability. Chondroitin has emerged as a new treatment. Previous meta-analyses have shown contradictory results on the efficacy of chondroitin. This, in addition to the publication of more trials, necessitates a systematic review.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefit and harm of oral chondroitin for treating osteoarthritis compared with placebo or a comparator oral medication including, but not limited to, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, opioids, and glucosamine or other "herbal" medications.

Search Methods

We searched seven databases up to November 2013, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Science Citation Index (Web of Science) and Current Controlled Trials. We searched the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) websites for adverse effects. Trial registers were not searched.

Selection Criteria

All randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials lasting longer than two weeks, studying adults with osteoarthritis in any joint, and comparing chondroitin with placebo, an active control such as NSAIDs, or other "herbal" supplements such as glucosamine.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed all title assessments, data extractions, and risk of bias assessments.

Main Results

Forty-three randomized controlled trials including 4,962 participants treated with chondroitin and 4,148 participants given placebo or another control were included. The majority of trials were in knee OA, with few in hip and hand OA. Trial duration varied from 1 month to 3 years. Participants treated with chondroitin achieved statistically significantly and clinically meaningful better pain scores (0–100) in studies less than 6 months than those given placebo with an absolute risk difference of 10% lower (95% confidence interval (CI), 15% to 6% lower; number needed to treat (NNT) = 5 (95% CI, 3 to 8; n = 8 trials) (level of evidence, low; risk of bias, high); but there was high heterogeneity between the trials (T² = 0.07; I² = 70%, which was not easily explained by differences in risk of bias or study sample size). In studies longer than 6 months, the absolute risk difference for pain was 9% lower (95% CI 18% lower to 0%); n = 6 trials; T² = 0.18; I² = 83%), again with low level of evidence. For the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Minimal Clinically Important Improvement (WOMAC MCII Pain subscale) outcome, a reduction in knee pain by 20% was achieved by 53/100 in the chondroitin group versus 47/100 in the placebo group, an absolute risk difference of 6% (95% CI 1% to 11%), (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.24; T² = 0.00; I² = 0%) (n = 2 trials, 1253 participants; level of evidence, high; risk of bias, low). Differences in Lequesne's index (composite of pain, function and disability) statistically significantly favoured chondroitin as compared with placebo in studies under six months, with an absolute risk difference of 8% lower (95% CI 12% to 5% lower; T² = 0.78; n = 7 trials) (level of evidence, moderate; risk of bias, unclear), also clinically meaningful. Loss of minimum joint space width in the chondroitin group was statistically significantly less than in the placebo group, with a relative risk difference of 4.7% less (95% CI 1.6% to 7.8% less; n = 2 trials) (level of evidence, high; risk of bias, low). Chondroitin was associated with statistically significantly lower odds of serious adverse events compared with placebo with Peto odds ratio of 0.40 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.82; n = 6 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Chondroitin did not result in statistically significant numbers of adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events compared with placebo or another drug. Adverse events were reported in a limited fashion, with some studies providing data and others not. Comparisons of chondroitin taken alone or in combination with glucosamine or another supplement showed a statistically significant reduction in pain (0–100) when compared with placebo or an active control, with an absolute risk difference of 10% lower (95% CI 14% to 5% lower); NNT = 4 (95% CI 3 to 6); T² = 0.33; I² = 91%; n = 17 trials) (level of evidence, low). For physical function, chondroitin in combination with glucosamine or another supplement showed no statistically significant difference from placebo or an active control, with an absolute risk difference of 1% lower (95% CI 6% lower to 3% higher with T² = 0.04; n = 5 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Differences in Lequesne's index statistically significantly favoured chondroitin as compared with placebo, with an absolute risk difference of 8% lower (95% CI, 12% to 4% lower; T² = 0.12; n = 10 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Chondroitin in combination with glucosamine did not result in statistically significant differences in the numbers of adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, or in the numbers of serious adverse events compared with placebo or with an active control. The beneficial effects of chondroitin in pain and Lequesne's index persisted when evidence was limited to studies with adequate blinding or studies that used appropriate intention to treat (ITT) analyses. These beneficial effects were uncertain when we limited data to studies with appropriate allocation concealment or a large study sample (> 200) or to studies without pharmaceutical funding.

Authors' Conclusions

A review of randomized trials of mostly low quality reveals that chondroitin (alone or in combination with glucosamine) was better than placebo in improving pain in participants with osteoarthritis in short-term studies. The benefit was small to moderate with an 8 point greater improvement in pain (range 0 to 100) and a 2 point greater improvement in Lequesne's index (range 0 to 24), both seeming clinically meaningful. These differences persisted in some sensitivity analyses and not others. Chondroitin had a lower risk of serious adverse events compared with control. More high-quality studies are needed to explore the role of chondroitin in the treatment of osteoarthritis. The combination of some efficacy and low risk associated with chondroitin may explain its popularity among patients as an over-the-counter supplement.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^114Kas9d]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee is a chronic condition mostly treated with analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but these drugs can cause serious gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse events, especially with long term use. Disease modifying agents that not only reduce joint pain but also slow the progression of the condition would be desirable. Throughout the world for the past 10 years, the cartilage constituents chondroitin and glucosamine have been increasingly recommended in guidelines, prescribed by general practitioners and rheumatologists, and used by patients as over the counter medications to modify the clinical and radiological course of the condition. Global sales of glucosamine supplements reached almost $2bn (£1.3bn, €0.8bn) in 2008, which represents an increase of about 60% compared with 2003, with a forecasted continued growth through 2013 reaching $2.3bn. The oral administration of cartilage constituents in patients with osteoarthritis is thought to make up for the apparent cartilage loss in affected joints. Chondroitin is a highly hydrophilic, gel forming polysaccharide macromolecule. Its hydrocolloid properties convey much of the compressive resistance of cartilage. Glucosamine is an amino sugar that is a building block for the glycosaminoglycans that are part of the structure of cartilage. Ingested chondroitin and glucosamine are both partially absorbed in the intestine, and it has been suggested that some of the ingested amount reaches the joints.

Results from randomised trials about the effectiveness of chondroitin and glucosamine are conflicting. Trials that have reported large effects on joint pain were often hampered by poor study quality and small sample sizes, whereas large methodologically sound trials often found only small or no effects.

Bayesian approaches towards network meta-analyses allow a unified, coherent analysis of data recorded at multiple time points in randomised trials that compare either of these preparations with placebo or head to head. The approaches fully respect randomisation, account for the correlation of multiple observations within the same trial, and allow the estimation of the relative effectiveness of the different preparations and their combination. We performed a systematic review with network meta-analysis including data from large methodologically sound randomised trials at multiple follow-up times to determine the effect of these preparations on joint pain and on radiological progression of disease.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^111tyu3m]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

As with conventional meta-analyses, some will argue that we have not compared like with like. Our model, however, was based on relative treatment effects (differences between groups expressed as effect sizes), and variations in patients' characteristics between trials are fully accounted for in the analysis by maintaining randomised comparisons within each trial. Network meta-analysis makes similar assumptions to standard meta-analysis of direct comparisons within trials but requires that these assumptions hold over the entire set of trials in the network — that is, for the indirect comparisons also. In addition, our model assumes that relative treatment effects comparing two interventions in different trials are from the same common distribution. The smaller the heterogeneity between trials, and the smaller the inconsistency between direct randomised comparisons and indirect comparisons, the more likely these assumptions hold. The heterogeneity between trials in our analysis was near zero and the upper credible interval for the τ² estimate was 0.24 on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (the maximum τ of the underlying distribution of treatment effects compatible with the credible interval would be 0.5 cm). In addition, we investigated potential sources of variation in the network by including characteristics of trials as covariates in the analysis of the primary outcome. Taken together, results of these analyses make it likely that relative treatment effects originate from one common distribution and confirm one of our key assumptions. As with heterogeneity between trials, inconsistency between direct and indirect comparisons was also near zero (inconsistency factor 0.2 cm). Although we cannot rule out clinically relevant inconsistency (the upper credible interval for the inconsistency factor crossed the pre-specified threshold for a clinically relevant effect at 0.9 cm), we have no indication that clinical characteristics of included patients or other trial characteristics confounded the indirect comparisons. The use of different instruments to measure joint pain made it necessary to calculate effect sizes as a common measure of effectiveness to ensure comparability between outcomes assessed with different instruments. Poor correlation or differences in responsiveness of different instruments could be a potential threat to the validity of results. The scales used in the component trials of our network (10 cm visual analogue scale and WOMAC pain subscales), however, were highly correlated and have comparable responsiveness.

### Argument against use of food additives for osteoarthritis of the hip [^111H7pMn]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2000). Low credibility.

Food additives and other forms of alternative medicines have been embraced by the general public. Some of these compounds including glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate have shown efficacy in relieving pain associated with osteoarthritis. However, evidence is limited concerning the chondroprotective ability of these agents. More controlled studies and basic research is necessary to evaluate these claims especially because these compounds are not under regulatory control.

Relation to other studies

Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses on glucosamine and chondroitin have been published. The three most recent ones were by Vlad et alon glucosamine, Reichenbach et alon chondroitin, and Lee et alon radiographic outcomes of both preparations. Vlad and colleagues analysed 15 trials comparing glucosamine with placebo. They found a pooled effect size of −0.35 (95% confidence interval −0.56 to −0.14) in favour of glucosamine, but there was substantial heterogeneity. Trials with adequate concealment of allocation, industry independent trials, and trials evaluating glucosamine hydrochloride showed less beneficial effects and less pronounced heterogeneity between trials than the remainder. The authors concluded that glucosamine hydrochloride is ineffective but could not exclude the possibility of a clinically relevant effect of glucosamine sulphate. Reichenbach and colleagues found large heterogeneity among 20 chondroitin trials, which could be explained by a lack of concealment of allocation, failure to perform an intention to treat analysis, and small sample sizes. The initial pooled effect size of −0.75 (−0.99 to −0.50) in favour of chondroitin sulphate diminished to zero when the analysis was restricted to methodologically sound trials of adequate sample size. Both groups had analysed only one time point per trial, which was criticised. Lee and colleagues included six trials evaluating the effects of chondroitin or glucosamine on narrowing of joint space (four were included in our analysis and we excluded two because of small sample size). They found significant small to moderate protective effects. They did not, however, include the GAIT trial. We included methodologically superior large scale patient blinded trials in more than 200 patients in our network meta-analysis and used a statistical model that allowed the simultaneous analysis and summary of treatment effects observed at multiple time points. Addressing earlier concerns about time dependency of effects, quality control of preparations, and differences between different formulations of glucosamine, we conclude that there is no evidence for time dependent effects, that the lack of a clinically relevant effect of these preparations is not related to a lack of quality control, and that the lack of a clinically relevant effect is also apparent for glucosamine sulphate. With the summary of multiple time points and the combination of direct comparisons within trials between preparations with indirect evidence from other trials, these conclusions are based on considerably more high quality evidence than the previous restricted analyses of trials considered least biased by Vlad et al and Reichenbach et al.

### Glucosamine oral bioavailability and plasma pharmacokinetics after increasing doses of crystalline glucosamine sulfate in man [^114WhETC]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Pharmacokinetic data on glucosamine are scant, limiting the understanding of glucosamine sulfate mechanism of action in support of its treatment effects in osteoarthritis. This study investigated the oral pharmacokinetics and dose-proportionality of glucosamine after administration of the patented crystalline glucosamine sulfate in man.

Methods

Twelve healthy volunteers received three consecutive once-daily oral administrations of glucosamine sulfate soluble powder at the doses of 750, 1,500, and 3,000 mg, in an open, randomised, cross-over fashion. Glucosamine was determined in plasma collected up to 48 h after the last dose by a validated Liquid Chromatography method with Mass Spectrometry detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated at steady state.

Results

Endogenous plasma levels of glucosamine were detected (10.4–204 ng/ml, with low intra-subject variability). Glucosamine was rapidly absorbed after oral administration and its pharmacokinetics were linear in the dose range 750–1,500 mg, but not at 3,000 mg, where the plasma concentration-time profiles were less than expected based on dose-proportionality. Plasma levels increased over 30-folds from baseline and peaked at about 10 microM with the standard 1,500 mg once-daily dosage. Glucosamine distributed to extravascular compartments and its plasma concentrations were still above baseline up to the last collection time. Glucosamine elimination half-life was only tentatively estimated to average 15 h.

Conclusions

Glucosamine is bioavailable after oral administration of crystalline glucosamine sulfate, persists in circulation, and its pharmacokinetics support once-daily dosage. Steady state peak concentrations at the therapeutic dose of 1,500 mg were in line with those found to be effective in selected in vitro mechanistic studies. This is the only glucosamine formulation for which pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety data are now available.

### A comprehensive review of oral glucosamine use and effects on glucose metabolism in normal and diabetic individuals [^115QfZYL]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Reginster et al. evaluated the effect of GlcN·SO 4 supplementation in 212 male and female subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee. Participants (mean age of 66 years) were randomized to receive either placebo or GlcN·SO 4 (1500 mg/day) for a period of 3 years. Diabetes-relevant parameters were monitored as secondary endpoints and, in addition to standard adverse event and laboratory monitoring, each subject had fasting glucose concentrations measured yearly. Drop-out rates were equal in both groups throughout the trial, and reasons for dropping out did not differ. Routine laboratory testing did not show any significant changes in glycaemic homeostasis although fasting plasma glucose levels tended to decrease from baseline in the GlcN-treated group. In a personal communication, the lead author explained that only subjects with diagnosed type 2 diabetes were excluded from the study and that sub-group analysis of the subjects who were randomized to the GlcN group and had above 'normal' fasting glucose concentrations at the beginning of the trial displayed trends (non-significant) towards lower plasma glucose concentration throughout the 3 years of daily GlcN use (Reginster, personal correspondence, 2009).

As the average age of the subjects in these two studies was above 60 years, a significant proportion of the patients who participated in these studies might have been expected to have some degree of glucose intolerance, the prevalence of which has been estimated by some to be as high as 52% for Europeans 60–79 years of age. On the basis of data collected from the International Diabetes Federationand European census data, it has been estimated that 17% of people recruited between the ages of 60 and 79 from the Belgian populationand 23% of those from the Czech populationswould have evidence of impaired glucose tolerance, and might therefore be considered potentially pre-diabetic. Although some of these potentially 'pre-diabetic' subjects might have been excluded from each of the two long-term clinical trials (e.g. obese subjects) it is not unreasonable to suppose, given its high prevalence, that a significant number of individuals with impaired glucose tolerance would have been included in these studies of long-term GlcN administration.

### Non-surgical management of knee osteoarthritis: comparison of ESCEO and OARSI 2019 guidelines [^11219DcZ]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a heterogeneous disease associated with substantial effects on quality of life, and its clinical management is difficult. Among the several available guidelines for the management of knee OA, those from OARSI and ESCEO were updated in 2019. Here, we examine the similarities and differences between these two guidelines and provide a narrative to help guide health-care providers through the complexities of non-surgical management of knee OA. OARSI and ESCEO both recommend education, structured exercise and weight loss as core treatments, topical NSAIDs as first-line treatments and oral NSAIDs and intra-articular injections for persistent pain. Low-dose, short-term acetaminophen, pharmaceutical grade glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are recommended by ESCEO whereas OARSI strongly recommends against their use (including all glucosamine and chondroitin formulations). Despite this difference, the two guidelines are consistent in the majority of their recommendations and provide useful treatment recommendations for individuals with OA and health-care providers.

### Glucosamine [^114naGLQ]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Glucosamine is one of the most popular dietary supplements sold in the United States. Most clinical trials have focused on its use in osteoarthritis of the knee. The reported adverse effects have been relatively well studied and are generally uncommon and minor. No significant supplement-drug interactions involving glucosamine have been reported. The National Institutes of Health-sponsored Glucosamine/chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial, the largest randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving the supplement, still has not confirmed whether glucosamine is effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Despite conflicting results in studies, there is no clear evidence to recommend against its use. If physicians have patients who wish to try glucosamine, it would be reasonable to support a 60-day trial of glucosamine sulfate, especially in those at high risk of secondary effects from other accepted treatments. The decision to continue therapy can then be left to patients on an individual basis, while the physician monitors for possible adverse effects. Glucosamine should be used with caution in patients who have shellfish allergies or asthma, and in those taking diabetes medications or warfarin.

Discussion

Principal findings

Our network meta-analysis of all 10 available large scale patient blind randomised trials in 3803 patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis showed no clinically relevant effect of chondroitin, glucosamine, or their combination on perceived joint pain. Despite abundant statistical power, none of the pooled estimates crossed the pre-specified boundary of a minimal clinically important difference of −0.9 cm on a 10 cm visual analogue scale at any of the recorded time points. At some time points the 95% credible interval crossed this boundary (see fig 3), which could mean that we cannot exclude a relevant effect at such time points. The overall estimates, which combine effects over different time points, were precise, however, and the lower end of their credible intervals did not cross the pre-specified boundary. These estimates should be considered most valid in view of the negative test of interaction of treatment effects by time (P = 0.93), which indicates that the observed variation over different time points is not over and above what would be expected by chance alone.

The upper limit of the 95% credible interval of the overall pooled estimate of glucosamine versus placebo and chondroitin versus placebo did not overlap the line of no effect, which suggests that a traditional P value for this comparison would be significant at the conventional 5% level. Statistical significance should not, however, be confused with clinical relevance. With the observed differences in pain intensity of 0.3 to 0.5 cm between supplements and placebo on a 10 cm visual analogue scale, the range and distribution of pain scores in patients receiving supplements and placebo are near identical, and it would be impossible, based on the reported pain intensity at the end of a trial, to determine whether a patient was allocated to a supplement or to placebo.

In stratified analyses, we found that estimates comparing supplements with placebo depended to some extent on the quality of the trials, the presence or absence of quality control measures for preparations, the joint studied, and the type of glucosamine salt used, but tests for interaction were all negative for these variables (P ≥ 0.20 for interaction). On average, the estimated differences between supplements and placebo were 0.5 cm less pronounced in industry independent trials compared with industry sponsored trials, and estimated treatment effects in industry independent trials were minute to zero and by no means clinically relevant (see fig 2). The effects on minimal width of joint space were small, again clinically irrelevant, and — with credible intervals overlapping the line of no effect — non-significant at the conventional α level of 5%.

### Current role of glucosamine in the treatment of osteoarthritis [^111SjBbe]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the interest of using the various preparations of glucosamine for symptomatic and structural management of osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

A critical analysis of the literature based on an exhaustive search (Medline, PubMed and manual search within the bibliography of retrieved manuscripts) from 1980 to 2005.

Results

Despite multiple controlled clinical trials of the use of glucosamine in OA (mainly of the knee), controversy on efficacy related to symptomatic improvement continues. Differences in results originate from the differences in products, study design and study populations. Symptomatic efficacy described in multiple studies performed with glucosamine sulphate (GS) support continued consideration in the OA therapeutic armamentarium. The most compelling evidence of a potential for inhibiting the progression of OA is also obtain with GS.

Conclusions

GS has shown positive effects on symptomatic and structural outcomes of knee OA. These results should not be extrapolated to other glucosamine salts [hydrochloride or preparations (over-the-counter or food supplements)] in which no warranty exists about content, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the tablets.

### A review of evidence-based medicine for glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate use in knee osteoarthritis [^113Ch63Q]. Arthroscopy (2009). Low credibility.

The investigation of disease-modifying treatment options for osteoarthritis (OA) has become an important aspect of orthopaedic care. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the evidence for the use of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate for knee OA with the goal of elucidating their indications for clinical use. The published clinical studies of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate on OA are reviewed within the context of evidence-based medicine. Almost every included trial has found the safety of these compounds to be equal to placebo. In the literature satisfying our inclusion criteria, glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, and chondroitin sulfate have individually shown inconsistent efficacy in decreasing OA pain and improving joint function. Many studies confirmed OA pain relief with glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate use. The excellent safety profile of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate therapy should be discussed with patients, and these supplements may serve a role as an initial treatment modality for many OA patients.

### Why are clinical trials of glucosamine no longer uniformly positive? [^114GMVyg]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

In contrast to earlier industry-funded trials of for knee OA, recent studies have generated negative results. While there will be a tendency to assume that these studies were negative because of the absence of any conflicts of interest, a number of issues must be taken into consideration before drawing such conclusions. These issues include design issues and important differences in sample characteristics. Ultimately, it is clear that more work needs to be done to clarify issues surrounding the efficacy and utility of the various glucosamine compounds.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^1148EVrE]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Effects on joint pain

All trials contributed to the network meta-analysis of pain related outcomes (see appendix 1 on bmj.com). Figure 2presents pooled estimates across different time points. The variation across time points was not over and above what would be expected by chance (τ² = 0.04 for variation across time points on a 10 cm visual analogue scale, P = 0.93 for interaction between treatment effect and time). The overall difference in pain intensity versus placebo based on a summary of all time points was −0.4 cm (95% credible interval −0.7 to −0.1 cm) on a 10 cm visual analogue scale for glucosamine, −0.3 cm (−0.7 to 0.0 cm) for chondroitin, and −0.5 cm (−0.9 to 0.0 cm) for the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin. Corresponding effect sizes were −0.17 (−0.28 to −0.05) for glucosamine, −0.13 (−0.27 to 0.00) for chondroitin, and −0.19 (−0.37 to 0.00) for the combination. Heterogeneity between trials was low (τ² = 0.04 for heterogeneity between trials on a 10 cm visual analogue scale), there was no evidence for inconsistency (inconsistency factor 0.2 cm, −0.7 to 1.1, P = 0.63), and the goodness of fit of the model to the data was excellent (data available on request). Results from the primary network meta-analysis were concordant with a model including a linear term for time, conventional meta-analyses of direct comparisons, a network meta-analysis, which included only one time point for pain intensity at the end of follow-up, and an analysis with a different prior distribution for the heterogeneity between trials (see appendix 2 on bmj.com).

Regarding medical management for knee osteoarthritis, more specifically with respect to agents with no evidence for benefit, AAOS 2022 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to support the use of the following supplements in patients with knee OA, although they may be helpful in reducing pain and improving function in patients with mild-to-moderate knee OA:

- turmeric

- ginger extract

- glucosamine

- chondroitin

- vitamin D.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^112c49PL]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Safety

Five trials reported on adverse events, all 10 reported withdrawals or drop-outs because of adverse events, and three reported serious adverse events. The odds ratios of adverse events compared with placebo were 0.94 (0.59 to 1.47) for glucosamine and 0.99 (0.49 to 2.00) for chondroitin; no data were available on adverse events overall for the combination. The odds ratios for withdrawals or drop-outs because of adverse events were 0.99 (0.61 to 1.50) for glucosamine, 0.92 (0.56 to 1.51) for chondroitin, and 0.90 (0.43 to 1.85) for the combination. Heterogeneity between trials was low for both outcomes, with τ² of 0.02 and 0.03, respectively. We could estimate inconsistency only for drop-outs because of adverse events, with some evidence of inconsistency (ratio of relative risks 0.54, 0.19 to 1.46, P = 0.22 for inconsistency).

### Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate [^1178uafn]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, components of normal cartilage that are marketed as dietary supplements in the United States, have been evaluated for their potential role in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Due to claims of efficacy, increased prevalence of osteoarthritis, and a lack of other effective therapies, there has been substantial interest in using these dietary supplements as therapeutic agents for osteoarthritis. Though pharmacokinetic and bioavailability data are limited, use of these supplements has been evaluated for management of osteoarthritis symptoms and modification of disease progression. Relevant clinical trial efficacy and safety data are reviewed and summarized.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^1133Rsc4]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

We used an extension of multivariable Bayesian hierarchical random effects models for mixed multiple treatment comparisons with minimally informative prior distributions. It fully preserves the comparison of randomised treatments within each trial while combining all available comparisons between treatments and accounts for multiple comparisons within a trial when there are more than two treatment arms. For the analysis of effect sizes of pain, the model included random effects at the level of trials and time points. It accounted for the correlation of outcome data reported at different time points within a trial and allowed the estimation of the variance of treatment effects between trials (τ 2). Effect sizes were calculated by dividing the differences in mean values between treatment groups in a time window by the median pooled standard deviation (SD) observed across all time points in a trial. If SDs were not provided, we calculated them from standard errors or confidence intervals as described elsewhere. An effect size of −0.20 SD units suggests an overlap in the distributions of reported pain scores in the experimental group with pain scores in placebo group in 85% and can be considered a small difference between experimental and control group. An effect size of −0.50 indicates an overlap in about 67% and can be considered a moderate difference, whereas −0.80 suggests an overlap in 53% and is considered a large difference.

To allow intuitive interpretation of pooled effects, we back transformed effect sizes to differences on a 10 cm visual analogue scale on the basis of a median pooled SD of 2.5 cm found in large scale osteoarthritis trials that assessed pain on a 10 cm visual analogue scale. We prespecified a minimal clinically important difference of 0.37 SD units, corresponding to 0.9 cm on a 10 cm visual analogue scale. This was based on the median minimal clinically important difference found in recent studies in patients with osteoarthritis. As the analysis of changes of minimum radiographic joint space did not include multiple time points, the model used for this outcome included only a random effect at the level of trials. To achieve comparability of the magnitude of effects on joint space and on pain and distinguish between small, moderate, and large treatment effects, we expressed differences in the width of the joint space as effect sizes, dividing the pooled estimates in millimetres by the median pooled SD of 1.2 mm found in included trials.

Oral analgesics

Paracetamol was included as a treatment arm in three conference abstracts (unclear RoB) and one cross-over trial (high RoB), in various dosages and for different duration. Three trials intended paracetamol to be the control group. One trial (unclear RoB) included a placebo arm, and reports no between-group difference in pain or morning stiffness. Paracetamol was not superior to any of the active comparators.

Oral NSAIDs lead to moderate improvements in pain and function compared with no intervention, placeboand other active interventions (glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate, paracetamol).

Nutraceuticals

The effectiveness of chondroitin sulfate was studied in two papers. One trial (low RoB) focused on clinical outcomes after 6 months, reporting beneficial effects on pain and function compared with placebo. The other study (high RoB) assessed structural outcomes in two long-term trials (published in one paper), assessing chondroitin sulfate and chondroitin polysulphate. Only for chondroitin polysulphate, a preparation not commercially available, less erosive damage after 3 years was reported and not for chondroitin sulfate. The trials did not report higher risk of sAEs in the intervention groups.

Glucosamine is reported to have beneficial effects on pain and function after 6 weeks in an RCT (unclear RoB) published as conference abstract (no raw data provided).

Diacerhein was not better than placebo for pain relief or any of the other secondary outcomes in a study (unclear RoB) of Korean patients with hand OA, while more (mild) AEs were reported in the intervention group, especially discoloration of urine (88% vs 20%) and abdominal pain (31% vs 14%), but remarkably not diarrhoea (21% vs 20%).

### Association of habitual glucosamine use with risk of cardiovascular disease: prospective study in UK biobank [^11471MBq]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To prospectively assess the association of habitual glucosamine use with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

UK Biobank.

Participants

466039 participants without CVD at baseline who completed a questionnaire on supplement use, which included glucosamine. These participants were enrolled from 2006 to 2010 and were followed up to 2016.

Main Outcome Measures

Incident CVD events, including CVD death, coronary heart disease, and stroke.

Results

During a median follow-up of seven years, there were 10204 incident CVD events, 3060 CVD deaths, 5745 coronary heart disease events, and 3263 stroke events. After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, race, lifestyle factors, dietary intakes, drug use, and other supplement use, glucosamine use was associated with a significantly lower risk of total CVD events (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.90), CVD death (0.78, 0.70 to 0.87), coronary heart disease (0.82, 0.76 to 0.88), and stroke (0.91, 0.83 to 1.00).

Conclusion

Habitual use of glucosamine supplement to relieve osteoarthritis pain might also be related to lower risks of CVD events.

### Association of habitual glucosamine use with risk of microvascular complications among individuals with type 2 diabetes: a prospective cohort study in UK biobank [^111GnNKY]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) mellitus is a complex metabolic disorder with multiple metabolic and homeostatic disturbances that occur during the course of the disease and persist over time. About 537 million adults worldwide have diabetes, the majority of whom have T2D, and this number is projected to increase to 783 million by 2045. Diabetic microvascular complications, including diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic neuropathy, lead to increased mortality, renal failure, blindness and overall reduced quality of life in people with diabetes mellitus. Therefore, it is crucial to identify cost-effective strategies to prevent and slow the progression of microvascular complications in diabetic patients.

Glucosamine is a commonly used supplement for relieving osteoarthritis and joint pain. About 20% of adults in the United States and Australia consume it daily. Although the efficacy of glucosamine for osteoarthritis and joint pain remains debated, several recent epidemiological studies have shown that glucosamine reduces the risk of a number of diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and lung cancer. A 3-year clinical trial of 212 participants showed a slight glucose-lowering effect in glucosamine users, and studies have shown a protective effect of glycaemia control on diabetic microvascular complications. In addition, previous studies have suggested that glucosamine may affect the inflammatory state, which has also been linked to the risk of microvascular complications in T2D. However, the relationship between habitual glucosamine uses and microvascular complications in patients with T2D remains unclear.

To fill these knowledge gaps, in the current study we aimed to prospectively evaluate the association of habitual glucosamine use with risk of microvascular complications in individuals with T2D from the UK Biobank.

Figure 3 shows the results from stratified analyses. Estimates comparing supplements with placebo depended to some extent on the quality of the trials, the presence or absence of quality control measures for preparations, the type of study joint, and the type of glucosamine salt used, but tests for interaction were all negative for these variables (P ≥ 0.20 for interaction). The estimated differences between supplements and placebo, however, were, on average, 0.5 cm (0.1 to 0.9 cm) less pronounced in industry independent trials compared with industry sponsored trials (P = 0.02 for interaction).

Effects on radiological joint space

Six trials reported changes in width of joint space. The network meta-analysis of differences in changes in minimal joint space narrowing at the end of the treatment period showed minute effects for all preparations compared with placebo. The difference was −0.2 mm (−0.3 to 0.0 mm) in favour of glucosamine, −0.1 mm (−0.3 to 0.1 mm) in favour of chondroitin, and 0.0 mm (−0.2 to 0.2 mm) for the combination, which corresponded to effect sizes of −0.16 (−0.25 to 0.0), −0.08 (−0.25 to 0.08), and 0.00 (−0.16 to 0.16). Heterogeneity between trials was low (τ² = 0.02), there was no evidence for inconsistency (inconsistency factor −0.1 mm, −0.6 to 0.4 mm; P = 0.54), and the goodness of fit of the model to the data was excellent.

### The effect of glucosamine on glucose metabolism in humans: a systematic review of the literature [^113DNbRg]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Glucosamine is commonly used for the treatment of osteoarthritis. It is available as an over the counter preparation and also as a prescription pharmaceutical. There is concern from animal experiments that glucosamine may alter glucose metabolism through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. The objective of this systematic review is to determine if exogenous glucosamine adversely affects glucose metabolism in humans. This review does not separate out the effects on glucose metabolism of the various glucosamine preparations.

Method

An English-language literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and EBM Reviews (1950-February 2009) was conducted. The bibliographies of selected papers were manually searched for additional references. Two reviewers independently analyzed studies for quality and content using a standardized data extraction form.

Results

Eleven studies were included. Six studies were randomized controlled trials and the remaining five were prospective studies with or without controls. Four of the studies found decreased insulin sensitivity or increased fasting glucose in subjects taking glucosamine. Three of these were clinical studies using oral glucosamine. Studies that included subjects with baseline impaired glucose tolerance or insulin resistance were more likely to detect an effect on glucose metabolism than studies without such subjects.

Conclusion

Clinical studies, including three using oral glucosamine, have provided mixed evidence about the effect of exogenous glucosamine on glucose metabolism in humans. Therefore, more studies are needed, particularly including subjects at high risk for impairments in glucose homeostasis, before a definite conclusion can be made.

### Update of ACR guidelines for osteoarthritis: role of the coxibs [^113PRGa8]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recently provided an update to the guidelines published in 1995 on the management of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee and hip. Members of the Ad Hoc Committee on OA Guidelines followed an evidence-based medicine approach to revise the guidelines by reviewing an extensive literature search of the Cochrane and Medline databases and published abstracts, and discussing evidence with expert rheumatologists. The goal of the guidelines is to provide recommendations to control patients' OA pain, improve function and health-related quality of life, and avoid therapeutic toxicity. As in the original guidelines, nonpharmacologic interventions involving patient education and physical measures are recommended following initial diagnosis of OA. The pharmacologic algorithm was updated to include currently available therapeutic agents. Acetaminophen remains first-line therapy because of its cost, efficacy, and safety profiles. Cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitors (coxibs) have been included as an alternative to nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients at risk for upper gastrointestinal adverse events. Tramadol is an available alternative for patients who have a contraindication to coxibs or nonselective NSAIDs or for those who have not responded to previous oral therapy. Intra-articular injections or topical therapy may be used as monotherapy, or as an adjunct to oral analgesia. Surgical treatment of OA remains a last resort for patients who have failed to respond to nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment approaches, and have progressive limitation in their activities of daily living. Several therapies for the prevention or treatment of OA are currently under investigation, including nutritional supplements, such as glucosamine and chondroitin, disease-modifying OA drugs, and devices, such as acupuncture and electromagnetic therapy. It is anticipated that the guidelines for the management of OA will continue to evolve as new therapies become available.

Sets are logically combined as follows: "Combine population sets #1 OR #2", "Combine intervention sets #4 OR #5", and "Combine population and intervention sets #3 AND #6". Evidence filters are specified: "Apply general hedges See General Hedges at the end of this table" and "Apply meta-analyses and RCTs hedges See Study Type Hedges at the end of this table". The focused question is stated as "Question 4 – What are the comparative benefits and harms of topical pharmacotherapy agents versus oral pharmacotherapy for treatment of OA of the hip and knee?"

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^111bzjvT]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and weaknesses

Our network meta-analysis integrated evidence from direct and indirect comparisons while fully preserving randomisation. It enabled us to simultaneously analyse effect sizes reported at different follow-up times in a single model and to estimate the overall effect of preparations irrespective of the duration of follow-up while fully accounting for potential variation across time points and for the correlation of estimates within a trial. Consequently, estimates in our analysis were more precise than the pairwise meta-analyses or the network meta-analysis with only pain intensity at the end of follow-up (see appendix 2 on bmj.com).

We performed an extensive literature search, which makes it unlikely that we missed any relevant trial. Trial selection and data extraction including quality assessment were done independently by two authors to minimise bias and transcription errors. Components used for quality assessment are validated and reported to be associated with bias. In line with our pre-specified inclusion criteria, the trials in our network were large and of satisfactory methodological quality.

### Potential effects of chondroitin sulfate on joint swelling: a GAIT report [^113ZYLN8]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2008). Low credibility.

The Glucosamine/chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT) was a randomized double-blind placebo and active comparator (celecoxib) controlled trial of 1583 persons with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee(1). Patients randomized to celecoxib had significant improvement in knee pain compared to those randomized to placebo. No statistically significant improvement in knee pain compared to placebo was seen among patients randomized to the dietary supplements, although a subset of patients with moderate-to-severe knee pain at entry who were assigned to the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate did seem to experience some improvement. Additionally, patients taking chondroitin sulfate were noted to have a statistically significant improvement in knee joint swelling. An exploratory post hoc analysis of GAIT patients suggested the effect of chondroitin sulfate on joint swelling occurred more often in patients with milder pain and lower Kellgren-Lawrence Grade at entry.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^111xMTns]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Outcome measures

The prespecified primary outcome was absolute pain intensity reported in any of nine time windows organised in increments of three months (up to 3 months, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 months, and 22 months or more). If more than one time point was reported in a window, we extracted data nearest to the longest follow-up time included in that window; for the window covering 22 months or more, we extracted the follow-up closest to 24 months. When an article provided data on more than one pain scale, we referred to a previously described hierarchy of pain related outcomes and extracted the outcome that was highest on this list. Global pain took precedence over pain on walking and pain subscores on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) arthritis index. If a trial report provided data on both — for example, global pain scores and WOMAC pain subscores — we recorded only data on global pain scores. Secondary outcomes were changes in the minimum radiographic joint space between baseline and the end of treatment, the number of individuals withdrawn or who dropped out because of an adverse event, and the number of patients experiencing any adverse event.

Quality assessment

Two of the four reviewers independently assessed concealment of allocation, blinding, and adequacy of analyses. Concealment of allocation was considered adequate if the investigators responsible for the selection of patients did not know before allocation which treatment was next in line (central randomisation, sealed, opaque, sequentially numbered assignment envelopes, coded drug packs, etc). Any procedures based on predictable generation of allocation sequences, and potentially transparent attempts to conceal allocation, such as non-opaque envelopes, were considered inadequate. We extracted the number of patients initially randomised and the number of patients analysed per group at each time point to distinguish between trials that had included all randomised patients in the analysis (intention to treat analysis) and trials that had not. Finally, we determined whether experimental preparations had undergone quality control — that is, if either a formally approved preparation was used or pharmacological laboratory analysis confirmed the content of the preparation. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Data collection

Two of the four reviewers used a standardised form to extract in duplicate data on publication status, trial design, patients' characteristics, treatment regimens, outcome modalities, and funding. Results of pain, joint space narrowing, and adverse events were extracted by one reviewer (ST) and cross checked by another (PJ). When necessary, means and measures of dispersion were approximated from figures in the reports.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or glucosamine reduced pain and improved muscle strength with resistance training in a randomized controlled trial of knee osteoarthritis patients [^115tXaL4]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the effect of 12 weeks of strength training in combination with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), glucosamine, or placebo on muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), strength (primary outcome parameters), and function, power, pain, and satellite cell number (secondary outcome parameters) in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Design

Double-blinded, randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Hospital.

Participants

Patients (N = 36; 20 women, 16 men; age range, 50–70y) with bilateral tibiofemoral knee OA. A total of 181 patients were approached, and 145 were excluded.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with the NSAID ibuprofen (n = 12), glucosamine (n = 12), or placebo (n = 12) during 12 weeks of quadriceps muscle strength training.

Main Outcome Measures

Muscle CSA and strength.

Results

No differences between groups were observed in gains in muscle CSA. Training combined with ibuprofen increased maximal isometric strength by an additional .22Nm/kg (95% confidence interval [CI].01-.42; p = 0.04), maximal eccentric muscle strength by .38Nm/kg (95% CI, .05-.70; p = 0.02), and eccentric muscle work by .27J/kg (95% CI, .01-.53; p = 0.04) in comparison with placebo. Training combined with glucosamine increased maximal concentric muscle work by an additional .24J/kg versus placebo (95% CI, .06-.42; p = 0.01).

Conclusions

In patients with knee OA, NSAID or glucosamine administration during a 12-week strength-training program did not improve muscle mass gain, but improved maximal muscle strength gain in comparison with treatment with placebo. However, we do not find that the benefits are large enough to justify taking NSAIDs or glucosamine.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of glucosamine sulphate as an analgesic in osteoarthritis of the knee [^116Xg2Qu]. Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of the relative effectiveness of glucosamine sulphate and placebo in managing pain in osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.

Methods

Eighty patients with OA of the knee were recruited from a rheumatology out-patient clinic and received either glucosamine sulphate 1500 mg daily for 6 months or dummy placebo. The primary outcome measure was patients' global assessment of pain in the affected knee.

Results

Area under the curve analysis for the primary outcome measure showed no difference between placebo and glucosamine [mean difference 0.15 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.78 to 9.07]. The placebo response was 33%. There was a statistically significant difference between groups in knee flexion (mean difference 13 degrees, 95% CI -23.13 to -1.97), but this difference was small and could have been due to measurement error.

Conclusions

As a symptom modifier in OA patients with a wide range of pain severities, glucosamine sulphate was no more effective than placebo.

### Long-term effects of a lifestyle intervention and oral glucosamine sulphate in primary care on incident knee OA in overweight women [^1166sjaJ]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of a lifestyle intervention aimed to reduce body weight and of oral glucosamine sulphate on the incidence of knee osteoarthritis (OA) after 6–7 years in a population of middle-aged, overweight women, without knee OA at baseline.

Methods

The Prevention of knee Osteoarthritis in Overweight Females study, ISRCTN42823086, was a randomized controlled trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design. Four hundred and seven women aged 50–60 years with a BMI of ⩾27 kg/m 2 and free of knee OA were randomized.

Results

Four hundred and seventy-seven knees from 245 participants were available after a mean follow-up time of 6.6 years. Nineteen per cent of all knees showed incident knee OA. Both interventions showed no significant preventive effect on incident knee OA. Despite the fact that per protocol analyses showed greater differences between both groups for the lifestyle intervention, significance was not reached. A significant effect of losing ⩾5 kg or ⩾ 5% of baseline weight in the first 12 months on the incidence of knee OA according to the primary outcome was found (odds ratio = 0.10; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.41).

Conclusion

No significant preventive effect on incident knee OA of either the lifestyle intervention or the glucosamine intervention was found. As a proof of concept, the preventive effect of moderate weight loss in 1 year on the incidence of clinical knee OA is demonstrated. This trial provides important insights for future studies on the prevention of knee OA, which are currently lacking.

### A comprehensive review of oral glucosamine use and effects on glucose metabolism in normal and diabetic individuals [^117TFLYp]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Glucosamine (GlcN) is one of the most widely used over-the-counter dietary supplement products for the management of osteoarthritis. In a recent US survey, 5% of the general population in the United States reported using GlcN in the previous week, and up to 9% of elderly men and 7% of elderly women were identified as GlcN users. Given GlcN's widespread use and popularity, particularly in the elderly, it is expected that a significant percentage of users would have diabetes or pre-diabetes. On the basis of this incidence of GlcN use, and the current prevalence of diabetes in the US population, it can be estimated that GlcN is used by almost 400 000 elderly diabetic subjects, and in as many as 2.7 million pre-diabetic individuals. With the ageing population, increasing incidences of diabetes, and increased popularity of dietary supplement use in this population group, the safety of GlcN supplementation in patients with diabetes and those with undiagnosed diabetes warrants consideration as infusion of GlcN in animal models or incubation of GlcN with tissues induces insulin resistance and glucose intolerance.

Mechanistically, it has been hypothesized that the diabetogenic effect of GlcN observed in animal infusion studies is mediated by GlcN augmenting hexosamine biosynthesis in insulin-sensitive tissues, a metabolic pathway that has been implicated in the development of type 2 diabetes. Recent investigations have reported that oral GlcN consumption in humans worsens insulin resistance in subjects at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. To date, these observations have not been critically appraised and, as they have raised concerns among clinicians and the general public that GlcN is contraindicated in people with diabetes and those at risk of developing it, we have herein critically and comprehensively reviewed the published literature.

### A comprehensive review of oral glucosamine use and effects on glucose metabolism in normal and diabetic individuals [^111hFRX2]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

The recent GlcN/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial commissioned by the National Institutes of Health (United States) investigated the safety of GlcN·HCl use in a large number of osteoarthritic subjects (average age 59 years). The study utilized a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled design and evaluated the exposure to GlcN supplementation over a 6-month period. A total of 242 subjects were randomized to receive GlcN treatment (1500 mg/day) and 313 to the placebo group. The study included diabetic subjects (number not reported), who had their fasting plasma glucose or HbA 1c monitored during the study. There were no significant GlcN-induced changes in these parameters on conclusion of the study nor was there an increase in cardiovascular disease risk factors in the diabetic patients who received GlcN.

In a double-blind placebo-controlled study by Tannis et al. conducted in 19 healthy male and female subjects, daily GlcN·SO 4 (1500 mg) for 12 weeks had no effect on fasting glucose or insulin levels and no change in glucose tolerance following glucose challenge. Changes in fasting plasma glucose levels in the placebo- (P) and GlcN-treated (GlcN) groups after 6 weeks were + 6.6% (P) and − 15.8% (GlcN), respectively, with net difference, − 22.4 favouring GlcN. After 12 weeks, the corresponding figures were + 5.4% (P) and − 3.7% (GlcN) with net difference, − 9.2% favouring GlcN.

The effects of acute high-dose oral GlcN administration were investigated by Laferrère et al. in 20 healthy, non-obese subjects with normal glucose tolerance. Six subjects received 3000 mg of GlcN·SO 4, five received 6000 mg of GlcN and nine received an inert placebo in the morning following an overnight fast. Neither of the high doses of oral GlcN affected plasma glucose or insulin levels.

### OARSI guidelines for the non-surgical management of knee osteoarthritis [^114DSvSn]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop concise, up-to-date, patient-focused, evidence-based, expert consensus guidelines for the management of knee osteoarthritis (OA), intended to inform patients, physicians, and allied healthcare professionals worldwide.

Method

Thirteen experts from relevant medical disciplines (primary care, rheumatology, orthopedics, physical therapy, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and evidence-based medicine), three continents and ten countries (USA, UK, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Australia, Japan, and Canada) and a patient representative comprised the Osteoarthritis Guidelines Development Group (OAGDG). Based on previous OA guidelines and a systematic review of the OA literature, 29 treatment modalities were considered for recommendation. Evidence published subsequent to the 2010 OARSI guidelines was based on a systematic review conducted by the OA Research Society International (OARSI) evidence team at Tufts Medical Center, Boston, USA. Medline, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were initially searched in first quarter 2012 and last searched in March 2013. Included evidence was assessed for quality using Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) criteria, and published criticism of included evidence was also considered. To provide recommendations for individuals with a range of health profiles and OA burden, treatment recommendations were stratified into four clinical sub-phenotypes. Consensus recommendations were produced using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Delphi voting process. Treatments were recommended as Appropriate, Uncertain, or Not Appropriate, for each of four clinical sub-phenotypes and accompanied by 1–10 risk and benefit scores.

Results

Appropriate treatment modalities for all individuals with knee OA included biomechanical interventions, intra-articular corticosteroids, exercise (land-based and water-based), self-management and education, strength training, and weight management. Treatments appropriate for specific clinical sub-phenotypes included acetaminophen (paracetamol), balneotherapy, capsaicin, cane (walking stick), duloxetine, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; COX-2 selective and non-selective), and topical NSAIDs. Treatments of uncertain appropriateness for specific clinical sub-phenotypes included acupuncture, avocado soybean unsaponfiables, chondroitin, crutches, diacerein, glucosamine, intra-articular hyaluronic acid, opioids (oral and transdermal), rosehip, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and ultrasound. Treatments voted not appropriate included risedronate and electrotherapy (neuromuscular electrical stimulation).

Conclusion

These evidence-based consensus recommendations provide guidance to patients and practitioners on treatments applicable to all individuals with knee OA, as well as therapies that can be considered according to individualized patient needs and preferences.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^112jhpWq]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

Hip and knee osteoarthritis — dietary supplements and nutraceuticals evidence and recommendation — Many of these dietary supplements demonstrated a small benefit in pain and function in the short-term, but equivalence with placebo long-term; short follow-up times were insufficient to determine long-term adverse events, and evidence from an SR suggested the risk of adverse GI events was higher in the chondroitin group compared to placebo while other studies did not indicate a significant difference between groups for adverse events. This is a Reviewed, New-replaced recommendation; the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of evidence was very low due to significant limitations including small study sizes and heterogeneity of dosing and follow-up times, with some studies industry-funded. Given the low potential for adverse events with most supplements and that many studies reported an improvement in pain and function, the Work Group determined the benefits slightly outweighed the harms, but the risk of adverse events or outcomes from potential drug-supplement interactions needs to be considered in individual patients; thus, the Work Group decided upon a "Neither for nor against" recommendation, noting that research is lacking in methodological rigor and protocol implementation, that more rigorous regulation is required, and that further research is needed into long-term side effect profiles for patients with knee and hip OA.

American College of Rheumatology/Arthritis Foundation guideline — oral/systemic pharmacologic agents for osteoarthritis: Bisphosphonates are strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand osteoarthritis (OA), and the preponderance of data shows no improvement in pain or functional outcomes. Glucosamine is strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA; the weight of the evidence indicates a lack of efficacy of glucosamine, though some patients exposed to glucosamine may show elevations in serum glucose levels. Chondroitin sulfate is strongly recommended against in patients with knee and/or hip OA as are combination products that include glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, but is conditionally recommended for patients with hand OA, with a single trial suggesting analgesic efficacy without evidence of harm in hand OA. Hydroxychloroquine is strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA, with well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in erosive hand OA demonstrating no efficacy. Methotrexate is strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA, and well-designed RCTs in erosive hand OA have demonstrated no efficacy.

### Adjuvant therapies for management of hemorrhagic shock: a narrative review [^114jXciu]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Use in humans

Dietary supplementation with Glucosamine has long been used in the treatment of osteoarthritis with great tolerance, even in the long-term. However, its clinical effect in this indication is still controversial, though some trials have shown an improvement in painful symptoms, and even in radiological symptoms. All of these clinical trials used daily doses of glucosamine, the most common being 1500 mg/day in three doses for adults, which is lower than the amounts used experimentally to achieve a therapeutic effect in HS. Nevertheless, clinical toxicity studies conducted in humans with high doses of glucosamine (30–300 mg/kg in 6 h) have shown that glucosamine is well tolerated; it does not destabilize carbohydrate metabolism at high doses. This paves the way for clinical trials with higher doses of glucosamine.

Another means of acting on O-GlcNAcylation levels are OGA inhibitors. By reducing the activity of the enzyme that removes the GlcNAc moiety from proteins, OGA inhibitors increase proteins O-GlcNAcylation levels. These molecules are used experimentally both in vitro and in vivo. The molecules most commonly used in preclinical studies have not been tested in humans. Recently, however, new molecules have been developed and tested in humans. One of the most promising compounds is MK-8719, an OGA inhibitor with very high specificity developed by Selnick et al. It is currently being studied for tauopathies and has entered a phase 1 trial in humans. Still in favor of the therapeutic potential of O-GlcNAcylation in tauopathies, another group has developed an OGA-inhibiting molecule (LY3372689) that is currently being evaluated in a phase 2 trial in humans because its safety profile was shown to be acceptable in phase 1 clinical studies. These data raise hopes for clinical trials in fields other than neurodegenerative pathologies, and especially in severe trauma and HS.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (Table 5)

Table 5
Summary of histone deacetylase inhibitors testing in hemorrhagic shock models

Biological rationale

Histones are nuclear proteins that DNA wraps around to form chromatin. Acetylation of the lysine residues on histones relaxes the chromatin, making the DNA more accessible to transcription factors. Conversely, hypoacetylation condenses chromatin and makes gene expression more difficult. This hypoacetylation of histone proteins is mediated by histone deacetylase in HS. Histone deacetylase inhibitors counteract this phenomenon and facilitate transcription dynamics, enabling the activation of mechanisms that promote cell survival. There are 18 histone deacetylase isoforms in humans with different actions in different tissues. Some inhibitors are class-specific, whereas others are nonspecific and act on several classes of histone deacetylase.

### Effectiveness of glucosamine for symptoms of knee osteoarthritis: results from an internet-based randomized double-blind controlled trial [^111sop6K]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present the safety and effectiveness results of a prototypical 12-week, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial of glucosamine among subjects with knee osteoarthritis who were recruited and followed entirely over the Internet.

Methods

The study comprised 205 subjects aged 45 years or older with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis who were recruited over the Internet; eligibility was authenticated through medical record review. Participants were assigned randomly to 1.5 g/d of glucosamine (n = 101) or placebo (n = 104), of whom 108 completed the intervention (93 in each arm). The primary outcome measure was the pain subscale of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Likert version). Additional outcome measures included the physical function and stiffness subscales and overall score of the questionnaire, and analgesic use.

Results

There was no difference between treatment and control groups in terms of change in pain score (2.0 ± 3.4 vs. 2.5 ± 3.8, P = 0.41), stiffness (0.7 ± 1.6 vs. 0.8 ± 1.5, P = 0.52), physical function (5.2 ± 9.5 vs. 4.6 ± 9.6, P = 0.49), overall score (7.8 ± 13.1 vs. 7.8 ± 13.5, P = 0.81), and analgesic use (133 ± 553 vs. -88 ± 755, P = 0.12). Stratification by osteoarthritis severity, glucosamine product, and use of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, as well as exclusion of opiate users, did not alter the results. The number and type of adverse events reported was similar between the groups.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that although glucosamine appears to be safe, it is no more effective than placebo in treating the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^111AUNcQ]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Literature search

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, and CINAHL (from inception to June 2010) using a combination of keywords and text words related to osteoarthritis; these were combined with generic and trade names of the various preparations plus a validated filter for controlled clinical trials. We also retrieved reports citing relevant articles via Science Citation Index (1981–2008). In addition, we manually searched conference proceedings and text books, screened reference lists of all obtained papers, and contacted content experts.

Study selection

We included randomised trials with an average of at least 100 patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis per arm. Trials compared chondroitin sulphate, glucosamine sulphate, glucosamine hydrochloride, or the combination of any two with placebo or head to head. A sample size of 2×100 patients will yield more than 80% power to detect a small to moderate effect size of −0.40 at a two sided P = 0.05, which corresponds to a difference of 1 cm on a 10 cm visual analogue scale between the experimental and control intervention. Two of four reviewers (BT, EN, SR, ST) evaluated reports independently for eligibility. They excluded trial arms with sub-therapeutic doses (< 800 mg/day of chondroitin and < 1500 mg/day of glucosamine, in accordance with doses licensed in Europe). Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

### Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are effective in the management of osteoarthritis [^1143pV1f]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2003). Low credibility.

The use of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate for the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis has been a subject of controversy for several reasons. First, the medical community in general took offense at the title of Theodosakis' book, The Arthritis Cure. Second, the medical community is becoming divided into "traditional" and "alternative" camps with deep skepticism between them. Third, the whole nutraceutical industry is essentially unregulated, with manufacturers making outrageous claims on products that have never been tested at all, are often of poor quality, and occasionally lacking in any active ingredient. However, for the nutriceuticals evaluated here, there is abundant in vitro, in vivo, animal clinical, and human clinical evidence of both their efficacy and safety. They deserve a prominent place in the armamentarium of nonsurgical treatment of osteoarthritis.

### Association of habitual glucosamine use with risk of microvascular complications among individuals with type 2 diabetes: a prospective cohort study in UK biobank [^113H75Bd]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2025). Medium credibility.

In this large prospective study of patients with type 2 diabetes, we found that habitual use of glucosamine, a commonly used supplement for the treatment of osteoarthritis and joint pain, was associated with lower risks of composite microvascular complications and diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest that glucosamine could be considered as part of a comprehensive management strategy for patients with type 2 diabetes. Integrating glucosamine into patient care may help reduce the risk of microvascular complications, thereby improving overall health outcomes. However, further research is needed to explore the biological mechanisms underlying these associations and to establish causality through randomized controlled trials. Additionally, examining the long-term effects of glucosamine in diverse populations will provide a robust evidence base for clinical guidelines and public health policies aimed at managing diabetes and its complications effectively.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^1149SXfo]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Whenever possible, we used results of intention to treat analysis including all randomised patients. Pooled effect sizes were estimated from the median of the posterior distribution. A negative effect size indicates a benefit of the experimental intervention. Corresponding 95% credible intervals were estimated from the 2.5th and 97.5th centiles of the posterior distribution. In the presence of minimally informative priors, credible intervals can be interpreted in a similar way to conventional confidence intervals. To determine whether the variation of treatment effects over time was over and above what would be expected by chance, we calculated a P value for heterogeneity across time points of follow-up. The P value was derived from the proportion of observations of the posterior distribution of the variance observed across time points within trials smaller than or equal to the variance within trials typically found in large osteoarthritis trials (0.01 for an effect size scale, 0.0625 for a 10 cm visual analogue scale).

To explore possible time trends, we included a linear term for time as a covariate in the analyses. We then included characteristics of the trials as covariates in the network meta-analysis to estimate effects according to concealment of allocation; intention to treat analysis; high methodological quality defined as adequate concealment of allocation, adequate blinding of patients, and the presence of an intention to treat analysis; source of funding (industry independent v other); type of glucosamine used (sulphate v hydrochlorides); quality control of preparations; and type of joint affected (knee v hip). P values for interaction between trial characteristics and treatment effect were derived from the posterior distribution of covariates and can be interpreted in the same way as a traditional P value for interaction.

Heterogeneity between trials was estimated from the median variance between trials (τ²) observed in the posterior distribution with the following prior distributions: a gamma distribution for heterogeneity between trials (1/τ² ∼ gamma(0.001,0.001)I(0,2000)), and a uniform distribution for heterogeneity between time points (τ ∼ unif(0,50)). In a sensitivity analysis we also used a uniform prior for the heterogeneity between trials. The consistency of the network was determined by use of inconsistency factors: the estimated difference between the effect size from direct comparisons within randomised trials and the effect size from indirect comparisons between randomised trials with one intervention in common. Estimates of variation and consistency are based on back transformations to differences on a 10 cm visual analogue scale. Goodness of ﬁt was assessed with Q-Q plots.

### Comparative effectiveness of glucosamine, chondroitin, acetaminophen or celecoxib for the treatment of knee and / or hip osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis [^111YN4N5]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the efficacies of oral glucosamine, chondroitin, the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin, acetaminophen and celecoxib on the treatment of knee and/or hip osteoarthritis.

Methods

We searched electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library and the reference lists of relevant articles published from inception to October 23, 2017. A Bayesian hierarchical random effects model was used to examine the overall effect size among mixed multiple interventions.

Results

We identified 61 randomised controlled trials of patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis. There was no obvious difference in the results between the traditional meta-analysis and the network meta-analysis. The network meta-analysis demonstrated that celecoxib was most likely the best option (SMD, -0.32 [95% CI, -0.38 to -0.25]) for pain, followed by the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin. For physical function, all interventions were significantly superior to oral placebo except for acetaminophen. In terms of stiffness, glucosamine (SMD, -0.36 [95% CI, -0.67 to -0.06]) and celecoxib (SMD, -0.29 [95% CI, -0.51 to -0.08]) were significantly better compared to placebo. In view of safety, compared to placebo only, celecoxib and acetaminophen presented significant differences.

Conclusions

Given the effectiveness of these non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and symptomatic slow-acting drugs, oral celecoxib is more effective than placebo on relieving pain and improving physical function, followed by the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin. Acetaminophen is likely the least efficacious intervention option. This information, accompanied by the tolerability and economic costs of the included treatments, would be conducive to making decisions for clinicians.

### Use of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate in the management of osteoarthritis [^115faTkb]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2001). Low credibility.

The goals of osteoarthritis therapy are to decrease pain and to maintain or improve joint function. The pharmacologic treatment of this condition has included the use of aspirin, acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. More recently, numerous studies have investigated the potential role of chondroprotective agents in repairing articular cartilage and decelerating the degenerative process. The reports of limited clinical experience with two of these agents, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, as well as the accompanying publicity in the popular media, have generated controversy. Advocates of these alternative modalities cite reports of progressive and gradual decline of joint pain and tenderness, improved mobility, sustained improvement after drug withdrawal, and a lack of significant toxicity associated with short-term use of these agents. Critics point out that in the great majority of the relevant clinical trials, sample sizes were small and follow-up was short-term.

### The gut microbiome-joint connection: implications in osteoarthritis [^116CLwxX]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

NUTRACEUTICALS MAY IMPROVE OSTEOARTHRITIS OUTCOMES VIA EFFECTS ON THE GUT MICROBIOME

Glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, and undenatured type 2 collagen (UT2C) are nutraceuticals marketed as dietary supplements supportive of joint health. In the US alone, these compounds make up a multibillion-dollar industry that spans both human and animal use. In the first major article detailing the protective effects of nutraceuticals on joint disease, Trentham et al. demonstrated that oral consumption of rooster comb type 2 collagen had beneficial effects on biological, structural, and pain outcomes in patients with RA flare. Although this provocative finding was met with broad skepticism because of uncertainty regarding mechanism of action, it was an important early piece of evidence for use of cartilage component-based nutraceuticals to treat joint arthropathies. Various preclinical experiments have also supported the notion that oral supplementation with 'joint protective' nutraceuticals is effective at mitigating osteoarthritis. For example, Dar et al. demonstrated that daily oral consumption of hydrolyzed type I collagen is chondroprotective in murine post traumatic osteoarthritis. Similarly, Bagi et al. demonstrated that oral supplementation with undenatured native chicken type 2 collagen reduced joint degeneration in a rat model of posttraumatic osteoarthritis. As oral supplements composed of cartilage and soft tissue matrix components are the only agents with clinical data supporting positive patient-reported functional improvement in osteoarthritis, we and others have speculated that positive results may be due to an unappreciated action of these agents as prebiotics that can affect the gut microbiome.

We searched MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, ACP Journal Club, DARE, CDSR, and the CCTR. We also wrote letters to content experts, and hand searched reference lists of identified RCTs and pertinent review articles. All searches were updated in January 2005.

Selection Criteria

Relevant studies met the following criteria: 1) RCTs evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucosamine in OA, 2) Both placebo controlled and comparative studies were eligible, 3) Both single blinded and double blinded studies were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data abstraction was performed independently by two investigators and the results were compared for degree of agreement. Gotzsche's method and a validated tool (Jadad 1996) were used to score the quality of the RCTs. Continuous outcome measures were pooled using standardized mean differences (SMD) as the measure of effect size. Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using relative risk ratios (RR).

Main Results

Analysis restricted to eight studies with adequate allocation concealment failed to show benefit of glucosamine for pain and WOMAC function. Collectively, the 20 analyzed RCTs found glucosamine favoured placebo with a 28% (change from baseline) improvement in pain (SMD -0.61, 95% CI -0.95, -0.28) and a 21% (change from baseline) improvement in function using the Lequesne index (SMD -0.51 95% CI -0.96, -0.05). However, the results are not uniformly positive, and the reasons for this remain unexplained. WOMAC pain, function and stiffness outcomes did not reach statistical significance. In the 10 RCTs in which the Rotta preparation of glucosamine was compared to placebo, glucosamine was found to be superior for pain (SMD -1.31, 95% CI -1.99, -0.64) and function using the Lequesne index (SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.96, -0.05). Pooled results for pain (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.35, 0.05) and function using the WOMAC index (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.18, 0.25) in those RCTs in which a non-Rotta preparation of glucosamine was compared to placebo did not reach statistical significance. In the four RCTs in which the Rotta preparation of glucosamine was compared to an NSAID, glucosamine was superior in two, and equivalent in two. Two RCTs using the Rotta preparation showed that glucosamine was able to slow radiological progression of OA of the knee over a three year period (SMD 0.24, 95% CI 0.04, 0.43). Glucosamine was as safe as placebo in terms of the number of subjects reporting adverse reactions (RR = 0.97, 95% CI, 0.88, 1.08).

Authors' Conclusions

This update includes 20 studies with 2570 patients. Pooled results from studies using a non-Rotta preparation or adequate allocation concealment failed to show benefit in pain and WOMAC function while those studies evaluating the Rotta preparation show that glucosamine was superior to placebo in the treatment of pain and functional impairment resulting from symptomatic OA. WOMAC outcomes of pain, stiffness and function did not show a superiority of glucosamine over placebo for both Rotta and non-Rotta preparations of glucosamine. Glucosamine was as safe as placebo.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty), third edition [^113MfTnZ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Oral/dietary supplements for mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis may be helpful in reducing pain and improving function, but the evidence is inconsistent/limited and additional research clarifying the efficacy of each supplement is needed; listed options are Turmeric, Ginger extract, Glucosamine, Chondroitin, and Vitamin D, and the Strength of Recommendation is Limited (downgrade). For glucosamine, included studies showed either improvement or no change in patient outcomes versus control; for chondroitin, included studies showed either improvement or no change in patient outcomes; for turmeric extract, a high quality study showed it could be used over control to improve adverse events, function, and pain; for ginger extract, included studies showed it may be used to improve pain, but there was no significant difference in function versus control; and for vitamin D, included studies showed either improvement or no significant difference in patient outcomes versus control. The oral/dietary supplements recommendation has been downgraded two levels because of inconsistency and need for additional clarity of efficacy, and the United States Food and Drug Administration does not hold dietary supplements to the same standards as prescription medication, so variability can exist between producers of dietary supplements.

Medication selection and clinical considerations in osteoarthritis — for some patients with more limited disease in whom medication is required, topical NSAIDs represent an appropriate first choice, whereas for others, particularly with hip OA or polyarticular involvement, oral NSAIDs are more appropriate. The appropriate use of other oral agents, particularly acetaminophen and opioids, will continue to evolve. Despite the many options available, some patients may continue to experience inadequate symptom control, and clinicians treating patients in these circumstances should choose interventions with a low risk of harm; there are controversies in interpretation of the evidence, particularly with regard to the use of glucosamine and chondroitin, acupuncture, and intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections.

Consensus recommendations ("do not do")

After synthesis (see Supplementary Table 4), 5 "do not do" recommendations were identified (Table 4). The following recommendations were found in at least 2 CPGs, where the majority recommended against the intervention.

Table 4
Consensus recommendations *

Therapeutic ultrasound and pharmacologic interventions (bisphosphonates, colchicine, methotrexate, diacerein)

Three CPGs recommended against the use of therapeutic ultrasound for people with knee, hip, and/or polyarticular OA. Two CPGs recommended against the use of bisphosphonates, colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, and methotrexate in people with knee, hip, and/or hand OA. Similarly, 1 CPG recommended against the use of biologic disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs for people with hand OA. Two CPGs recommended against the use of diacerein for people with knee and/or hip OA.

Glucosamine and chondroitin combined

Two CPGs recommended against the use of glucosamine and chondroitin for knee, hip, and polyarticular OA. One CPG was unable to recommend for or against their combined use in people with OA of the glenohumeral joint. Moreover, 1 CPG conditionally recommended this intervention for people with knee OA, noting that further research is warranted to determine structural effects, patients' suitability, and cost‐to‐benefit ratio.

Postsurgical continuous passive motion and postsurgical cryotherapy devices

Two CPGs recommended against the use of CPM after total joint replacement for patients with knee and/or hip OA, as research found no improvement in outcomes. One CPG recommended against the use of cryotherapy devices for patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In contrast, 1 CPG conditionally recommended the use of cryotherapy or cold packs following total shoulder replacement while acknowledging that this decision was based on the opinion of the working group and not strong/reliable evidence.

Recommendations with no consensus

The following were conflicting recommendations found in at least 2 CPGs: aquatic therapy; balneotherapy; massage therapy; manual therapy; acupuncture; dry needling; heat and cold therapy; electrotherapy; taping and braces; shoe orthotics; footwear; opioids; injections; topical capsaicin; glucosamine and chondroitin individually or combined for OA of the glenohumeral joint; acetaminophen; and nutraceuticals (see Supplementary Table 4).

### Glucosamine long-term treatment and the progression of knee osteoarthritis: systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^114E8iqj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the structural and symptomatic efficacy and safety of glucosamine in knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Data Sources

Clinical trials of glucosamine were identified through electronic searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, EMB review, the Cochrane Library) using the key words glucosamine, osteoarthritis, degenerative joint disease, degenerative arthritis, osteoarthrosis, gonarthrosis, knee, disease progression, and clinical trial. The bibliographic databases were searched from their respective inception dates to August 2004. We also hand-searched reference lists of relevant articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies were included if they were double-blind, randomized, controlled trials that evaluated oral glucosamine long-term treatment in knee OA; lasting at least one year; and reporting as outcome measures the symptom severity and disease progression as assessed by joint space narrowing. Two authors interpreted data independently. Disagreements were resolved through discussion.

Data Synthesis

Glucosamine sulfate was more effective than placebo in delaying structural progression in knee OA. The risk of disease progression was reduced by 54% (pooled RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.73; p = 0.0011). The number-needed-to-treat was 9 (95% CI 6 to 20). The pooled effect sizes for pain reduction and improvement in physical function were 0.41 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.60; p < 0.0001) and 0.46 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.66; p < 0.0001), respectively, in favor of glucosamine sulfate. Glucosamine sulfate caused no more adverse effects than placebo.

Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that glucosamine sulfate may be effective and safe in delaying the progression and improving the symptoms of knee OA. Due to the sparse data on structural efficacy and safety, further studies are warranted.

### Association of habitual glucosamine use with risk of cardiovascular disease: prospective study in UK biobank [^115nBFYg]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

We conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, because participants who took glucosamine also tended to take other supplements more often than participants who did not take glucosamine, we did a sensitivity analysis by excluding participants who used any other supplements. Second, to minimize the influence of reverse causation, we performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding participants who developed CVD events within two years of follow-up. Third, to control the influence of genetic predisposition to CHD or stroke, we adjusted for CHD or stroke genetic risk score.

We conducted all statistical analyses by using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All statistical tests were two sided, and we considered a P value less than 0.05 to be statistically significant.

Patient and public involvement

No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in the design and implementation of the study. No plans exist to disseminate the results to study participants.

### Association of habitual glucosamine use with risk of cardiovascular disease: prospective study in UK biobank [^111KnwqP]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To prospectively assess the association of habitual glucosamine use with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

UK Biobank.

Participants

466 039 participants without CVD at baseline who completed a questionnaire on supplement use, which included glucosamine. These participants were enrolled from 2006 to 2010 and were followed up to 2016.

Main outcome measures

Incident CVD events, including CVD death, coronary heart disease, and stroke.

Results

During a median follow-up of seven years, there were 10 204 incident CVD events, 3060 CVD deaths, 5745 coronary heart disease events, and 3263 stroke events. After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, race, lifestyle factors, dietary intakes, drug use, and other supplement use, glucosamine use was associated with a significantly lower risk of total CVD events (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.90), CVD death (0.78, 0.70 to 0.87), coronary heart disease (0.82, 0.76 to 0.88), and stroke (0.91, 0.83 to 1.00).

Conclusion

Habitual use of glucosamine supplement to relieve osteoarthritis pain might also be related to lower risks of CVD events.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^116tsNmq]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings indicate that glucosamine, chondroitin, and their combination do not result in a relevant reduction of joint pain nor affect joint space narrowing compared with placebo. Some patients, however, are convinced that these preparations are beneficial, which might be because of the natural course of osteoarthritis, regression to the mean, or the placebo effect. We are confident that neither of the preparations is dangerous. Therefore, we see no harm in having patients continue these preparations as long as they perceive a benefit and cover the costs of treatment themselves. Coverage of costs by health authorities or health insurers for these preparations and novel prescriptions to patients who have not received other treatments should be discouraged.

### Glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, and the two in combination for painful knee osteoarthritis [^1148WTrD]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are used to treat osteoarthritis. The multicenter, double-blind, placebo- and celecoxib-controlled Glucosamine/chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT) evaluated their efficacy and safety as a treatment for knee pain from osteoarthritis.

Methods

We randomly assigned 1583 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis to receive 1500 mg of glucosamine daily, 1200 mg of chondroitin sulfate daily, both glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, 200 mg of celecoxib daily, or placebo for 24 weeks. Up to 4000 mg of acetaminophen daily was allowed as rescue analgesia. Assignment was stratified according to the severity of knee pain (mild [N = 1229] vs. moderate to severe [N = 354]). The primary outcome measure was a 20 percent decrease in knee pain from baseline to week 24.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 59 years, and 64 percent were women. Overall, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate were not significantly better than placebo in reducing knee pain by 20 percent. As compared with the rate of response to placebo (60.1 percent), the rate of response to glucosamine was 3.9 percentage points higher (P = 0.30), the rate of response to chondroitin sulfate was 5.3 percentage points higher (P = 0.17), and the rate of response to combined treatment was 6.5 percentage points higher (P = 0.09). The rate of response in the celecoxib control group was 10.0 percentage points higher than that in the placebo control group (P = 0.008). For patients with moderate-to-severe pain at baseline, the rate of response was significantly higher with combined therapy than with placebo (79.2 percent vs. 54.3 percent, P = 0.002). Adverse events were mild, infrequent, and evenly distributed among the groups.

Conclusions

Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate alone or in combination did not reduce pain effectively in the overall group of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Exploratory analyses suggest that the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate may be effective in the subgroup of patients with moderate-to-severe knee pain. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00032890.).

### Does the evidence make a difference in consumer behavior? Sales of supplements before and after publication of negative research results [^116dtNeu]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Echinacea (Echinacea Angustafolia and Echinacea Purpurea)

Echinacea angustafolia and purpurea, two species of purple cone flower, have been used to treat cold symptoms and upper respiratory infections. Two prominent studies, one investigating Echinacea purpurea published in December 2003 and one investigating Echinacea angustafolia published in July 2005, showed no benefit in treatment and prevention of colds. The only significant side effects were an allergic rash in children. These studies were mentioned in 39 and 55 news stories respectively. US annual sales of all echinacea products exceeded $200 million in 2000 and 2001. From 2003 to 2004, sales dropped modestly from $177 million to $153 million (down 14%). Sales between 2004 and 2005 reached a plateau and then dropped further in 2006 from $154 to $129 million (down 16%). These modest declines were not significant, suggesting no substantial immediate impact of the research on sales.

Saw Palmetto

The ripe fruit of the saw palmetto plant (serenoa repens) is used to treat urinary symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The largest US study to date published in February 2006 reported that while well tolerated, saw palmetto was no better than placebo in improving symptoms of BPH.US annual sales of saw palmetto peaked in 2003 at $145 million. This study was mentioned 45 times in news stories around the time of publication. Annual sales dropped only slightly from $137 to $134 million between 2005 and 2006 (down 2.5%).

Glucosamine and Chondroitin

Supplemental glucosamine alone or taken in combination with chondroitin has gained popularity for treating symptoms of osteoarthritis. In February 2006, results from a large federally funded trialshowed that glucosamine alone or in combination with chondroitin did not improve symptoms of osteoarthritis more than placebo. However, a pre-planned secondary analysis suggested that the glucosamine/chondroitin combination was more beneficial than placebo in a subgroup with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis. There were no serious adverse events reported. This study was mentioned in 58 news stories around the time of publication. After publication of the study sales did not substantially change.

### The effects of oral glucosamine on joint health: is a change in research approach needed? [^114bF7pq]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Oral glucosamine (GlcN) has been widely studied for its potential therapeutic benefits in alleviating the pain and disability of osteoarthritis (OA). Its popularity has grown despite ongoing controversy regarding its effectiveness vs placebo in clinical trials, and lack of information regarding possible mechanisms of action. Here, we review the state of knowledge concerning the biology of GlcN as it relates to OA, and discuss a framework for future research directions.

Methods

An editorial "narrative" review of peer-reviewed publications is organized into four topics (1) Chemistry and pharmacokinetics of GlcN salts (2) Biological effects of GlcN salts in vitro (3) Therapeutic effects of GlcN salts in animal models of OA and (4) GlcN salts in the treatment of clinical OA.

Results

Data reporting potent pleiotropic activities of GlcN in in vitro cell and explant cultures are discussed in the context of the established pharmacokinetic data in humans and animals. The available clinical trial data are discussed to place the patient in the context of controlled research on disease management.

Conclusions

Future research to determine therapeutic mechanisms of GlcN salt preparations will require use of standardized and clinically relevant in vitro assay systems and in vivo animal models for testing, as well as development of new outcome measures for inflammation and pain pathways in human OA.

### Total mortality risk in relation to use of less-common dietary supplements [^1123jZnB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary supplement use is common in older US adults; however, data on health risks and benefits are lacking for a number of supplements.

Objective

We evaluated whether 10-y average intakes of 13 vitamin and mineral supplements and glucosamine, chondroitin, saw palmetto, Ginko biloba, garlic, fish-oil, and fiber supplements were associated with total mortality.

Design

We conducted a prospective cohort study of Washington State residents aged 50–76 y during 2000–2002. Participants (n = 77,719) were followed for mortality for an average of 5 y.

Results

A total of 3577 deaths occurred during 387,801 person-years of follow-up. None of the vitamin or mineral 10-y average intakes were associated with total mortality. Among the nonvitamin-nonmineral supplements, only glucosamine and chondroitin were associated with total mortality. The hazard ratio (HR) when persons with a high intake of supplements (≥ 4 d/wk for ≥ 3 y) were compared with nonusers was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.97; P for trend = 0.009) for glucosamine and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.00; P for trend = 0.011) for chondroitin. There was also a suggestion of a decreased risk of total mortality associated with a high intake of fish-oil supplements (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.70, 1.00), but the test for trend was not statistically significant.

Conclusions

For most of the supplements we examined, there was no association with total mortality. Use of glucosamine and use of chondroitin were each associated with decreased total mortality.

### Association of habitual glucosamine use with risk of cardiovascular disease: prospective study in UK biobank [^114XKaBZ]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this study

Our study has several major strengths, including the large sample size and the wealth of information on lifestyle, diet, and other covariates, which enabled us to conduct comprehensive sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses. We acknowledge that our study also has potential limitations. First, the UK Biobank did not record detailed information on glucosamine use, such as the dosage and the duration of use. Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate such associations. Second, the UK Biobank did not collect information on the side effects of glucosamine use. However, glucosamine has been rated the safest supplement for osteoarthritis, with few side effects reported, such as occasional allergic reactions, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and heartburn. Although previous studies have suggested that glucosamine might worsen glucose tolerance in participants with a high risk of diabetes, clinical trials have shown that glucosamine has no effect on glucose metabolism and lipid profile at any oral dose in healthy participants and patients with diabetes.

A third limitation is that specific information on forms of glucosamine supplement (glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, N acetyl glucosamine) was not collected, and so it was difficult to assess whether the association between various forms of glucosamine supplement and CVD risk might differ. However, most glucosamine products available on the market contain glucosamine sulfate. Fourth, it is difficult to separate the effects of a healthy lifestyle from the use of habitual supplements in an observational study. Habitual glucosamine use might be a marker for a healthy lifestyle in this study. Therefore, we could not exclude the possibility that the observed inverse associations were driven by healthy lifestyle factors among glucosamine users, although we had carefully adjusted for potential confounding in our analyses. Finally, potential reverse causality might still exist in our study, although the results remained unchanged when we excluded participants with CVD events that occurred during the first two years of follow-up.

Conclusions

Habitual use of glucosamine supplement to relieve osteoarthritis pain might also be related to lower risks of CVD events. Further clinical trials are needed to test this hypothesis.

Pharmacological interventions

Table 3 presents an overview of the characteristics and RoB of the 33 trials of the most relevant pharmacological interventions to inform the 2018 update of the EULAR management recommendations for hand OA. Trials not listed in table 3 studied topical capsaicin (n = 1), topical salicylates (n = 2), paracetamol (n = 4), glucosamine (n = 1), diacerhein (n = 1), different herbal formulations (n = 3), anti-interleukin-1 (n = 1), clodronate (n = 1), several types of periarticular injections (n = 3), intra-articular hyaluronic acid (n = 9), other intra-articular therapies (n = 2), folate/cobalamin supplementation (n = 1), apremilast (n = 1), galactosaminoglycuronglycan sulfate (n = 1), and pregabalin and duloxetine (n = 1). A description can be found in online supplementary tables (3.2.2, 3.2.4, 3.2.6, 3.2.10, 3.2.12, 3.2.15, 3.2.17, 3.2.22).

Table 3
Characteristics of studies of main pharmacological interventions (n = 33 studies)

The longest trial lasted up to 3 years, though most trials had a duration of 3 weeks. Most studies focused on clinical outcomes, while structure modification was the primary outcome of two trials. The majority were RCTs (n = 30), and few were set-up as CCTs (n = 1) or cross-over trials (n = 2). Seven trials specifically included participants with signs of 'inflammatory OA', all investigating anti-inflammatory agents (ie, NSAIDs, glucocorticoids and anti-TNF). Compared with non-pharmacological interventions, less studies were small (n ≤ 60; 15 trials, 45%). Twelve studies (36%) were at low RoB. Reason to judge studies to be at high or unclear RoB was most often due to problems with randomisation or blinding, and for six studies only a conference abstract was available thus RoB remained unclear. The detailed RoB assessment is presented in online supplementary (3.2.1–3.2.23).

### Conditional recommendations for specific dietary ingredients as an approach to chronic musculoskeletal pain: evidence-based decision aid for health care providers, participants, and policy makers [^112V1uFg]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Glucosamine, Prescription/Over-the-Counter

Glucosamine is an amino sugar naturally produced in the human body. It is required for the synthesis of glucoproteins, glyocolipids, and glucosaminoglycans found in the tendons, ligaments, cartilage, synovial fluid, mucous membranes, eye structures, blood vessels, and heart valves. It can also be derived from marine exoskeletons or produced synthetically. Glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride are delivered orally for many MSK conditions such as temporomandibular disorder, joint pain, osteoarthritis, knee pain, and back pain. Both are also commonly combined with each other or other products (e.g. chondroitin sulfate, N-acetyl glucosamine).

Controversy surrounds the reported effectiveness of glucosamine; however, a Cochrane review recently confirmed that a particular glucosamine sulfate product (Dona, Rotta Pharmaceuticals), as opposed to other formulations, was effective in reducing osteoarthritic pain.

Conditional recommendations were made (62.5% weak; 37.5% strong, in favor) for the use of prescription patented Crystalized Glucosamine Sulfate (pCGS) at daily doses of 1,500 mg for pain and related symptoms. It is important to note that the controversy concerning the use of glucosamine sulfate and combination products containing glucosamine largely reflects the differing regulatory status, labeling, and availability of medications in separate countries and regions of the world. Hence, to date it appears that pCGS, as supplied by RottaPharm, is the only product with a well-documented pharmacological effect.

There is moderate overall quality and certainty that this product will produce a statistically significant effect in reducing pain (SMD = –0.27) compared with placebo. pCGS appears to be well-tolerated, as associated undesirable effects (e.g. mild gastrointestinal complaints) are small to trivial. Although pCGS shows similar effects to ibuprofen, it does take longer to obtain a response. Members mostly agreed that the cost would be negligible to even a moderate savings compared with other active ingredients for pain relief. Moreover, they concurred that it would likely justify out-of-pocket expenses and be both acceptable to stakeholders and feasible/suitable to implement, provided that any implemented supplement had the same purity levels as the pCGS ingredients, as in the RottaPharm product.
