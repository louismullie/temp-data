## Question

What is IUI

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about intrauterine insemination (IUI): what it is, how it works, who benefits, expected outcomes, key procedural decisions, risks, and how to counsel patients on next steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining IUI and its core indications. Then, I should verify the evidence for ovarian stimulation strategies and timing. Next, I will review comparative effectiveness versus alternatives like expectant management, IVF, and other insemination methods. After that, I should quantify outcomes and risk profiles, including multiple gestation. Finally, I will synthesize practical, guideline-concordant recommendations and highlight where evidence is weak or evolving, making sure to self-check each claim against high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and indications so I don't jump ahead: IUI places processed, motile sperm directly into the uterine cavity to bypass cervical barriers and improve proximity to the oocyte. Indications include unexplained infertility, mild male factor, ovulatory dysfunction responsive to ovulation induction, cervical factor, and donor sperm, with typical practice requiring at least one patent fallopian tube and reasonable ovarian reserve before proceeding [^116aGZxB] [^115tkeB2] [^112LyDCH] [^116KvSRD].

> I need to check how ovarian stimulation affects outcomes, because overpromising or understating risks would mislead patients. Evidence suggests that, compared with natural cycles, oral agents like clomiphene citrate or letrozole with IUI probably improve live birth in appropriately selected couples, whereas conventional-dose gonadotropins raise live birth at the cost of unacceptably high multiple gestation rates, and guidelines generally advise against routine gonadotropin-IUI outside specific contexts due to this risk trade-off [^112LyDCH] [^115XGRGp] [^114DxfQY] [^112mLgVi].

> Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of benefit for low-dose approaches. A pragmatic randomized trial in women with an unfavorable prognosis showed IUI with oral stimulation tripled cumulative live birth versus expectant management, while high-quality guidelines note similar pregnancy rates between letrozole-IUI and clomiphene-IUI, and mixed results for low-dose gonadotropins versus oral agents, reinforcing that oral OS-IUI is often the optimal first-line balance of efficacy and safety [^116yk6r3] [^notfound].

> Next, I should review timing and number of inseminations, because practice varies and the evidence base has evolved. Guidelines recommend a single IUI timed about 0–36 hours after hCG trigger in stimulated cycles, and contemporary evidence shows no consistent advantage to double IUI, with older trials suggesting potential gains in select subgroups offset by complexity and costs and a Cochrane review concluding uncertainty about live birth benefit, so routine double IUI should not be standard [^117JkB8P] [^112mLgVi] [^114Habr2] [^112PoAqy] [^112nDAn6].

> Wait, let me verify whether trigger modality changes outcomes. Meta-analytic and Cochrane data indicate pregnancy rates are similar whether IUI is timed to hCG trigger or endogenous LH surge, so the choice should balance patient preference, monitoring burden, and cancellation risk, especially given higher cancellation with LH-only strategies in some studies [^1154mP9v] [^116aGZxB] [^1173zK8m] [^111iHjpx].

> I will now examine alternatives and positioning of IUI in treatment pathways. For couples with a good prognosis for natural conception, expectant management for 6 months can be reasonable, whereas for those with poor prognosis, immediate OS-IUI improves outcomes compared with expectant care, and after about 3–4 cycles of oral OS-IUI, moving to IVF is generally favored over escalating to gonadotropin-IUI given diminishing returns and higher multiple risk with gonadotropins [^115u9cFY] [^116qEM3R] [^112PEz3D] [^115tkeB2].

> But wait, what if donor sperm is involved? I should confirm comparative effectiveness here too. In donor insemination, IUI yields higher pregnancy rates than intracervical insemination in stimulated cycles with cryopreserved sperm, though absolute differences vary and heterogeneity limits certainty, supporting IUI as preferred when feasible [^1163cRco] [^112LyDCH].

> Next, I should review technical aspects of sperm preparation and insemination, since these can materially affect success. Semen must be processed to concentrate motile sperm and remove seminal plasma and leukocytes, with no definitive superiority among gradient, swim-up, or simple wash in randomized trials, and emerging observational data suggest timing sperm preparation completion about 40–80 minutes before IUI may optimize pregnancy rates, though this requires prospective validation before becoming standard [^115CfPH3] [^113CqCht] [^111jPA2G].

> Let me think about outcomes so I don't understate variability. Per-cycle live birth with IUI typically ranges roughly 8–20% depending on age, indication, and stimulation, with most pregnancies occurring within the first 3–4 cycles and cumulative rates rising to about 30–45% after 3–4 cycles in many programs, acknowledging substantial center-to-center and patient-to-patient variability and the importance of prognosis tools in counseling [^116251Qv] [^115Chdwf] [^112adYqZ] [^116bqCL3] [^116qEM3R].

> I should double-check multiple gestation risk because this drives counseling. With oral agents, twin risk is modest, but with conventional-dose gonadotropins, multiple gestation can reach 20–30% of pregnancies, and guideline panels issue strong recommendations against routine gonadotropin-IUI for this reason, reinforcing careful follicle monitoring and cycle cancellation policies when overresponse occurs [^114q8rEB] [^112mLgVi] [^115V3RNo].

> Hold on, I should verify predictors of success to refine expectations. Female age, duration of infertility, and post-wash total motile sperm count strongly influence outcomes, with many programs finding a pragmatic post-wash threshold around 5–10 million motile sperm below which IVF or ICSI becomes more cost-effective, and models like the Hunault prediction tool can stratify natural conception probabilities to guide whether to treat now or wait, while AMH does not reliably predict OS-IUI success [^111LTBk2] [^112sphL8] [^116qEM3R] [^1171a8Jt].

> I need to ensure I address male factor thresholds accurately. Men with very low total motile sperm counts after processing, often cited around or below 5 million, have markedly reduced IUI success and are generally counseled toward IVF/ICSI rather than repeated IUI attempts, aligning with urologic and reproductive guidance [^114BAiYd] [^112YXjnq].

> Let me reconsider the overall treatment algorithm so it's coherent: confirm at least one open tube and reasonable ovarian reserve, offer 3–4 cycles of oral OS-IUI as first-line, avoid routine gonadotropin-IUI due to multiple gestation risk, individualize timing by hCG trigger or LH surge based on logistics and cancellation risk, and proceed to IVF after failure of oral OS-IUI or immediately in older women or those with poor prognosis, integrating prediction models to avoid overtreatment of couples with good chances of natural conception [^112PEz3D] [^115tkeB2] [^116qEM3R].

> Finally, I should confirm that I've flagged uncertainties. Evidence quality varies across comparisons, some timing and preparation nuances remain unsettled, and patient-specific factors like age, duration of infertility, and sperm parameters should anchor shared decision-making, with explicit discussion of cumulative probabilities, costs, and the risks of multiple gestation before committing to higher-intensity strategies [^114eFBgf] [^115tkeB2] [^116qEM3R].

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a fertility treatment that places **washed, concentrated sperm** directly into the uterus around ovulation, increasing the chance of conception by bypassing cervical barriers and timing insemination with ovulation [^116aGZxB]. IUI is used for unexplained infertility, mild male factor, cervical factor, ovulatory disorders, and donor sperm, and is typically combined with **ovulation stimulation** (clomiphene, letrozole, or low-dose gonadotropins) to improve success [^114QMChj] [^114eFBgf]. Success rates vary by age, cause, and stimulation: about 10–15% per cycle in natural cycles, 15–20% with oral agents, and 20–25% with gonadotropins, with a modest increase in multiple pregnancy risk when gonadotropins are used [^114q8rEB]. IUI is less invasive and less costly than IVF and is generally recommended for 3–4 cycles before moving to IVF if unsuccessful [^112PEz3D].

---

## Indications for IUI

IUI is indicated for several **infertility scenarios**, including:

- **Unexplained infertility**: No identifiable cause after standard evaluation [^114eFBgf].
- **Mild male factor infertility**: Slightly abnormal semen parameters [^112E3zo7].
- **Cervical factor infertility**: Hostile cervical mucus or cervical stenosis [^116KvSRD].
- **Ovulatory disorders**: Such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or mild endometriosis [^114QMChj].
- **Donor sperm**: For single women, same-sex female couples, or severe male factor infertility [^112LyDCH].

---

## IUI procedure

The IUI procedure involves several **key steps**:

| **Step** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Ovulation monitoring | - Ultrasound and/or hormone assays (LH, estradiol) track follicular development [^1173zK8m] <br/> - hCG triggers ovulation when follicles mature [^116aGZxB] |
| Sperm preparation | - Semen is washed to concentrate motile sperm and remove seminal plasma and debris [^117J6JJ1] <br/> - Common methods include density gradient centrifugation and swim-up [^115CfPH3] |
| Insemination | - A catheter delivers the prepared sperm into the uterine cavity <br/> - Typically performed within 24–36 hours after hCG trigger [^117JkB8P] |

---

## Success rates and influencing factors

IUI success varies with **female age, infertility cause, sperm quality, and ovarian stimulation** [^116251Qv]. Typical per-cycle success rates are:

- **Natural cycle IUI**: 10–15% [^notfound].
- **Clomiphene citrate or letrozole stimulation**: 15–20% [^notfound].
- **Gonadotropin stimulation**: 20–25% [^notfound].

Success declines with **advancing female age** and longer infertility duration [^115Chdwf] [^111LFkwv].

---

## Risks and complications

IUI is generally safe; **key risks** include:

- **Multiple pregnancy**: Higher with gonadotropins (about 20–30% of pregnancies) [^1144LW6d].
- **Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)**: Rare, more common with gonadotropins [^112sT3oy].
- **Infection**: Rare, minimized by sterile technique [^116fv8Cp].

---

## Comparison with other fertility treatments

IUI is **less invasive and less costly** than IVF, making it a common first-line option [^112tUu9A]. IVF offers higher success rates, especially in older women or with severe male factor infertility, but at greater cost and invasiveness [^113zVjfp].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend IUI as **first-line therapy** for unexplained or mild infertility, typically for 3–4 cycles before proceeding to IVF [^112PEz3D]. Conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI are not recommended due to high multiple pregnancy risk; low-dose gonadotropins or oral agents are preferred [^114DxfQY].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Ideal candidates have **patent fallopian tubes**, a normal uterine cavity, and adequate ovarian reserve. IUI is less suitable for severe male factor infertility, advanced female age, or prolonged infertility duration [^114BAiYd] [^111LFkwv].

---

## Cost-effectiveness

IUI is **more cost-effective** than IVF for initial treatment, particularly in younger women with unexplained or mild infertility. Costs vary by region, stimulation protocol, and insurance coverage.

---

## Psychological and emotional considerations

IUI can cause stress, anxiety, and disappointment, especially after failed cycles. Counseling and support are important to help patients cope with these challenges [^1135QFFt].

---

## Recent advancements and controversies

Recent studies explore **ovarian stimulation protocols**, timing, and sperm preparation techniques [^1173zK8m] [^115CfPH3]. Controversies include the role of double IUI, the optimal timing of insemination, and the use of gonadotropins versus oral agents [^112PoAqy] [^114Habr2] [^114QMChj].

---

IUI is a **less invasive, cost-effective** fertility treatment that places washed sperm into the uterus around ovulation, with success influenced by age, cause of infertility, and stimulation. It is a first-line option for many couples, with IVF considered after unsuccessful IUI attempts.

## References

### GnRH agonist administration at the time of implantation does not improve pregnancy outcome in intrauterine insemination cycles: a randomized controlled trial [^115qUpHX]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether GnRH agonist administration in the luteal phase improves pregnancy outcome in intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycles.

Design

Single-center, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

University-affiliated infertility clinic, between February 2005 and December 2007.

Patient(S)

Three hundred forty-four women undergoing IUI owing to mild to moderate male factor or donor sperm indication.

Intervention(S)

Random administration to either a single subcutaneous injection of 0.1 mg triptorelin (group A; n = 172) 8 days after hCG administration, or solvent only (group B; n = 172) at the same time.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Pregnancy rate was the primary outcome measure considered for assessing the role of triptorelin administration at the time of implantation. Clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and ongoing pregnancy rates were the secondary outcome measures.

Result(S)

No differences were detected between the groups regarding clinical, seminal, or ovarian stimulation parameters. Pregnancy rate per randomized patient was similar in both groups (22.7% vs. 22.1%), as were clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and ongoing pregnancy rates. There was a significant increase in the proportion of multiple pregnancies in the placebo group (10.3% vs. 36.8%).

Conclusion(S)

Administration of GnRH agonist at the time of implantation does not improve the reproductive outcome of IUI cycles.

### Intra-uterine insemination for unexplained subfertility [^113kQZYG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Intra-uterine insemination (IUI) is a widely used fertility treatment for couples with unexplained subfertility. Although IUI is less invasive and less expensive thAppendixan in vitro fertilisation (IVF), the safety of IUI in combination with ovarian hyperstimulation (OH) is debated. The main concern about IUI treatment with OH is the increase in multiple pregnancy rate. This is an update of a Cochrane review (Veltman-Verhulst 2012) originally published in 2006 and updated in 2012.

Objectives

To determine whether, for couples with unexplained subfertility, IUI improves the live birth rate compared with timed intercourse (TI), or expectant management, both with and without ovarian hyperstimulation (OH).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (formerly Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group) Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, inception to Issue 11, 2015), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, PsycINFO and trial registers, all from inception to December 2015 and reference lists of articles. Authors of identified studies were contacted for missing or unpublished data. The evidence is current to December 2015.

Selection Criteria

Truly randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparisons of IUI versus TI, in natural or stimulated cycles. Only couples with unexplained subfertility were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, quality assessment and data extraction. We extracted outcomes, and pooled data and, where possible, we carried out subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

We included 14 trials including 1867 women. IUI versus TI or expectant management both in natural cycleLive birth rate (all cycles)There was no evidence of a difference in cumulative live births between the two groups (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 2.78; 1 RCT; n = 334; moderate quality evidence). The evidence suggested that if the chance of a live birth in TI was assumed to be 16%, that of IUI would be between 15% and 34%. Multiple pregnancy rateThere was no evidence of a difference in multiple pregnancy rate between the two treatment groups (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.53; 1 RCT; n = 334; moderate quality evidence). IUI versus TI or expectant management both in stimulated cycleLive birth rate (all cycles)There was no evidence of a difference between the two treatment groups (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.88; 2 RCTs; n = 208; I(2) = 72%; moderate quality evidence). The evidence suggested that if the chance of achieving a live birth in TI was assumed to be 26%, the chance of a live birth with IUI would be between 23% and 50%. Multiple pregnancy rateThere was no evidence of a difference in multiple pregnancy rates between the two treatment groups (OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.87; 4 RCTs, n = 316; I(2) = 0%; low quality evidence). IUI in a natural cycle versus IUI in a stimulated cycle Live birth rate (all cycles)An increase in live birth rate was found for women who were treated with IUI in a stimulated cycle compared with those who underwent IUI in natural cycle (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.82; 4 RCTs, n = 396; I(2) = 0%; moderate quality evidence). The evidence suggested that if the chance of a live birth in IUI in a stimulated cycle was assumed to be 25%, the chance of a live birth in IUI in a natural cycle would be between 9% and 21%. Multiple pregnancy rateThere was no evidence of a difference in multiple pregnancy rate between the two treatment groups (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.70; 2 RCTs; n = 65; low quality evidence). IUI in a stimulated cycle versus TI or expectant management in a natural cycleLive birth rate (all cycles)There was no evidence of a difference in live birth rate between the two treatment groups (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.49; 1 RCT; n = 253; moderate quality evidence). The evidence suggested that if the chance of a live birth in TI or expectant management in a natural cycle was assumed to be 24%, the chance of a live birth in IUI in a stimulated cycle would be between 12% and 32%. Multiple pregnancy rateThere was no evidence of a difference in multiple pregnancy rate between the two treatment groups (OR 2.00, 95% CI 0.18 to 22.34; 2 RCTs; n = 304; moderate quality evidence). IUI in natural cycle versus TI or expectant management in stimulated cycle Live birth rate (all cycles)There was evidence of an increase in live births for IUI (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.44; 1 RCT, n = 342; moderate quality evidence). The evidence suggested that if the chance of a live birth in TI in a stimulated cycle was assumed to be 13%, the chance of a live birth in IUI in a natural cycle would be between 14% and 34%. Multiple pregnancy rateThere was no evidence of a difference in multiple pregnancy rate between the groups (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.90; 1 RCT; n = 342; moderate quality evidence). The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE methods. Quality ranged from low to moderate, the main limitation being imprecision in the findings for both live birth and multiple pregnancy.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review did not find conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth or multiple pregnancy in most of the comparisons for couples with unexplained subfertility treated with intra-uterine insemination (IUI) when compared with timed intercourse (TI), both with and without ovarian hyperstimulation (OH). There were insufficient studies to allow for pooling of data on the important outcome measures for each of the comparisons.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^112tUu9A]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Intrauterine insemination (IUI), natural cycle — evidence summary states that IUI "is often considered first-line treatment for couples with unexplained or mild male-factor infertility because it is less invasive and less costly than IVF", and that "some clinicians favor natural-cycle IUI over IUI with OS" because "OS increases the risk of multiple pregnancy, which is associated with significantly higher maternal and neonatal morbidities". The guideline reports "seven randomized trials (10–16), one cost-effectiveness study (17), and six cohort studies (18–23)" assessing natural-cycle IUI in unexplained infertility. In a high-quality randomized controlled trial of "580 couples", those "randomized to 6 cycles of IUI alone were not significantly more likely to achieve a live birth than those randomized to expectant management (23% [43/191], and 17% [32/193] live-birth rates, respectively, P = 0.16)".

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^114q8rEB]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Letrozole versus clomiphene citrate with intrauterine insemination (IUI) — comparative outcomes and guidance are as follows: Compared with natural-cycle IUI (live-birth rate 6.2%), adjusted live-birth rates were significantly higher with clomiphene (8.9%, RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2–1.6), letrozole (9.4%, RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3–1.7), and gonadotropins (9.5%, RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3–1.8). Multiple-pregnancy rates were significantly higher with gonadotropins (4.6%, RR 6.2, 95% CI 2.1–18.3) and clomiphene (1.9%, RR 3.8, 95% CI 1.7–16.1) than natural cycles (0.7%), but not with letrozole (1.3%, RR 1.7, 95% CI 0.4–7.7). A systematic review of six randomized controlled trials (1,776 women) found clinical pregnancy rates not significantly different overall between letrozole (199/809 [24.5%]) and clomiphene (201/967 [20.8%], RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.89–1.80, P = 0.20; six studies; heterogeneity P = 0.01), with a subgroup showing higher rates with 2.5 mg letrozole versus 100 mg clomiphene (74/261, 28.4% vs 39/260, 15%; RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.31–2.60, P = 0.0004; no heterogeneity, P = 0.60), and another review reporting similar live birth (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.08), spontaneous miscarriage (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.61–1.38), and twin gestation (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.39–1.68). One RCT using extended letrozole (2.5 mg from day 1–9) versus clomiphene (100 mg days 3–7) showed higher ongoing pregnancy with letrozole (35/106, 33%) than clomiphene (20/105, 19%) (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.11–3.95, P = 0.02). In a high-quality RCT of 900 couples, live birth was lower with letrozole and clomiphene versus gonadotropins (gonadotropins 32.2% [97/301]; letrozole 18.7% [56/299], P < .001; clomiphene 23.3% [70/300], P = 0.02), and multiple gestations among live births were highest with gonadotropins (gonadotropins 32% [31/97]; clomiphene 5.7% [4/70]; letrozole 14.3% [8/56]). There is strong evidence that there is no significant difference in pregnancy rates or multiple-gestation pregnancy rate following letrozole with IUI as compared to clomiphene citrate with IUI. It is recommended that letrozole with IUI treatments be considered as an alternative regimen for couples with unexplained infertility; of note, letrozole is not FDA approved for treatment of unexplained infertility, but is considered an effective and well tolerated option (Strength of Evidence: A; Strength of Recommendation: Strong).

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^115yyXdu]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for intrauterine device, more specifically with respect to timing for placement, general principles, CDC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider performing the insertion of a copper IUD within 5 days of the first act of unprotected sexual intercourse as an emergency contraceptive. Consider performing the insertion of a copper IUD > 5 days after sexual intercourse as long as placement does not occur > 5 days after ovulation, if the day of ovulation can be estimated.

### Timing intrauterine insemination either 33 or 39 hours after administration of human chorionic gonadotropin yields the same pregnancy rates as after superovulation therapy [^115zoJKh]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare a short and long interval between hCG administration and IUI after superovulation for the treatment of infertility.

Design

Prospective, randomized clinical trial.

Setting

University hospital-based fertility clinic.

Patient(S)

Patients planning superovulation and IUI for the treatment of infertility.

Intervention(S)

Patients with ≥ 2 years of infertility enrolled for superovulation and IUI treatment were randomized to IUI after a short (32–34-hour) or long (38–40-hour) interval after hCG injection. Superovulation was accomplished with hMG or recombinant FSH, with dose adjustment until the maturation of two to five follicles, at which time hCG was given. Sperm was prepared with a gradient centrifugation technique, with IUI performed high up in the uterine fundus.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Pregnancy rates.

Result(S)

Of the 348 patient cycles randomized, 270 treatment cycles were initiated. Eighty-one initiated cycles were canceled, leaving 189 completed randomized cycles from 75 patients for analysis. Pregnancy rates were not significantly different between groups. There were pregnancies in 20 of the 96 short hCG-IUI interval cycles (21%) and in 14 of the 93 long hCG-IUI interval cycles (15%) (odds ratio = 0.673, 95% confidence interval 0.297–1.518).

Conclusion(S)

Pregnancy rates are the same after superovulation therapy whether IUI is done after a short or a long interval after hCG injection.

### Efficacy and pregnancy outcome of two methods of semen preparation for intrauterine insemination: a prospective randomized study [^112adYqZ]. Fertility and Sterility (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine pregnancy outcome with two methods of semen preparation for intrauterine insemination (IUI).

Design

Prospective and randomized study.

Settings

Academic tertiary center.

Patient(S)

Three hundred eleven couples undergoing 676 consecutive cycles of assisted conception using IUI.

Intervention(S)

Semen samples collected for IUI were randomized to wash only or density gradient centrifugation (DGC) processing.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Various prepreparation and postpreparation semen parameters were used for IUI. The influence of the method of semen processing, and impact of various semen parameters and female factors on pregnancy were examined by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, logistic regression, and life table analysis.

Result(S)

Of the 676 cycles, 88 resulted in conception leading to an overall clinical pregnancy rate of 13.0% per cycle and 28.3% per patient with a miscarriage rate of 34.0%. Eighty-eight percent of pregnancies occurred in the first three cycles of IUI and 95.5% within the first four cycles. The pregnancy rate for wash only was 11.6% (37 of 319) and the rate for DGC was 14.3% (51 of 356). However, in samples with < 22 million motile sperm in the inseminate, pregnancy rates were 4% for wash and 18% for DGC. The woman's age for both methods and the percentage of sperm in the original semen with a velocity of ≥ 80 micro m/s for the wash method influenced pregnancy outcome.

Conclusion(S)

Although samples with an acceptable number of motile sperm can be processed efficiently by wash only, poor quality semen samples should be processed using DGC.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^115XGRGp]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Clomiphene citrate with intrauterine insemination (IUI) — efficacy and guidance: There is strong evidence that clomiphene citrate with IUI is superior to expectant management and natural-cycle IUI for live-birth rate in couples with unexplained infertility. Multiple gestation pregnancy rates with clomiphene citrate with IUI treatment range from 0 to 12.5%. It is recommended to use clomiphene citrate with IUI in the treatment of couples with unexplained infertility (Strength of Evidence: A; Strength of Recommendation: Strong).

### Intra-uterine insemination for unexplained subfertility [^114eFBgf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-uterine insemination (IUI) is a widely-used fertility treatment for couples with unexplained subfertility. Although IUI is less invasive and less expensive than in vitro fertilisation (IVF), the safety of IUI in combination with ovarian hyperstimulation (OH) is debated. The main concern about IUI treatment with OH is the increase in multiple pregnancy rates.

Objectives

To determine whether, for couples with unexplained subfertility, the live birth rate is improved following IUI treatment with or without OH compared to timed intercourse (TI) or expectant management with or without OH, or following IUI treatment with OH compared to IUI in a natural cycle.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and two trials registers up to 17 October 2019, together with reference checking and contact with study authors for missing or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IUI with TI or expectant management, both in stimulated or natural cycles, or IUI in stimulated cycles with IUI in natural cycles in couples with unexplained subfertility.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, quality assessment and data extraction. Primary review outcomes were live birth rate and multiple pregnancy rate.

Main Results

We include 15 trials with 2068 women. The evidence was of very low to moderate quality. The main limitation was very serious imprecision. IUI in a natural cycle versus timed intercourse or expectant management in a natural cycle It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a natural cycle improves live birth rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a natural cycle (odds ratio (OR) 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 2.78; 1 RCT, 334 women; low-quality evidence). If we assume the chance of a live birth with expectant management in a natural cycle to be 16%, that of IUI in a natural cycle would be between 15% and 34%. It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a natural cycle reduces multiple pregnancy rates compared to control (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.53; 1 RCT, 334 women; low-quality evidence). IUI in a stimulated cycle versus timed intercourse or expectant management in a stimulated cycle It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle improves live birth rates compared to treatment with TI in a stimulated cycle (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.88; 2 RCTs, 208 women; I² = 72%; low-quality evidence). If we assume the chance of achieving a live birth with TI in a stimulated cycle was 26%, the chance with IUI in a stimulated cycle would be between 23% and 50%. It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle reduces multiple pregnancy rates compared to control (OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.87; 4 RCTs, 316 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). IUI in a stimulated cycle versus timed intercourse or expectant management in a natural cycle In couples with a low prediction score of natural conception, treatment with IUI combined with clomiphene citrate or letrozole probably results in a higher live birth rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a natural cycle (OR 4.48, 95% CI 2.00 to 10.01; 1 RCT; 201 women; moderate-quality evidence). If we assume the chance of a live birth with expectant management in a natural cycle was 9%, the chance of a live birth with IUI in a stimulated cycle would be between 17% and 50%. It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle results in a lower multiple pregnancy rate compared to control (OR 3.01, 95% CI 0.47 to 19.28; 2 RCTs, 454 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). IUI in a natural cycle versus timed intercourse or expectant management in a stimulated cycle Treatment with IUI in a natural cycle probably results in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a stimulated cycle (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.44; 1 RCT, 342 women: moderate-quality evidence). If we assume the chance of a live birth with expectant management in a stimulated cycle was 13%, the chance of a live birth with IUI in a natural cycle would be between 14% and 34%. It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a natural cycle results in a lower multiple pregnancy rate compared to control (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.90; 1 RCT, 342 women; low-quality evidence). IUI in a stimulated cycle versus IUI in a natural cycle Treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle may result in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to treatment with IUI in a natural cycle (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.50; 4 RCTs, 396 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). If we assume the chance of a live birth with IUI in a natural cycle was 14%, the chance of a live birth with IUI in a stimulated cycle would be between 17% and 36%. It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle results in a higher multiple pregnancy rate compared to control (OR 3.00, 95% CI 0.11 to 78.27; 2 RCTs, 65 women; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Due to insufficient data, it is uncertain whether treatment with IUI with or without OH compared to timed intercourse or expectant management with or without OH improves cumulative live birth rates with acceptable multiple pregnancy rates in couples with unexplained subfertility. However, treatment with IUI with OH probably results in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to expectant management without OH in couples with a low prediction score of natural conception. Similarly, treatment with IUI in a natural cycle probably results in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to treatment with timed intercourse with OH. Treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle may result in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to treatment with IUI in a natural cycle.

### Oocyte retrieval versus conversion to intrauterine insemination in patients with poor response to gonadotropin therapy [^114zPWQa]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

We compared cycle characteristics and outcomes for planned in vitro fertilization cycles with five or fewer developing follicles that proceeded to retrieval (n = 170) with those that converted to intrauterine insemination (IUI) (n = 50). The risk of no embryo transfer was 24% in cycles that proceeded to retrieval. Live birth rate per cycle started was similar for IUI (6%) compared with retrieval (7%).

### Intrauterine insemination after human chorionic gonadotropin trigger or luteinizing hormone surge: a meta-analysis [^1154mP9v]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the odds of pregnancy after intrauterine insemination (IUI) timed by ultrasound monitoring and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration compared with monitoring luteinizing hormone (LH) levels.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE (Elsevier), Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), ClinicalTrials.gov (National Institutes of Health), and the Cochrane Library (Wiley) from the inception until October 1, 2022. No language limitations were applied.

Methods Of Study Selection

After deduplication, 3,607 unique citations were subjected to blinded independent review by three investigators. Thirteen studies (five retrospective cohort, four cross-sectional, two randomized controlled trials, and two randomized crossover studies) that enrolled women undergoing natural cycle, oral medication (clomid or letrozole), or both for IUI were included in the final random-effects model meta-analysis. Methodologic quality of included studies was assessed with the Downs and Black checklist.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Data extraction was compiled by two authors, including publication information, hCG and LH monitoring guidelines, and pregnancy outcomes. No significant difference in odds of pregnancy between hCG administration and endogenous LH monitoring was observed (odds ratio [OR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.69–1.22, P = 0.53). Subgroup analysis of the five studies that included natural cycle IUI outcomes also showed no significant difference in odds of pregnancy between the two methods (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.46–1.69, P = 0.61). Finally, a subgroup analysis of 10 studies that included women who underwent ovarian stimulation with oral medications (clomid or letrozole) did not demonstrate a difference in odds of pregnancy between ultrasonography with hCG trigger and LH-timed IUI (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66–1.16, P = 0.32). Statistically significant heterogeneity was noted between studies.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis showed no difference between pregnancy outcomes between at-home LH monitoring and timed IUI.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^112PEz3D]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — recommendation states that it is recommended that couples with unexplained infertility initially undergo a course (typically 3 or 4 cycles) of ovulation stimulation (OS) and intrauterine insemination (IUI) with oral agents, and for those unsuccessful with OS and IUI with oral agents, IVF is recommended rather than OS and IUI with gonadotropins; Strength of Evidence: B and Strength of Recommendation: Moderate.

### Screening hysteroscopy in subfertile women and women undergoing assisted reproduction [^111Xm2Gw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Screening hysteroscopy in infertile women with unexplained infertility, or prior to intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilisation (IVF) may reveal intrauterine pathology that may not be detected by routine transvaginal ultrasound. Hysteroscopy, whether purely diagnostic or operative may improve reproductive outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of screening hysteroscopy in subfertile women undergoing evaluation for infertility, and subfertile women undergoing IUI or IVF.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL CRSO, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (September 2018). We searched reference lists of relevant articles and handsearched relevant conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing screening hysteroscopy versus no intervention in subfertile women wishing to conceive spontaneously, or before undergoing IUI or IVF.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. The primary outcomes were live birth rate and complications following hysteroscopy. We analysed data using risk ratio (RR) and a fixed-effect model. We assessed the quality of the evidence by using GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We retrieved 11 studies. We included one trial that evaluated screening hysteroscopy versus no hysteroscopy, in women with unexplained subfertility, who were trying to conceive spontaneously. We are uncertain whether ongoing pregnancy rate improves following a screening hysteroscopy in women with at least two years of unexplained subfertility (RR 4.30, 95% CI 2.29 to 8.07; 1 RCT; participants = 200; very low-quality evidence). For a typical clinic with a 10% ongoing pregnancy rate without hysteroscopy, performing a screening hysteroscopy would be expected to result in ongoing pregnancy rates between 23% and 81%. The included study reported no adverse events in either treatment arm. We are uncertain whether clinical pregnancy rate is improved (RR 3.80, 95% CI 2.31 to 6.24; 1 RCT; participants = 200; very low-quality evidence), or miscarriage rate increases (RR 2.80, 95% CI 1.05 to 7.48; 1 RCT; participants = 200; very low-quality evidence), following screening hysteroscopy in women with at least two years of unexplained subfertility. We included ten trials that included 1836 women who had a screening hysteroscopy and 1914 women who had no hysteroscopy prior to IVF. Main limitations in the quality of evidence were inadequate reporting of study methods and higher statistical heterogeneity. Eight of the ten trials had unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment. Performing a screening hysteroscopy before IVF may increase live birth rate (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.43; 6 RCTs; participants = 2745; I² = 69%; low-quality evidence). For a typical clinic with a 22% live birth rate, performing a screening hysteroscopy would be expected to result in live birth rates between 25% and 32%. However, sensitivity analysis done by pooling results from trials at low risk of bias showed no increase in live birth rate following a screening hysteroscopy (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.18; 2 RCTs; participants = 1452; I² = 0%). Only four trials reported complications following hysteroscopy; of these, three trials recorded no events in either group. We are uncertain whether a screening hysteroscopy is associated with higher adverse events (Peto odds ratio 7.47, 95% CI 0.15 to 376.42; 4 RCTs; participants = 1872; I² = not applicable; very low-quality evidence). Performing a screening hysteroscopy before IVF may increase clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.45; 10 RCTs; participants = 3750; I² = 49%; low-quality evidence). For a typical clinic with a 28% clinical pregnancy rate, performing a screening hysteroscopy would be expected to result in clinical pregnancy rates between 33% and 40%. There may be little or no difference in miscarriage rate following screening hysteroscopy (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.50; 3 RCTs; participants = 1669; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). We found no trials that compared a screening hysteroscopy versus no hysteroscopy before IUI.

Authors' Conclusions

At present, there is no high-quality evidence to support the routine use of hysteroscopy as a screening tool in the general population of subfertile women with a normal ultrasound or hysterosalpingogram in the basic fertility work-up for improving reproductive success rates. In women undergoing IVF, low-quality evidence, including all of the studies reporting these outcomes, suggests that performing a screening hysteroscopy before IVF may increase live birth and clinical pregnancy rates. However, pooled results from the only two trials with a low risk of bias did not show a benefit of screening hysteroscopy before IVF. Since the studies showing an effect are those with unclear allocation concealment, we are uncertain whether a routine screening hysteroscopy increases live birth and clinical pregnancy, be it for all women, or those with two or more failed IVF attempts. There is insufficient data to draw conclusions about the safety of screening hysteroscopy.

### The relationship between duration of infertility and clinical outcomes of intrauterine insemination for younger women: a retrospective clinical study [^1135QFFt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Infertility represents a significant global health issue, with a projected prevalence rate ranging from 10 to 15%. It is estimated that one in every seven couples grapples with an unfulfilled desire to conceive for a duration exceeding one year. Intrauterine insemination (IUI) has always been a first line assisted reproductive therapy (ART) for infertility due to its ease of management, low cost, low incidence of complications and closer approach to natural pregnancy. The current guidelines point out that IUI should be a first-line treatment for unexplained infertile women with appropriate age or ovarian reserve function. However, the clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate of IUI is low, which was reported a live birth rate of 10% for IUI cycles. Patients often require multiple cycles of artificial insemination to enhance the cumulative rates of clinical pregnancy and live birth. This necessity may precipitate depression and emotional distress in couples, potentially impacting subsequent ART outcomes. Therefore, early identification of the possibility of pregnancy after IUI is beneficial for better medical consultation and treatment planning. There are numerous factors affecting the outcomes of IUI cycles described previously, which include the female age, the type of infertility, the infertility duration, the number of IUI cycles, the initial dosage of gonadotropin (Gn), the number of dominant follicles, endometrial thickness, and the sperm parameters. There have been some reports regarding the duration of infertility as a predictive factor for pregnancy outcomes after IUI treatment. Certain research studies propose that extended periods of infertility are correlated with a decreased pregnancy rate following IUI. However, Tay et al. found no relationship between the duration of infertility and pregnancy outcomes. These studies have not achieved a unanimous agreement. Consequently, we undertook a retrospective analysis of IUI cycles at our reproductive medicine centre spanning the years 2016 to 2022. The objective was to investigate the correlation between the duration of infertility and clinical pregnancy outcomes in IUI cycles among women of varying age groups.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^1134uy9h]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility guideline — treatments addressed: The guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for treatments for couples with unexplained infertility, including natural cycle with intrauterine insemination (IUI), clomiphene citrate with intercourse, aromatase inhibitors with intercourse, gonadotropins with intercourse, clomiphene citrate with IUI, aromatase inhibitors with IUI, combination of clomiphene citrate or letrozole and gonadotropins (low dose and conventional dose) with IUI, low-dose gonadotropins with IUI, conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI, timing of IUI, and in vitro fertilization (IVF) and treatment paradigms.

### Effectiveness of intrauterine insemination in subfertile couples with an isolated cervical factor: a randomized clinical trial [^116KvSRD]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

After randomization of subfertile couples with an isolated cervical factor to intrauterine insemination for 6 months or expectant management for 6 months, 26 women (51%) vs. 16 women (33%) conceived, respectively. Of these pregnancies, 22 (43%) vs. 13 (27%) were ongoing (relative risk, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 2.8). There was one multiple pregnancy in the group that was allocated to intrauterine insemination. This trial suggests a beneficial effect of IUI in couples with an isolated cervical factor.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^111GEXoo]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — oral agents and conventional-dose gonadotropins with intrauterine insemination (IUI): In a cohort study, clomiphene and conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI was superior to expectant management (pregnancy rate 34.7% vs. 8.9%, respectively, P < .001), but 16% of pregnancies following gonadotropin treatment were multiple-gestation pregnancies with two sets of triplets, and 3.7% developed moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Pregnancy rates per cycle were significantly higher with IVF-ICSI than with clomiphene plus gonadotropins and IUI (36.6% vs. 5.6% per cycle, respectively, P < .001). An RCT comparing clomiphene with low-dose recombinant FSH vs. low-dose menopausal gonadotropins with IUI found no difference in outcomes, including a live-birth rate of 14.4% vs. 12.6% (recombinant FSH vs. menopausal gonadotropins, respectively, P = NS). A cohort study similarly found no difference when comparing one dose (150 IU) of gonadotropins with IUI to the same protocol with 75–150 IU of hMG on days 5–9, and a quasi-randomized study across IUI, direct intraperitoneal insemination, and timed intercourse found similar per-cycle pregnancy rates with high multiple-pregnancy rates (30% of all pregnancies and 40% of all deliveries). Summary statements on this page include: "There is fair evidence that clomiphene citrate and conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI treatments are associated with higher pregnancy rates than expectant management". and "There is good evidence that clomiphene citrate with conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI treatments are associated with an increased risk of multiple-gestation pregnancy".

### For now, one well-timed intrauterine insemination is the way to go [^116VbVjk]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Two articles on pregnancy rates from superovulation and IUI in relation to the IUI protocol were reviewed. Results from a meta-analysis of IUI number (one vs. two) and from a randomized trial of IUI timing (33 hours vs. 39 hours after hCG administration) suggest that one well-timed insemination within several hours of ovulation represents a reasonable balance between efficacy and cost.

### Single versus double intrauterine insemination (IUI) in stimulated cycles for subfertile couples [^112nDAn6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Intra uterine insemination (IUI), with or without controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH), is one of the treatment modalities offered to couples who have tried to conceive for at least one year (subfertile couples). It has been suggested that increasing the number of inseminations from one per cycle to two might increase the probability of conception.

Objectives

To determine if there is a difference in live birth or pregnancy rates for subfertile couples using single or double intrauterine insemination in stimulated cycles.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility group trials register (searched 8 July 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2002), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2002), EMBASE (January 1988 to July 2002), SCIENCE Direct Database (January 1966 to July 2002), Confsci (January 1973 to 15 July 2002), Pascal (January 1984 to July 2002) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled, parallel trials of single versus double intrauterine inseminations in simulated cycles in subfertile couples.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

Three studies involving 386 women were included. There was no data for the main outcome measure of live birth per couple or ongoing pregnancy rates, and none presented comparative data for adverse events. The results of two studies that reported pregnancy rate per couple did not show a significant effect of using double insemination (Peto OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.78–2.70).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Based on the results of pregnancy rate per couple of two trials, double intrauterine insemination showed no significant benefit over single intrauterine insemination in the treatment of subfertile couples with husband semen. There are no meaningful data to offer advice regarding clinical practice on the basis of this review.

### Poor response cycles: when should we cancel? Comparison of outcome between egg collection, intrauterine insemination conversion, and follow-up cycles after abandonment [^113CfHFT]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine optimal management with one or two mature follicles after stimulation.

Design

Retrospective analysis.

Setting

Lister fertility clinic.

Patient(S)

A total of 1,350 IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles (7.3% of total) during 1998–2009 were found to have one or two mature follicles.

Intervention(S)

Group 1 (n = 807) comprised those who proceeded to vaginal egg collection (VEC) (59.8%; outcome per egg collection), group 2 (n = 248) those who converted to IUI (18.4%; outcome per insemination) and group 3 (n = 259) those who abandoned the current cycle (21.9%; outcome per abandoned cycle in first subsequent cycle).

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Live birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, and biochemical pregnancy rate.

Result(S)

Biochemical pregnancy rates of 13.1%, 4.9%, and 9.7%, clinical pregnancy rates of 8.1%, 3.6%, and 7.2%, and ongoing pregnancy rates of 6.8%, 2.0%, and 5.5% were achieved in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. All pregnancy outcomes were significantly higher after VEC (group 1) than for those converted to IUI (group 2), and all pregnancy outcomes were higher with borderline significance in group 3 vs. group 2. There was no significant difference in outcome between groups 1 and 3.

Conclusion(S)

Our data suggest that for such poor responders, proceeding to VEC may represent their best chance of successful outcome. Conversion to IUI offers the poorest outcome, and despite the potential for improvements in cycle protocol, abandoning and a further attempt does not improve outcome (using abandoned cycle as the denominator).

### Intrauterine insemination versus fallopian tube sperm perfusion for non tubal infertility [^113ywTDW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) together with intrauterine insemination (IUI) is commonly offered to couples with infertility factors not involving the fallopian tubes. Intrauterine insemination gained its popularity because it is simple, non-invasive and cost-effective technique. Another simple non invasive method was introduced called fallopian tube sperm perfusion (FSP). This technique was developed to ensure the presence of higher sperm densities in the fallopian tubes at the time of ovulation than standard IUI provides. Fallopian tube sperm perfusion is based on pressure injection of 4 mL of sperm suspension with attempt of sealing of the cervix to prevent semen reflux. The IUI technique on the other hand is based on intrauterine injection of 0.5 mL of sperm suspension without flushing the tubes. A number of randomised controlled trials have been published comparing the efficacy of FSP with standard IUI. There were considerable variations in the results. The aim of this review was to determine whether outcomes differ between FSP and IUI in improving the probability of conception.

Objectives

To investigate whether outcomes differ between fallopian tube sperm perfusion and intrauterine insemination in the treatment of non tubal subfertility resulting in pregnancies and live births.

Search Strategy

We searched the Menstrual Disorders & Subfertility Group trials register (24 March 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2003) and EMBASE (January 1988 to July 2003). Abstracts of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (1987 to 2003) and European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (1987 to 2003) meetings were searched with the same key- or text words.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled studies comparing fallopian tube sperm perfusion with intrauterine insemination were included in this review. The method of allocation was assessed to determine whether each study was truly randomised or pseudo-randomised. Only first period data of cross-over trials were included for analysis. Couples who have been trying to conceive for at least one year were included but only when the female partner had patent tubes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers (AC and MJ) selected the trials for inclusion based on the quality of the studies.

Main Results

Overall six studies involving 474 couples were included in the meta-analysis. Only one study assessed live birth rates (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.39 3.53). The results for pregnancy rate per couple were statistically significant with FSP showing higher pregnancy rates (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.79 using the odds ratio with the fixed effect model. To check the results the random effect model was used, which gave a wider confidence interval which crossed the line of no significance (OR 1.76, 95% CI 0.77 to 4.05). As a result, these outcomes should be interpreted with caution. Subgroup analysis revealed that couples suffering from unexplained subfertility benefit from FSP over IUI, resulting in significantly higher pregnancy rates (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.73 to 4.78). Excluding studies which used the Foley catheter for tubal perfusion resulted in a significant difference favouring FSP for all indications (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.54 to 3.80).

Reviewers' Conclusions

FSP may be more effective for non-tubal subfertility, but the significant heterogeneity should be taken into account. As a result no advice based on the meta-analysis could be given for the treatment of non-tubal subfertility. Subgroup analysis, which did not show evidence of statistical heterogeneity, suggested that couples with unexplained infertility may benefit from FSP over IUI in terms of higher pregnancy rates. FSP may therefore be advised in couples with unexplained subfertility. Results suggested the possibility of differential effectiveness of FSP depending on catheter choice.

### Pregnancy outcomes of intrauterine insemination without ovarian stimulation in couples affected by unilateral tubal occlusion and male infertility [^111Pi1w1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an effective and frequently used fertility treatment worldwide in the management of couples with unexplained and mild male factor infertility. It is less invasive, less stressful, more cost-effective, and more easily accepted by patients than other available treatments. IUI can be performed with or without ovarian stimulation (OS).

For IUI, at least one patent fallopian tube is required. There are multiple approaches to diagnose tubal patency, including hysterosalpingography (HSG), hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy), and laparoscopy with dye chromopertubation. Although laparoscopy with dye chromopertubation remains the gold-standard test in the diagnosis of tubal pathologies, HSG and HyCoSy are widely used as the first-line approach to assess the anatomy of the uterus and the patency of the fallopian tubes in women with infertility.

Compared to bilateral patent tubes or bilateral tubal occlusion, the diagnosis of unilateral tubal pathology has more limited prognostic significance and management strategies. One management strategy is IUI with OS through the available patent tube. Several studies have demonstrated that the clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and/or cumulative pregnancy rate after IUI with OS in patients diagnosed with unilateral tubal occlusion using HSG were similar to those with bilateral tubal patency and unexplained infertility. Therefore, IUI with OS is reccomended as the initial treatment in infertile women with unilateral tubal occlusion. However, could IUI without OS be an alternative treatment for infertile patients with unilateral tubal occlusion? Information available to date regarding the pregnancy outcomes of IUI without OS in infertile patients with unilateral tubal occlusion remains scarce. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to investigate for couples affected by unilateral tubal occlusion and male infertility: (1) whether significant differences exist in pregnancy outcomes between IUI with or without OS cycles, and (2) whether the pregnancy outcomes of IUI without OS in women with unilateral tubal occlusion were similar to those of women with bilateral patent tubes.

### Evaluation of intrauterine insemination practices: a 1-year prospective study in seven French assisted reproduction technology centers [^116251Qv]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the best practices of intrauterine insemination with the partner's fresh sperm.

Design

Prospective multicenter observational study.

Setting

Assisted reproduction technology (ART) centers.

Patient(S)

Seven hundred and seven patients entering the program, regardless of age or cause of infertility.

Intervention(S)

Intrauterine insemination by standard procedures.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Effect of patient characteristics (duration of infertility, indications, age, parity, body mass index, semen parameters) as well as IUI parameters on delivery rates per couple or per attempt.

Result(S)

The overall live birth rate was 11.4% per cycle, varying from 8.4% to 17.6% between centers. The main differences in practice that had a statistically significant impact on the delivery rate were the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists (15.2% with versus 9.4% without) and the number of mature recruited follicles (9.4% for one versus 15.2% for two).

Conclusion(S)

Our results indicate that the use of GnRH antagonists has a positive effect on the delivery rate, especially in the multifollicular stimulations that are required when women are older than 27 years.

### Double versus single intrauterine insemination (IUI) in stimulated cycles for subfertile couples [^112PoAqy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In subfertile couples, couples who have tried to conceive for at least one year, intrauterine insemination (IUI) with ovarian hyperstimulation (OH) is one of the treatment modalities that can be offered. When IUI is performed a second IUI in the same cycle might add to the chances of conceiving. In a previous update of this review in 2010 it was shown that double IUI increases pregnancy rates when compared to single IUI. Since 2010, different clinical trials have been published with differing conclusions about whether double IUI increases pregnancy rates compared to single IUI.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of double intrauterine insemination (IUI) compared to single IUI in stimulated cycles for subfertile couples.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL in July 2020 and LILACS, Google scholar and Epistemonikos in February 2021, together with reference checking and contact with study authors and experts in the field to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled, parallel trials of double versus single IUIs in stimulated cycles in subfertile couples.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

We identified in nine studies involving subfertile women. The evidence was of low quality; the main limitations were unclear risk of bias, inconsistent results for some outcomes and imprecision, due to small trials with imprecise results. We are uncertain whether double IUI improves live birth rate compared to single IUI (odds ratio (OR) 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 1.88; I² = 29%; studies = 3, participants = 468; low quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following single IUI is 16%, the chance of live birth following double IUI would be between 12% and 27%. Performing a sensitivity analysis restricted to only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with low risk of selection bias showed similar results. We are uncertain whether double IUI reduces miscarriage rate compared to single IUI (OR 1.78, 95% CI 0.98 to 3.24; I² = 0%; studies = 6, participants = 2363; low quality evidence). The evidence suggests that chance of miscarriage following single IUI is 1.5% and the chance following double IUI would be between 1.5% and 5%. The reported clinical pregnancy rate per woman randomised may increase with double IUI group (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.86; I² = 34%; studies = 9, participants = 2716; low quality evidence). This result should be interpreted with caution due to the low quality of the evidence and the moderate inconsistency. The evidence suggests that the chance of a pregnancy following single IUI is 14% and the chance following double IUI would be between 16% and 23%. We are uncertain whether double IUI affects multiple pregnancy rate compared to single IUI (OR 2.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 4.56; I² = 8%; studies = 5; participants = 2203; low quality evidence). The evidence suggests that chance of multiple pregnancy following single IUI is 0.7% and the chance following double IUI would be between 0.85% and 3.7%. We are uncertain whether double IUI has an effect on ectopic pregnancy rate compared to single IUI (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.28; I² = 0%; studies = 4, participants = 1048; low quality evidence). The evidence suggests that the chance of an ectopic pregnancy following single IUI is 0.8% and the chance following double IUI would be between 0.3% and 3.2%.

Authors' Conclusions

Our main analysis, of which the evidence is low quality, shows that we are uncertain if double IUI improves live birth and reduces miscarriage compared to single IUI. Our sensitivity analysis restricted to studies of low risk of selection bias for both outcomes is consistent with the main analysis. Clinical pregnancy rate may increase in the double IUI group, but this should be interpreted with caution due to the low quality evidence. We are uncertain whether double IUI has an effect on multiple pregnancy rate and ectopic pregnancy rate compared to single IUI.

### Clomiphene citrate monitoring for intrauterine insemination timing: a randomized trial [^111iHjpx]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare pregnancy rates with two different methods of intrauterine insemination (IUI) timing in patients treated with clomiphene citrate (CC).

Design

Prospective, randomized trial.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Patient(S)

One hundred fifty ovulatory, infertile women.

Intervention(S)

Patients were randomized into a luteinizing hormone (LH) surge group or a follicle monitoring/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) group. All patients underwent baseline ultrasound, and took clomiphene citrate, during days 5–9. Patients in the LH surge group underwent IUI on the day after a home test for the LH surge was positive, whereas those in the hCG group received hCG according to ultrasound parameters and underwent insemination 33–40 hours later. Patients remained in the same study group for up to three cycles.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Pregnancy rates per cycle and per patient.

Result(S)

No significant differences were found between groups in pregnancy rates per patient or per cycle. The LH surge group underwent IUI significantly later than the hCG group. Cancellation rates were significantly higher for the LH surge group (31% vs. 11%) and attributable mainly to failure to detect an LH surge. The majority of pregnancies in both treatment groups occurred in the first cycle.

Conclusion(S)

The decision to use hCG for IUI timing should be influenced by factors other than pregnancy rates.

### Synchronised approach for intrauterine insemination in subfertile couples [^1173zK8m]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is widely used as a first-line treatment for subfertile couples with favourable prognostic factors, yet pregnancy rates vary considerably. The optimal method for timing IUI - whether through different monitoring strategies or ovulation triggering techniques in natural or stimulated cycles - remains uncertain. This review explores which timing approaches and methods of ovulation monitoring and triggering lead to the best outcomes, including live birth and clinical pregnancy. It updates a Cochrane review last published in 2014.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of different methods of synchronisation of insemination with ovulation on live birth or ongoing pregnancy, in natural and stimulated cycles for IUI in subfertile couples.

Search Methods

We used the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and two other databases, along with reference checking, citation searching, handsearching of conference abstracts, and contact with study authors to identify the studies included in the review. The latest search date was October 2023.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing timing methods in natural or stimulated cycles, and different ovulation triggering methods. These included: varying the time interval between ovulation triggering and insemination, luteinising hormone (LH) detection in urine, LH detection in blood, basal body temperature charts, ultrasound detection of ovulation, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration, a combination of LH detection and hCG administration, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist administration, and other trigger administrations.

Outcomes

Critical outcome: live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate per couple. Important outcomes (all are rate per couple): clinical pregnancy; multiple pregnancy; miscarriage; ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome; tubal pregnancy.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane Collaboration's original tool to assess the risk of bias in the included RCTs.

Synthesis Methods

After the search, we screened the trials, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias and trustworthiness of the included studies. We synthesised results for each outcome using meta-analysis where possible. We expressed results for each included study as Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Included Studies

This review update includes 42 studies: 18 from the 2014 version, plus 24 studies newly identified in the updated search.

Synthesis Of Results

Of the 42 included studies (a total of 6603 couples), we included seven in the primary meta-analyses (1917 couples) and 12 in the sensitivity meta-analyses (2143 couples). The certainty of the evidence was low for most comparisons. The main limitation of the evidence was serious imprecision. Of the seven studies included in the primary analyses, two compared the optimum time interval from hCG injection to IUI for live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate, comparing different time frames ranging from 0 to 48 hours. We categorised the time frames into three groups: (i) 0 to 33 hours; (ii) 34 to 40 hours; and (iii) more than 40 hours. We compared 0 to 33 hours versus 34 to 40 hours, and 34 to 40 hours versus more than 40 hours. Results were too imprecise to be informative in both comparisons (0 to 33 hours versus 34 to 40 hours: OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.23; 1 study, 374 couples; 34 to 40 hours versus more than 40 hours: OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.33; 1 study, 107 couples). We included one study in the primary analysis for each of the following comparisons: hCG versus LH surge; recombinant hCG versus urinary hCG; and hCG alone versus hCG plus follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). It is unclear whether there might be a difference in live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates in the first two comparisons: hCG versus LH surge: OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.37; 1 study, 392 couples; low-certainty evidence; recombinant hCG versus urinary hCG: OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.63; 1 study, 125 couples; low-certainty evidence. However, live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates may be lower with hCG alone compared to hCG plus FSH (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.95; 1 study, 108 couples; low-certainty evidence). We found no clear evidence of a difference between any of the groups in clinical pregnancy rate or adverse events (multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, tubal pregnancy rate). However, all results were of low-certainty evidence. None of the studies included in the primary analyses reported on ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is any difference in effectiveness between different methods of synchronisation of ovulation and insemination.

Funding

This Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.

### Synchronised approach for intrauterine insemination in subfertile couples [^112r61dH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) should logically be performed around the moment of ovulation. Since spermatozoa and oocytes have only limited survival times correct timing is essential. As it is not known which technique of timing for IUI results in the best treatment outcome, we compared different techniques for timing IUI and different time intervals.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of different synchronisation methods in natural and stimulated cycles for IUI in subfertile couples.

Search Strategy

We searched for all publications which described randomised controlled trials of the timing of IUI. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), (1966 to March 2009), EMBASE (1974 to March 2009) and Science Direct (1966 to March 2009) electronic databases. Furthermore, we checked the reference lists of all obtained studies and performed a handsearch of conference abstracts.

Selection Criteria

Only truly randomised controlled trials comparing different timing methods for IUI were included. The following interventions were evaluated: detection of luteinising hormone (LH) in urine or blood, single test; human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration; combination of LH detection and hCG administration; basal body temperature chart; ultrasound detection of ovulation; gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist administration; or other timing methods.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the trials to be included according to the above mentioned criteria. We performed statistical analyses in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Ten studies were included comparing urinary LH surge versus hCG injection; recombinant hCG versus urinary hCG; and hCG versus a GnRH agonist. One study compared the optimum time interval from hCG injection to IUI. The results of these studies showed no significant differences between different timing methods for IUI expressed as live birth rates: hCG versus LH surge (odds ratio (OR) 1.0, 95% CI 0.06 to 18); urinary hCG versus recombinant hCG (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.0); and hCG versus GnRH agonist (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.1). All the secondary outcomes analysed showed no significant differences between treatment groups.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence to advise one particular treatment option over another. The choice should be based on hospital facilities, convenience for the patient, medical staff, costs and drop-out levels. Since different time intervals between hCG and IUI did not result in different pregnancy rates, a more flexible approach might be allowed.

### Semen preparation techniques for intrauterine insemination [^113CqCht]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Semen preparation techniques for assisted reproduction, including intrauterine insemination (IUI), were developed to separate the motile morphological normal spermatozoa. Leucocytes, bacteria and dead spermatozoa produce oxygen radicals that negatively influence the ability to fertilize the egg. The yield of as many motile, morphologically normal spermatozoa might influence treatment choices and therefore outcomes.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of gradient, swim-up, or wash and centrifugation in subfertile couples undergoing intrauterine insemination (IUI) on clinical outcome as well as on semen parameters.

Search Strategy

We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's trials register (30 June 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2003), EMBASE (1980 to July 2003), Science Direct Database (1966 to July 2003), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2003), National Research Register (2000 to Issue 2, 2003), Biological Abstracts (2000 to June 2003), CINAHL (1982 to July 2003) and reference lists of relevant articles. We also contacted experts and authors in the field.

Selection Criteria

Parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), comparing the efficacy of semen preparation techniques used for subfertile couples undergoing IUI, were included. RCTs or split sample studies examining semen parameters after different semen preparation techniques were also included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

Two randomised controlled trials comparing clinical outcomes, including 81 participants in total, were included in the meta-analysis (Dodson 1998-I/ II; Xu 2000-I/ II). Both studies compared swim-up technique versus gradient technique in 65 subfertile couples undergoing IUI. One study compared the effectiveness of both techniques with wash technique. No trials reported the primary outcome of live birth. There was no statistically significant difference between pregnancy rates (PR) for swim-up versus gradient / wash centrifuge (Peto OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.76; Peto OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.2 to 14.9; PR/ couple swim-up 20%, gradient 40%, wash 12.5%) or gradient versus wash centrifuge (Peto OR 4.01, 95% CI 0.82 to 19.56; PR/ couple swim-up 15%, gradient 20%). There was no significant difference in the miscarriage rate (MR) per couple between either of the three treatment groups in the one trial reporting this outcome (MR/ couple swim-up 0%, gradient 10.3%, wash 0%. MR/ pregnancy gradient 30.3%). There was no statistically significant difference in the multiple pregnancy rate (MPR) per couple between either of the three treatment groups in Dodson 1998-I/ II (MPR/ couple swim -up 0%, gradient 0%, wash 6.3%). One triplet pregnancy was recorded. Fifteen studies comparing semen parameters after processing were included. Two studies were included in the meta-analysis, we were not able to pool results.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific preparation technique. Large high quality randomised controlled trials, comparing the effectiveness of a gradient and/ or a swim-up and/ or wash and centrifugation technique on clinical outcome are lacking. Further randomised trials are warranted. Results from studies comparing semen parameters may suggest a preference for gradient technique, but firm conclusions cannot be drawn and the limitations should be taken into consideration.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^115tkeB2]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based recommendations to practicing physicians and others regarding the effectiveness and safety of therapies for unexplained infertility.

Methods

ASRM conducted a literature search, which included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and prospective and retrospective comparative observational studies published from 1968 through 2019. The ASRM Practice Committee and a task force of experts used available evidence and informal consensus to develop evidence-based guideline recommendations.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Outcomes of interest included: live-birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, implantation rate, fertilization rate, multiple pregnancy rate, dose of treatment, rate of ovarian hyperstimulation, abortion rate, and ectopic pregnancy rate.

Result(S)

The literature search identified 88 relevant studies to inform the evidence base for this guideline.

Recommendation(S)

Evidence-based recommendations were developed for the following treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: natural cycle with intrauterine insemination (IUI); clomiphene citrate with intercourse; aromatase inhibitors with intercourse; gonadotropins with intercourse; clomiphene citrate with IUI; aromatase inhibitors with IUI; combination of clomiphene citrate or letrozole and gonadotropins (low dose and conventional dose) with IUI; low-dose gonadotropins with IUI; conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI; timing of IUI; and in vitro fertilization and treatment paradigms.

Conclusion(S)

The treatment of unexplained infertility is by necessity empiric. For most couples, the best initial therapy is a course (typically 3 or 4 cycles) of ovarian stimulation with oral medications and intrauterine insemination (OS-IUI) followed by in vitro fertilization for those unsuccessful with OS-IUI treatments.

### Ovarian stimulation protocols (anti-oestrogens, gonadotrophins with and without GnRH agonists / antagonists) for intrauterine insemination (IUI) in women with subfertility [^114S7y9x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) combined with ovarian hyperstimulation (OH) has been demonstrated to be an effective form of treatment for subfertile couples. Several ovarian stimulation protocols combined with IUI have been proposed, but it is still not clear which stimulation protocol and which dose is the most cost-effective.

Objectives

To evaluate ovarian stimulation protocols for intrauterine insemination for all indications.

Search Strategy

We searched for all publications which described randomised controlled trials comparing different ovarian stimulation protocols followed by IUI. We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). We searched the electronic databases of MEDLINE (January 1966 to present) and EMBASE (1980 to present).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials only were considered for inclusion in this review. Trials comparing different ovarian stimulation protocols combined with IUI were selected and reviewed in detail.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors independently assess trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Forty three trials involving 3957 women were included. There were 11 comparisons in this review. Pregnancy rates are reported here since results of live birth rates were lacking. Seven studies (n = 556) were pooled comparing gonadotrophins with anti-oestrogens showing significant higher pregnancy rates with gonadotrophins (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.7). Five studies (n = 313) compared anti-oestrogens with aromatase inhibitors reporting no significant difference (OR 1.2 95% CI 0.64 to 2.1). The same could be concluded comparing different types of gonadotrophins (9 studies included, n = 576). Four studies (n = 391) reported the effect of adding a GnRH agonist which did not improve pregnancy rates (OR 0.98 95% CI 0.6 to 1.6), although it resulted in significant higher multiple pregnancy rates (OR 2.9 95% CI 1.0 to 8). Data of three studies (n = 299) showed no convincing evidence of adding a GnRH antagonist to gonadotrophins (OR 1.5 95% CI 0.83 to 2.8). The results of two studies (n = 297) reported no evidence of benefit in doubling the dose of gonadotrophins (OR 1.2 95% 0.67 to 1.9) although the multiple pregnancy rates and OHSS rates were increased. For the remaining five comparisons only one or none studies were included.

Authors' Conclusions

Robust evidence is lacking but based on the available results gonadotrophins might be the most effective drugs when IUI is combined with ovarian hyperstimulation. When gonadotrophins are applied it might be done on a daily basis. When gonadotrophins are used for ovarian stimulation low dose protocols are advised since pregnancy rates do not differ from pregnancy rates which result from high dose regimen, whereas the chances to encounter negative effects from ovarian stimulation such as multiples and OHSS are limited with low dose gonadotrophins. Further research is needed for each comparison made.

### Interventions for unexplained infertility: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112sT3oy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical management for unexplained infertility includes expectant management as well as active treatments, including ovarian stimulation (OS), intrauterine insemination (IUI), OS-IUI, and in vitro fertilisation (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Existing systematic reviews have conducted head-to-head comparisons of these interventions using pairwise meta-analyses. As this approach allows only the comparison of two interventions at a time and is contingent on the availability of appropriate primary evaluative studies, it is difficult to identify the best intervention in terms of effectiveness and safety. Network meta-analysis compares multiple treatments simultaneously by using both direct and indirect evidence and provides a hierarchy of these treatments, which can potentially better inform clinical decision-making.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different approaches to clinical management (expectant management, OS, IUI, OS-IUI, and IVF/ICSI) in couples with unexplained infertility.

Search Methods

We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We searched electronic databases including the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL, up to 6 September 2018, as well as reference lists, to identify eligible studies. We also searched trial registers for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing at least two of the following clinical management options in couples with unexplained infertility: expectant management, OS, IUI, OS-IUI, and IVF (or combined with ICSI).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts identified by the search strategy. We obtained the full texts of potentially eligible studies to assess eligibility and extracted data using standardised forms. The primary effectiveness outcome was a composite of cumulative live birth or ongoing pregnancy, and the primary safety outcome was multiple pregnancy. We performed a network meta-analysis within a random-effects multi-variate meta-analysis model. We presented treatment effects by using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For the network meta-analysis, we used Confidence in Network Meta-analysis (CINeMA) to evaluate the overall certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 27 RCTs (4349 couples) in this systematic review and 24 RCTs (3983 couples) in a subsequent network meta-analysis. Overall, the certainty of evidence was low to moderate: the main limitations were imprecision and/or heterogeneity. Ten RCTs including 2725 couples reported on live birth. Evidence of differences between OS, IUI, OS-IUI, or IVF/ICSI versus expectant management was insufficient (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.98; low-certainty evidence; OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.43; low-certainty evidence; OR 1.61, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.94; low-certainty evidence; OR 1.88, 95 CI 0.81 to 4.38; low-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of live birth following expectant management is assumed to be 17%, the chance following OS, IUI, OS-IUI, and IVF would be 9% to 28%, 11% to 33%, 15% to 37%, and 14% to 47%, respectively. When only including couples with poor prognosis of natural conception (3 trials, 725 couples) we found OS-IUI and IVF/ICSI increased live birth rate compared to expectant management (OR 4.48, 95% CI 2.00 to 10.1; moderate-certainty evidence; OR 4.99, 95 CI 2.07 to 12.04; moderate-certainty evidence), while there was insufficient evidence of a difference between IVF/ICSI and OS-IUI (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.60; low-certainty evidence). Eleven RCTs including 2564 couples reported on multiple pregnancy. Compared to expectant management/IUI, OS (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 9.41; low-certainty evidence) and OS-IUI (OR 3.34 95% CI 1.09 to 10.29; moderate-certainty evidence) increased the odds of multiple pregnancy, and there was insufficient evidence of a difference between IVF/ICSI and expectant management/IUI (OR 2.66, 95% CI 0.68 to 10.43; low-certainty evidence). These findings suggest that if the chance of multiple pregnancy following expectant management or IUI is assumed to be 0.6%, the chance following OS, OS-IUI, and IVF/ICSI would be 0.6% to 5.0%, 0.6% to 5.4%, and 0.4% to 5.5%, respectively. Trial results show insufficient evidence of a difference between IVF/ICSI and OS-IUI for moderate/severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (OR 2.50, 95% CI 0.92 to 6.76; 5 studies; 985 women; moderate-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of moderate/severe OHSS following OS-IUI is assumed to be 1.1%, the chance following IVF/ICSI would be between 1.0% and 7.2%.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence of differences in live birth between expectant management and the other four interventions (OS, IUI, OS-IUI, and IVF/ICSI). Compared to expectant management/IUI, OS may increase the odds of multiple pregnancy, and OS-IUI probably increases the odds of multiple pregnancy. Evidence on differences between IVF/ICSI and expectant management for multiple pregnancy is insufficient, as is evidence of a difference for moderate or severe OHSS between IVF/ICSI and OS-IUI.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^112QedWN]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility background and treatment definitions: Of couples experiencing infertility, up to 30% are diagnosed with unexplained infertility after a standard evaluation. Ovarian stimulation (OS) refers to pharmacological treatment with the intent of inducing development of multiple mature ovarian follicles and should be distinguished from ovulation induction, which refers to the pharmacological treatment of the anovulatory woman to induce ovulation. OS with intrauterine insemination (OS-IUI) is believed to improve fecundity by increasing the number of available oocytes and the number of motile sperm in the uterus at the time of ovulation. Other proposed treatments include IUI in unstimulated (natural) cycles and OS with timed intercourse.

### Cervical insemination versus intra-uterine insemination of donor sperm for subfertility [^112LyDCH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Insemination with donor sperm is an option for couples for whom in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has been unsuccessful, couples with azoospermia and for single women or same sex couples. Insemination of sperm can be done via cervical (CI) or intra-uterine (IUI) routes. IUI has been considered potentially more effective than CI as the sperm bypasses the cervical mucus and is deposited closer to the fallopian tubes. The cost and risks of IUI may be higher because of the need for sperm preparation and the introduction of foreign material into the uterus. Donor sperm used for artificial insemination is mainly cryopreserved, due to concerns about HIV transmission. However, cycle fecundity is higher for fresh sperm. Insemination is often combined with ovulatory stimulation, with either clomiphene or gonadotrophin. There may be risks associated with these therapies, such as higher multiple pregnancy rates.

Objectives

To determine whether pregnancy outcomes are improved using intra-uterine insemination in comparison to cervical insemination in women undergoing artificial insemination with donor sperm.

Search Strategy

The following databases were searched: the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the reference lists of articles retrieved.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing IUI with CI were included. Crossover studies were included if pre-crossover data was available.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study quality assessment and data extraction were carried out independently by two review authors (DB, JM). Authors of studies that potentially met the inclusion criteria were contacted, where possible if additional information was needed.

Main Results

The search strategy found 232 articles. Fifteen studies potentially met the inclusion criteria. Four studies were included in this review. All the included studies used cryopreserved sperm in stimulated cycles. In two studies 134 women had gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles and in two studies 74 women had clomiphene-stimulated cycles. The evidence showed that IUI after 6 cycles significantly improved live birth rates (odds ratio (OR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 3.86) and pregnancy rates (OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.90 to 5.96) in comparison to cervical insemination. There was no statistically significant evidence of an effect on multiple pregnancies (OR 2.19, 95% CI 0.79 to 6.07) or miscarriages (relative risk (RR) 3.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 17.96).

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this systematic review support the use of IUI rather than CI in stimulated cycles using cryopreserved sperm for donor insemination.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^114dZ6gq]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Low-dose gonadotropins with intrauterine insemination (IUI) — in couples with unexplained infertility who have a good or intermediate prognosis for unassisted conception, there is fair evidence that treatment with low-dose gonadotropins with IUI is no more effective than 6 months of expectant management. There is no difference in multiple-pregnancy rates between clomiphene citrate or letrozole with IUI treatments compared to low-dose gonadotropins with IUI. It is not recommended to use low-dose gonadotropins with IUI in the treatment of unexplained infertility, as it is more complex and expensive, and likely no more effective than OS with oral medications with IUI (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate).

### Effect of sperm morphology on pregnancy success via intrauterine insemination: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116smfsb]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Men with abnormal sperm morphology are often counseled that natural conception and intrauterine insemination are ineffective, and in vitro fertilization is the only option. Our objective was to determine the effect of sperm morphology on the pregnancy success of intrauterine insemination.

Materials and Methods

We systematically searched for studies published prior to January 2017 that 1) reported ultrasound verified clinical pregnancies per intrauterine insemination cycle, 2) assessed sperm morphology using the Kruger strict criteria and 3) described morphology at the greater than 4% and 4% or less and/or the 1% or greater and less than 1% thresholds. In all studies mean female age was between 25 and 40 years and mean total motile sperm count was greater than 10 million. Estimates were pooled using random effects meta-analysis.

Results

Data were extracted from 20 observational studies involving a total of 41,018 cycles. When comparing men at the greater than 4% and 4% or less thresholds, the rate of ultrasound verified pregnancy per intrauterine insemination cycle was not statistically or clinically different (14.2% vs 12.1%, p = 0.06) and the risk difference was 3.0% (95% CI 1.4–4.6), indicating 3.0 additional pregnancies per 100 intrauterine insemination cycles. When comparing men at the 1% or greater and the less than 1% thresholds, there were no statistical or clinical differences in the rate of ultrasound verified pregnancy per cycle of intrauterine insemination (14.0% vs 13.9%, p = 0.97) or in the risk difference (1.6%, 95% CI -4.5–7.6).

Conclusions

There appears to be no clinical difference in intrauterine insemination pregnancy success among men with normal and abnormal sperm morphology when accounting for total motile sperm count and female age. Abnormal sperm morphology alone should not exclude couples from attempting intrauterine insemination.

### Success of intrauterine insemination in women aged 40–42 years [^115Chdwf]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine how advancing female age decreases successful outcomes of intrauterine insemination (IUI) alone or combined with ovarian stimulation.

Design

Retrospective review.

Setting

Academic fertility center.

Patient(S)

Infertile men and women.

Intervention(S)

Intrauterine insemination alone or combined with ovarian stimulation.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Pregnancy rates, miscarriage rates, and live birth rates per insemination cycle according to female age.

Result(S)

The 1,117 cycles of IUI resulted in 217 pregnancies, for an overall pregnancy rate for all female ages of 19.4% and a live birth rate of 12.9% per cycle inseminated. The overall live birth rate per insemination declined with advancing maternal age.

Conclusion(S)

Advancing female age decreases successful outcomes with IUI. The live birth rate with IUI for women 40–42 years old (n = 82) was 9.8% per insemination and may demonstrate that IUI is an appropriate treatment for this age group of women.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^112behWU]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — recommendation on combining oral agents with conventional-dose gonadotropins for intrauterine insemination (IUI): "It is not recommended to use letrozole or clomiphene citrate plus conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI, as most studies associated with improved pregnancy rate over OS-IUI with oral medications are also associated with an increased risk of multiple-gestation pregnancy. (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate)"

### A new accurate model to assess intrauterine insemination success based on clinical parameters: optimizing fertility treatment [^1164MLZT]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop a predictive model for intrauterine insemination (IUI) success based on known clinical parameters.

Methods

We created an application designed to calculate the probability of IUI success, utilizing data from couples who underwent fertility treatment. The model was developed through a retrospective analysis of clinical and laboratory variables. The main outcome was positive beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG) test. The variables included in the model, determined through a multivariate analysis using stepwise regression, encompassed the etiology of infertility, FSH levels in the early proliferative phase, duration of infertility, total sperm count in the ejaculate, and Kruger morphology.

Results

The study included data from 299 couples seeking fertility treatment at the Hospital das Clínicas of the University of São Paulo between 2008 and 2016, involving a total of 355 insemination cycles. All patients underwent IUI treatment for infertility. Various clinical and laboratory variables were examined to build the predictive model for IUI success. The model demonstrated high sensitivity (89.8%), specificity (88.2%), and an area under the ROC curve of 0.946 (95% CI: 0.910–0.982), indicating an overall accuracy of 94.6%. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test yielded a p value of 0.036. This calculator offers healthcare professionals the means to assess the suitability of IUI for individual patients, providing them with tailored guidance.

Conclusion

By enhancing the accuracy of IUI success predictions, this model has the potential to optimize the allocation of healthcare resources, alleviate patient stress and disappointment, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes within the field of infertility treatment.

### Agents for ovarian stimulation for intrauterine insemination (IUI) in ovulatory women with infertility [^114QMChj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Intrauterine insemination (IUI), combined with ovarian stimulation (OS), has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for infertile couples. Several agents for ovarian stimulation, combined with IUI, have been proposed, but it is still not clear which agents for stimulation are the most effective. This is an update of the review, first published in 2007.

Objectives

To assess the effects of agents for ovarian stimulation for intrauterine insemination in infertile ovulatory women.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and two trial registers from their inception to November 2020. We performed reference checking and contacted study authors and experts in the field to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included truly randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different agents for ovarian stimulation combined with IUI for infertile ovulatory women concerning couples with unexplained infertility. mild male factor infertility and minimal to mild endometriosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

In this updated review, we have included a total of 82 studies, involving 12,614 women. Due to the multitude of comparisons between different agents for ovarian stimulation, we highlight the seven most often reported here. Gonadotropins versus anti-oestrogens (13 studies) For live birth, the results of five studies were pooled and showed a probable improvement in the cumulative live birth rate for gonadotropins compared to anti-oestrogens (odds ratio (OR) 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.79; I² = 30%; 5 studies, 1924 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of live birth following anti-oestrogens is assumed to be 22.8%, the chance following gonadotropins would be between 23.7% and 34.6%. The pooled effect of seven studies revealed that we are uncertain whether gonadotropins lead to a higher multiple pregnancy rate compared with anti-oestrogens (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.60 to 4.17; I² = 58%; 7 studies, 2139 participants; low-certainty evidence). Aromatase inhibitors versus anti-oestrogens (8 studies) One study reported live birth rates for this comparison. We are uncertain whether aromatase inhibitors improve live birth rate compared with anti-oestrogens (OR 0.75, CI 95% 0.51 to 1.11; 1 study, 599 participants; low-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of live birth following anti-oestrogens is 23.4%, the chance following aromatase inhibitors would be between 13.5% and 25.3%. The results of pooling four studies revealed that we are uncertain whether aromatase inhibitors compared with anti-oestrogens lead to a higher multiple pregnancy rate (OR 1.28, CI 95% 0.61 to 2.68; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 1000 participants; low-certainty evidence). Gonadotropins with GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) agonist versus gonadotropins alone (4 studies) No data were available for live birth. The pooled effect of two studies revealed that we are uncertain whether gonadotropins with GnRH agonist lead to a higher multiple pregnancy rate compared to gonadotropins alone (OR 2.53, 95% CI 0.82 to 7.86; I² = 0; 2 studies, 264 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Gonadotropins with GnRH antagonist versus gonadotropins alone (14 studies) Three studies reported live birth rate per couple, and we are uncertain whether gonadotropins with GnRH antagonist improve live birth rate compared to gonadotropins (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.52 to 4.39; I² = 81%; 3 studies, 419 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of a live birth following gonadotropins alone is 25.7%, the chance following gonadotropins combined with GnRH antagonist would be between 15.2% and 60.3%. We are also uncertain whether gonadotropins combined with GnRH antagonist lead to a higher multiple pregnancy rate compared with gonadotropins alone (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.28; I² = 0%; 10 studies, 2095 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Gonadotropins with anti-oestrogens versus gonadotropins alone (2 studies) Neither of the studies reported data for live birth rate. We are uncertain whether gonadotropins combined with anti-oestrogens lead to a higher multiple pregnancy rate compared with gonadotropins alone, based on one study (OR 3.03, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.1; 1 study, 230 participants; low-certainty evidence). Aromatase inhibitors versus gonadotropins (6 studies) Two studies revealed that aromatase inhibitors may decrease live birth rate compared with gonadotropins (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.71; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 651 participants; low-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of a live birth following gonadotropins alone is 31.9%, the chance of live birth following aromatase inhibitors would be between 13.7% and 25%. We are uncertain whether aromatase inhibitors compared with gonadotropins lead to a higher multiple pregnancy rate (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.06 to 8.17; I² = 77%; 3 studies, 731 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Aromatase inhibitors with gonadotropins versus anti-oestrogens with gonadotropins (8 studies) We are uncertain whether aromatase inhibitors combined with gonadotropins improve live birth rate compared with anti-oestrogens plus gonadotropins (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.3 8 to 2.54; I² = 69%; 3 studies, 708 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of a live birth following anti-oestrogens plus gonadotropins is 13.8%, the chance following aromatase inhibitors plus gonadotropins would be between 5.7% and 28.9%. We are uncertain of the effect of aromatase inhibitors combined with gonadotropins compared to anti-oestrogens combined with gonadotropins on multiple pregnancy rate (OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.39 to 4.37; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 901 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the available results, gonadotropins probably improve cumulative live birth rate compared with anti-oestrogens (moderate-certainty evidence). Gonadotropins may also improve cumulative live birth rate when compared with aromatase inhibitors (low-certainty evidence). From the available data, there is no convincing evidence that aromatase inhibitors lead to higher live birth rates compared to anti-oestrogens. None of the agents compared lead to significantly higher multiple pregnancy rates. Based on low-certainty evidence, there does not seem to be a role for different combined therapies, nor for adding GnRH agonists or GnRH antagonists in IUI programs.

### The relationship between duration of infertility and clinical outcomes of intrauterine insemination for younger women: a retrospective clinical study [^111LFkwv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate of IUI in young women (< 35 years old) who have been infertile for more than 5 years significantly decrease with the prolongation of infertility time. Therefore, for young women who have been infertile for more than 5 years, IUI may not be the best choice.

### Intra-uterine insemination for unexplained subfertility [^112MXGZh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Intra-uterine insemination (IUI) is a widely used fertility treatment for couples with unexplained subfertility. Although IUI is less invasive and less expensive than in vitro fertilisation (IVF), the safety of IUI in combination with ovarian hyperstimulation (OH) is debated. The main concern about IUI treatment with OH is the increase in multiple pregnancy rate.

Objectives

To determine whether, for couples with unexplained subfertility, IUI improves the live birth rate compared with timed intercourse (TI), both with and without ovarian hyperstimulation (OH).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched July 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2011), EMBASE (1980 to July 2011), PsycINFO (1806 to July 2011), SCIsearch and reference lists of articles. Authors of identified studies were contacted for missing or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

Truly randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least one of the following comparisons were included: IUI versus TI, both in a natural cycle; IUI versus TI, both in a stimulated cycle; IUI in a natural cycle versus IUI in a stimulated cycle; IUI with OH versus TI in a natural cycle; IUI in a natural cycle versus TI with OH. Only couples with unexplained subfertility were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two review authors. Outcomes were extracted and the data were pooled. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were done where possible.

Main Results

One trial compared IUI in a natural cycle with expectant management and showed no evidence of increased live births (334 women: odds ratio (OR) 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 2.8). In the six trials where IUI was compared with TI, both in stimulated cycles, there was evidence of an increased chance of pregnancy after IUI (six RCTs, 517 women: OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.50). A significant increase in live birth rate was found for women where IUI with OH was compared with IUI in a natural cycle (four RCTs, 396 women: OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.50). However the trials provided insufficient data to investigate the impact of IUI with or without OH on several important outcomes including live births, multiple pregnancies, miscarriage and risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. There was no evidence of a difference in pregnancy rate for IUI with OH compared with TI in a natural cycle (two RCTs, total 304 women: data not pooled). The final comparison of IUI in natural cycle to TI with OH showed a marginal, significant increase in live births for IUI (one RCT, 342 women: OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.44).

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that IUI with OH increases the live birth rate compared to IUI alone. The likelihood of pregnancy was also increased for treatment with IUI compared to TI in stimulated cycles. One adequately powered multicentre trial showed no evidence of effect of IUI in natural cycles compared with expectant management. There is insufficient data on multiple pregnancies and other adverse events for treatment with OH. Therefore couples should be fully informed about the risks of IUI and OH as well as alternative treatment options.

### Improving the reporting of clinical trials of infertility treatments (IMPRINT): modifying the CONSORT statement [^115pNAAM]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Medium credibility.

IMPRINT randomized trial flow (intrauterine insemination [IUI] vs in vitro fertilization [IVF]) depicts screening and allocation: 793 couples screened, with 284 ineligible and 151 declined to participate; allocation included 86 assigned IUI in spontaneous cycles, 85 assigned IUI in stimulated cycles, and 87 assigned IVF; within branches, censored before treatment and censored during treatment were 6 and 13 with 67 completed treatment (spontaneous IUI), 2 and 14 with 69 completed treatment (stimulated IUI), and 2 and 37 with 48 completed treatment (IVF).

### In vitro fertilisation for unexplained subfertility [^117VYaKq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is now a widely accepted treatment for unexplained infertility (RCOG 1998). However, with estimated live-birth rates per cycle varying between 13% and 28%, its effectiveness has not been rigorously evaluated in comparison with other treatments. With increasing awareness of the role of expectant management and less invasive procedures such as intrauterine insemination, concerns about multiple complications and costs associated with IVF, it is extremely important to evaluate the effectiveness of IVF against other treatment options in couples with unexplained infertility.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to determine, in the context of unexplained infertility, whether IVF improves the probability of live-birth compared with (1) expectant management, (2) clomiphene citrate (CC), (3) intrauterine insemination (IUI) alone, (4) IUI with controlled ovarian stimulation, and (5) gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched 23 March 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2004), MEDLINE (1970 to August 2004), EMBASE (1985 to August 2004) and reference lists of articles. We also handsearched relevant conference proceedings and contacted researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials were included. Live-birth rate per woman was the primary outcome of interest.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and quality of trials.

Main Results

Ten randomised controlled trials were identified. In two we could not extract data separately for unexplained infertility cases, two were non-randomised, one did not report valid rates (included in the review but not in the meta-analysis); leaving four trials for analysis. One trial compared two different interventions (IVF versus IUI with or without ovarian stimulation) and one study compared three interventions (IVF versus IUI with ovarian stimulation and GIFT). The numbers of trials assessing the effectiveness of IVF with the other treatments were as follows: IVF versus expectant management (two), IVF versus IUI (one), IVF versus IUI with ovarian stimulation (two) and IVF versus GIFT (three). Live-birth rate per woman was reported in three studies and three studies determined clinical pregnancy rate per woman. Multiple pregnancy rate was reported in three trials. Two studies reported ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) as an outcome measure. There were no comparative data for clomiphene citrate and no comparative data on live-birth rates for GIFT. There was no evidence of a difference in live-birth rates between IVF and IUI either without (OR 1.96; 95% CI 0.88 to 4.4) or with (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.55 to 2.4) ovarian stimulation. There were significantly higher clinical pregnancy rates with IVF in comparison to expectant management (OR 3.24; 95% CI 1.07 to 9.80). There was no significant difference between IVF and GIFT for the one RCT that reported live-birth rates (OR 2.57; 95% CI 0.93 to 7.08). However, there was a significant difference in the clinical pregnancy rates between IVF and GIFT, with pregnancy rates greater for IVF (OR 2.14; 95% CI 1.08 to 4.2). There was no evidence of a difference in the multiple pregnancy rates between IVF and IUI with ovarian stimulation (OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.27 to 1.5), however, IVF had a higher rate than GIFT (OR 6.3; 95% CI 1.7 to 23). Clinical heterogeneity was present among the studies included. However, there was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity, which allowed the studies to be combined for statistical analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

Any effect of IVF relative to expectant management, clomiphene citrate, IUI with or without ovarian stimulation and GIFT in terms of live-birth rates for couples with unexplained subfertility remains unknown. The studies included are limited by their small sample size so that even large differences might be hidden. Live-birth rates are seldom reported. Periods of follow up are inadequate and unequal. Adverse effects such as multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome have also not been reported in most studies. Larger trials with adequate power are warranted to establish the effectiveness of IVF in these women. Future trials should not only report rates per woman/couple but also include adverse effects and costs of the treatments as outcomes. Factors that have a major effect on these outcomes such as fertility treatment, female partner's age, duration of infertility and previous pregnancy history should also be considered.

### Intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation versus expectant management for couples with unexplained subfertility and an intermediate prognosis: a randomised clinical trial [^115u9cFY]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

Intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is commonly used as first-line treatment for couples with unexplained subfertility. Since such treatment increases the risk of multiple pregnancy, a couple's chances of achieving an ongoing pregnancy without it should be considered to identify those most likely to benefit from treatment. We aimed to assess the incremental effectiveness of intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation compared with expectant management in couples with unexplained subfertility and an intermediate prognosis of a spontaneous ongoing pregnancy.

Methods

253 couples with unexplained subfertility and a 30–40% probability of a spontaneous ongoing pregnancy within 12 months were randomly assigned either intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for 6 months or expectant management for 6 months. The primary endpoint of this hospital-based study was ongoing pregnancy within 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the Dutch Trial Register and as an International Standard Randomised Clinical Trial, number ISRCTN72675518.

Findings

Of the 253 couples enrolled, 127 were assigned intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and 126 expectant management. In the intervention group, 42 (33%) women conceived and 29 (23%) pregnancies were ongoing. In the expectant management group, 40 (32%) women conceived and 34 (27%) pregnancies were ongoing (relative risk 0.85, 95% CI 0.63–1.1). There was one twin pregnancy in each study group, and one woman in the intervention group conceived triplets.

Interpretation

A large beneficial effect of intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in couples with unexplained subfertility and an intermediate prognosis can be excluded. Expectant management for 6 months is therefore justified in these couples.

### Soft versus firm catheters for intrauterine insemination [^1175gxu5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a recommended treatment for unexplained subfertility. The treatment involves the direct delivery of spermatozoa into the uterus using a catheter. Many factors influence the success of IUI treatments including the type of catheter used.

Objectives

To compare pregnancy-related outcomes from women undergoing intrauterine insemination cycles performed with either soft or firm catheters in subfertile women.

Search Strategy

We searched the following databases (inception to July 2010) with no language restrictions: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS and OpenSigle. We also searched the conference abstracts in the ISI Web of Knowledge and Google, and conference abstracts and citation lists of relevant publications, reviews and included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included only truly randomised controlled studies of women who underwent IUI using either soft or firm catheter types and reporting data on rates of live birth, clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, ease of introduction of the catheter, occurrence of trauma, or woman's discomfort.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the titles and abstracts of 78 potentially eligible studies and excluded 66 of these. We critically appraised the full texts of twelve studies and excluded three studies. Nine publications of six studies were remaining. We extracted data from the six remaining studies and there were no disagreements. We assessed risk of bias and pooled dichotomous data and presented the Peto odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

There was no evidence of a significant effect difference regarding the choice of catheter type for any of the outcomes. Three studies reported live birth rates (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.35) with a translated OR percentages (1.3, 95% CI 0.56 to 3.1) while six studies reported clinical pregnancy rates (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.35). Two studies were pooled for the analysis of miscarriages (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.22). Results of other adverse outcomes were reported per cycle and were therefore not pooled.

Authors' Conclusions

On the basis of the evidence available in this review, no specific conclusion can be made regarding the superiority of one catheter class over another. Further adequately powered studies reporting on clinical outcomes (e.g. live birth rate) are required. Additional outcomes such as miscarriage rates and measures of discomfort need to be reported.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^112mLgVi]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — treatment recommendations with intrauterine insemination (IUI) specify that "It is not recommended to use conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI, as most studies associated with improved pregnancy rate over OS-IUI with oral medications are also associated with a high multiple-gestation pregnancy rate" (Strength of Evidence: A; Strength of Recommendation: Strong). "It is recommended that a single IUI be performed between 0 and 36 hours relative to hCG injection in OS with IUI treatments" (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate). "It is recommended that couples with unexplained infertility initially undergo a course (typically 3 or 4 cycles) of OS and IUI with oral agents. For those unsuccessful with OS and IUI treatments with oral agents, IVF is recommended rather than OS and IUI with gonadotropins" (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate).

### Intra-uterine insemination for male subfertility [^112E3zo7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Intra-uterine insemination (IUI) is one of the most frequently used fertility treatments for couples with male subfertility. Its use, especially when combined with ovarian hyperstimulation (OH) has been subject of discussion. Although the treatment itself is less invasive and expensive than others, its efficacy has not been proven. Furthermore, the adverse effects of OH such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and multiple pregnancy are a concern.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to determine whether for couples with male subfertility, IUI improves the live birth rates or ongoing pregnancy rates compared with timed intercourse (TI), with or without OH.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual and Disorders Subfertility Group Trials Special Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library, 2006, issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2006), EMBASE (1980 to May 2006), SCIsearch and the reference lists of articles. We hand searched abstracts of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology. Authors of identified articles were contacted for unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCT's) with at least one of the following comparisons were included: 1) IUI versus TI or expectant management both in natural cycles 2) IUI versus TI both in cycles with OH 3) IUI in natural cycles versus TI + OH 4) IUI + OH versus TI in natural cycles 5) IUI in natural cycles versus IUI + OH Couples with abnormal sperm parameters only were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two co-reviewers independently performed quality assessment and data extraction. Where possible data were pooled, and a meta-analysis was performed. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were carried out where possible and appropriate.

Main Results

Three trials of parallel design, and five trials of cross-over design with pre-cross-over data were included in the meta-analysis. Three compared IUI with TI both in stimulated cycles. The remaining four of these studies compared IUI versus IUI + OH. Three studies reported on our main outcome of interest live birth rate per couple. For the comparison IUI versus TI both in natural cycles no evidence of difference between the probabilities of pregnancy rates per woman after IUI compared with TI was found (Peto OR 5.3, 95% CI 0.42 to 67). No statistically significant of difference between pregnancy rates (PR) per couple for IUI + OH versus IUI could be found (Peto OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.37). For the comparison IUI versus TI both in stimulated cycles there was no evidence of statistically significant difference in pregnancy rates per couple either (Peto OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.37). There were insufficient data available for adverse outcomes such as OHSS, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage rate and ectopic pregnancy to perform a statistical analysis. For the other two comparisons no RCT's were found which reported pregnancy rates per couple. A further 10 studies which included one of the comparisons of interests were found. Since these studies reported pregnancy rates per cycle only these data could not be included in the meta-analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence of effectiveness to recommend or advise against IUI with or without OH above TI, or vice versa. Large, high quality randomised controlled trials, comparing IUI with or without OH with pregnancy rate per couple as the main outcome of interest are lacking. There is a need for such trials since firm conclusions cannot be drawn yet.

### Clinical success of intrauterine insemination cycles is affected by the sperm preparation time [^111jPA2G]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the impact of the time interval from the end of sperm preparation (TSP) to intrauterine insemination (IUI) on the outcome.

Design

Prospective multicentre cohort study.

Setting

Seven French centers (assisted reproduction group in northeastern France, four academic centers, and three clinics).

Patient(S)

Eight hundred sixty-two IUI cycles (709 patients) managed by gonadotropins were studied.

Intervention(S)

Cycles were stimulated by either FSH or hMG, and hCG was administrated when the leading follicle diameter measured > 15 mm. IUIs were performed ∼ 36 hours after ovulation triggering.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Generalized linear mixed models for binary outcomes were used to model clinical pregnancy (CP) to assess the effect of TSP adjusted for other predictors (such as maternal age, semen quality, and indication of IUI treatment).

Result(S)

The TSP effect was significant, featuring an inverse U-shaped curve admitting an optimum interval of ∼ 40–80 minutes improving CP compared with other values. Other significant predictors were total motile spermatozoa inseminated, maternal age, and unexplained infertility.

Conclusion(S)

The observance of TSP in the range of 40–80 minutes has a potential positive effect on pregnancy rate, while not requiring the investment of supplemental resources. This finding awaits confirmation in randomized trials.

### Intra-uterine insemination versus fallopian tube sperm perfusion for non-tubal infertility [^114KM7gj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) combined with intrauterine insemination (IUI) is commonly offered to couples with subfertility that does not involve the fallopian tubes. Another method is fallopian tube sperm perfusion (FSP). This technique ensures the presence of higher sperm densities in the fallopian tubes at the time of ovulation than does standard IUI. The aim of this review was to determine whether FSP and IUI differ in improving the probability of conception.

Objectives

To investigate whether pregnancy and live birth outcomes differ between fallopian tube sperm perfusion and intrauterine insemination in the treatment of non-tubal subfertility.

Search Strategy

We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (October 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2008), and EMBASE (January 1988 to October 2008). Abstracts of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (1987 to 2008) and European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (1987 to 2008) meetings were searched using the same key or text words.

Selection Criteria

Only truly randomised controlled studies comparing FSP with IUI were included in this review. Couples with non-tubal subfertility who have been trying to conceive for at least one year were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the trials for inclusion based on the quality of the studies.

Main Results

Eight studies involving 595 couples were included in the meta-analysis. Only one study reported the live birth rate and there was no evidence of a difference between FSP and IUI (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.5). There was no evidence of a difference between FSP and IUI for clinical pregnancy per couple (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.7). A subgroup analysis which included couples with unexplained subfertility only (n = 239) did not report any difference between FSP and IUI (OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.8).

Authors' Conclusions

For non-tubal subfertility, the results indicate no clear benefit for FSP over IUI. Therefore the advice offered to subfertile couples regarding the comparative use of FSP versus IUI in the treatment of non-tubal subfertility should reflect this.

### A comparison of intrauterine versus intracervical insemination in fertile single women [^111w2Mms]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of intrauterine insemination (IUI) and intracervical insemination (ICI) when used by fertile single women in a donor insemination program.

Design

Prospective randomized crossover study.

Setting

Donor insemination program (not an infertility clinic).

Patient(S)

Single fertile women choosing to inseminate with frozen donor semen.

Intervention(S)

Clients received procreative counseling and screening and were then randomly assigned to begin office insemination with ICI or IUI. If additional insemination cycles were required, the clients used the method opposite their previous method of insemination until pregnancy was achieved.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Monthly fecundity rate was compared between the two methods of insemination.

Result(S)

Sixty-two women contributed a total of 189 cycles, 94 by IUI and 95 by ICI. The monthly fecundity rate for IUI was 15%, as compared with 9% for ICI, (P = 0.14). When the analysis was confined to cycles in which only one insemination was performed (64 IUI and 65 ICI cycles), the monthly fecundity rates were 14% for IUI and 5% for ICI (P = 0.04).

Conclusion(S)

Intrauterine insemination with frozen donor sperm is more effective than intracervical insemination for single women without known fertility problems.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^114Habr2]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Timing and number of intrauterine inseminations (IUI) — In cycles using hCG, one RCT found no difference in clinical pregnancy when IUI was performed simultaneously with hCG versus 34–36 hours after hCG (IUI simultaneously with hCG 12.2% vs. IUI 34–36 hours after hCG 9.4%, P = 0.523, OR 1.35, 95% CI .53–3.42), and another RCT reported higher live-birth per cycle at 36 hours than 24 hours (13.4% [31/231] vs. 7.8% [18/230]). Trials comparing single versus double IUI after OS reported no differences (12/95 [12.6%] vs. 9/43 [20.9%], P = 0.21; 23/195 [11.8%] vs. 21/204 [10.3%], P = 0.64; 26/247 [10.5%] vs. 29/243 [11.9%], P = 0.68), although one RCT (n = 273) found higher clinical pregnancy with double IUI using clomiphene 100 mg plus conventional-dose gonadotropins (21.9% vs. 10.9%, P < .05) and reported a high multiple-pregnancy rate (25.4%). Summary statements specify that there is fair evidence timing between 0 and 36 hours does not impact pregnancy rates, that live-birth following single IUI is not significantly different than double IUI with clomiphene citrate, and that evidence is insufficient that ultrasound timing improves outcomes compared to urinary LH monitoring in clomiphene citrate-IUI treatments.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline part II [^114BAiYd]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) and ART relative to semen parameters: Although sperm number and quality affect results with in vitro fertilization (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) applied during IVF appears to abrogate adverse effects of sperm "quality" as long as adequate viable sperm are present. Men with low total motile sperm count (< 5 million motile sperm after processing) will have limited chances of contributing to pregnancy after IUI, and clinicians may advise that IUI success rates may be reduced and ART (IVF/ICSI) may be considered.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^115V3RNo]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) with conventional-dose gonadotropins — scope and effects versus unstimulated cycles and ICI: This guideline includes eight randomized trials and two cohort studies assessing conventional-dose (≥ 150 IU) gonadotropins. Both studies comparing unstimulated cycles to IUI with conventional-dose gonadotropin stimulation showed a significant increase in pregnancy rates with gonadotropin stimulation but also significantly higher multiple-gestation pregnancy rates; in the largest, the pregnancy rate following four treatment cycles was 18% in the natural-cycle IUI group and 33% in the gonadotropin with IUI group (P < .001), the multiple-pregnancy rate was at least 20%, and 18% of pregnancies delivered preterm. In the largest RCT comparing IUI with gonadotropin stimulation to ICI (932 couples), pregnancy rates following 4 treatment cycles were 33% with IUI-gonadotropin versus 19% with ICI-gonadotropin (P < .001). One RCT comparing low-dose versus conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI found similar pregnancy rates (14.30% vs. 14.6%) and a significantly lower risk of moderate OHSS requiring hospitalization with low-dose (0% vs. 16.7%), with no significant difference in multiple-gestation pregnancy rates (1/7 vs. 2/7).

### Performance of the postwash total motile sperm count as a predictor of pregnancy at the time of intrauterine insemination: a meta-analysis [^111LTBk2]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the performance and clinical value of the postwash total motile sperm count (postwash TMC) as a test to predict intrauterine insemination (IUI) outcome.

Design

Meta-analysis of diagnostic tests.

Setting

Tertiary fertility center.

Patient(S)

Patients undergoing IUI.

Intervention(S)

None.

Result(S)

We detected 16 studies that reported on postwash TMC at insemination and IUI outcome. Summary receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves indicated a reasonable predictive performance toward IUI outcome, and, at cut-off levels between 0.8 to 5 million motile spermatozoa, the postwash TMC provided a substantial discriminative performance. At these cut-off levels, the specificity of the postwash TMC, defined as the ability to predict failure to become pregnant, was as high as 100%; the sensitivity of the test, defined as the ability to predict pregnancy, was limited.

Conclusion(S)

The postwash TMC at insemination could potentially be used in counseling patients for either IUI or IVF. However, to enable patient counseling before the start of treatment, further studies are needed to establish the accuracy of a postwash TMC during the fertility workup rather than at insemination.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^113qzYk4]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Clomiphene citrate with intrauterine insemination (IUI) for unexplained infertility — Ovarian stimulation (OS) with IUI is a mainstay of fertility treatment, and this guideline includes 19 randomized trials, 4 systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials, and 3 cohort studies assessing clomiphene citrate with IUI. Two randomized trials versus expectant management showed benefit: in 201 couples treated over 3 cycles, live-birth rate was 31% vs. 9%, respectively, P = 0.0003, and a strict per-protocol analysis showed 24% vs. 7%, P = 0.05. An intermediate-quality randomized controlled trial found a higher pregnancy rate versus untreated cycles (9.7% vs. 3.3%, respectively, P = 0.049), although live-birth outcome by diagnosis was not reported.

### Ejaculatory abstinence in IUI cycles… [^113bQCRK]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Ejaculatory Abstinence in IUI CyclesClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Intrauterine insemination combined with ovarian stimulation, has been an extensively used procedure for the treatment of patients with unexplained infertility. The fact that IUI is less expensive, less invasive, and easier to perform than other assisted reproductive techniques makes it the first-line treatment option in infertility treatments. Several studies have been published over the past few years examining the relationship between sperm DNA fragmentation and IUI outcome. The optimal period for ejaculatory abstinence before the semen sample is a controversial issue in the literature. There are only two retrospective studies examining the relationship between the ejaculatory abstinence period and pregnancy rates after IUI.
- Infertility for more than 12 months
- Diagnosed as unexplained infertility
- Female age between 20 and 40 years
- Regular menstrual cycles
- Mid-luteal progesterone levels of > 3 ng/ml
- Basal FSH < 12 mIU/ml, AMH > 1ng/ml.
- Body mass index 19–35 kg/m2
- No pelvic pathology documented by transvaginal ultrasound and bilateral tubal patency diagnosed by hysterosalpingography
- **Normal semen parameters according to WHO criteria Exclusion Criteria**:

- Any endocrine and pelvic pathology
- PCOS
- Known endometriosis history
- Prior pelvic surgery
- Persistent ovarian cysts. Interventional Model Description: One hundred twenty eligible couples were prospectively randomized into two groups on the second day of the cycle just before starting the treatment protocol. Randomization was performed according to a computer-generated random number list at a ratio of 1:

1.

From the randomization list, an independent secretary who was blind to patients' identities applied the allocation in consecutive order. Patients allocated into group A, had an ejaculatory abstinence period of one day, whereas patients allocated into group B had an ejaculatory abstinence period of three days. Masking: Masking Description: From the randomization list, an independent secretary who was blind to patients' identities applied the allocation in consecutive order. Patients allocated into group A, and group B. Care provider and investigator were blind to patient groups. Participants were informed about the timing of abstinence intervals, but they did not know which groups they were allocated to.

### Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and intrauterine insemination for treatment of unexplained infertility should be limited to a maximum of three trials [^116bqCL3]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the optimum number of cycles of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and intrauterine insemination in the treatment of unexplained infertility.

Design

Observational prospective study.

Setting

In vitro fertilization embryo transfer center.

Patient(S)

Five hundred ninety-four couples with unexplained infertility.

Intervention(S)

Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH), intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Cycle fecundity.

Result(S)

One to 3 cycles of COH/IUI were performed in 594 patients (group A) undergoing 1,112 cycles (mean, 1.9 cycles/patient). Up to 3 further trials (cycles 4–6) of COH/IUI were then performed in 91 of these women (group B), a total of 161 cycles (mean, 1.8 cycles/patient). A historical comparison group C consisted of 131 patients with 3 failed cycles of COH/IUI who underwent 1 cycle of IVF and ICSI at our center. In group A, 182 pregnancies occurred, with a cycle fecundity of 16.4% and a cumulative pregnancy rate (PR) of 39.2% after the first 3 cycles. In group B, 9 pregnancies occurred in cycles 4–6, with a cycle fecundity of 5.6%, significantly lower than that of group A (P < .001). The cumulative PR rose to 48.5% by cycle 6, a further increase of only 9.3%. In the women undergoing IVF and ICSI in group C, 48 pregnancies occurred, with a cycle fecundity of 36.6% per cycle, significantly higher than that of group B (P < .001).

Conclusion(S)

In unexplained infertility, the cycle fecundity in the first three trials of COH and IUI was higher than in cycles 4–6, with a statistically significant difference. Patients should be offered IVF or ICSI if they fail to conceive after three trials of COH and IUI.

### Comprehensive guidance for human embryology, andrology, and endocrinology laboratories: management and operations: a committee opinion [^117J6JJ1]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). High credibility.

Sperm preparation for intrauterine insemination (IUI) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) — Semen samples need to be properly processed before an IUI to concentrate motile sperm, remove nonmotile sperm, and remove seminal plasma, and raw semen should not be placed into the uterine cavity; depending on motile sperm quantity, the ejaculate can be layered over a gradient or a simple wash performed, and the resulting pellet is washed and used for insemination via conventional insemination or ICSI.

### Assisted reproductive technologies for male subfertility [^1151GTYC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Intra-uterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are frequently used fertility treatments for couples with male subfertility. The use of these treatments has been subject of discussion. Knowledge on the effectiveness of fertility treatments for male subfertility with different grades of severity is limited. Possibly, couples are exposed to unnecessary or ineffective treatments on a large scale.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different fertility treatments (expectant management, timed intercourse (TI), IUI, IVF and ICSI) for couples whose subfertility appears to be due to abnormal sperm parameters.

Search Methods

We searched for all publications that described randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the treatment for male subfertility. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and the National Research Register from inception to 14 April 2015, and web-based trial registers from January 1985 to April 2015. We applied no language restrictions. We checked all references in the identified trials and background papers and contacted authors to identify relevant published and unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing different treatment options for male subfertility. These were expectant management, TI (with or without ovarian hyperstimulation (OH)), IUI (with or without OH), IVF and ICSI. We included only couples with abnormal sperm parameters.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. They resolved disagreements by discussion with the rest of the review authors. We performed statistical analyses in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by The Cochrane Collaboration. The quality of the evidence was rated using the GRADE methods. Primary outcomes were live birth and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) per couple randomised.

Main Results

The review included 10 RCTs (757 couples). The quality of the evidence was low or very low for all comparisons. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to describe study methods, serious imprecision and inconsistency. IUI versus TI (five RCTs)Two RCTs compared IUI with TI in natural cycles. There were no data on live birth or OHSS. We found no evidence of a difference in pregnancy rates (2 RCTs, 62 couples: odds ratio (OR) 4.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 102, very low quality evidence; there were no events in one of the studies). Three RCTs compared IUI with TI both in cycles with OH. We found no evidence of a difference in live birth rates (1 RCT, 81 couples: OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.59; low quality evidence) or pregnancy rates (3 RCTs, 202 couples: OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.74 to 3.07; I(2) = 11%, very low quality evidence). One RCT reported data on OHSS. None of the 62 women had OHSS. One RCT compared IUI in cycles with OH with TI in natural cycles. We found no evidence of a difference in live birth rates (1 RCT, 44 couples: OR 3.14, 95% CI 0.12 to 81.35; very low quality evidence). Data on OHSS were not available. IUI in cycles with OH versus IUI in natural cycles (five RCTs)We found no evidence of a difference in live birth rates (3 RCTs, 346 couples: OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.33; I(2) = 0%, very low quality evidence) and pregnancy rates (4 RCTs, 399 couples: OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.82; I(2) = 0%, very low quality evidence). There were no data on OHSS. IVF versus IUI in natural cycles or cycles with OH (two RCTs)We found no evidence of a difference in live birth rates between IVF versus IUI in natural cycles (1 RCT, 53 couples: OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.35; low quality evidence) or IVF versus IUI in cycles with OH (2 RCTs, 86 couples: OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.45; I(2) = 0%, very low quality evidence). One RCT reported data on OHSS. None of the women had OHSS. Overall, we found no evidence of a difference between any of the groups in rates of live birth, pregnancy or adverse events (multiple pregnancy, miscarriage). However, most of the evidence was very low quality. There were no studies on IUI in natural cycles versus TI in stimulated cycles, IVF versus TI, ICSI versus TI, ICSI versus IUI (with OH) or ICSI versus IVF.

Authors' Conclusions

We found insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any difference in safety and effectiveness between different treatments for male subfertility. More research is needed.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^114DxfQY]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — conventional-dose gonadotropins with intrauterine insemination (IUI) are not recommended; it is not recommended to use conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI, as most studies associated with improved pregnancy rate over OS-IUI with oral medications are also associated with a high multiple-gestation pregnancy rate (Strength of Evidence: A; Strength of Recommendation: Strong).

### In vitro fertilisation for unexplained subfertility [^115mx5wJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a widely accepted treatment for unexplained infertility (NICE 2004), which affects up to a third of all infertile couples. With estimated live birth rates (LBRs) per cycle varying from 33.1% in women aged under 35 years down to 12.5% in women aged between 40 and 42 years (HFEA 2011), its effectiveness has not been rigorously evaluated in comparison with other treatments. With increasing awareness of the role of expectant management, less-invasive procedures such as intrauterine insemination (IUI), and concerns about multiple pregnancies and costs associated with IVF, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of IVF against other treatment options in couples with unexplained infertility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of IVF compared to expectant management, clomiphene citrate, IUI alone and intrauterine insemination plus controlled ovarian stimulation (IUI+SO).

Search Methods

Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched July 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, first quarter), MEDLINE (1970 to July 2011), EMBASE (1985 to July 2011) and reference lists of articles were searched. Relevant conference proceedings were handsearched. Authors were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. LBR per woman was the primary outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and quality of trials.

Main Results

Six RCTs were included in the final analysis. LBR per woman was significantly higher with IVF (45.8%) than expectant management (3.7%) (odds ratio (OR) 22.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.56 to 189.37, 1 RCT, 51 women). There were no comparative data for clomiphene citrate. There was no evidence of a significant difference in LBR between IVF and IUI alone (OR 1.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.36, 1 RCT, 113 women), 40.7% with IVF versus 25.9% with IUI. In studies comparing IVF versus IUI+SO, LBR per woman did not differ significantly between the groups among treatment-naive women (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.59, 2 RCTs, 234 women) but was significantly higher in a large RCT of women pretreated with IUI + clomiphene citrate (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.94 to 3.63, 1 RCT, 341 women). These three studies could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I(2) = 84%). There was no evidence of a significant difference in multiple pregnancy rate (MPR) or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) between the two treatments (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.29, 3 RCTs, 351 women; OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.25 to 9.49, 1 RCT, 118 women, respectively).

Authors' Conclusions

IVF may be more effective than IUI+SO. Due to paucity of data from RCTs the effectiveness of IVF for unexplained infertility relative to expectant management, clomiphene citrate and IUI alone remains unproven. Adverse events and the costs associated with these interventions have not been adequately assessed.

### Semen preparation techniques for intrauterine insemination [^115CfPH3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Semen preparation techniques for assisted reproduction, including intrauterine insemination (IUI), were developed to select the motile morphologically normal spermatozoa. The yield of many motile, morphologically normal spermatozoa might influence treatment choices and therefore outcomes.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of three different semen preparation techniques (gradient; swim-up; wash and centrifugation) on clinical outcomes (live birth rate; clinical pregnancy rate) in subfertile couples undergoing IUI.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGFG) trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Direct Database, National Research Register, Biological Abstracts and clinical trial registries in March 2019, and checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy in terms of clinical outcomes of semen preparation techniques used for subfertile couples undergoing IUI.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes are live birth rate and clinical pregnancy rate per couple.

Main Results

We included seven RCTS in the review; we included six of these, totalling 485 couples, in the meta-analysis. No trials reported the primary outcome of live birth. The evidence was of very low-quality. The main limitations were (unclear) risk of bias, signs of imprecision and inconsistency in results among studies and the small number of studies/participants included. Swim-up versus gradient technique Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a difference between clinical pregnancy rates (CPR) for swim-up versus a gradient technique (odds ratio (OR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.35; I² = 71%; 4 RCTs, 370 participants; very low-quality evidence). The results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy after the use of a gradient technique is assumed to be 24%, the chance of pregnancy after using the swim-up technique is between 14% and 30%. We are uncertain whether there was a real difference between ongoing pregnancy rates per couple (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.82; heterogeneity not applicable; 1 RCT, 223 participants; very low-quality evidence). Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a difference between multiple pregnancy rates (MPR) per couple comparing a swim-up versus gradient technique (MPR per couple 0% versus 0%; 1 RCT, 25 participants; very low-quality of evidence). Considering the quality of evidence, we are also uncertain whether there was a difference between miscarriage rates (MR) per couple comparing a swim-up versus gradient technique (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.59; I² = 44%; 3 RCTs, 330 participants; very low-quality evidence). No studies reported on ectopic pregnancy rate, fetal abnormalities or infection rate. Swim-up versus wash techniqueConsidering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there is a difference in clinical pregnancy rates after a swim-up technique versus wash and centrifugation (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.13; I² = 55%; 2 RCTs, 78 participants; very low-quality evidence). The results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy after the use of a wash technique is assumed to be 38%, the chance of pregnancy after using the swim-up technique is between 9% and 41%. Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a difference between multiple pregnancy rates between swim-up technique versus wash technique (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.02 to 13.28; heterogeneity not applicable; 1 RCT, 26 participants; very low-quality evidence). Miscarriage rate was only reported by one study: no miscarriages were reported in either treatment arm. No studies reported on ongoing pregnancy rate, ectopic pregnancy rate, fetal abnormalities or infection rate. Gradient versus wash techniqueConsidering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there is a difference in clinical pregnancy rates after a gradient versus wash and centrifugation technique (OR 1.78, 95% CI 0.58 to 5.46; I² = 52%; 2 RCTs, 94 participants; very low-quality evidence). The results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy after the use of a wash technique is assumed to be 13%, the chance of pregnancy after using the gradient technique is between 8% and 46%. Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a difference between multiple pregnancy rates per couple between the treatment groups (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.83; very low-quality evidence). Considering the quality of evidence, we are also uncertain whether there was a difference between miscarriage rates per couple between the treatment groups (OR 6.11, 95% CI 0.27 to 138.45; very low-quality evidence). No studies reported on ongoing pregnancy rate, ectopic pregnancy rate, fetal abnormalities or infection rate.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific semen preparation technique: swim-up versus gradient versus wash and centrifugation technique. No studies reported on live birth rates. Considering the quality of evidence (very low), we are uncertain whether there is a difference in clinical pregnancy rates, ongoing pregnancy rates, multiple pregnancy rates or miscarriage rates per couple) between the three sperm preparation techniques. Further randomised trials are warranted that report live birth data.

### In vitro fertilisation for unexplained subfertility [^113DMC34]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

One-third of subfertile couples have no identifiable cause for their inability to conceive. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a widely accepted treatment for this condition; however, this treatment is invasive and expensive and is associated with risks.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of IVF compared with expectant management, unstimulated intrauterine insemination (IUI) or intrauterine insemination along with ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins (IUI + gonadotropins) or clomiphene (IUI + CC) or letrozole (IUI + letrozole) in improving pregnancy outcomes.

Search Methods

This review has drawn on the search strategy developed by the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched May 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, first quarter), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2015), EMBASE (1985 to May 2015), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (May 2015) and reference lists of articles. We searched the following trial registries: clinicaltrials.gov (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Trials Registry Platform search portal (http://www.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx). We searched the Web of Science (http://wokinfo.com/) as another source of trials and conference abstracts, OpenGrey (http://www.opengrey.eu/) for unpublished literature from Europe and the Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) database (http://regional.bvsalud.org/php/index.php?lang = en). Moreover, we handsearched relevant conference proceedings and contacted study authors to ask about additional publications. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The primary review outcome was cumulative live birth rate. Multiple pregnancy and other adverse effects were secondary outcomes. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed statistical heterogeneity by using the I(2) statistic. We assessed the overall quality of evidence for the main comparisons using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methods.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which the effectiveness of IVF in couples with unexplained subfertility was compared with that of other treatments, including expectant management, unstimulated IUI and stimulated IUI using gonadotropins or clomiphene or letrozole. Live birth rate (LBR) per woman was the primary outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and quality of trials and evaluated the quality of the evidence by using GRADE criteria.

Main Results

IVF versus expectant management (two RCTs):Live birth rate per woman was higher with IVF than with expectant management (odds ratio (OR) 22.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.56 to 189.37, one RCT, 51 women, very low quality evidence). Multiple pregnancy rates (MPRs), ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and miscarriage were not reported. IVF versus unstimulated IUI (two RCTs):Live birth rate was higher with IVF than with unstimulated IUI (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.19 to 5.12, two RCTs, 156 women, I(2) = 60%, low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in multiple pregnancy rates (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.04 to 27.29, one RCT, 43 women, very low quality evidence) IVF versus IUI + ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins (three RCTs) or clomiphene (one RCT) or letrozole (no RCTs):Data from these trials could not be pooled because of high statistical heterogeneity (I(2) = 93.3%). Heterogeneity was eliminated when studies were stratified by pretreatment status. In trials comparing IVF versus IUI + gonadotropins among treatment-naive women, there was no conclusive evidence of a difference between the groups in live birth rates (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.73, four RCTs, 745 women, I(2) = 8.0%, moderate-quality evidence). In women pretreated with IUI + clomiphene, a higher live birth rate was reported among those who underwent IVF than those given IUI + gonadotropins (OR 3.90, 95% CI 2.32 to 6.57, one RCT, 280 women, moderate-quality evidence). There was no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth rates between IVF and IUI + CC in treatment-naive women (OR 2.51, 95% CI 0.96 to 6.55, one RCT, 103 women, low quality evidence). In treatment-naive women, there was no evidence of a difference in rates of multiple pregnancy between women who underwent IVF and those who received IUI + gonadotropins (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.39, four RCTs, 745 women, I(2) = 0%, moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in MPRs between women who underwent IVF compared with those given IUI + CC (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.20 to 5.31, one RCT, 103 women, low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome rate between treatment-naive women who underwent IVF and those given IUI + gonadotropins (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.36 to 4.14, two RCTs, 221 women, low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in OHSS rates between groups receiving IVF versus those receiving IUI + CC (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.20 to 5.31, one RCT, 103 women, low-quality evidence). In treatment naive women, there was no evidence of a difference in miscarriage rates between IVF and IUI + CC (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.02, one RCT, 103 women, low-quality evidence), nor between women treated with IVF versus those receiving IUI+ gonadotropins (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.02, one RCT, 103 women). No studies compared IVF with IUI + letrozole. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitation was serious imprecision resulting from small study numbers and low event rates.

Authors' Conclusions

IVF may be associated with higher live birth rates than expectant management, but there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. IVF may also be associated with higher live birth rates than unstimulated IUI. In women pretreated with clomiphene + IUI, IVF appears to be associated with higher birth rates than IUI + gonadotropins. However in women who are treatment-naive there is no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth rates between IVF and IUI + gonadotropins or between IVF and IUI + clomiphene. Adverse events associated with these interventions could not be adequately assessed owing to lack of evidence.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^112G1rVk]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

American Society for Reproductive Medicine guideline — objective, methods, outcomes, and scope: The objective is to provide evidence-based recommendations regarding the effectiveness and safety of therapies for unexplained infertility. ASRM conducted a literature search including systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and comparative observational studies published from 1968 through 2019, and the literature search identified 88 relevant studies to inform the evidence base. Outcomes of interest included live-birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, implantation rate, fertilization rate, multiple pregnancy rate, dose of treatment, rate of ovarian hyperstimulation, abortion rate, and ectopic pregnancy rate. Evidence-based recommendations were developed for treatments including natural cycle with intrauterine insemination (IUI), clomiphene citrate with intercourse, aromatase inhibitors with intercourse, gonadotropins with intercourse, aromatase inhibitors with IUI, low-dose and conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI, timing of IUI, and in vitro fertilization and treatment paradigms.

### Effect of the total motile sperm count on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization [^112sphL8]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine prognostic factors for achieving a pregnancy with intrauterine insemination (IUI) and IVF. To compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of IUI and IVF based on semen analysis results.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Academic university hospital-based infertility center.

Patient(S)

One thousand thirty-nine infertile couples undergoing 3,479 IUI cycles. Four hundred twenty-four infertile couples undergoing 551 IVF cycles.

Intervention(S)

IUI and IVF treatment.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the significance of prognostic factors including a woman's age, gravidity, duration of infertility, diagnoses, use of ovulation induction, and sperm parameters for predicting the outcomes of clinical pregnancy and live birth rate after the first cycle of IUI and IVF. The relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these treatments were then determined based on sperm count results.

Result(S)

Female age, gravidity, and use of ovulation induction were all independent factors in predicting pregnancy after IUI. The average total motile sperm count in the ejaculate was also an important factor, with a threshold value of 10 million. For IVF, only female age was an important predictor for both clinical and ongoing pregnancy. When the average total motile sperm count was under 10 million, IVF with ICSI was more cost-effective than IUI in our clinic.

Conclusion(S)

An average total motile sperm count of 10 million may be a useful threshold value for decisions about treating a couple with IUI or IVF.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^115v6o5v]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) with combination of clomiphene citrate or letrozole and gonadotropins — evidence across trials indicates mixed findings without consistent superiority of combinations over oral agents alone: This guideline includes six RCTs and six cohort studies assessing clomiphene plus low-dose gonadotropins with IUI versus letrozole with IUI or letrozole plus low-dose gonadotropins with IUI. One intermediate-quality RCT found no difference in live birth among clomiphene with IUI, low-dose FSH with IUI, or sequential clomiphene plus low-dose FSH with IUI (8.0%, 12.0%, and 13.6%, respectively) (P = NS). Three randomized trials suggested no difference in fecundity between clomiphene and low-dose gonadotropins with IUI compared to letrozole and low-dose gonadotropins with IUI, and one cohort study found higher pregnancy rates with clomiphene and gonadotropins than letrozole and gonadotropins, but not statistically significant. Conversely, one RCT reported higher clinical pregnancy rates per cycle with letrozole-IUI alone versus clomiphene plus low-dose hMG plus IUI (23/70, 32.8% vs. 10/70, 14.3%), but there was a high risk for bias in the randomization strategy.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^113aVTz5]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Timed-intercourse cycles with gonadotropins — Two older randomized controlled trials showed higher pregnancy rates in their intrauterine insemination (IUI) arms compared with timed intercourse, with one showing a statistically significant per-cycle advantage for IUI (25.0% vs. 8.9%, with IUI vs. timed intercourse, P < .05) and the other a nonsignificant difference (8.7% vs. 4.3% with IUI vs. timed intercourse, P = 0.30). In the 1995 randomized controlled trial the multiple-gestation pregnancy rate was 9.1% in the gonadotropin with IUI arm, and no multiple pregnancies were reported in the 1991 trial. Conventional-dose gonadotropins (≥ 150 IU) with timed intercourse were not associated with higher pregnancy rates than oral agents in a systematic review, and one trial in patients with unexplained or male-factor infertility showed no significant difference comparing timed intercourse with IUI and conventional-dose gonadotropins; however, with ICI, gonadotropins increased live birth (P = 0.01) and nearly doubled conception versus ICI alone (19% vs. 10%, per couple; p = 0.006), with > 20% multiple gestations, and multiple-gestation rates with gonadotropins plus IUI ranged from 6.5% to 22%.

### Intrauterine insemination versus intracervical insemination in donor sperm treatment [^1163cRco]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The first-line treatment in donor sperm treatment consists of inseminations that can be done by intrauterine insemination (IUI) or by intracervical insemination (ICI).

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness and safety of intrauterine insemination (IUI) and intracervical insemination (ICI) in women who start donor sperm treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL in October 2016, checked references of relevant studies, and contacted study authors and experts in the field to identify additional studies. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, the Grey literature, and five trials registers on 15 December 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on IUI versus ICI in natural cycles or with ovarian stimulation, and RCTs comparing different cointerventions in IUI and ICI. We included cross-over studies if pre-cross-over data were available.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. We collected data on primary outcomes of live birth and multiple pregnancy rates, and on secondary outcomes of clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and cancellation rates.

Main Results

We included six RCTs (708 women analysed) on ICI and IUI in donor sperm treatment. Two studies compared IUI and ICI in natural cycles, two studies compared IUI and ICI in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles, and two studies compared timing of IUI and ICI. There was very low-quality evidence; the main limitations were risk of bias due to poor reporting of study methods, and serious imprecision. IUI versus ICI in natural cyclesThere was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any clear difference in live birth rate between IUI and ICI in natural cycles (odds ratio (OR) 3.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 87.13; 1 RCT, 26 women; very low-quality evidence). There was only one live birth in this study (in the IUI group). IUI resulted in higher clinical pregnancy rates (OR 6.18, 95% CI 1.91 to 20.03; 2 RCTs, 76 women; I² = 48%; very low-quality evidence). No multiple pregnancies or miscarriages occurred in this study. IUI versus ICI in gonadotrophin-stimulated cyclesThere was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any clear difference in live birth rate between IUI and ICI in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles (OR 2.55, 95% CI 0.72 to 8.96; 1 RCT, 43 women; very low-quality evidence). This suggested that if the chance of a live birth following ICI in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles was assumed to be 30%, the chance following IUI in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles would be between 24% and 80%. IUI may result in higher clinical pregnancy rates than ICI (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.38 to 5.78; 2 RCTs, 131 women; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence). IUI may be associated with higher multiple pregnancy rates than ICI (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.00 to 7.69; 2 RCTs, 131 women; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence). This suggested that if the risk of multiple pregnancy following ICI in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles was assumed to be 10%, the risk following IUI would be between 10% and 46%. We found insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any clear difference between the groups in miscarriage rates in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles (OR 1.97, 95% CI 0.43 to 9.04; 2 RCTs, overall 67 pregnancies; I² = 50%; very low-quality evidence). Timing of IUI and ICIWe found no studies that reported on live birth rates. We found a higher clinical pregnancy rate when IUI was timed one day after a rise in blood levels of luteinising hormone (LH) compared to IUI two days after a rise in blood levels of LH (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.53; 1 RCT, 351 women; low-quality evidence). We found insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any clear difference in clinical pregnancy rates between ICI timed after a rise in urinary levels of LH versus a rise in basal temperature plus cervical mucus scores (OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.42 to 4.11; 1 RCT, 56 women; very low-quality evidence). Neither of these studies reported multiple pregnancy or miscarriage rates as outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a clear difference in live birth rates between IUI and ICI in natural or gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles in women who started with donor sperm treatment. There was insufficient evidence available for the effect of timing of IUI or ICI on live birth rates. Very low-quality data suggested that in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles, ICI may be associated with a higher clinical pregnancy rate than IUI, but also with a higher risk of multiple pregnancy rate. We concluded that the current evidence was too limited to choose between IUI or ICI, in natural cycles or with ovarian stimulation, in donor sperm treatment.

### Intrauterine insemination with ovarian stimulation versus expectant management for unexplained infertility (TUI): a pragmatic, open-label, randomised, controlled, two-centre trial [^116yk6r3]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Women with unexplained infertility are often offered intrauterine insemination (IUI) with ovarian stimulation as an alternative to in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). However, little evidence exists that IUI is an effective treatment. In 2013, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended that IUI should not be routinely offered for couples with unexplained infertility.

Methods

For this pragmatic, open-label, randomised, controlled, two-centre study, we enrolled women attending two fertility clinics in New Zealand with unexplained infertility and an unfavourable prognosis of natural conception. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomisation sequence, prepared by an independent statistician, to either three cycles of IUI with ovarian stimulation (with either oral clomifene citrate [50–150 mg, days 2–6] or oral letrozole [2.5–7.5 mg, days 2–6], with choice of ovarian stimulation made by the clinic) or three cycles of expectant management (couples advised to be sexually active around the likely time of ovulation and provided with a diary to record the first day of each menstrual cycle and dates of sexual activity) in blocks of four, six, and ten, without stratification. The participating couple and the clinicians were informed of treatment allocation. The primary outcome was cumulative livebirth rate in the intention-to-treat population. The safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study was prospectively registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register, number ACTRN12612001025820.

Findings

Between March 12, 2013, and May 12, 2016, we randomly assigned 101 women to IUI with ovarian stimulation and 100 to expectant management, all of whom were included in the primary efficacy analysis and safety analyses. Women assigned to IUI had a higher cumulative livebirth rate than women assigned to expectant management (31 [31%] livebirths among 101 women vs nine [9%] livebirths among 100 women; risk ratio [RR] 3.41, 95% CI 1.71–6.79; p = 0.0003). Of 31 livebirths in the IUI group, 23 resulted from IUI cycles and eight were conceived without assistance before or between IUI cycles. Of nine livebirths in the expectant management group, one patient was pregnant from IUI with ovarian stimulation at study entry and one had received off-protocol treatment (IVF). Two sets of twins were born, both in the IUI group (one from a cancelled cycle for over-response).

Interpretation

IUI with ovarian stimulation is a safe and effective treatment for women with unexplained infertility and an unfavourable prognosis for natural conception.

### Evaluating prognosis in unexplained infertility [^116qEM3R]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Importance

The diagnosis of unexplained infertility presents a dilemma as it signifies both uncertainty about the cause of infertility and the potential for natural conception. Immediate treatment of all would result in overtreatment. Prediction models estimating the likelihood of natural conception and subsequent live birth can guide treatment decisions.

Objective

To evaluate if in couples with unexplained infertility, prediction models are effective in guiding treatment decisions.

Evidence Review

This review examines 25 studies that assess prediction models for natural conception in couples with unexplained infertility in terms of derivation, validation, and impact analysis.

Findings

The largest prediction models have been integrated in the synthesis models of Hunault, which includes female age and infertility duration, having been pregnant before and motile sperm percentage. Despite its limited discriminative capacity, this model demonstrates excellent calibration. Importantly, the impact of the Hunault model has been evaluated in randomized clinical trials, and shows that in couples with unexplained infertility and 12-month natural conception chances exceeding 30%, immediate treatment with intrauterine insemination (IUI) and controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is not better than expectant management for 6 months. Below the threshold of 30%, treatment with IUI is superior over expectant management, but immediate in vitro fertilization was not better than IUI.

Conclusion

In couples with unexplained infertility and a good prognosis for natural conception, treatment can be delayed, whereas in couples with a poor prognosis, immediate treatment (with IUI-controlled ovarian hyperstimulation) is warranted.

Relevance

These data indicate that in couples with unexplained infertility, integration of prediction models into clinical decision making can optimize treatment selection and maximize fertility outcomes while limiting unnecessary treatment.

### In vitro fertilisation for unexplained subfertility [^113zVjfp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a treatment for unexplained subfertility but is invasive, expensive, and associated with risks.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of IVF versus expectant management, unstimulated intrauterine insemination (IUI), and IUI with ovarian stimulation using gonadotropins, clomiphene citrate (CC), or letrozole in improving pregnancy outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched following databases from inception to November 2021, with no language restriction: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL. We searched reference lists of articles and conference abstracts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing effectiveness of IVF for unexplained subfertility with expectant management, unstimulated IUI, and stimulated IUI.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods.

Main Results

IVF versus expectant management (two RCTs) We are uncertain whether IVF improves live birth rate (LBR) and clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) compared to expectant management (odds ratio (OR) 22.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.56 to 189.37; 1 RCT; 51 women; very low-quality evidence; OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.07 to 9.8; 2 RCTs; 86 women; I² = 80%; very low-quality evidence). Adverse effects were not reported. Assuming 4% LBR and 12% CPR with expectant management, these would be 8.8% to 9% and 13% to 58% with IVF. IVF versus unstimulated IUI (two RCTs) IVF may improve LBR compared to unstimulated IUI (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.19 to 5.12; 2 RCTs; 156 women; I² = 60%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether there is a difference between IVF and IUI for multiple pregnancy rate (MPR) (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.04 to 27.29; 1 RCT; 43 women; very low-quality evidence) and miscarriage rate (OR 1.72, 95% CI 0.14 to 21.25; 1 RCT; 43 women; very low-quality evidence). No study reported ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Assuming 16% LBR, 3% MPR, and 6% miscarriage rate with unstimulated IUI, these outcomes would be 18.5% to 49%, 0.1% to 46%, and 0.9% to 58% with IVF. IVF versus IUI + ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins (6 RCTs), CC (1 RCT), or letrozole (no RCTs) Stratified analysis was based on pretreatment status. Treatment-naive women There may be little or no difference in LBR between IVF and IUI + gonadotropins (1 IVF to 2 to 3 IUI cycles: OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.61; 3 RCTs; 731 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence; 1 IVF to 1 IUI cycle: OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.92; 2 RCTs; 221 women; I² = 54%; low-quality evidence); or between IVF and IUI + CC (OR 2.51, 95% CI 0.96 to 6.55; 1 RCT; 103 women; low-quality evidence). Assuming 42% LBR with IUI + gonadotropins (1 IVF to 2 to 3 IUI cycles) and 26% LBR with IUI + gonadotropins (1 IVF to 1 IUI cycle), LBR would be 39% to 54% and 24% to 51% with IVF. Assuming 15% LBR with IUI + CC, LBR would be 15% to 54% with IVF. There may be little or no difference in CPR between IVF and IUI + gonadotropins (1 IVF to 2 to 3 IUI cycles: OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.59; 3 RCTs; 731 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence; 1 IVF to 1 IUI cycle: OR 4.59, 95% CI 1.86 to 11.35; 1 RCT; 103 women; low-quality evidence); or between IVF and IUI + CC (OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.51 to 8.49; 1 RCT; 103 women; low-quality evidence). Assuming 48% CPR with IUI + gonadotropins (1 IVF to 2 to 3 IUI cycles) and 17% with IUI + gonadotropins (1 IVF to 1 IUI cycle), CPR would be 44% to 60% and 28% to 70% with IVF. Assuming 21% CPR with IUI + CC, CPR would be 29% to 69% with IVF. There may be little or no difference in multiple pregnancy rate (MPR) between IVF and IUI + gonadotropins (1 IVF to 2 to 3 IUI cycles: OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.77; 3 RCTs; 731 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence; 1 IVF to 1 IUI cycle: OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.58; 2 RCTs; 221 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence); or between IVF and IUI + CC (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.41; 1 RCT; 102 women; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if there is a difference in OHSS between IVF and IUI + gonadotropins with 1 IVF to 2 to 3 IUI cycles (OR 6.86, 95% CI 0.35 to 134.59; 1 RCT; 207 women; very low-quality evidence); and there may be little or no difference in OHSS with 1 IVF to 1 IUI cycle (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.36 to 4.16; 2 RCTs; 221 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference between IVF and IUI + CC (OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.24 to 9.57; 1 RCT; 102 women; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if there is a difference in miscarriage rate between IVF and IUI + gonadotropins with 1 IVF to 2 to 3 IUI cycles (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.04; 1 RCT; 207 women; very low-quality evidence); and there may be little or no difference with 1 IVF to 1 IUI cycle (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.02; 1 RCT; 103 women; low-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference between IVF and IUI + CC (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.54 to 4.05; 1 RCT; 102 women; low-quality evidence). In women pretreated with IUI + CC IVF may improve LBR compared with IUI + gonadotropins (OR 3.90, 95% CI 2.32 to 6.57; 1 RCT; 280 women; low-quality evidence). Assuming 22% LBR with IUI + gonadotropins, LBR would be 39% to 65% with IVF. IVF may improve CPR compared with IUI + gonadotropins (OR 14.13, 95% CI 7.57 to 26.38; 1 RCT; 280 women; low-quality evidence). Assuming 30% CPR with IUI + gonadotropins, CPR would be 76% to 92% with IVF.

Authors' Conclusions

IVF may improve LBR over unstimulated IUI. Data should be interpreted with caution as overall evidence quality was low.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^116fE5Yc]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) with low-dose gonadotropins — comparative effectiveness and cost: IUI with low-dose gonadotropins (< 150 IU daily) has been compared with several strategies in unexplained infertility, with mixed results. Two randomized controlled trials showed that expectant management resulted in similar pregnancy rates and similar time to pregnancy compared to IUI with low-dose gonadotropins, and a cost analysis found a significantly higher cost per ongoing pregnancy compared with 6 months of expectant management. One randomized trial showed no difference between natural-cycle IUI and low-dose FSH with IUI up to 6 cycles (23.7% vs. 31.0%, respectively, P = 0.17). When IUI with low-dose gonadotropins was compared to timed intercourse using the same stimulation, one small RCT of 46 couples favored IUI (25.7% and 8.9%, respectively, P < .05), whereas a second small RCT (n = 48) showed no difference. Across seven randomized trials versus clomiphene citrate with IUI, three trials favored gonadotropins and four showed no difference, and the multiple-pregnancy rate was not significantly different across these studies. One RCT and one cohort study comparing low-dose gonadotropins plus IUI to letrozole plus IUI also demonstrated no significant differences in pregnancy or multiple-pregnancy rates. Summary statement: "There is insufficient evidence that treatment with low-dose gonadotropins with IUI is associated with a higher pregnancy rate than clomiphene citrate or letrozole with IUI".

### In vitro fertilisation for unexplained subfertility [^1132oSv9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is now a widely accepted treatment for unexplained infertility (RCOG 1998). However, with estimated livebirth rates per cycle varying between 13% and 28%, it's effectiveness has not been rigorously evaluated in comparison with other treatments. With increasing awareness of the role of expectant management and less invasive procedures such as intrauterine insemination, concerns about multiple complications and costs associated with IVF, it is extremely important to evaluate the effectiveness of IVF against other treatment options in couples with unexplained infertility.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to determine, in the context of unexplained infertility, whether IVF improves the probability of livebirth compared with 1. expectant management 2. clomiphene citrate (CC) 3. intra uterine insemination (IUI) alone 4. IUI with controlled ovarian stimulation and 5. Gamete IntraFallopian Transfer (GIFT).

Search Strategy

RCTs were identified using the search strategies developed for the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group. See Review group for more information.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials were included. Livebirth rate per woman was the primary outcome of interest.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and quality of trials.

Main Results

Nine randomised controlled trials were identified. In two we could not extract data separately for unexplained infertility cases, two were non-randomised, one reported no valid rates (included in the review and not in the meta-analysis), leaving four trials for analysis. One trial compared two different interventions (IVF versus IUI with or without ovarian stimulation) and one study compared three interventions (IVF versus IUI with ovarian stimulation and GIFT). The number of trials assessing the effectiveness of IVF with the other treatments were as follows: IVF versus expectant management (one), IVF versus IUI (one), IVF versus IUI with ovarian stimulation (two) and IVF versus GIFT (three). Livebirth rate per woman was reported in two studies and three studies determined clinical pregnancy rate per woman. Multiple pregnancy rate was reported in three trials. Two studies reported ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) as an outcome measure. There were no comparative data for clomiphene citrate, and no comparative data on livebirth rates for expectant management or GIFT. There was no evidence of a difference in livebirth rates between IVF and IUI either without (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.1) or with (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.8) ovarian stimulation. There was no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy rates between IVF and expectant management. There was no significant difference in the clinical pregnancy rates between IVF and GIFT (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.92). There was no evidence of a difference in the multiple pregnancy rates between IVF and either IUI with ovarian stimulation (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.68 to 3.70) or GIFT (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.58). Clinical heterogeneity was present among the studies included. However, there was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity, which allowed the studies to be combined for statistical analysis.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Any effect of IVF relative to expectant management, clomiphene citrate, IUI with or without ovarian stimulation and GIFT in terms of livebirth rates for couples with unexplained subfertility remains unknown. The studies included are limited by their small sample size, so that even large differences might be hidden. Livebirth rates are seldom reported. Adverse effects such as multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome have also not been reported in most studies. Larger trials with adequate power are warranted to establish the effectiveness of IVF in these women. Future trials should not only report rates per woman /couple but also include adverse effects and costs of the treatments compared as outcomes. Factors that have a major effect on these outcomes such as fertility treatment, female partner's age, duration of infertility and previous pregnancy history should also be considered.

Ovarian stimulation and intrauterine insemination (OS/IUI) — predictive value of ovarian reserve markers: In unexplained infertility, findings are "inconclusive", and a secondary AMIGOS analysis reported that AMH did not predict OS/IUI pregnancy rates; overall, the best available evidence states these markers do not predict success following OS/IUI.

### External validation of a prediction model for an ongoing pregnancy after intrauterine insemination [^115QfULP]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the accuracy of our recently developed prediction model in a prospective validation study to predict the outcome of intrauterine insemination (IUI).

Design

Descriptive prospective validation study.

Setting

Seven fertility centers in the Netherlands.

Patient(S)

Couples treated with IUI of whom the female partner had a regular cycle.

Intervention(S)

Intrauterine insemination with or without controlled ovarian hyperstimulation.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Ongoing pregnancy after intrauterine insemination. Performance of the prediction model was assessed with calibration and discriminative capacity. Calibration was assessed by comparing the predicted ongoing pregnancy rate with the observed ongoing pregnancy rate. Discriminative capacity was assessed with receiver operation characteristic (ROC) analysis. For daily practice, a score worksheet of the validated model was developed to estimate the chance of an ongoing pregnancy after IUI per treatment cycle.

Result(S)

We included 1,079 subfertile couples who underwent 4,244 cycles of IUI. There were 278 ongoing pregnancies, that is, an ongoing pregnancy rate of 6.6% per cycle. External validation of the model showed good calibration. The predicted probability never differed by more than 1.5% of the mean observed probability. The area under the ROC curve was 0.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.53–0.59) at external validation.

Conclusion(S)

The prediction model was able to make a good distinction between couples with a good pregnancy chance and those with a poor pregnancy chance after IUI. This model can help in deciding which couples will benefit from IUI and which couples will not.

### Timing of intrauterine insemination: where are we? [^1162MmSe]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Correct timing of insemination remains a controversial aspect of IUI cycles associated with ovarian hyperstimulation. Although it is currently believed that insemination at 32–38 hours after hCG administration provides the best results, clinical evidence supporting this conclusion is scarce. Double insemination might be an alternative, effective strategy, but studies on this topic are few, heterogeneous, and controversial.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis comparing continuation of assisted reproductive technology with conversion to intrauterine insemination in patients with low follicle numbers [^1153yDaF]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the cost effectiveness of proceeding with oocyte retrieval vs. converting to intrauterine insemination (IUI) in patients with ≤ 4 mature follicles during assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles.

Design

Probabilistic decision analysis. The cost effectiveness of completing ART cycles in poor responders was compared to that for converting the cycles to IUI.

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

Not applicable.

Intervention(S)

Cost-effectiveness analysis.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Cost effectiveness, which was defined as the average direct medical costs per ongoing pregnancy.

Result(S)

In patients with 1–3 mature follicles, completing ART was more cost effective if the cost of a single ART cycle was between $10,000 and $25,000. For patients with 4 mature follicles, if an ART cycle cost < $18,025, it was more cost effective to continue with oocyte retrieval than to convert to IUI.

Conclusion(S)

In patients with ≤ 4 mature follicles following ovarian stimulation in ART cycles, it was on average more cost effective to proceed with oocyte retrieval rather than convert to IUI. However, important factors, such as age, prior ART failures, other fertility factors, and medications used in each individual case need to be considered before this analysis model can be adapted by individual practices.

### Intrauterine insemination versus fallopian tube sperm perfusion for non-tubal infertility [^115xfW5E]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a common treatment for couples with subfertility that does not involve the fallopian tubes. It is used to bring the sperm close to the released oocyte. Another method of introducing sperm is fallopian tube sperm perfusion (FSP). Fallopian tube sperm perfusion ensures the presence of higher sperm densities in the fallopian tubes at the time of ovulation than does standard IUI. These treatments are often used in combination with ovarian hyperstimulation.

Objectives

To compare intrauterine insemination versus fallopian tube sperm perfusion in the treatment of non-tubal subfertility, for live birth and pregnancy outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE from inception to September 2013. We also searched study reference lists and trial registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IUI with FSP in couples with non-tubal subfertility were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed study quality and extracted the data. If studies were sufficiently similar, data were combined using a fixed-effect model to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A random-effects model was used if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected. Studies that included participants with unexplained or mixed (non-tubal) subfertility were analysed separately from studies restricted to participants with mild or moderate male factor subfertility. The overall quality of evidence for the main outcomes was summarised using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.

Main Results

The review included 16 RCTs. Fourteen RCTs (1745 women) were included in the meta-analysis. Only three studies reported live birth per couple. No evidence of a statistically significant difference was noted between IUI and FSP in live birth (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.49, three RCTs, 633 women, I(2) = 0%, low-quality evidence) or clinical pregnancy (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.12, 14 RCTs, 1745 women, I(2) = 52%, low-quality evidence). These findings suggest that for a couple with a 13% chance of live birth using FSP, the chance when using IUI will be between 8% and 19%; and that for a couple with a 19% chance of pregnancy using FSP, the chance of pregnancy when using IUI will be between 10% and 20%. Nor was evidence found of a statistically significant difference between IUI and FSP in per-pregnancy of multiple pregnancy (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.07, eight RCTs, 197 women, I(2) = 0%, low-quality evidence), miscarriage (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.53, seven RCTs, 199 women, I(2) = 0%, low-quality evidence) or ectopic pregnancy (OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.42 to 6.88, four RCTs, 111 women, I(2) = 0%, very low quality evidence). Substantial heterogeneity was noted for the outcome of clinical pregnancy (I(2) = 54%), for which no clear explanation was provided.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently no clear evidence suggests any difference between IUI and FSP with respect to their effectiveness and safety for treating couples with non-tubal subfertility. However, a high level of uncertainty is evident in the findings, and additional research may be useful.

### WITHDRAWN: intra-uterine versus cervical insemination of donor sperm for subfertility [^116fv8Cp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Artificial insemination with sperm is used to improve the chances of conception for various causes of infertility. Traditionally, sperm is deposited in or around the endocervical canal (cervical insemination - CI). Some studies reported higher pregnancy rates if sperm was deposited in the uterine cavity itself (intrauterine insemination - IUI), but most were uncontrolled. However the cost and the risks (infection and anaphylaxis) of IUI may also be higher.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of depositing donor sperm in the uterine cavity (intrauterine insemination) compared to cervical insemination.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Subfertility Review Group specialised register of controlled trials was searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing intrauterine insemination and cervical insemination, using fresh or cryopreserved semen, with or without ovarian hyperstimulation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality assessment and data extraction were done independently by two reviewers.

Main Results

Twelve studies were included. They comprised 697 patients undergoing 2215 treatment cycles. Ten trials used frozen semen, with three using ovarian hyperstimulation. Overall the methodological quality of the trials was low. The overall pregnancy rate per cycle in the intrauterine insemination group was 18% compared to 5% for cervical insemination. When cryopreserved donor sperm was used, the overall chance of pregnancy in spontaneous or clomiphene-corrected cycles was significantly higher with intrauterine insemination. This was irrespective of whether pregnancy rates were calculated on a per cycle (odds ratio 2.63, 95% confidence interval 1.85 to 3.73) or per patient (odds ratio 3.86, 95% confidence interval 1.81 to 8.25) basis. The greatest benefit appeared in trials with poor pregnancy rates (less than 6%) for cervical insemination. There was no difference in pregnancy rate between intrauterine and cervical insemination when fresh donor sperm was used (odds ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 2.24).

Authors' Conclusions

Intrauterine insemination appears to be beneficial when cervical insemination using cryopreserved donor sperm has had low pregnancy rates. This applies to spontaneous, clomiphene corrected and gonadotrophin stimulated cycles. However it may offer little benefit where high pregnancy rates have been achieved with cervical insemination. There appears to be no additional benefit from intrauterine insemination when fresh sperm is used for donor insemination.

### Synchronised approach for intrauterine insemination in subfertile couples [^116aGZxB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In many countries intrauterine insemination (IUI) is the treatment of first choice for a subfertile couple when the infertility work up reveals an ovulatory cycle, at least one open Fallopian tube and sufficient spermatozoa. The final goal of this treatment is to achieve a pregnancy and deliver a healthy (singleton) live birth. The probability of conceiving with IUI depends on various factors including age of the couple, type of subfertility, ovarian stimulation and the timing of insemination. IUI should logically be performed around the moment of ovulation. Since spermatozoa and oocytes have only limited survival time correct timing of the insemination is essential. As it is not known which technique of timing for IUI results in the best treatment outcome, we compared different techniques for timing IUI and different time intervals.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of different synchronisation methods in natural and stimulated cycles for IUI in subfertile couples.

Search Methods

We searched for all publications which described randomised controlled trials of the timing of IUI. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (1966 to October 2014), EMBASE (1974 to October 2014), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2014) and PsycINFO (inception to October 2014) electronic databases and prospective trial registers. Furthermore, we checked the reference lists of all obtained studies and performed a handsearch of conference abstracts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different timing methods for IUI were included. The following interventions were evaluated: detection of luteinising hormone (LH) in urine or blood, single test; human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration; combination of LH detection and hCG administration; basal body temperature chart; ultrasound detection of ovulation; gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist administration; or other timing methods.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the trials, extracted the data and assessed study risk of bias. We performed statistical analyses in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by The Cochrane Collaboration. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE methods.

Main Results

Eighteen RCTs were included in the review, of which 14 were included in the meta-analyses (in total 2279 couples). The evidence was current to October 2013. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for most comparisons. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to describe study methods, serious imprecision and attrition bias. Ten RCTs compared different methods of timing for IUI. We found no evidence of a difference in live birth rates between hCG injection versus LH surge (odds ratio (OR) 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 18, 1 RCT, 24 women, very low quality evidence), urinary hCG versus recombinant hCG (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.03, 1 RCT, 284 women, low quality evidence) or hCG versus GnRH agonist (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.6, 3 RCTS, 104 women, I(2) = 0%, low quality evidence). Two RCTs compared the optimum time interval from hCG injection to IUI, comparing different time frames that ranged from 24 hours to 48 hours. Only one of these studies reported live birth rates, and found no difference between the groups (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.00, 1 RCT, 204 couples). One study compared early versus late hCG administration and one study compared different dosages of hCG, but neither reported the primary outcome of live birth. We found no evidence of a difference between any of the groups in rates of pregnancy or adverse events (multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)). However, most of these data were very low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is any difference in safety and effectiveness between different methods of synchronization of ovulation and insemination. More research is needed.

### Intrauterine insemination-ready versus conventional semen cryopreservation for donor insemination: a comparison of retrospective results and a prospective, randomized trial [^1131pFqN]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare fecundity rates following intrauterine insemination (IUI) with donor sperm frozen conventionally versus an IUI-ready preparation.

Design

Both retrospective results and a prospective, randomized study where recipients were assigned to one of two sperm cryopreservation methods in each cycle of intrauterine insemination are reported.

Setting

University-based infertility practice, affiliated private practices, and andrology laboratory.

Patient(S)

Women desiring therapeutic insemination in an effort to establish pregnancy.

Intervention(S)

Intrauterine insemination with donor sperm frozen conventionally or by an IUI-ready protocol.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Cycle fecundity in donor IUI recipients.

Result(S)

In a retrospective analysis involving 642 inseminations in 209 recipients, 79 pregnancies were recorded for an overall pregnancy rate of 12.3% per insemination (or cycle): 11.3% with IUI-ready sperm and 13.9% with conventionally preserved sperm. In a follow-up prospective, randomized study, the pregnancy rate for IUI-ready sperm preparations was 36% per cycle (14 of 39) whereas that for conventionally preserved sperm was 19.6% per cycle (9 of 46). Thirteen of the 23 pregnancies occurred in the first study cycle of insemination; only two pregnancies were observed in patients undergoing more than four cycles of insemination.

Conclusion(S)

Cycle fecundity for IUI-ready donor sperm is equivalent to conventional cryopreserved sperm based on both prospective and retrospective assessments.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^1144LW6d]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) with conventional-dose gonadotropins — comparisons with oral medications and protocol strategies: One RCT (n = 900) found a significantly higher live-birth rate with gonadotropins and IUI compared to clomiphene citrate with IUI or letrozole with IUI (32.2%, 23.3%, and 18.7%, respectively), and a significantly higher risk of multiple gestations among live births (32%, 5.7%, and 14.3%, respectively). Another RCT (n = 154) showed no difference in live-birth rates between gonadotropins with IUI versus clomiphene with IUI following two treatment cycles (13.5% vs. 15.7%), with no difference in multiple-gestation live-birth rates (14.3% vs. 12.5% of live births). A third RCT (n = 503) reported similar rates per cycle (9.8% vs. 7.6% ongoing pregnancy per initiated cycle). In a well-designed RCT of treatment strategy in 503 women < 40 years, the conventional protocol consisted of ≤ 3 cycles of clomiphene-IUI, followed by ≤ 3 cycles of gonadotropins-IUI, followed by ≤ 6 cycles of IVF, while the accelerated protocol omitted gonadotropins-IUI; per-cycle pregnancy rates were clomiphene-IUI = 7.6%, FSH-IUI = 9.8%, IVF = 30.7%, and time to pregnancy was shorter with the accelerated protocol (8 vs. 11 months; hazard ratio [HR] 1.25, 95% CI 1.00–1.56, P = 0.045).

### The relationship between duration of infertility and clinical outcomes of intrauterine insemination for younger women: a retrospective clinical study [^114vMTku]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The clinical pregnancy outcomes of IUI are influenced by various factors, such as the basic conditions of the couple, treatment protocol, timing of insemination, and sperm quality after treatment. We posit that the fundamental characteristics of a patient serve as the initial criteria for making clinical decisions. Hence, we conducted a retrospective analysis to investigate the correlation between the duration of infertility and the clinical pregnancy outcomes following IUI in patients of varying ages. Our study revealed that for patients who have been infertile for more than 5 years, both the clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate following IUI progressively decrease as the duration of infertility extends.

The correlation between the duration of infertility and the clinical outcomes of IUI has been a topic of extensive debate. Numerous researchers posit that the length of infertility serves as a significant predictor for successful pregnancy, with the assertion that patients experiencing prolonged periods of infertility exhibit significantly reduced pregnancy rates. Previous studies have shown that the clinical pregnancy rate decreases with the duration of infertility in patients. There were also studies suggested that approximately 80% of pregnancies are achieved less than 4 years after attempting. Although it is difficult to determine a threshold value of infertility duration, less than 4–5 years of infertility should be a appropriate time to try IUI. This is similar to our study, as our results suggest that patients who have been infertile for more than 5 years have significantly reduced clinical pregnancy rates and live birth rates of IUI cycles. On the contrary, some studies suggested that there was no correlation between the duration of infertility and IUI clinical outcomes. The major reason for this difference may be the difference in basic characteristics of the patient population. One of the studies was conducted on polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients, and the results showed no significant difference in the duration of infertility between the pregnant and non pregnant groups. However, PCOS often results in extended periods of infertility and missed opportunities for conception due to aberrant ovulation or anovulation. Thus, the impact of the duration of infertility on the clinical pregnancy outcomes in these patients is ostensibly negligible.

### Double versus single intrauterine insemination for unexplained infertility: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^1156f8V2]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of double versus single intrauterine insemination (IUI) per treatment cycle in women with unexplained infertility.

Design

Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Clinical pregnancy rates per couple.

Intervention(S)

Electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Trials Registry and Medline without year and language restriction through March 2009; hand searching of the abstract books of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology and American Society for Reproductive Medicine annual meetings (2001–2008).

Result(S)

Six randomized trials, involving 829 women, were included in the analysis. Fifty-four (13.6%) clinical pregnancies were recorded for treatment with double IUI and 62 (14.4%) for treatment with single IUI. There was no significant difference between the single and double IUI groups in the probability for clinical pregnancy (odds ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.58–1.45; P = 0.715).

Conclusion(S)

Double IUI offers no clear benefit in the overall clinical pregnancy rate in couples with unexplained infertility.

### Comparing intrauterine insemination and in vitro… [^116aqoAv]. isrctn.com (2025). Medium credibility.

Overall study status Ongoing Condition category Pregnancy and Childbirth Plain English summary of protocol Background and study aims Unexplained infertility affects a significant number of couples, causing emotional distress and leading them to consider costly and intensive treatments like in vitro fertilization. IVF involves hormone injections to stimulate egg production, followed by egg retrieval, fertilization. in a lab, and embryo transfer. However, IVF carries risks such as infection and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Intrauterine insemination, a simpler procedure with lower hormone doses, directly introduces sperm into the womb to increase the chances of fertilization. Current UK guidelines recommend IVF for unexplained infertility, but recent research suggests. that three cycles of IUI may offer similar success rates and be more cost-effective.

To investigate this further, a randomized controlled trial is planned, where couples will be randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of IUI or proceed directly to an IVF cycle. Couples assigned to IUI can still opt for IVF if unsuccessful. The study will assess patient outcomes such as quality of life. computer at the UNITY Trial Office. The computer will allocate the treatment randomly. You will have an equal chance of receiving either 3 cycles of IUI or 1 cycle of IVF. This method of research is called a "randomised controlled trial". What are the possible benefits and risks of participating. IVF is routinely performed in the UK, and IUI is well established and is routinely performed in. many countries around the world. There are no other trial-specific risks beyond those such as multiple births that were explained in the information that you had before treatment. You will sign routine local treatment consent forms as would any couple beginning fertility treatment.
