## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which treatment option should be selected for a 57-year-old postmenopausal woman who presents with postmenopausal bleeding, has multiple large uterine fibroids, and significant comorbidities including morbid obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immediate priority of evaluating postmenopausal bleeding and ruling out endometrial cancer. Then, I should verify how fibroids fit into the differential and whether they explain the bleeding. Next, I will review how her comorbidities modify cancer risk and surgical risk. After that, I need to compare the therapeutic options against guideline-based evidence and the patient's risk profile. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and ensure it aligns with contemporary guidance and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the priority: any postmenopausal bleeding mandates evaluation for endometrial pathology, most importantly endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, before deciding on definitive therapy for fibroids, because postmenopausal bleeding is the cardinal symptom of endometrial cancer and carries a meaningful risk of malignancy that increases with age and comorbidities [^116FTFV1] [^116VCBHk] [^111TvDBc].

> Wait, let me verify the initial workup steps. The standard approach is transvaginal ultrasound to assess endometrial thickness and look for focal lesions, followed by endometrial sampling if the endometrium is thickened or if bleeding persists. In a 57-year-old with risk factors, proceeding directly to endometrial biopsy is reasonable, and hysteroscopy can be added if focal pathology is suspected or sampling is non-diagnostic [^114WRQ4V] [^116VCBHk].

> I need to check how fibroids influence this. Large fibroids can cause bleeding, but in postmenopausal patients they do not exclude endometrial pathology; in fact, fibroids may coexist with hyperplasia or cancer, so I should not anchor on fibroids as the sole cause until malignancy is excluded by tissue diagnosis [^116VCBHk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before staging the risk. I should confirm that her obesity, hypertension, and diabetes materially increase the risk of endometrial cancer; meta-analyses show diabetes increases endometrial cancer risk by roughly 70% and hypertension by about 60%, and obesity independently elevates risk, so her baseline risk is high enough that definitive pathologic evaluation of the endometrium is essential before choosing fibroid-directed therapy [^116iUsFL] [^111TvDBc].

> Next, I should review the options against guideline-based evidence. Myomectomy is generally reserved for patients desiring fertility or uterine preservation; at 57 and postmenopausal, fertility is not a goal, and myomectomy would leave residual fibroids and does not address endometrial pathology, so it is not the best choice here [^112PfvTj]. Oral contraceptives are contraindicated after menopause and would not treat fibroids or protect the endometrium in this context, so I should eliminate that option [^notfound]. Uterine artery embolization can reduce fibroid symptoms but does not provide tissue diagnosis and is less appropriate when cancer risk is elevated and when definitive therapy is reasonable, so I should be cautious here [^notfound]. Oral progesterone can stabilize the endometrium in some bleeding scenarios, but it is not definitive and would delay necessary cancer evaluation in a postmenopausal patient with high-risk features, so I should not rely on it as primary therapy now [^notfound] [^116FTFV1]. Total hysterectomy provides both definitive treatment for fibroids and a complete pathologic assessment of the endometrium and cervix, which directly addresses cancer risk and is favored when malignancy risk is elevated and the patient is a surgical candidate [^116dP1Ri] [^116VCBHk].

> I should double-check surgical approach considerations given her morbid obesity. Vaginal hysterectomy is often preferred for benign disease when feasible because it is associated with fewer complications than abdominal or laparoscopic routes; however, with multiple large fibroids, feasibility depends on uterine size, mobility, and surgeon expertise, so a minimally invasive approach may still be possible, but abdominal hysterectomy remains acceptable if vaginal or laparoscopic routes are not feasible due to size or access constraints [^111M5mLz] [^111RGF55].

> But wait, what if she strongly desires uterine preservation despite the risk? In that scenario, I would still insist on endometrial sampling first. If cancer is excluded, uterine-preserving options like uterine artery embolization or focused ultrasound could be considered, but I need to counsel that these do not provide tissue diagnosis and carry higher reintervention rates, and in a high-risk patient that may be suboptimal compared with hysterectomy [^116dP1Ri].

> Let me reconsider the sequence to ensure nothing is missed. The safest, guideline-concordant pathway is: confirm postmenopausal bleeding, obtain transvaginal ultrasound and endometrial sampling, and if endometrial pathology is benign and she remains symptomatic from fibroids, proceed with hysterectomy as definitive therapy; if malignancy is found, oncologic hysterectomy is indicated, which aligns with both cancer care and fibroid management in this context [^114WRQ4V] [^116VCBHk].

> Final answer: Total abdominal hysterectomy is the best treatment option here because it definitively treats fibroids, enables complete pathologic evaluation to rule out endometrial cancer in a high-risk postmenopausal patient, and is consistent with evidence-based management of postmenopausal bleeding and symptomatic fibroids. Route selection should be individualized, with vaginal or laparoscopic approaches preferred when feasible, but abdominal hysterectomy remains appropriate given the likely uterine size and fibroid burden [^116dP1Ri] [^111RGF55] [^111M5mLz].

The best treatment for a 57-year-old postmenopausal woman with multiple large fibroids and postmenopausal bleeding is **total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy** [^notfound]. This approach provides definitive treatment of fibroids, eliminates the risk of recurrence, and allows for comprehensive pathologic evaluation to exclude malignancy [^116dP1Ri]. Given her morbid obesity, hypertension, and diabetes, **minimally invasive approaches** (laparoscopic or robotic) should be considered if feasible, as they reduce postoperative complications and recovery time [^notfound]. Medical therapy (oral progesterone, GnRH analogs) is not appropriate for postmenopausal bleeding because it does not address cancer risk and may mask symptoms [^notfound]. Uterine artery embolization is not first-line in this setting due to limited efficacy for large fibroids and lack of tissue diagnosis [^112gBZow].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

- **Postmenopausal bleeding**: Any bleeding after 12 months of amenorrhea requires evaluation to exclude endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma [^111TCFDr] [^114WRQ4V].

- **Ultrasound**: First-line to assess endometrial thickness, fibroid size, number, and location [^1133dkdo] [^116V6iWm].

- **Endometrial sampling**: Essential to rule out hyperplasia or carcinoma; indicated for postmenopausal bleeding or endometrial thickness > 4 mm [^116VCBHk].

---

## Risk factors and complications

Obesity, hypertension, and diabetes increase the risk of **endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma** [^111TvDBc] [^116iUsFL]. Large fibroids can cause **heavy bleeding, anemia, and bulk symptoms**, further complicating management [^113mHfya].

## Treatment options and their appropriateness

| **Treatment option** | **Appropriateness in this patient** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Myomectomy | Not recommended | - Reserved for women desiring fertility or uterine preservation [^112PfvTj] <br/> - High recurrence risk and does not address cancer risk [^116dP1Ri] |
| Total abdominal hysterectomy | Recommended | - Definitive treatment for fibroids [^116dP1Ri] <br/> - Eliminates recurrence risk <br/> - Allows comprehensive pathologic evaluation [^114GPkmg] |
| Oral contraceptives | Contraindicated | - Not indicated postmenopause [^notfound] <br/> - Increases thromboembolic risk, especially with obesity and hypertension [^111oimrr] |
| Uterine artery embolization | Not first-line | - Limited efficacy for large fibroids <br/> - No tissue diagnosis <br/> - Recurrence risk [^112gBZow] |
| Oral progesterone | Not recommended | - Does not address cancer risk <br/> - May mask symptoms [^notfound] |

---

## Surgical approach

Minimally invasive surgery (**laparoscopic or robotic hysterectomy**) is preferred when feasible, as it reduces postoperative complications, length of stay, and recovery time, particularly in obese patients [^notfound]. However, **total abdominal hysterectomy** remains appropriate if minimally invasive surgery is not feasible due to uterine size, extensive adhesions, or surgeon expertise.

---

## Postoperative considerations

Postoperative care should include **close monitoring** for complications such as infection, venous thromboembolism, and wound healing issues, which are more common in obese patients [^111RGF55]. Long-term follow-up should address **cardiovascular risk factors** (hypertension, diabetes) and monitor for metabolic syndrome [^113EBo7P].

---

## Patient counseling and shared decision-making

Counseling should explain the risks and benefits of each option, including recurrence, potential complications, and the importance of excluding malignancy [^116Kc3vU]. Shared decision-making should incorporate the patient's preferences, comorbidities, and goals to guide the final choice [^112cMm6m].

---

Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is the **best treatment** for this patient, providing definitive fibroid treatment, eliminating recurrence, and enabling comprehensive pathologic evaluation. Minimally invasive approaches should be considered if feasible, and medical therapy is not appropriate due to cancer risk and limited efficacy.

Prior Health History

Multiple meta-analyses have shown an increased risk of endometrial cancer with diabetes, with the most recent reporting an RR of 1.72 (95% CI 1.48–2.01). Diabetes also increases risk of uterine sarcoma (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.41–3.83). A systematic review of 25 studies found hypertension to be an independent risk factor for endometrial cancer (RR 1.61, 95% CI, 1.41–1.85). A meta-analysis of studies of metabolic syndrome found too much heterogeneity between studies and in metabolic syndrome diagnostic criteria to calculate a pooled RR but noted increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome among patients with endometrial cancer compared with a control group in the individual studies. Infertility treatment does not appear to be associated with uterine cancer risk, although there appears to be increased incidence in some subgroups of women with infertility, including those with ovulatory dysfunction, progesterone deficiency, and obesity. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is associated with a 2.89 OR (95% CI 1.52–5.48) of endometrial cancer. Breast and ovarian cancer do not appear to increase uterine cancer risk, although related treatments such as tamoxifen and pelvic radiation do increase uterine cancer risk.

Some preexisting histopathologic abnormalities increase risk. A meta-analysis reported that 32.6% of women with complex endometrial hyperplasia had an occult endometrial cancer (95% CI 24.1–42.4%). Using newer endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia criteria, patients with endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia had a pooled RR of 19.37 (95% CI 5.86–64.01) for progression to cancer. A meta-analysis found a 1.12% and 4.93% risk of endometrial polyps containing malignancy in premenopausal and postmenopausal women, respectively.(See Appendices 3 and 4 for complete evidence summaries.)

### Diagnosis and management of endometrial cancer [^116VCBHk]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy. It is the fourth most common cancer in women in the United States after breast, lung, and colorectal cancers. Risk factors are related to excessive unopposed exposure of the endometrium to estrogen, including unopposed estrogen therapy, early menarche, late menopause, tamoxifen therapy, nulliparity, infertility or failure to ovulate, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Additional risk factors are increasing age, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. The most common presentation for endometrial cancer is postmenopausal bleeding. The American Cancer Society recommends that all women older than 65 years be informed of the risks and symptoms of endometrial cancer and advised to seek evaluation if symptoms occur. There is no evidence to support endometrial cancer screening in asymptomatic women. Evaluation of a patient with suspected disease should include a pregnancy test in women of childbearing age, complete blood count, and prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time if bleeding is heavy. Most guidelines recommend either transvaginal ultrasonography or endometrial biopsy as the initial study. The mainstay of treatment for endometrial cancer is total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Radiation and chemotherapy can also play a role in treatment. Low- to medium-risk endometrial hyperplasia can be treated with nonsurgical options. Survival is generally defined by the stage of the disease and histology, with most patients at stage I and II having a favorable prognosis. Controlling risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension could play a role in the prevention of endometrial cancer.

### Addressing heterogenous outcomes in uterine fibroid research: a call to action [^116rxj4D]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroid tumors are the most common benign pelvic tumors in women, with complications that include heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, reproductive complications, and bulk-related symptoms. Although the majority of uterine fibroid tumors are asymptomatic, those women who experience symptoms can experience substantial burdens on quality of life and daily functioning. Comparative effectiveness reviews of available medical, surgical, and radiologic treatments have found that a lack of high-quality data to inform treatment decisions is, in part, due to the use of heterogeneous outcomes and instruments in clinical studies. With multiple new interventions emerging, this call-to-action encourages the development and use of a core outcome set that will capture the most relevant, patient-important outcomes in late-phase and after-marketing therapeutic trials for uterine fibroid tumors. The core outcome set should be developed by a diverse, multistakeholder group comprised of key healthcare decision-makers. Development and uptake of a core outcome set ensures that a consistent, collaboratively vetted set of outcomes will be accessible across different studies and promotes transparency for innovators who seek to anticipate the evidence needs of patients, providers, payers, regulators, and other stakeholders.

### Current perspectives in polycystic ovary syndrome [^115ibuw7]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome has been viewed primarily as a gynecologic disorder requiring medical intervention to control irregular bleeding, relieve chronic anovulation, and facilitate pregnancy. A large body of evidence has demonstrated an association between insulin resistance and polycystic ovary syndrome. The former condition has an established link with long-term macrovascular diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atherosclerotic heart disease, consequences that also are observed in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. In addition, chronic anovulation predisposes women to endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. The purpose of this review is to examine the clinical course of this syndrome, which spans adolescence through menopause, and suggest a simple and cost-effective diagnostic evaluation to screen the large numbers of women who may be affected. Therapy, which should be individualized, should incorporate steroid hormones, antiandrogens, and insulin-sensitizing agents. Weight loss by way of reduced carbohydrate intake and gentle exercise is the most important intervention; this step alone can restore menstrual cyclicity and fertility, and provide long-term prevention against diabetes and heart disease. Treatment alternatives should be directed initially toward the most compelling symptom. Longitudinal care is of paramount importance to provide protection from long-term sequelae.

Definition of obesity — body mass index (BMI) calculation and classification — Obesity is a disease of excess body fat that increases the risk of conditions including type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, coronary heart disease, cholelithiasis, endometrial and postmenopausal breast cancer, stroke, osteoarthritis, and infertility. Body fat is often estimated by BMI, calculated as body weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Expert committees have established BMI classifications; the World Health Organization classification system is commonly used in Western nations and is outlined in Table 1. A BMI of 30 kg/m² is often used to define obesity at a population level.

### Medical treatment of fibroids: FIGO best practice guidance [^115fJzJu]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

There are different options for treating uterine fibroids. In many cases, medical treatment is the first‐line treatment to preserve fertility and avoid surgery, and is a perfectly satisfactory solution for the patient. Beyond this, medical treatment can be used presurgically to minimize intraoperative complications by reducing the volume of the fibroid(s) or increasing the level of hemoglobin before surgery is performed.

Other treatment options in symptomatic women include interventional radiology and surgical procedures, and these will be presented in other papers in this collection.

Before one can decide which preparation should be used, it is obligatory to decide whether a treatment is necessary at all. Most women with uterine fibroids are asymptomatic and therefore require no intervention. Approximately 30% of them will present with symptoms, which can include abnormal uterine bleeding, anemia, pelvic pain and pressure, back pain, urinary frequency, constipation, or infertility, and will require intervention. The treatment options depend on the personal treatment objectives of the patients in addition to expected treatment effectiveness. Each therapy has its own advantages and disadvantages and improves fibroid volume, pain, menstrual bleeding, and/or anemiain different ways (Table 1).

### Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies novel risk loci for uterine fibroids within and across multiple ancestry groups [^116GPTfJ]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Uterine fibroids, or leiomyomata, are benign monoclonal elliptical growths of smooth muscle and connective tissue in the myometrium of the uterus. They are the most common benign tumor affecting people with a uterus. The cumulative incidence of fibroids by age 50 is estimated to be almost 70% among White individuals and over 80% in Black individuals. Common symptoms of fibroids include heavy menstrual bleeding, abnormal menstrual bleeding, and pelvic pain. People with fibroids report quality-of-life scores similar to or lower than patients with other chronic diseases such as, diabetes, breast cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Fibroids are the leading cause of hysterectomy, comprising 40% of indications, and the estimated annual costs for the United States due to fibroids are between $5.9 to $34.4 billion. Established risk factors for fibroids include early menarche, obesity, premenopausal age, Black race (self-selected), and family history. A protective effect has been seen with parity. Additional factors that have been associated with fibroids include, and are not limited to, vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, stressful life events –, and experiences of racial discrimination.

Genetic factors also contribute to risk, with estimated twin-based heritability ranging from 26 to 63%. There have been 13 fibroid genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that collectively report 72 genes with genome-wide significant variants –. Investigations of fibroid genetics in diverse ancestry groups have been limited in African ancestry populations.

Here we report a large, multi-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis of uterine fibroids including 74,294 cases (27.7% non-European descent) and 465,810 controls (18.3% non-European descent) from a combination of publicly available summary statistics and newly available data. We identified multiple novel genes associated with fibroids in both multi-ancestry and ancestry-specific analyses. We report functional interpretation of significant loci with genetically predicted gene expression. Genes were also characterized into functional pathways and enrichment sets, and pathways relating to cancer and cell cycle were observed.

### Fibroid growth and medical options for treatment [^113D54Bi]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Although fibroids are common benign tumors, their impact on women's quality of life can be considerable. The most frequent symptoms are uterine bleeding, resulting in anemia, and pelvic pain. Fibroids can be of genetic or hormonal origin or arise from intrauterine events. Current options for medical treatment include control of estradiol and progesterone production or action and are discussed in this review. Although curative treatment of fibroids relies on surgical strategies, the current trend is for uterine-sparing treatment to preserve fertility and avoid unnecessary surgery. Currently approved medical treatments include intrauterine progestin delivery to reduce uterine bleeding, GnRH analogues, and, more recently, selective progesterone receptor modulators to control uterine bleeding and reduce fibroid volume.

### Emerging treatment options for fibroids [^113cGrqi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Leiomyomas (fibroids) are common, usually benign, monoclonal tumors that arise from the uterine myometrium. Clinical presentation is variable; some patients are asymptomatic, whereas others experience heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, bulk symptoms, and/or alterations in fertility. Previously, treatment options for fibroids were largely surgical. However, over the last decade, options have grown to include many medical and procedural options that allow for uterine and fertility preservation. Clinicians must become familiar with these options to adequately counsel patients desiring treatment of fibroids.

### Guideline no. 451: asymptomatic endometrial thickening in postmenopausal women [^112jQYKk]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for endometrial hyperplasia, more specifically with respect to patients with asymptomatic endometrial thickening (further evaluation), SOGC 2024 guidelines recommend to individualize the decision on further investigations in asymptomatic patients with increased endometrial thickening and risk factors for endometrial cancer, such as obesity, hypertension, late menopause, unopposed estrogen use, and genetic cancer risks.

### Committee opinion no. 619: gynecologic surgery in the obese woman [^111RGF55]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Obesity is a serious problem worldwide and particularly in the United States, and in women is associated with an increased risk of death and morbid conditions (including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and hypercholesterolemia) as well as malignancies such as endometrial and postmenopausal breast cancer. Adverse effects after gynecologic surgery, such as surgical site infection, venous thromboembolism, and wound complications, are more prevalent in obese women than in normal-weight women. Preoperative consultation with an anesthesiologist should be considered for the obese patient in whom the possibility of obstructive sleep apnea is suspected on clinical grounds or who is at risk of coronary artery disease, has a difficult airway, or has poorly controlled hypertension. Gynecologic surgeons should have the knowledge to counsel obese women on the risks specific to this group. As with all patients, evidence demonstrates that, in general, vaginal hysterectomy is associated with better outcomes and fewer complications than laparoscopic or abdominal hysterectomy. Postoperative care of the obese patient is similar to postoperative care of the normalweight patient and comorbid conditions should be taken into consideration.

### Fibroids: yet another example of disparity in health? [^113NXM6z]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Startlingly, by the age of 50, 70–80% of women will have personally experienced some form of uterine fibroid growth. Further solidifying the prevalence of fibroids, 171 million women globally were estimated to have chronic fibroid symptoms from the 2013 Global burden of Disease (GBD) study on chronic diseases. In 2019, 1,378,498 disability-adjusted life years were attributed to fibroids, as reported by The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). This significant burden of disease prompted the organisation to declare July as Fibroid Awareness Month, under this year's theme "Real solutions". Why then, despite the awareness day and a demonstrable burden on health, are healthcare issues due to fibroids not more highly prioritized?

One of the major problems surrounding fibroids is the lack of clear understanding of the cause. The current primary hypothesis focuses on excess estrogen and progestogen, promoting fibroid growth and development. There also appears to be a genetic component as shown by the increased concordance of fibroids in monozygotic twins versus other sibling pairs. However, a single genetic locus responsible for a majority of fibroid cases has not been identified. Risk factors for fibroids include heredity, low Vitamin-D levels, lack of previous childbirth, obesity, consumption of red meat and alcohol, polycystic ovary syndrome, diabetes and hypertension.

### Clinical practice guideline for abnormal uterine bleeding: hysterectomy versus alternative therapy [^116Kc3vU]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To develop recommendations in selecting treatments for abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB).

Design

Clinical practice guidelines.

Setting

Randomized clinical trials compared bleeding, quality of life, pain, sexual health, satisfaction, the need for subsequent surgery, and adverse events between hysterectomy and less-invasive treatment options.

Patients

Women with AUB, predominantly from ovulatory disorders and endometrial causes.

Interventions

On the basis of findings from a systematic review, clinical practice guidelines were developed. Rating the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grades for Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system.

Measurements and Main Results

This paper identified few high-quality studies that directly compared uterus-preserving treatments (endometrial ablation, levonorgestrel intrauterine system and systemically administered medications) with hysterectomy. The evidence from these randomized clinical trials demonstrated that there are trade-offs between hysterectomy and uterus-preserving treatments in terms of efficacy and adverse events.

Conclusion

Selecting an appropriate treatment for AUB requires identifying a woman's most burdensome symptoms and incorporating her values and preferences when weighing the relative benefits and harms of hysterectomy versus other treatment options.

2.3 Estrogen‐progestin contraceptives

Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are composed of an estrogen and a progestin in a single tablet for preventing pregnancy. Today, these agents offer a broader range of effects and are used in the treatment of multiple indications including uterine fibroid therapy.

COCs reduce abnormal uterine bleeding in women with uterine fibroids by 9.9 mL (13.4% reduction) as measured by the alkaline hematin method, and by 53.5% by the Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart. A meta‐analysis of studies assessing the association of COCs with fibroid growth demonstrated a 17% reduction in the risk of growth in current users, although the authors pointed out significant heterogeneity among the included trials. There is no evidence to suggest that COCs promote the growth of uterine fibroids.

The available data indicate that COCs may be a treatment option for women experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. However, there is limited evidence regarding their efficacy for other fibroid‐related symptoms, particularly as COCs do not significantly reduce fibroid volume. Another important factor to consider is the patient's age. Uterine fibroids often grow with advancing age, meaning that symptoms frequently manifest during later reproductive years. The use of COCs in older women remains a subject of debate. In such cases, it is advisable to consider formulations with lower estrogen doses and carefully selected progestogens to minimize the risk of thrombotic or cardiovascular events. Moreover, women over the age of 35 years who smoke should not use COCs due to an increased risk of serious complications. In summary, COCs cannot be considered a universal treatment strategy for uterine fibroids, particularly in older patients.

A review of the literature evaluated the impact of hormonal replacement treatment (HRT) in postmenopausal women with uterine fibroids. Available data suggest that uterine fibroids might be influenced by HRT, without representing an absolute contraindication. Women with uterine fibroids who use HRT should be periodically examined and hormonal treatment should be discontinued if fibroids appear to increase in size.

The following constitutes key background information on endometrial cancer:

- **Definition**: Endometrial cancer is a malignancy that originates in the endometrium, the inner lining of the uterus.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of endometrial cancer involves the abnormal growth and spread of endometrial cells. This is often due to genetic mutations that disrupt the normal cell cycle, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of endometrial cancer in the US is estimated at 12.6 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors associated with the development of endometrial cancer include obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and certain genetic syndromes such as Lynch syndrome. Additionally, PCOS or estrogen replacement therapy without progesterone, can also increase the risk.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, endometrial cancer often presents with symptoms such as abnormal vaginal bleeding, particularly postmenopausal bleeding, and pelvic pain.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of endometrial cancer is generally favorable when the disease is diagnosed and treated early. However, the prognosis can worsen with advanced stages of the disease, high-grade tumors, and the presence of certain high-risk features such as deep myometrial invasion or lymphovascular space invasion.

### Predicting the risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women presenting with vaginal bleeding: the norwich DEFAB risk assessment tool [^116V6iWm]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal bleeding refers to any genital tract bleeding in a postmenopausal woman, other than the expected bleeding that occurs in women taking sequential hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Because postmenopausal bleeding is the most common symptom of endometrial cancer, when postmenopausal bleeding occurs, clinical evaluation is indicated. Approximately 10% (range 1–25%) of women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding will be diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma. Endometrial atrophy is the most common cause of genital tract bleeding among postmenopausal women. Endometrial hyperplasia and polyps are also common causes.

Two different forms of endometrial carcinoma have been identified. Type-I cancers have an endometrioid histology and account for 70–80% of endometrial carcinomas. They are associated with unopposed oestrogen stimulation of the endometrium and tend to arise in women with obesity, hyperlipidaemia, and other hyper-oestrogenic conditions. Type-II cancers have a non-endometrioid histology and arise in women who are less likely to have the clinical associations seen in type-I cancers. Several risk factors such as obesity, tamoxifen use, increasing age, hypertension, diabetes, and unopposed use of exogenous oestrogens are strongly associated with increased risk of type-I endometrial cancer. Early menarche and late menopause have also been implicated due to prolonged oestrogen stimulation of the endometrium. Nulliparity as an isolated risk factor does not appear to increase the risk of endometrial cancer, although due to the high frequency of anovulatory cycles there may be an association in women with subfertility. Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer is a significant but rare risk factor, with descendants of an affected family member carrying a theoretical 50% lifetime risk of endometrial cancer.

Currently, controversy exists as to whether transvaginal ultrasonography or endometrial biopsy should be used as the initial diagnostic step for clinical evaluation of women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding. In addition, decisions made about the most appropriate investigations that need to be performed, are not always guided by clinical history. The few studies that attempt to include information gained from clinical history to predict the risk of endometrial carcinoma are too small to develop a predictive model.

The aim of our study was to use routinely collected clinical data from history and ultrasound evaluation of the endometrium to develop an algorithm to predict the risk of endometrial carcinoma in women presenting to secondary care with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding.

WOMEN-SPECIFIC HYPERTENSION RISK FACTORS

In addition to the conventional risk factors for HTN, several sex-related cardiovascular risk factors have been identified and need to be considered. Indeed, women undergo numerous hormonal changes throughout their lives, which can impact on their hypertensive and cardiovascular risk. Figure 2 summarizes some of the pathophysiology of sex-related differences in HTN, focusing on women aspects.

FIGURE 2
Pathophysiology of hypertension considering women specificities.

Menarche

Early or late menarche can be associated with HTN, as can menstrual disorders (premenstrual syndrome, painful or irregular periods).

Gynecological disorders

Gynecological disorders, such as like polycystic ovary syndrome, fibroids, endometriosis, contribute to an increased cardiovascular risk and a higher likelihood of developing HTN well before menopause.

Oral contraceptives

Oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol are associated with an increase in BP and cardiovascular and thromboembolic risk. It is, therefore, recommended to opt for low-dose contraceptives, transdermals or progestins alone, especially in cases of uncontrolled HTN.

Pregnancy-related disorders

Pregnancy acts like a cardiovascular stress test, potentially triggering or revealing HTN. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy include gestational HTN, preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count), or intrauterine growth retardation with low birth weight. These disorders not only elevate fetomaternal morbidity during pregnancy but also have long-term health consequences. The cardiovascular risk is thus increased not only for the mother but also for the child later in life. The importance of obstetrical history in women's life course should be part of the systematic anamnesis, as any hypertensive disorders during pregnancy are considered a risk factor for developing not only HTN in the following years but also cardiovascular disease [stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and chronic kidney disease (CKD)].

Obesity

Obesity is strongly associated with HTN in women. The neuroendocrine hormone leptin plays an important role in obesity by regulating food intake, metabolism, and fat distribution. Additionally, progesterone appears to amplify leptin-mediated endothelial dysfunction in obese premenopausal women through aldosterone and endothelial mineralocorticoid receptors. Leptin also seems to contribute to obesity in women with polycystic ovary syndrome or uterine fibroids.

Menopause

As already described, menopause has a significant impact on cardiovascular risk, especially when it occurs early, due to the loss of sexual hormone protection.

Hormone replacement therapy can, therefore, modify BP depending on the type of estrogens administered: oral forms increase hepatic angiotensinogen, activating the RAAS and potentially raising BP, while transdermal estrogens appear to have a neutral or hypotensive effect.

### A 41-year-old woman with menorrhagia, anemia, and fibroids: review of treatment of uterine fibroids [^114heV6L]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Uterine fibroids are common tumors that can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure symptoms, and reproductive disorders. The incidence of fibroids peaks in the fifth decade of age and they are more common in African American women. Often, fibroids are asymptomatic and require no treatment. However, the case of Ms P, a 41-year-old woman with recurrent uterine fibroids, menorrhagia, anemia, and fatigue who wishes to retain fertility, illustrates the symptoms that require treatment. Evaluation usually begins with a pelvic examination and an ultrasound to determine both the size and location of the fibroids within the uterus. Standard treatment of symptomatic fibroids is surgical removal by myomectomy or hysterectomy, depending in part on the desire for future fertility; new treatment options include uterine artery embolization via interventional radiologic techniques as well as various medical interventions. Several new therapies show promise but are still experimental at this time. The evidence for treatment options for Ms P and symptomatic patients with fibroids in general is discussed.

Medical, reproductive, and gynecologic history

For patient medical history, there was consensus on capturing the presence of relatively common medical conditions among reproductive aged women that might affect complication risk during or after a procedure. These conditions included hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease, and a history of thrombosis. Gynecologic conditions that frequently coexist or produce similar symptoms to uterine fibroids and which could affect treatment decisions and/or the likelihood of symptom relief, such as endometriosis and adenomyosis, were also identified. Because abnormal uterine bleeding is the most frequent symptom associated with uterine fibroids, there was consensus on including data on menstrual regularity, heaviness of flow, and whether the abnormal bleeding had resulted in anemia, with or without a transfusion (as a marker of severity). Although there was consensus on the value of these data, the participants recognized that there is considerable variability in how this information is elicited from patients and recorded by clinicians, and that further work on reaching consensus on standards for reporting is needed. There was consensus on including data on previous pregnancy, including number of pregnancies, outcomes (miscarriage, abortion, live birth, stillbirth), gestational age, and delivery type. Pregnancy-related data elements were considered important for several reasons, including a potential association between fibroids and outcomes, the impact of mode of delivery on choice of treatment approach (such as scarring from previous cesarean sections), concordance with other WHT-CRN registries, and, importantly, the potential for using those same elements as outcomes for uterine-preserving treatments.

Data elements specific to fibroid history included current symptoms (bleeding, cyclic pain, non-cyclic pain, bulk symptoms, recurrent miscarriage), history and year of any prior procedures (abdominal, hysteroscopic, laparoscopic/robotic, or vaginal myomectomy, focused ultrasound, endometrial ablation, radiofrequency ablation, or uterine artery embolization), and current medical treatments (hormonal birth control, tranexamic acid, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).

### Selective progesterone receptor modulators for the treatment of uterine leiomyomas [^1151FVYt]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Uterine leiomyomas have drawn much attention since being described more than 200 years ago. These common benign uterine tumors often present with prolonged menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure, and reproductive disorders and pose a true financial burden on health care systems all over the world. Over the past few decades, surgical treatment of uterine leiomyomas has received most of the focus compared with other treatment options. Choosing the appropriate surgical technique depends on many factors such as uterine leiomyoma location, patient's age, interest in future fertility, concomitant comorbidities, and the patient's preference. Pharmacologic treatments such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and antagonists have been used for the treatment of symptomatic uterine leiomyomas with only partial success. Myriad side effects and limited clinical results have rendered them less popular and have exposed a true need for new effective medical treatments. Recently, treatment with selective progesterone receptor modulators has shown promising results with shrinkage of uterine leiomyomas and a prolonged clinical effect. Selective progesterone receptor modulators provide hope for women with this challenging condition and are a promising new option in the armamentarium of medical treatments for uterine leiomyomas.

Hormonal dysregulation and cardiovascular disease risk

Polycystic ovarian syndrome and cardiovascular disease risk

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) affects 6–16% of women with marked ethnic variation. Central to the disorder are dysovulation, hyperandrogenism, and metabolic disturbances, particularly insulin resistance. Diagnosis is most commonly based on the Rotterdam criteria, requiring 2 out of 3 of oligo-or anovulation, clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary(-ies) on ultrasound.PCOS has been associated with many risk factors for CVD including impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and raised inflammatory markers. Young women with PCOS have evidence of endothelial dysfunction and subclinical atherosclerosis, as assessed by CIMT and CAC scores. Although most women are diagnosed in their 20s and 30s, long-term follow-up studies are limited. The natural progression of cardiovascular risk factors has been hampered by confounders like obesity and the heterogeneous criteria and various phenotypes of the disorder. Several cardiovascular risk factors associated with PCOS seem to ameliorate over time. In a meta-analysis performed for the development of the ESHRE/American Society for Reproductive Medicine guidelines on PCOS, and restricted to only higher quality studies, no increased risk of MI, stroke or CAD was found in women with PCOS compared to controls. Another meta-analysis confirmed that the risk of CVD was increased in women of reproductive age, but not in peri- or post-menopausal women. This may be related to timely modification of cardiovascular risk factors, a cardio-protective effect from a delayed menopause, or other unknown (genetic) factors.

It is recommended that all women with PCOS should have an assessment of BP and OGTT, and a fasting lipid profile. Dietary and lifestyle education is recommended and as women with PCOS have increased risk of diabetes and HPD, they should be offered screening for GDM in pregnancy.

Other chronic gynaecological conditions associated with cardiovascular disease risk

There is considerable overlap between gynaecologic conditions and chronic disease, particularly CVD. In addition to the gynae-endocrine disorders (e.g. PCOS, POI, hypogonado-trophic hypogonadism), endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and hysterectomy < 50 years with ovarian conservation have all been associated with increased CVD risk. Endometriosis is associated with enhanced inflammation, oxidative stress, and an adverse lipid profile. Although causal relationships have not been proven, the gynaecological and reproductive history may provide important insights into potential long-term health risks in women for which a more systems-wide approach may be beneficial.

### Uterine fibroids: diagnosis and treatment [^1133dkdo]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are common benign neoplasms, with a higher prevalence in older women and in those of African descent. Many are discovered incidentally on clinical examination or imaging in asymptomatic women. Fibroids can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pressure, bowel dysfunction, urinary frequency and urgency, urinary retention, low back pain, constipation, and dyspareunia. Ultrasonography is the preferred initial imaging modality. Expectant management is recommended for asymptomatic patients because most fibroids decrease in size during menopause. Management should be tailored to the size and location of fibroids; the patient's age, symptoms, desire to maintain fertility, and access to treatment; and the experience of the physician. Medical therapy to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding includes hormonal contraceptives, tranexamic acid, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or selective progesterone receptor modulators are an option for patients who need symptom relief preoperatively or who are approaching menopause. Surgical treatment includes hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery.

### Management of endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical endometrial hyperplasia: ACOG clinical consensus no. 5 [^113q2S8s]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on endometrial hyperplasia:

- **Definition**: Endometrial hyperplasia is an abnormal growth of endometrial glands and stroma due to excessive estrogen exposure and can be a precursor to endometrial cancer.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of endometrial hyperplasia is primarily driven by chronic exposure to unopposed estrogen, which stimulates the proliferation of endometrial cells, and a deficiency in progesterone, which normally counteracts the effects of estrogen by inducing cell differentiation and apoptosis.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of endometrial hyperplasia is estimated at 133 per 100,000 woman-years, peaking at ages 50–60. The peak incidences of simple, complex, and atypical endometrial hyperplasia are estimated at 142, 213, and 56 per 100,000 woman-years, respectively.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia include obesity, diabetes, PCOS, and postmenopausal status, all of which can lead to an excess of estrogen. Certain medications, such as tamoxifen and selective estrogen-receptor modulators, can also increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, endometrial hyperplasia most commonly presents with abnormal uterine bleeding, which can manifest as heavy menstrual bleeding or postmenopausal bleeding.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of endometrial hyperplasia varies based on the type of hyperplasia and the presence of atypical cells. While most cases of endometrial hyperplasia are benign, there is a potential for progression to endometrial cancer. The cumulative 20-year progression risk is < 5% for non-atypical endometrial hyperplasia but increases to 28% for atypical hyperplasia.

### Treatment patterns in patients with uterine fibroids with and without a diagnosis of heavy menstrual bleeding: results from a large U.S. claims database [^112cMm6m]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uterine fibroids (UF) are the most common benign pelvic tumors among women in the United States. The prevalence of UF increases with age until menopause, with > 60% of cases occurring in women aged 30–44 years. Although UF can be asymptomatic, ∼25% of women are symptomatic, with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) being the most frequently reported symptom. Although HMB commonly drives the need for treatment in patients with UF, it is not the only factor; other symptoms, such as pain and fatigue, can severely impair multiple aspects of women's health-related quality of life and lead patients to seek medical attention.

No clear consensus currently exists regarding appropriate treatment protocols for patients with symptomatic UF, although it is acknowledged that shared decision-making should be used in treatment selection, and that quality of life should be a central consideration. Recently published guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) regarding the management of symptomatic UF suggest that treatment decisions should be guided by individual patient symptoms and long- and short-term treatment goals. However, very few drugs are indicated for UF, and only limited evidence is available for many commonly used pharmacologic options. Medical treatments used for UF or its symptoms include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tranexamic acid, hormonal therapy, aromatase inhibitors, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs, and progesterone modulators. These typically provide only short-term symptom control, and the long-term use of some of these drugs can lead to adverse effects such as reduced bone density or dyslipidemia.

### Management options for uterine fibroid tumors… [^112gBZow]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Following the dictum of primum non nocere, medical therapy is always the first-line option in management of symptomatic fibroid tumors. However, the use of hormonal therapies, including oral contraceptive pills, progesterones, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, has had conflicting results for some aspects of fibroid-related bleeding. In patients with symptoms persisting for more than three months, it is reasonable to try other therapies because further improvement is unlikely. When considering other noninvasive treatment options, such as uterine artery embolization, it is important to carefully select your patients. There now are long-term follow-up data from the Fibroid Registry for Outcomes Data that may give patients some idea of treatment expectations. The overall success rate of uterine artery embolization is similar to that associated with the alternative treatment of myomectomy.

2 Size and location of the tumor are important factors to consider when choosing a treatment. Submucosal fibroid tumors have a higher likelihood of necrosing and passing into the uterine cavity, which requires further surgical intervention, thus defeating the purpose of embolization. Fibroids larger than the equivalent of 20 weeks' gestational age, adenomyosis, and pedunculated subserosal fibroid tumors confer a higher chance of treatment failure and, if symptomatic, are best treated with other surgical options. 4 Although limited conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study, it remains an ongoing debate whether to remove the cervix in hysterectomies for benign disease. Options for hysterectomy include vaginal, abdominal, laparoscopy-assisted vaginal, laparoscopy-assisted supracervical, and complete laparoscopic hysterectomy.

The approach recommended depends on many factors, such as size, concurrent ovarian pathology, prior surgeries, descent of uterus, and, most importantly, the expertise of the surgeon. Studies comparing all three approaches suggest that the safest and most cost-effective approach is vaginal hysterectomy. Until there are better randomized trials comparing treatment options, physicians must carefully counsel patients and consider associated symptoms, individual expectations, and quality of life. In-depth counseling on the evidence for a specific treatment is an important consideration in the management of uterine fibroid tumors.

Surgical or interventional therapy

If medical management proves insufficient, surgical or interventional procedures are the next approach to treating symptomatic fibroids. A myomectomy (laparoscopic, hysteroscopic, or abdominal) removes fibroids to address symptomatic disease, but has a high rate of recurrence, requiring sequential treatment or a second line of therapy to manage the disease. While myomectomy preserves fertility, the cumulative risk of multiple surgeries must be considered when pursuing this course of action. Hysterectomy is the only definitive cure for fibroids, but eliminates the option of pregnancy and may have long-term health impacts. In fact, fibroids account for one-third of all hysterectomies.

The short- and long-term trade-offs of these procedures vary. Hysterectomy, even with ovarian conservation, affects ovarian function and leads to early menopause, but it shows better outcomes for fibroids within 3–5 years post-surgery, compared to other medical treatments. However, in the longer term, hysterectomy (particularly when conducted with oophorectomy) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, fracture risk, pelvic floor dysfunction, and neurologic issues. These complications are not fully understood and often are not adequately discussed with patients.

Endometrial ablation and uterine artery embolization are not only less invasive procedures but they also inhibit fertility. Alternatively, magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRg-FUS) is an emerging noninvasive treatment recommended for patients who have fewer and larger fibroids. Patients report symptom improvement within the first 2 years, but one-third of women will need another procedure to treat recurrent disease. Because this is a new treatment, many providers do not know enough about it to offer this option, and MRg-FUS is not always covered by health insurance. The FDA has also cleared a laparoscopic, ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation therapy, an outpatient procedure that spares the uterus and allows for more rapid recovery. Pregnancy data concerning these emerging technologies are still limited.

Although conservative methods of treatment to preserve the uterus and fertility are often preferred, the likelihood of re-intervention increases with these approaches. With this comes the added burdens of cost, risk, and compromised emotional wellness of the patient. To help guide clinical decision-making, there is a need for additional comparative data on treatment options and their outcomes, as well as evidence-based algorithms to help predict patient responses to treatments. More research is also needed to identify less invasive treatment options without fertility-related drawbacks.

Definitions — symptoms and clinical outcome metrics — are specified as follows. Adenomyosis is defined as implants of endometrial tissue within the uterine wall that may cause progressive dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia, and it is best distinguished from leiomyomata with magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical success is defined as significant improvement or resolution of presenting symptoms without additional therapy. Dysmenorrhea is defined as painful menstruation. Menorrhagia is defined as heavy, prolonged menstrual flow that may result in chronic blood-loss anemia, most commonly caused by submucosal leiomyomas, but also by intramural leiomyomas that distort the endometrial cavity.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) monitoring and discontinuation — For women with persistent unscheduled bleeding while taking MHT, we recommend evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology, most importantly, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, and we recommend informing women about the possible increased risk of breast cancer during and after discontinuing EPT and emphasizing the importance of adhering to age-appropriate breast cancer screening. We suggest that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. For young women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), premature or early menopause, without contraindications, we suggest taking MHT until the time of anticipated natural menopause, when the advisability of continuing MHT can be reassessed. For women preparing to discontinue MHT, we suggest a shared decision-making approach to elicit individual preference about adopting a gradual taper vs abrupt discontinuation.

Fig. 6
Sagittal T2w images of a 45-year-old patient with a large uterus containing multiple uterine fibroids. Left: intramural uterine fibroid with medium T2w signal intensity in between myometrium and skeletal muscle (Funaki type 2), with a volume of 406 cm³ (diamond). Right: uterine fibroid in contact with endometrium with high T2w signal intensity comparable to myometrium (Funaki type 3), with a volume of 57 cm³ (triangle), and subserosal Funaki type 2 uterine fibroid with a volume of 36 cm³ (star)

By calculating scaled signal intensities (SSIs) from T1w and T2w scans using a reference structure, signal intensities can be analyzed in a semi-quantitative manner. A similar approach has been relatively successfully applied in the context of MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) treatments of fibroids (as per Funaki scale) by comparing T2w signal intensities of fibroids to those in myometrium and skeletal muscle. The resulting metric (Funaki scale) is used to estimate the degree to which fibroid tissue can be heated.

### The modern management of uterine fibroids-related abnormal uterine bleeding [^116Qmaq4]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids (UFs) are the most common female benign pelvic tumors, affecting > 60% of patients aged 30–44 years. Uterine fibroids are asymptomatic in a large percentage of cases and may be identified incidentally using a transvaginal ultrasound or a magnetic resonance imaging scan. However, in approximately 30% of cases, UFs affect the quality of life and women's health, with abnormal uterine bleeding and heavy menstrual bleeding being the most common complaints, along with iron deficiency (ID) and ID anemia. Medical treatments used for UFs-related abnormal uterine bleeding include symptomatic agents, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and tranexamic acid, and hormonal therapies, including combined oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or antagonists, levonorgestrel intrauterine systems, selective progesterone receptor modulators, and aromatase inhibitors. Nevertheless, few drugs are approved specifically for UF treatment, and most of them manage the symptoms. Surgical options include fertility-sparing treatments, such as myomectomy, or nonconservative options, such as hysterectomy, especially in perimenopausal women who are not responding to any treatment. Radiologic interventions are also available: uterine artery embolization, high-intensity focused ultrasound or magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound, and radiofrequency ablation. Furthermore, the management of ID and ID anemia, as a consequence of acute and chronic bleeding, should be taken into account with the use of iron replacement therapy both during medical treatment and before and after a surgical procedure. In the case of symptomatic UFs, the location, size, multiple UFs, or coexistent adenomyosis should guide the choice with a shared decision-making process, considering long- and short-term treatment goals expected by the patient, including pregnancy desire or wish to preserve the uterus independently of reproductive goals.

Antihypertensive Medication Use

Participants reported all medication used at each visit, and study staff categorized each medication by mechanism. Antihypertensive medications included α-blockers, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and diuretics. Participants who reported use of antihypertensive medication in the current visit or in a prior visit were considered to be using antihypertensive medication; however, the type of antihypertensive medication used was updated at each visit and reflected current use only.

Models of time-varying antihypertensive treatment vs no treatment were conducted among a subpopulation of participants eligible to be treated with antihypertensives (624 participants at baseline; using antihypertensive medication; having systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg; or having systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mm Hg and at least 1 risk factor [age ≥ 65 years, history of cardiovascular event, 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score ≥ 10%, or diabetes]) (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). We also evaluated time-varying treatment with ACE inhibitors specifically, because of evidence suggesting that ACE inhibitors may be associated with lower fibroid incidence(ACE inhibitors were 28%-34% of antihypertensive medications used across visits). eTable 2 in Supplement 1 describes the subpopulation eligible for antihypertensive treatment.

Covariates

Participants self-reported their age, educational attainment, race and ethnicity, smoking status, and parity. To identify race and ethnicity, participants were asked their primary group and told to choose 1 group if identifying as multiple races and ethnicities. Data on race and ethnicity are included in this analysis because Black women experience elevated risk of both fibroids and hypertension compared with White women.

Because fibroids are diagnosed by radiological tests or physical examinations, they are more likely to be identified in participants with greater health care engagement. We operationalized health care utilization with variables that may reflect healthy behaviors, health care seeking, and health care access, such as multivitamin use, calcium supplementation, annual times spoken to a health care practitioner, and recency of last mammogram. To explore the role of gynecologic symptoms and care on likelihood of fibroid detection, we used recency of last pelvic examination, abnormal bleeding, and pelvic pain. We categorized menopausal status using data on menstrual bleeding patterns, pregnancy and/or breastfeeding, hormone use, and hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy. All variables except baseline age, education, site, and race and ethnicity were updated at each visit.

### Evaluation and management of abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women [^117PA1a1]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Up to 14 percent of women experience irregular or excessively heavy menstrual bleeding. This abnormal uterine bleeding generally can be divided into anovulatory and ovulatory patterns. Chronic anovulation can lead to irregular bleeding, prolonged unopposed estrogen stimulation of the endometrium, and increased risk of endometrial cancer. Causes include polycystic ovary syndrome, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, and use of antipsychotics or antiepileptics. Women 35 years or older with recurrent anovulation, women younger than 35 years with risk factors for endometrial cancer, and women with excessive bleeding unresponsive to medical therapy should undergo endometrial biopsy. Treatment with combination oral contraceptives or progestins may regulate menstrual cycles. Histologic findings of hyperplasia without atypia may be treated with cyclic or continuous progestin. Women who have hyperplasia with atypia or adenocarcinoma should be referred to a gynecologist or gynecologic oncologist, respectively. Ovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding, or menorrhagia, may be caused by thyroid dysfunction, coagulation defects (most commonly von Willebrand disease), endometrial polyps, and submucosal fibroids. Transvaginal ultrasonography or saline infusion sonohysterography may be used to evaluate menorrhagia. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is an effective treatment for menorrhagia. Oral progesterone for 21 days per month and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are also effective. Tranexamic acid is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ovulatory bleeding, but is expensive. When clear structural causes are identified or medical management is ineffective, polypectomy, fibroidectomy, uterine artery embolization, and endometrial ablation may be considered. Hysterectomy is the most definitive treatment.

### Uterine fibroids [^113mHfya]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids or myomas), benign tumours of the human uterus, are the single most common indication for hysterectomy. They are clinically apparent in up to 25% of women and cause significant morbidity, including prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure or pain, and, in rare cases, reproductive dysfunction. Thus, both the economic cost and the effect on quality of life are substantial. Surgery has been the mainstay of fibroid treatment, and various minimally invasive procedures have been developed in addition to hysterectomy and abdominal myomectomy. Formation of new leiomyomas after these conservative therapies remains a substantial problem. Although medications that manipulate concentrations of steroid hormones are effective, side-effects limit long-term use. A better approach may be manipulation of the steroid-hormone environment with specific hormone antagonists. There has been little evidence-based evaluation of therapy. New research into the basic biology of these neoplasms may add new treatment options for the future as the role of growth factors and genetic mutations in these tumours are better understood.

### Predictors of response for elagolix with add-back therapy in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids [^111vxRTP]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Structured Discussion or Comment

Principal findings

This subgroup analysis demonstrated that treatment with elagolix with hormonal add-back therapy is efficacious in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding, achieving amenorrhea, and improving severity of symptoms and HRQoL in women across all ages and BMIs, various race and ethnicity groups, and over a wide range of baseline menstrual blood loss volume and uterine anatomy parameters.

Clinical implications

These study results show that response to elagolix with add-back therapy is not diminished by clinical or uterine factors that indicate more severe disease. Thus, all women may benefit from medical therapy before resorting to surgery.

Hysterectomy is the long-standing primary management option for symptomatic fibroids; however, it is not without a loss of fertility and surgical complications. In addition, hysterectomy, even with conservation of both ovaries, has also been linked to long-term cardiovascular risks. Despite the risks associated with hysterectomy, many women are not offered alternatives to hysterectomy for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids.

Current medical management options used for symptomatic uterine fibroids include nonhormonal treatments such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and antifibrinolytics and hormonal options, such as combination oral contraceptives, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems, progestogens, and GnRH agonists. In Canada and Europe, ulipristal acetate is also available; however, although effective, it is indicated for only 1 treatment course unless the patient is not a surgical candidate. Treatment breaks and monitoring are also required. Current options for medical treatment of symptomatic fibroids have been shown to produce inconsistent results across subsets of women. Furthermore, such options are only approved in the United States for short-term presurgical treatment of women who experience anemia associated with fibroid-related heavy menstrual bleeding.
