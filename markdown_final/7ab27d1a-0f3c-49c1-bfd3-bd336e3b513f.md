## Question

Tumiscient solutions for fat harvesting

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tumescent solutions for fat harvesting, specifically seeking a synthesis of the evidence on their composition, dosing, and use in clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic foundation of tumescent solutions and why the dosing paradigm differs from conventional infiltration anesthesia. Then, I should verify lidocaine dosing limits with and without liposuction and how those translate into practical concentrations. Next, I will review additives like epinephrine, sodium bicarbonate, and potential agents such as tranexamic acid and bupivacaine, while keeping an eye on their impact on fat graft biology. After that, I should examine the role of solution temperature and delivery technique. Finally, I will synthesize procedure-specific recommendations, highlight safety monitoring, and address special populations and contraindications before summarizing key takeaways with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacology. Tumescent local anesthesia uses large volumes of very dilute lidocaine with epinephrine in saline or lactated Ringer's to create a subcutaneous reservoir that provides regional anesthesia, vasoconstriction, and tissue hydrodissection; importantly, systemic absorption is slowed by epinephrine, and a significant fraction of lidocaine is removed by aspiration during liposuction, which is why the allowable mg/kg dose is far higher than the traditional 7 mg/kg used for undiluted infiltration [^1179TuKg] [^113jxEmt] [^116DKX7u].

> Wait, let me verify the lidocaine limits before I anchor on 55 mg/kg. Initial guidance often cites 55 mg/kg with liposuction based on large series and expert consensus, but pharmacokinetic data indicate a more conservative ceiling of 45 mg/kg with liposuction yields a ≤ 1/2000 risk of exceeding a mild toxicity threshold of 6 μg/mL, whereas 28 mg/kg without liposuction keeps toxicity risk similarly low. So, 55 mg/kg is not categorically unsafe, but 45 mg/kg with liposuction and 28 mg/kg without liposuction are better-supported, evidence-based maxima that I should prefer in routine practice [^112CMLgX] [^1143rQ1a] [^113jxEmt] [^111MCXto].

> Hold on, I should verify the concentration range next. Let me consider what actually works clinically. For most body areas, 400–500 mg/L lidocaine suffices for anesthesia, with some sensitive zones needing 500 mg/L; higher concentrations like 1000 mg/L can be reserved for select circumstances, but the goal is the lowest effective concentration to limit lidocaine exposure and potential adipocyte effects, especially when the harvested fat is intended for grafting [^114XECSw] [^111jmvYH].

> I need to check the essential additives. Epinephrine 1:1,000,000 (about 1 mg/L) is standard to provide vasoconstriction, reduce blood loss, and slow lidocaine absorption. Sodium bicarbonate 10 mEq/L reduces injection pain by raising pH. And wait, let me reconsider the optional hemostatic adjunct — tranexamic acid 1–2 mg/L can be added to reduce bruising and ecchymosis, with both topical and IV routes studied, though I should acknowledge the literature is heterogeneous and not liposuction-specific in all cases [^115TJGpN] [^1179TuKg] [^116BV8tV] [^116jddAn].

> But wait, what about bupivacaine or prilocaine. Bupivacaine appears in surveys and small series, with reports of improved postoperative pain control and no toxicity signals, yet it lacks high-quality, liposuction-specific safety data; guidelines advise against routine bupivacaine in tumescent solutions pending better evidence, so I should be cautious and avoid assuming class equivalence to lidocaine for this indication; prilocaine has historical data supporting feasibility, but U.S. availability is limited and methemoglobinemia remains a theoretical concern, albeit uncommon at low doses in small-volume cases [^112j9ukr] [^115TJGpN] [^114VecXK].

> Next, I should review the effect of solution temperature and pH on comfort and vasoconstriction. Warm tumescent solutions at approximately 37–40°C reduce injection pain and patient discomfort compared with room temperature, whereas cold solutions around 4°C may enhance vasoconstriction and reduce blood loss but carry a hypothermia risk. Randomized data in the arms show no clear superiority of cold over warm for pain or bruising, so I should tailor temperature to patient risk and procedure context, favoring warm solutions for comfort unless a brief, low-volume case could benefit from cold without hypothermia risk [^113wyGsL] [^115fmUHL] [^117FS8Ef].

> I will now examine technique and delivery. Let me verify the time-to-incision and infusion approach. Allowing at least 20 minutes after infiltration ensures epinephrine effect and adequate anesthesia; delivering the solution slowly and using buffered, warm fluid further improves comfort; infiltration pumps or pressure bags enable consistent, controlled delivery, and specialized systems like simultaneous separation and tumescence can improve vasoconstriction efficiency in some settings, though availability and surgeon preference vary [^114zjDNk] [^111MdFkv] [^112oLMDV].

> Now, I should synthesize procedure-specific guidance. For standard-volume body contouring, a practical mix is 400–500 mg/L lidocaine with 1 mg/L epinephrine and 10 mEq/L sodium bicarbonate in saline, staying within 45 mg/kg total lidocaine when liposuction follows. For high-volume cases where the mg/kg ceiling may be exceeded, segmental infiltration with lower lidocaine concentration (for example, 250–400 mg/L) combined with staged timing can keep total dose safer while maintaining anesthesia. For facial and neck procedures, absorption is faster above the clavicles, so I should lower the total dose and avoid stacking sequential infiltrations that could summate peaks [^114XECSw] [^1179TuKg] [^113jxEmt] [^115E5yys] [^115RZ2PR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about graft biology. I need to ensure the tumescent composition preserves adipocyte and stromal vascular fraction viability. Excess lidocaine and epinephrine can impair adipocyte survival via apoptosis and lipolysis pathways. Using the lowest effective lidocaine concentration, avoiding unnecessary additives, and minimizing dwell time help, and emerging strategies like ascorbic acid supplementation or antioxidant additives may mitigate oxidative stress, though human data remain limited and technique standardization is evolving [^111jmvYH] [^113fv7Ja] [^112G1hP3] [^112z7JGQ].

> I should double-check safety monitoring and contraindications. Serious complications linked to tumescent liposuction often arise when tumescent anesthesia is combined with systemic anesthetics or performed outside office-based, awake protocols; office-based tumescent liposuction without systemic anesthesia has an excellent safety record when guidelines are followed, with serious adverse event rates around 0.04–0.16% in large series; I must screen for hepatic enzyme inhibitors, cardiac conduction disease, low albumin, and very high BMI, and maintain vigilant perioperative monitoring for fluid shifts and lidocaine toxicity when larger volumes or sedation are used [^114Ef3zo] [^115w9ket] [^112CMLgX].

> Let me consider special populations. Above-the-clavicle infiltration reaches peak lidocaine earlier and higher, so I should reduce mg/kg and avoid layering with additional tumescent in the same session. Pediatric and geriatric patients have less predictable pharmacokinetics, warranting more conservative dosing. Patients on CYP3A4/1A2 inhibitors or with liver disease require lower limits. Pregnancy is not an absolute contraindication, but prudence dictates minimizing dose and using epinephrine-containing solutions with caution. In obese patients, I should calculate dose on adjusted or lean body mass rather than total weight to avoid over-dosing [^115RZ2PR] [^112sGLzX] [^112CMLgX].

> To wrap up, I should confirm the key takeaways. Evidence-based upper limits are 45 mg/kg with liposuction and 28 mg/kg without liposuction, recognizing that some guidelines still cite 55 mg/kg for select, closely monitored cases. Practical concentrations of 400–500 mg/L lidocaine with 1 mg/L epinephrine and 10 mEq/L sodium bicarbonate balance anesthesia, hemostasis, and comfort. Solution temperature should favor warmth for comfort unless a brief cold protocol is justified. And to protect graft quality, keep lidocaine concentration minimal, limit epinephrine to standard vasoconstrictive doses, and consider investigational antioxidants judiciously while awaiting stronger clinical data [^1143rQ1a] [^115TJGpN] [^114XECSw] [^1179TuKg] [^113wyGsL] [^112G1hP3].

Tumescent solutions for fat harvesting are dilute mixtures of **lidocaine, epinephrine, and saline** [^1179TuKg] that provide local anesthesia, vasoconstriction, and hydrodissection, enabling safe, efficient liposuction with minimal blood loss and enhanced fat graft viability [^notfound]. The standard Klein formula is **1,000 mL saline with 50 mL 1% lidocaine, 1 mL epinephrine 1:1,000, and 12.5 mEq sodium bicarbonate**; alternatives include prilocaine or mepivacaine, and adjuncts such as sodium bicarbonate, triamcinolone, or tranexamic acid [^115TJGpN] [^116BV8tV]. Maximum safe lidocaine doses are **45–55 mg/kg with liposuction** [^113jxEmt] and 28 mg/kg without [^1143rQ1a]; warm, buffered solutions reduce injection pain [^113wyGsL] [^116z5Rtb], and cold solutions may further reduce bleeding [^115fmUHL]. Proper tumescence, wait time, and technique are essential for safety and graft quality [^112d5CjL] [^114dX1uX].

---

## Composition of tumescent solutions

Tumescent solutions typically comprise the following **key components**:

| **Component** | **Function** | **Common concentration** |
|-|-|-|
| Lidocaine | Local anesthetic | 0.05%–0.1% (500–1,000 mg/L) [^114XECSw] |
| Epinephrine | Vasoconstrictor | 1:1,000,000 (1 mg/L) [^1179TuKg] |
| Sodium bicarbonate | Buffer to reduce injection pain | 10–12.5 mEq/L [^1179TuKg] |
| Normal saline or lactated Ringer's | Carrier fluid | 1,000 mL [^1179TuKg] |

---

The **standard Klein solution** consists of 1,000 mL normal saline, 50 mL of 1% lidocaine (500 mg), 1 mL epinephrine 1:1,000, and 12.5 mEq sodium bicarbonate, yielding a final lidocaine concentration of 0.05% (500 mg/L) [^notfound]. This formulation provides effective anesthesia, vasoconstriction, and reduced bleeding [^112pirnH].

---

## Clinical benefits of tumescent solutions

Tumescent solutions offer several **clinical advantages** in fat harvesting:

- **Local anesthesia**: Provides sufficient anesthesia, reducing the need for general anesthesia or systemic sedation [^111E6YZE].
- **Vasoconstriction**: Epinephrine-induced vasoconstriction minimizes blood loss, resulting in clearer operative fields and reduced postoperative bruising [^112pirnH].
- **Hydrodissection**: Facilitates easier separation of fat tissue, enhancing surgical efficiency and precision [^112pirnH].
- **Reduced postoperative pain**: Dilute local anesthesia and minimized tissue trauma contribute to lower postoperative pain levels [^112pirnH].
- **Enhanced fat graft viability**: Lower blood content in harvested fat improves graft survival and retention rates [^notfound].

---

## Safety considerations and potential complications

While tumescent solutions are generally safe, **clinicians must be aware of potential risks and complications**:

- **Lidocaine toxicity**: Excessive lidocaine doses can cause systemic toxicity, including seizures, arrhythmias, and cardiovascular collapse. Recommended maximum doses are 45–55 mg/kg with liposuction and 28 mg/kg without liposuction [^113jxEmt] [^1143rQ1a].
- **Epinephrine-related effects**: Tachycardia, hypertension, and anxiety may occur due to epinephrine absorption [^1179TuKg].
- **Fluid overload**: Large-volume infiltration can cause fluid overload, particularly in patients with compromised cardiovascular or renal function [^112rx5zi].
- **Methemoglobinemia**: Prilocaine-containing solutions can cause methemoglobinemia, particularly in susceptible individuals [^114VecXK].

---

## Variations in tumescent solution formulations

Several **modifications** of the standard Klein solution have been explored:

- **Alternative local anesthetics**: Prilocaine and mepivacaine have been used as alternatives to lidocaine, particularly in patients with lidocaine allergies or sensitivities [^114VecXK] [^114vjNkZ].
- **Adjunctive agents**: Triamcinolone acetonide (glucocorticoid) and tranexamic acid (antifibrinolytic) have been added to reduce inflammation and bleeding, respectively [^113WCxW9] [^116BV8tV].
- **Buffering agents**: Sodium bicarbonate is commonly added to reduce injection pain by increasing the pH of the solution [^1179TuKg].

---

## Impact on fat graft viability and retention

Tumescent solutions significantly influence **fat graft outcomes**. Lower blood content in harvested fat improves graft survival and retention [^notfound]. However, high lidocaine concentrations may negatively affect adipocyte viability and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cell survival, potentially reducing graft retention [^111jmvYH]. To mitigate this, some clinicians use ascorbic acid-supplemented tumescent solutions, which have been shown to improve adipocyte survival and graft retention [^112G1hP3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and best practices

Clinical guidelines emphasize the following **best practices** when using tumescent solutions for fat harvesting:

- **Patient selection**: Careful patient assessment and selection are essential to minimize risks associated with tumescent anesthesia [^113D3wCU].
- **Dose calculation**: Accurate calculation of lidocaine and epinephrine doses based on patient body weight and procedure volume is critical to prevent toxicity [^113D3wCU].
- **Monitoring**: Continuous intraoperative and postoperative monitoring of vital signs and neurological status is recommended to detect early signs of toxicity or complications [^116HuJAR].
- **Technique**: Slow, controlled infiltration of tumescent solution and adequate wait time (approximately 20 minutes) before initiating liposuction ensure optimal anesthesia and vasoconstriction [^114zjDNk].

## Recent advancements and innovations

Recent innovations in tumescent solutions include **cold tumescent anesthesia**, which uses chilled solutions (4°C) to enhance vasoconstriction and reduce intraoperative bleeding and postoperative bruising [^115fmUHL]. Ascorbic acid supplementation has been explored to improve adipocyte viability and graft retention [^112G1hP3]. Simultaneous separation and tumescence (SST) techniques combine tumescence with advanced fat separation methods to improve efficiency and safety [^112oLMDV].

---

Tumescent solutions are **essential for fat harvesting**, providing local anesthesia, vasoconstriction, and hydrodissection. They improve safety, efficiency, and graft quality, but require careful dosing and monitoring to avoid complications.

### Estimated maximal safe dosages of tumescent lidocaine [^112sGLzX]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Study Limitations

Our estimates are preliminary and based on a sample of only 14 subjects. A larger sample size would provide both more evidence of the validity of our normality assumptions and more reliable tolerance interval estimates. Further proof of safety requires a randomized clinical trial involving patients with a wide range of clinical problems. Therapeutic surgeries without liposuction are likely to involve patients who are less healthy and who take more medications than do healthy liposuction patients. Unrecognized comorbidities and unanticipated clinical situations may be encountered. A patient may be taking a drug that impairs lidocaine metabolism and increases the risk of lidocaine toxicity. Pediatric patients, geriatric patients with impaired cardiac function, and patients with low or very high body mass index might not have the same pharmacokinetic response to tumescent lidocaine as a healthy adult. Any clinical condition associated with slower lidocaine metabolism or faster lidocaine absorption requires a reduced lidocaine milligram per kilogram dosage.

The choice of a recommended maximum safe milligram per kilogram dosage should be tempered by the realization that all statistical estimates are affected by sampling error. Careful clinical judgment must influence the choice of maximum permissible dosage for an individual patient.

Dilute tumescent lidocaine is safer than undiluted commercial (0.5%, 1%, and 2%) solutions. When using undiluted commercial lidocaine with epinephrine, the traditional 7 mg/kg dosage limit should be observed.

We performed subcutaneous infiltration of TLA using a specific technique and specially designed infiltration cannulas. Different techniques and different clinicians may have different results.

### Outcomes after tumescence technique versus electrocautery mastectomy [^117VwY8D]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Tumescence is the injection of local anesthetic and crystalloid into the subcutaneous tissue to establish a bloodless plane for surgical dissection. The aim of our study was to evaluate outcomes after mastectomy with tumescent technique compared to electrocautery dissection.

Methods

We conducted a single-institution retrospective evaluation of patients who underwent mastectomy between 2007 and 2011. The tumescent technique was performed by injecting 1% lidocaine with epinephrine mixed in a 10% ratio with lactated Ringer solution into the mastectomy flaps followed by sharp dissection. Significance testing was done to evaluate for outcome differences between the two surgical groups.

Results

Among the 134 patients, 64 underwent electrocautery and 70 underwent tumescent-assisted dissection. The overall complication rate was 21.6% (tumescent, 20.0%; electrocautery, 23.4%, P = 0.63). Flap necrosis requiring operative debridement was the most common complication in the tumescent group (n = 6). On multivariate analysis, tumescent technique was not associated with an increased complication rate. Immediate reconstruction was the only factor that increased the risk of complication (odds ratio 12.95, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The tumescence surgery technique should be utilized with caution in patients undergoing immediate reconstruction, as a trend for higher complication rates was observed in these cases, and flap viability is particularly important in this setting. Future prospective studies are needed to further evaluate blood loss, operative time, postoperative pain, and duration of drainage catheters after tumescent mastectomy technique.

### Estimated maximal safe dosages of tumescent lidocaine [^115MGbGZ]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

RESULTS

There were 41 TLA infiltration procedures. With 1 exception, all subjects had at least 2 tumescent infiltration procedures without subsequent liposuction and then 1 infiltration followed by liposuction. A single subject participated in only 1 TLA infiltration procedure without liposuction. All but 1 subject received the same milligram per kilogram dose of lidocaine at least once without liposuction and once with liposuction. The lidocaine concentration-time profile for each of the 14 subjects is shown in Figure 1. No subject experienced a peak serum lidocaine concentration larger than 4.4 μg/mL. Tables 1 and 2 present lidocaine dosage data, without and with liposuction, respectively.

Subject number and anatomic area of infiltration are presented on the top of each plot. The figure legend presents whether or not liposuction was done after tumescent infiltration indicated by "No Lipo" and "Lipo", respectively, and the tumescent lidocaine dosage (mg/kg).

Without liposuction, the range of lidocaine content in bags of tumescent solution was 700 to 1000 mg/bag. With liposuction, the range of lidocaine content was 770 to 1000 mg/bag. The ranges of milligram per kilogram dosages of lidocaine were 19.2 to 45.0 mg/kg without liposuction and 19.4 to 52 mg/kg with liposuction. Ten subjects received 45 mg/kg without liposuction and at least 45 mg/kg with liposuction. The total milligram dose of tumescent lidocaine ranged from 1800mg to 3600mg. During this research, the volume of infiltrated TLA solution ranged from 2 to 4 L. Subjects received no IV fluids, no systemic sedatives, and no narcotic analgesics.

### Lidocaine-induced ASC apoptosis (tumescent vs. local anesthesia) [^111jmvYH]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose for the present study was to determine which anesthetic method, local anesthesia versus tumescent, is superior for liposuction in terms of adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) survival in lipoaspirate; which component, lidocaine versus lidocaine with epinephrine, in anesthetic solutions could affect ASC survival; and which mechanism, necrosis versus apoptosis, is involved in lidocaine-induced ASC death.

Methods

Human lipoaspirates were harvested using standard liposuction technique. Individuals scheduled for liposuction on bilateral body areas gave consent and were included in the study. On one area, liposuction was conducted under local anesthesia with lidocaine/epinephrine. On the contralateral area, liposuction was accomplished with tumescent wetting solution containing lidocaine/epinephrine. Lipoaspirates were processed for the isolation of stromal vascular fraction (SVF). ASC survival was determined by the number of adherent ASCs after 24 h of SVF culture. Lidocaine dose-response (with or without epinephrine) on cultured ASCs was examined. Lidocaine-induced ASC apoptosis and necrosis was determined by Annexin V-FITC/Propidium Iodide (PI) assay and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Results

All of the participants were female adults. The average age was 45 ± 4.0 years (± SEM) and the average BMI was 28 ± 1.0 (± SEM). Lipoaspirate samples (n = 14) treated by local anesthesia (n = 7/group) or tumescent anesthesia (n = 7/group) were investigated. Liposuction sites were located in the hip or thigh. The average number of adherent ASCs was 1,057 ± 146 k in the local anesthesia group, which was significantly lower than the 1,571 ± 111 k found in the tumescent group (P = 0.01). ASC survival was significantly lower in the lidocaine group and in a dose-dependent manner as compared to the correspondent PBS controls (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). ASC survival was significantly lower in both the lidocaine and lidocaine with epinephrine groups when compared to PBS controls. Annexin/PI assay showed that ASC apoptosis (but not necrosis) in the lidocaine group was significantly higher than that in the corresponding PBS control (P = 0.026).

Conclusions

Tumescent anesthesia is the superior method for liposuction with respect to ASC preservation compared to local anesthesia. Lidocaine could cause significant ASC apoptosis.

### Improved adipocyte viability in autologous fat grafting with ascorbic acid-supplemented tumescent solution [^112G1hP3]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In reconstructive surgery, fat volume augmentation is often necessary for esthetic or functional reasons. As an alternative to synthetic and xenogeneic materials, autologous fat grafting (AFG) based on liposuction is gaining popularity, yet successful transplantation and long-term volume maintenance are difficult. Standard tumescent solution formulations neglect adipocyte and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cell survival during extraction, as well as SVF differentiation into adipocytes thereafter, all of which are crucial for the success of AFG. Here we hypothesized that addition of ascorbic acid (AA) to the tumescent solution could prevent liposuction-induced cell damage.

Materials and Methods

The effect of 0.1 mmol/L AA in tumescent solution was investigated in a previously described ex vivo model of AFG. Briefly, excision fat was infiltrated with tumescent solution, with or without AA, and incubated for 20 minutes at 37°C. Hand-assisted liposuction was then performed with a blunt cannula. Total cell viability, clonogenicity, and differentiation capacity of the SVF cells were assessed.

Results

With AA, 10.3% more cells and in particular 14.9% more adipocytes survived liposuction. Clonogenicity, adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation by SVF cells remained unchanged.

Conclusions

Addition of AA successfully improved survival of adipocytes during liposuction without affecting SVF growth and differentiation. This study therefore identified a useful supplement to the tumescent solution which may lead to improving AFG success.

### Simultaneous separation and tumescence: a new paradigm for liposuction donor site preparation [^112oLMDV]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

An ever-increasing demand for liposuction and fat transplantation procedures in the United States reflects their continued safety and clinical effectiveness. Technical breakthroughs, such as the utilization of tumescent infiltration and fat separation techniques, have been instrumental in optimizing outcomes but add time to the surgical procedure. Simultaneous separation and tumescence (SST) is a new technique combining these innovations to further improve safety and efficiency in liposuction.

Objectives

The authors describe their technique for utilizing SST on more than 1200 patients spanning a 6-year period. A split abdomen study was designed to compare the vasoconstrictive effectiveness of SST with traditional Klein infiltration techniques.

Methods

A quantification perfusion analysis utilizing indocyanine green angiography was performed on 4 patients to illustrate the vasoconstrictive effectiveness of SST over traditional Klein infiltration techniques. A mean relative vasoconstriction score was calculated relative to the umbilicus for each technique.

Results

Compared with traditional Klein tumescence techniques, SST has a similar complication rate, utilizes similar infiltrative volumes, and increases vasoconstriction (mean 89.6% SST hemiabdomen vs 48.1% Klein hemiabdomen at 2 minutes, P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

SST represents a novel, long-overdue departure from Klein tumescence, which has been a valuable mainstay for donor site preparation for over 3 decades. SST will pave the way for more efficient operative times and potentially higher volumes of fat being safely extracted.

### The current state of fat grafting: a review of harvesting, processing, and injection techniques [^112d5CjL]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Interest in and acceptance of autologous fat grafting for use in contour abnormalities, breast reconstruction, and cosmetic procedures have increased. However, there are many procedural variations that alter the effectiveness of the procedure and may account for the unpredictable resorption rates observed.

Methods

The authors highlighted studies investigating the effects of harvesting procedures, processing techniques, and reinjection methods on the survival of fat grafts. This review focused on the impact different techniques have on outcomes observed in the following: in vitro analyses, in vivo animal experiments, and human studies.

Results

This systemic review revealed the current state of the literature. There was no significant difference in the outcomes of grafted fat obtained from different donor sites, different donor-site preparations, harvest technique, fat harvesting cannula size, or centrifugation speed, when tumescent solution was used. Gauze rolling was found to enhance the volume of grafted fat, and no significant difference in retention was observed following centrifugation, filtration, or sedimentation in animal experiments. In contrast, clinical studies in patients found more favorable outcomes with fat processed by centrifugation compared with sedimentation. In addition, higher retention was observed with slower reinjection speed and when introduced into less mobile areas.

Conclusions

There has been a substantial increase in research interest to identify methodologies for optimizing fat graft survival. Despite some differences in harvest and implantation technique in the laboratory, these findings have not translated into a universal protocol for fat grafting. Therefore, additional human studies are necessary to aid in the development of a universal protocol for clinical practice.

### Syringe-delivered tumescent anesthesia made easier [^113Kz2u2]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

A simple method for the infiltration of tumescent anesthesia is presented. An assembly is made using an infusion set, a three-way tap, and two unidirectional valves. The assembly and use of this system are straightforward and easy. The addition of unidirectional valves prevents the risk of reverse injection or aspiration of fluid from the patient.

### Syringe-delivered tumescent anesthesia made easier [^114Mufca]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Tumescent infiltration achieves effective local anesthesia and a bloodless operative field. Its use is standard practice in liposuction but has also been applied to other procedures, including cosmetic, reconstructive, and burn surgery. The basic principle common to all techniques is the delivery of a large amount of fluid with a local anesthetic and a vasoconstrictor. This results in swelling, i.e. tumescence, of the operative field.

Many techniques for the infiltration of the fluid have been described ranging from repeated aspiration of fluid into a large syringe followed by its injection into the patient, to the use of motorized irrigation pumps. There are also automatic manual pumps available. However, these specialized systems are not always available.

The use of a stopcock three-way tap has been described in the past. The disadvantage of this tap is that it requires two concurrent actions: pumping action using the plunger of the syringe and coordinated turning of the stopcock tap in order to either aspirate fluid from the infusion bag or inject it into the patient. The fluid can be injected in the wrong direction back into the IV bag or it can be aspirated out of the patient.

### Cold vs warm tumescent solution in arm liposculpture: a double-blind randomized clinical study [^117FS8Ef]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Use of cold tumescent solutions in liposuction is hypothesized to enhance vasoconstriction, potentially reducing bleeding and improving clinical outcomes. However, evidence for its efficacy in arm liposculpture remains inconclusive.

Purpose

To compare the effects of cold (4°C) and warm (37°C) tumescent solutions on postoperative outcomes in arm liposculpture, focusing on pain, bruising, and fat emulsification quality.

Methods

This double-blinded, randomized clinical trial enrolled patients undergoing bilateral arm liposculpture. One arm was infiltrated with a cold tumescent solution and the other with a warm solution, randomly assigned. Liposuction was performed using VASER-assisted fat emulsification followed by Power-Assisted Liposuction (PAL) or conventional suction-assisted liposuction (SAL). Outcomes included pain (Visual Analog Scale) assessed at Days 1, 8, 15, and 30; bruising, and lipocrit values.

Results

A total of 104 arms were analyzed from 52 female participants (mean age: 39.7 years; mean BMI: 24.7 kg/m²). Pain scores were similar between groups at all time points (Day 1: Cold = 5 [2–9], Warm = 6 [2–9]; p = 0.9). Bruising areas were comparable (Cold: 40,444 mm²; Warm: 41,212 mm²; p > 0.05). Lipocrit values for Microaire and SAL techniques showed no significant differences (p > 0.05). Patients reported high satisfaction, with 78.7% "very satisfied" and 96.1% recommending the procedure.

Conclusions

Cold tumescent solutions do not significantly enhance outcomes in arm liposculpture compared to warm solutions. Surgeons should exercise caution with cold solutions due to potential hypothermia risks. Further research is warranted to assess the potential long-term effects of cold tumescent infiltration.

### Estimated maximal safe dosages of tumescent lidocaine [^112BPUXW]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

In some individual subjects, the lidocaine concentration (mg/L) in the TLA solutions and the lidocaine dosage (mg/kg) varied between procedures to achieve a targeted milligram per kilogram dosage of lidocaine and to have sufficient volume of TLA solution to accomplish liposuction of the area.

The choices of the milligram per kilogram dosages used in the present research were motivated by clinical experience with tumescent liposuction totally by local anesthesia. Worldwide experience with tumescent liposuction has shown that 45 mg/kg with liposuction is quite safe. Without liposuction, the range of safe dosages is not known.

The Cmax following 35 mg/kg without liposuction in the first 2 subjects was well below the toxic threshold of 6 μg/mL. These results provided pharmacokinetic assurance that 45 mg/kg without liposuction would not represent a significant risk of harm to the subjects.

To achieve an adequate range of input data for linear regression analysis, some of the subjects who received 45 mg/kg without liposuction also received 22.5 mg/kg (half of 45 mg/kg) in the second study without liposuction.

Surgical Procedures

Videos 1, 2, and 3 demonstrate MAFT and may be viewed at. Preoperative markings were made with the patient seated. The recipient area for fat transfer was drawn in the shape of an I (width, 6–8 mm) from the nasal tip to a point approximately 15 mm above the intercanthal line (Figure 2) with a fan-shaped cephalic end. This pattern was divided into upper, middle, and lower zones (Figure 2). The total volume of fat to be injected was deposited as needed into these 3 zones.

The recipient area is drawn as a 6- to 8-mm-wide I shape extending from the nasal tip to 15 mm above the intercanthal line. This marking is evenly divided into 3 zones: the upper third (green), the middle third (blue), and the lower third (orange). The point of insertion is indicated with an x. (A) Frontal view. (B) Oblique view.

All patients received total intravenous anesthesia before fat grafting. Appropriate local anesthesia was applied as needed at donor and recipient sites. Fat primarily was harvested from the lower abdomen. The donor site was infiltrated with a tumescent solution (10 mL of 2% lidocaine [20 mg/mL]:30 mL of Ringer's lactate solution:0.2 mL of epinephrine [1:1000]). Approximately 10–15 minutes after infiltration, fat was harvested from the donor site with a blunt-tip cannula (diameter, 2.5 or 3.0 mm; ≥ 1 holes sized 1 mm × 2 mm). The lipoaspirate volume was approximately equal to the volume of the tumescent solution to ensure that fat constituted a major proportion of the lipoaspirate. To minimize damage to the lipoaspirate, the plunger of a 10-mL syringe connected to a liposuction cannula was withdrawn to approximately 2–3 mL to maintain a negative pressure of 270–330 mm Hg.

### Estimated maximal safe dosages of tumescent lidocaine [^1143rQ1a]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Tolerance interval analysis was used to calculate the proportion of individuals who, when given a specified milligram per kilogram dosage of tumescent lidocaine, will have a Cmax exceeding 6 μg/mL. The results confirmed our hypothesis that dosages larger than 7 mg/kg are associated with a risk of < 1/1000 for mild lidocaine toxicity. In particular, without liposuction, a dosage of 45 mg/kg has an estimated risk of mild toxicity of 1/80 and at 28 mg/kg the estimated risk of mild toxicity was several orders of magnitude < 1/2000. With liposuction, a dosage of 45 mg/kg has an estimated risk of mild toxicity of 1/2000. Thus, the risk of mild toxicity at 28 mg/kg without liposuction and 45 mg/kg with liposuction is each < 1/1000 and can be said to represent a nonsignificant risk of harm to patients. For nonliposuction surgeries, 28 mg/kg tumescent lidocaine is a prudent choice while allowing at least 2 L tumescent solution in a 70-kg adult.

Adverse Events with Tumescent Anesthesia

All reported adverse events associated with TLA have been the result of clinician error, such as inadvertent IV delivery of tumescent solution, miscommunication leading to excessive lidocaine in the tumescent lidocaine solution, unawareness of drug interactions that reduce lidocaine metabolism by impairing cytochrome P450 1A2 and 3A4, and ad libitum formulations of tumescent solutions using bupivacaine, mepivacaine, or triamcinolone(Fig. 5).

Figure 5.
"Safety Label" applied to a bag tumescent lidocaine solution. The label overhangs the port for the IV tubing spike. A "Safety Label" is a visual reminder that the bag contains tumescent lidocaine for subcutaneous delivery and is not for IV delivery.

In 1999, an influential report of 4 liposuction fatalities concluded that, "Tumescent liposuction can be fatal; perhaps in part because of lidocaine toxicity or lidocaine-related drug interactions". All 4 patients received general anesthesia or heavy IV sedation. The tumescent lidocaine dosages were 10, 14.3, 31.4, and 40 mg/kg. Our data suggest that it was unlikely that tumescent lidocaine caused toxicity in these cases.

### Advancing reduction mammaplasty surgery: advancements and outcomes with tumescent local anaesthesia [^116g7YUX]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Tumescent local anaesthesia (TLA) is a method of anaesthesia used for surgical procedures that involves the infusion of a saline solution containing lidocaine, sodium bicarbonate, and epinephrine. This anaesthetic technique is designed to achieve both vasoconstriction and anaesthesia. In this article, we present a modified TLA protocol specifically adapted for reduction mammaplasty, based on an analysis of clinical case histories collected over the past few years.

Methods

During the period from 2012 to 2022, we performed a reduction mammaplasty procedure in 120 patients employing tumescent local anaesthesia (TLA). The composition of the tumescent solution included 25 mL of 2% lidocaine, 8 mEq of sodium bicarbonate, and 1 mL of epinephrine (1 mg/1 mL) in 1000 mL of 0.9% saline solution. The solution was injected diffusely throughout the mammary gland.

Results

The average volume of tumescent solution infiltrated during TLA was 350 mL per breast. There were no cases of adrenaline or lidocaine toxicity, and no patients required conversion to general anaesthesia. No patient received sedation. Patients reported no pain or discomfort during pre-operative infiltration or during surgery.

No reinterventions were necessary because of short-term complications. Among the complications, there were 4 cases of hematoma (3,3%), 3 cases of seroma (2,55%), 10 cases of wound dehiscence (8,3%), 5 cases of asymmetry (4,1%), 9 cases of T-junction breakdown (7,5%), 2 cases of (partial) nipple necrosis (1,6%), and 3 cases of liponecrosis (2,5%).

No cases of infection or total nipple-areola loss were reported. The follow-up period was between 30 days and 1 year.

Conclusions

Reduction mammaplasty is a viable surgical option for women with macromastia seeking to enhance their physiognomy. It is imperative that patients fully understand the potential benefits and risks associated with the procedure and consult with healthcare professionals specialising in this field.

The use of tumescent local anaesthesia (TLA) has been confirmed as a safe and effective methodology to perform reduction mammaplasty, ensuring adequate pain control with minimal post-operative complications and resulting in a high degree of patient satisfaction.

### The practical procedure of tumescent technique in burn surgery for excision of burn eschar [^114bU4Pf]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2008). Low credibility.

The tumescent technique, which involves injection of large volumes of dilute epinephrine solution into subcutaneous fat, has been shown to markedly increase the safety of liposuction surgery, which is associated with risks of blood loss. The authors use this technique during burn surgery and developed a practical method of determining the amount of solution injected. The authors have applied the tumescent technique consisting of subeschar infiltration of dilute epinephrine (1 mg/L) in thermoneutral (37 degrees C) saline. Preoperatively, a 5 x 5 cm square grid pattern is drawn on the burn wound, which facilitates estimation of the amount of infiltrated solution. The authors injected 20 mL of solution per square in the grid. Ten consecutive patients underwent 15 surgical procedures for tangential excision and split-thickness skin grafting. There were no complications during the intraoperative or postoperative period. Their method using a grid pattern drawn on the tissue being treated by the tumescent technique in burn surgery facilitates the excision of burn eschar.

### Sub-muscular breast augmentation using tumescent local anesthesia [^113yJVqv]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Tumescent local anesthesia (TLA) consists of infiltration of saline solution with lidocaine and epinephrine into the tissues to obtain regional anesthesia and vasoconstriction. The use of TLA in augmentation mammoplasty has been described for sub-glandular positioning. We describe a modified TLA technique for primary sub-muscular breast augmentation reporting our experience during the past 7 years.

Methods

From 2010 to 2017, 300 patients underwent bilateral primary sub-muscular breast augmentation under TLA and conscious sedation. The tumescent solution was prepared with 25 mL of 2% lidocaine, 8 mEq of sodium bicarbonate, and 1 mL of epinephrine (1 mg/1 mL) in 1000 mL of 0.9% saline solution. Firstly, the solution was infiltrated between the pectoral fascia and the mammary gland, secondarily, during surgery, under the pectoralis major muscle.

Results

The average amount of tumescent solution infiltrated while performing TLA was 740 mL per breast. No signs of adrenaline or lidocaine toxicity were reported and conversion to general anesthesia was never required. In all patients, no pain nor discomfort was reported during the pre-operating infiltration and surgical procedure. We reported a major complication rate of 3.3% (4 hematomas and 6 seromas) and a minor complication rate of 6.0% (8 implant dislocation and 10 dystrophic scars formation).

Conclusions

TLA represents a safe and efficacious technique for performing breast augmentation surgery with sub-muscular implant positioning. This technique guarantees good pain control during and after surgery and has low incidence of postoperative side effects. Patients subjected to sub-muscular breast augmentation with TLA were satisfied.

### Safety studies in the field of liposuction: a systematic review [^114Ef3zo]. Dermatologic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There is an increasing demand for safety standards for cosmetic treatments. With regard to liposuction, interdisciplinary consensus is lacking, especially regarding treatment setting and physician specialty.

Objective

A solid, independent interpretation of scientific data on safety requires a systematic approach, which is the aim of this study.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted for safety studies about liposuction through April 2017. Fatalities and/or reported serious adverse events served as outcome measures for safety.

Results

Twenty-four studies were included. Factors that contributed to increased serious complication and mortality risk were: use of the (super)wet technique; use of systemic anesthetics, especially general anesthesia and intravenous sedation; execution by a plastic surgeon; execution in an operating room; and combination with other procedures.

Conclusion

Liposuction using tumescent local anesthesia has been shown to be the safest method of fat removal, especially if no or only minimal systemic anesthesia is used. Performance of this technique in an office-based setting has been proven to be safe beyond doubt. When systemic anesthesia is used, an outpatient or ambulatory surgery facility seems also safe. Regardless of the physician specialty, knowledge and training on the execution of the tumescent procedure are vital to ensure optimal safety.

### Prilocaine plasma levels and methemoglobinemia in patients undergoing tumescent liposuction involving less than 2, 000 mL [^114VecXK]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

As a reaction to reported adverse outcomes after lidocaine infiltration in tumescent liposuction, prilocaine has gained increasing popularity. Previous studies investigating large-volume liposuction procedures found maximum prilocaine levels and methemoglobinemia up to 12 h postoperatively, suggesting that liposuction should be performed as a hospital procedure only. The aim of this study was to determine prilocaine plasma levels and methemoglobinemia in patients after low- to average-volume liposuction for the purpose of defining the required postoperative surveillance period.

Methods

In 25 patients undergoing liposuction involving less than 2,000 mL prilocaine levels and methemoglobinemia were measured over 4 h postoperatively. Liposuction was conducted after the tumescent technique using a 0.05% hypotonic prilocaine solution with epinephrine.

Results

The average prilocaine dose was 6.8 + 0.8 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 15 mg/kg. The peak prilocaine plasma level of 0.34 mug/ml occurred 3 h after the infiltration. The mean methemoglobinemia at this time point was 0.65%. Only one patient demonstrated a slightly elevated methemoglobin level of 1.4%, but lacked any clinical signs of methemoglobinemia. The prilocaine recovery in the aspirate averaged 36 ± 4%, indicating that a large amount is removed by suctioning.

Conclusions

The patients did not experience high plasma levels of prilocaine or methemoglobinemia undergoing liposuction involving less than 2,000 mL using a 0.05% hypotonic prilocaine solution. The authors therefore conclude that this procedure can be performed safely with a monitoring period of 12 h.

### Lifestyle outcomes of tumescent liposuction surgery [^113QDegi]. Dermatologic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the lifestyle benefits of liposuction surgery using tumescent local anesthesia and to attempt to establish any significant factors affecting these lifestyle outcomes.

Methods

Standardized questionnaires were sent to 332 patients who had liposuction performed at the clinic in 1999 and 2000 for purely cosmetic indications. Questions were designed to evaluate specific lifestyle benefits generally attributed to liposuction surgery by intending patients and the general public.

Results

Of the 332 patients, 123 (37%) completed and returned the survey; 87.8% of respondents were female. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.16. A large proportion of patients experienced positive lifestyle outcomes from the procedure: 80.5% were more confident, 74.8% noted an increase in self-esteem, and 87% were more comfortable in clothes. The time since surgery did not influence results.

Conclusion

Liposuction using the tumescent technique is associated with a wide range of beneficial lifestyle outcomes for the majority of patients.

### Optimizing gynecomastia correction surgery: efficacy and safety of tumescent local anesthesia approach [^112LQ3Zg]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Tumescent local anesthesia (TLA) involves infusing a saline solution containing lidocaine and epinephrine into tissues to achieve localized anesthesia and vasoconstriction. While liposuction under general anesthesia remains the most used treatment, we introduce a novel TLA approach for gynecomastia surgery, drawing from our extensive experience in recent years.

Methods

Between the years 2010 and 2023, we performed gynecomastia surgery on 60 male patients under TLA. The gynecomastia was treated by liposuction plus periareolar excision technique. Liposuction was carried out on both breasts in every case, regardless of whether the gynecomastia was bilateral or unilateral. The tumescent solution consisted of 25 mL of 2% lidocaine, 8 mEq of sodium bicarbonate, and 1 mL of epinephrine (1 mg/1 mL) in 1000 mL of 0.9% saline solution. The solution was infiltrated between the pectoral fascia and the mammary gland, and then the surgery was carried out.

Results

The average volume of tumescent solution infiltrated during TLA was 300 mL per breast. There were no reports of adrenaline or lidocaine toxicity, and no cases required a conversion to general anesthesia. Patients experienced no pain or discomfort during the preoperative infiltration or surgical procedure. We observed a major postoperative complications rate of 6.7%, represented by three incident of hematoma and one case of seroma. A minor complication rate of 5% was observed: two cases of retraction of the NAC and one case of gynecomastia recurrence, the latter undergoing an additional combination procedure with liposuction and subcutaneous mastectomy. Follow-up time ranged from 30 days to 1 year.

Conclusions

We developed a new outpatient surgical method for gynecomastia using liposuction and periareolar excision under tumescent local anesthesia. This technique, supported by a comprehensive rehabilitation plan, proved a successful and quick recovery, and high patient satisfaction. Our results suggest it is a feasible and effective option, warranting further consideration in gynecomastia treatment strategies.

### Fat grafting and adipose stem cells for facial systemic sclerosis: a systematic review of the literature [^114vjNkZ]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Surgical Technique

The most frequent donor site was the abdominal area (9 studies), followed by the trochanteric area (4 studies), thighs (3 studies), flanks (2 studies), inner knee (1 study), and buttock (1 study) (Supplemental Table 5). In most studies (n = 6), fat was harvested from multiple body areas, rather than just 1 site (n = 5), whereas in 1 study the donor site was not reported.

Donor-site tumescent infiltration was performed in 5 studies and the anesthetics used were: 150 mL of Klein solution (1 study); modified Klein solution with 50 mL saline, 0.5 mL 1:1000 adrenalin, and 10 mL 2% mepivacaine (1 study); modified Klein solution with 100 mL of saline, 20 mL of mepivacaine 2%, 20 mL of ropivacaine 7.5, 1 mL of epinephrine, and 5 mL of sodium bicarbonate solution 1 mEq/mL (1 study); 500 mL of tumescent solution with normal saline, 25 mL lidocaine 2%, and 0.5 mL epinephrine 1:1000 (1 study); 1 liter of sodium chloride 0.9%, 20 mL of lidocaine 2%, and 1 mL of epinephrine 1:200,000 (1 study); 0.5% lidocaine, adrenaline (1:100.000), and 0.8% bicarbonate (1 study). One study adopted the dry technique with no infiltration performed, and 6 studies did not disclose whether donor-site infiltration was performed.

The lipoaspirate was harvested with a blunt 3-mm cannula (4 studies) connected to 10-mL (3 studies) or 60-mL (1 study) syringes; with a 14-gauge cannula connected to a 10-mL syringe (2 studies); and a 10-gauge cannula connected to a 10-mL syringe (1 study); 5 studies did not specify the diameter of the harvesting cannula.

The lipoaspirate was processed by: centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 minutes (4 studies), 2700 rpm for 5 minutes (1 study), 2547 rpm for 3 minutes (1 study), decanted by gravity for 10 minutes (2 studies), or 15 minutes (1 study), and washed in a closed 50 mL device (2 studies). One study did not report on the processing method.

### Application of a proposed multi-positional circumferential arm liposuction method and quantification of its clinical efficacy evaluation [^115JBS2Z]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Multi-Positional Circumferential Arm Liposuction

The operation was performed in supine position. After sedation anaesthesia, tumescent solution, consisting of normal saline (1000 ml), 2% lidocaine (20 ml) and 0.1% epinephrine (1 ml), was circumferentially infiltrated into the subcutaneous layer of arm via incisions until wet tumescent. The ratio of infiltrate to fat aspirate was approximately 1–2:1. The maximum total injected lidocaine concentration was 35 mg/kg.

We divided the upper arm and forearm into four regions, namely, anterior, posterior, external and internal regions. During surgery, each arm was placed in the following four different positions as shown in Figure 1 b and Figure S1: 90° of abduction, naturally positioned at the side of the body, the 180° lifting position and 45° of adduction. Suction-assisted liposuction (negative pressure approximately700 mmHg) was performed with 3 to 3.5 mm blunt-tip cannulas. The cannula moved through the incisions towards three selected regions of the upper arm in different positions, progressing from the deep layer to the superficial layer of fat tissue to perform fan-shaped cross-tunnelling aspiration. The cannula was manipulated in a back-and-forth motion, which was repeated four to five times. Meanwhile, the contour of the upper arm was checked when muscle groups of the upper arm were contracting and relaxing via the flexion and extension of the elbow joint. The end point of aspiration was determined by observing, touching and grasping the skin of the treated areas. We recommend completely retaining 1-cm-thick tissue under the skin to prevent skin necrosis and significant irregularities. The most common error in the application of the method is injury to the anteromedial vein of the arm due to rough operation.

Postoperative Cares and Follow-up

Patients were encouraged to move their arms within 24 h after operation for draining of the tumescent solution. After 1 month postoperatively, patients were allowed to return physical activities as normal. All patients were prescribed to wear compression garments after operation for at least 3 months. The outcomes were assessed during a follow-up visit two to three months postoperatively. Photographs and measurements were taken of all patients for the preoperative and postoperative assessments.

### Optimizing gynecomastia correction surgery: efficacy and safety of tumescent local anesthesia approach [^112ZvbxF]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gynecomastia, characterized by the benign enlargement of male breast tissue, poses both physical and psychological challenges for affected individuals. While the etiology of gynecomastia varies, ranging from hormonal imbalances to medication side effects, its impact on self-esteem and quality of life can be profound. Surgical correction remains a definitive treatment option, offering patients the opportunity to restore a masculine chest contour and alleviate associated. Depending on morphology and volume, Simon in the year 1973 classified it into four different groups. Group I encompass patients with minor breast enlargement without skin redundancy, group IIa includes patients with moderate breast enlargement without skin redundancy, while group IIb patients with moderate breast enlargement with minor skin redundancy. Finally, group III comprises gross breast enlargement with skin redundancy mimicking female breast ptosis. Simon's classification serves as an essential framework for the clinical assessment and management of gynecomastia. It emphasizes the importance of evaluating the relative proportions of adipose tissue, glandular parenchyma, and skin redundancy, which are critical for patient selection and the formulation of precise surgical strategies. Among the various surgical techniques available, the utilization of tumescent local anesthesia has gained prominence for its potential to enhance patient safety, minimize intraoperative bleeding, and expedite postoperative recovery. Tumescent anesthesia involves the infiltration of large volumes of dilute local anesthetic solution, typically containing lidocaine and epinephrine, into the subcutaneous tissue. This technique not only provides effective pain control but also serves as a reliable method for hydrodissection, facilitating precise dissection and minimizing surgical trauma. Despite the growing adoption of tumescent local anesthesia in gynecomastia correction procedures, comprehensive scientific investigations regarding its efficacy, safety profile, and perioperative outcomes remain limited. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the outcomes of gynecomastia correction surgery performed under tumescent local anesthesia, with a focus on both short-term and long-term results. By elucidating the advantages and potential limitations of this anesthesia technique in gynecomastia surgery, this research seeks to contribute to the refinement of surgical practices, ultimately optimizing patient care and satisfaction. Through meticulous examination of surgical outcomes and patient-reported experiences, this study endeavors to provide valuable insights that can inform clinical decision-making and enhance the overall management of gynecomastia.

### Liposuction considerations in men [^114SwFf8]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Liposuction is the most popular cosmetic surgical procedure performed in men. Aside from traditional liposuction using the tumescent technique, several energy-assisted liposuction technologies have emerged and been proven safe and particularly beneficial for the male patient demographic. The differences in fat distribution and unique goals and emotional perspective in men need to be taken into account when performing liposuction, to ensure meeting the patient's needs and expectations for satisfactory results.

### Water-assisted liposuction for body contouring and lipoharvesting: safety and efficacy in 41 consecutive patients [^114J7CQT]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Water-assisted liposuction (WAL) is a new technique for body contouring and fat harvesting that relies on a fan-shaped jet of tumescent solution to anesthetize fatty for liposuction and grafting. As with any new technology, safety and efficacy are paramount.

Objective

The author evaluates the technique and outcomes for small-to-moderate volume liposuction cases treated with WAL in an office setting.

Methods

Forty-one consecutive patients were treated with WAL (Body-Jet; Human Med, Eclipse Ltd, Dallas, Texas) in the author's private practice for mild-to-moderate body contouring. Patients were given local anesthesia (standardized tumescent solutions) during all three phases of the surgery. During the latter two phases, irrigation of tumescent solution was accompanied simultaneously by suction aspiration. Fat harvesting was accomplished by collecting and separating the aspirated adipose tissue in a sterile container, without need for washing or centrifugation. Fat grafting by microdroplet technique was performed within two hours of collection. Fat aliquots from five randomly-selected patients were assessed with a trypan blue dye exclusion test within one hour and again six to eight hours after collection.

Results

A total of 37 females and four males underwent WAL in this series; average body mass index (BMI) was 25.5. Among the 41 patients, 166 areas involving twelve anatomic sites were treated. Patients were divided into two groups based on the volume of treatment: Group 1 contained 19 patients with small-volume WAL and Group 2 had 22 cases of moderate-volume WAL. All patients experienced uneventful recovery periods with minimal side effects and no significant complications. Although large volumes of tumescent solution were required during the three phases of the technique, the total volume of infiltration almost equaled the final volume of aspiration. The average infiltration-to-aspiration ratio was 1.1 to 1.0 in all cases over both groups. On the other hand, the average infiltration-to-fat ratio was 2.8 to 1.0 in Group l and 2.4 to 1.0 in Group 2. Lidocaine dosage averaged 10.5mg/kg in Group 1 and 20.0mg/kg in Group 2. Patients were monitored for at least 24 hours without adverse signs or symptoms that required fluid resuscitation, blood transfusions, or interventional treatments for lidocaine side effects or toxicity. Twenty-three patients elected to save their fat for autologous fat grafting in nine anatomical sites with thirty-nine procedures. The augmented sites were clinically assessed between three and eight months postoperatively. Trypan blue dye exclusion testing indicated that about 90% of adipocytes expelled the dye after one hour of extraction, while an estimated 10% of cells per patient were observed to be free of dye six to eight hours after removal.

Conclusions

The amount of instilled tumescent fluid, lidocaine dosage, and aspiration volumes appeared to be safe, with minimal blood loss in small and moderate volume liposuction cases. The early experience with fat grafting was encouraging, but requires more sophisticated evaluation, longer follow-up, and a larger number of cases.

### Immediate oncoplastic breast reconstruction with fat grafting: preliminary radiological, aesthetic, and patient satisfaction outcomes [^111TdktC]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Technique

Our surgical technique for IOBR with lipofilling begins with preoperative marking, while the patient is in a standing position. Key landmarks such as the midline, inframammary folds, bilateral breast footprint, the planned location of the breast defect, and the donor sites for fat harvesting are marked. The breast incision site is also carefully chosen collaboratively with the breast surgeon to provide optimal access to the tumor with minimal visible scarring.

A tumescent solution is prepared combining 400mg of lidocaine with 2mg of adrenaline in 1 liter of Hartmann solution. This solution is injected into the donor sites to minimize bleeding and facilitate fat harvesting (Video 1). The size of the breast defect and tissue deficit post-lumpectomy is determined and recorded. Hemostasis is achieved to control bleeding from the surgical site using cautery and ligation, as necessary.

Based on the size and location of the breast defect, local tissue flaps are dissected and transferred to close the defect. These flaps can be advanced or rotated as needed to ensure complete coverage of the defect and avoid dead space (Video 2). Vicryl 2–0 sutures are used to secure the flaps in place.

Fifteen minutes following the tumescence injection, manual liposuction is performed at the donor sites, using a Luer-lock syringe (10cc) and a Coleman aspiration cannula (2mm). Approximately 120% of the lumpectomy specimen weight is aspirated in volume. The syringes with the extracted fat are placed vertically to facilitate the layer separation and division of the lipoaspirate. The oil and aqueous layers are then discarded. The prepared fat is transferred to 5cc syringes via a 3-way stopcock with 2 female Luer locks and tubing port.

The processed fat is subsequently grafted using an infiltration technique to fill the tissue around the donor sites of the local tissue flaps and correct secondary contour defects (Video 3). Fat grafting is performed in three dimensions, focusing on the deep plane adjacent to the pectoralis muscle, the breast parenchyma, and subcutaneous tissue. Most of the fat is grafted while the skin incision is still open though all other tissues are in place. A small amount is reserved for finesse grafting after the skin is closed.

### Exposure to tumescent solution significantly increases phosphorylation of perilipin in adipocytes [^113fv7Ja]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Lidocaine and epinephrine could potentially decrease adipocyte viability, but these effects have not been substantiated. The phosphorylation status of perilipin in adipocytes may be predictive of cell viability. Perilipin coats lipid droplets and restricts access of lipases; phospho-perilipin lacks this protective function.

Objectives

The authors investigated the effects of tumescent solution containing lidocaine and epinephrine on the phosphorylation status of perilipin in adipocytes.

Methods

In this in vitro study, lipoaspirates were collected before and after tumescence from 15 women who underwent abdominoplasty. Fat samples were fixed, sectioned, and stained for histologic and immunohistochemical analyses. Relative phosphorylation of perilipin was inferred from pixel intensities of immunostained adipocytes observed with confocal microscopy.

Results

For adipocytes collected before tumescent infiltration, 10.08% of total perilipin was phosphorylated. In contrast, 30.62% of total perilipin was phosphorylated for adipocytes collected from tumescent tissue (P < .01).

Conclusions

The tumescent technique increases the relative phosphorylation of perilipin in adipocytes, making these cells more vulnerable to lipolysis. Tumescent solution applied for analgesia or hemostasis of the donor site should contain the lowest possible concentrations of lidocaine and epinephrine. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 5.

### Estimated maximal safe dosages of tumescent lidocaine [^117B2YnC]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

The principal aim of our research was to measure serum lidocaine concentrations as a function of milligram per kilogram dosage of tumescent lidocaine. Our main hypothesis was that dosages of tumescent lidocaine that are considerably larger than 7 mg/kg are a nonsignificant risk of harm to patients.

The research had 4 specific aims. The first specific aim was to measure sequential serum lidocaine concentrations over 24 hours for each subject after subcutaneous infiltration of TLA on 3 separate occasions where the initial infiltrations were followed by no liposuction and the last infiltration was followed by liposuction. It has been suggested that IV lidocaine may have beneficial perioperative effects. – We hypothesized that tumescent infiltration without liposuction produces a serum lidocaine concentration-time profile resembling a constant IV infusion lasting 12 to 16 hours or more. Furthermore, we hypothesized that liposuction removes significant amounts of lidocaine before it can be systemically absorbed. If the later hypothesis is true, then lidocaine data derived from liposuction patients cannot be used to establish the maximum recommended milligram per kilogram dosage of tumescent lidocaine for surgical procedures that do not involve liposuction.

The second aim was to record heart rate associated with doses of tumescent epinephrine and document adverse signs or symptoms associated with serum lidocaine concentrations. We hypothesized that tachycardia is uncommon and that adverse events associated with the large dosages of tumescent lidocaine and epinephrine are uncommon.

The third aim was to analyze the association between the milligram per kilogram dosage of tumescent lidocaine and subsequent peak serum lidocaine concentrations (Cmax) both without and with liposuction. We hypothesized that there is a linear relationship between the milligram per kilogram dosage of tumescent lidocaine and Cmax. Such a linear relationship would allow one to estimate Cmax as a function of milligram per kilogram dosage of tumescent lidocaine.

The fourth aim was to use tolerance interval analysis to calculate the proportion of individuals who, when given a specified milligram per kilogram dosage of tumescent lidocaine, will have a Cmax exceeding 6 μg/mL. We hypothesized that there are dosages larger than 7 mg/kg that are associated with a risk of mild lidocaine toxicity (Cmax ≥ 6 μg/mL) of < 1/1000 and therefore are a nonsignificant risk of harm to patients.

### The impact of N-acetylcysteine on autologous fat graft: first-in-human pilot study [^112zBqLL]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Autologous Fat Graft Acquisition and Administration

Each patient received a 2 g intravenous dose of cefazolinum thirty minutes before the surgery. All fat graft acquisition procedures were carried out by the same operator to avoid inter-operator variability. The operator was blinded to the assignment of tumescent solutions. Each participant of the study underwent suction-assisted tumescent liposuction of the anterior and inner thigh under general anesthesia. Two types of tumescent solutions were used: Klein solution (1 l of saline with 50 mL of 1% lidocaine, 1 mL of 1:1000 epinephrine) administered to one thigh (control grafts) and Klein solution enriched with NAC, administered to another thigh (NAC-treated grafts).

For enriching tumescent solution with NAC, we used 300 mg/3 mL acetylcysteine intravenous solution (Sandoz, Holzkirchen, Germany). Per each liter of the solution, 600 mg of NAC was added (0.06% NAC solution). This concentration allowed us not to exceed 1200 mg of NAC, which is considered a safe-to-use daily dosage recommended, for example, in contrast-induced nephropathy. Since there are no pharmacokinetic data available for subcutaneous administration of NAC, we were obligated by our institutional bioethics committee not to exceed this dosage in our pilot study. Results of yet an unpublished study (PhD thesis of the second author) conducted on a rat animal model indicate that subcutaneous and intradermal administration of NAC solution of a concentration of 0.03% and higher, lowers the oxidative stress injury significantly and enhances wound healing. This finding seems to correspond well to the conclusions of the other animal studies, showing that a similar NAC dosage reduces oxidative stress and inflammation as well as improves wound healing along with neovascularization and nerve regeneration. Those facts allowed us to presume that using a NAC solution of concentration 0.06% would allow reducing the oxidative stress significantly in female volunteers.

### High-quality lipoaspirate following 1470-nm radial emitting laser-assisted liposuction [^111Wj2or]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Donors

The study included 10 consecutive subjects (1 man and 9 women) with a mean age of 47.7 ± 12 years and body mass index (BMI) of 27.7 ± 4.4 kg/m². All subjects provided informed consent for bench processing of their fat aspirate in accordance with the Shamir Medical Center Institutional Review Board, Helsinki approval number 0095–17-ASF. The average volume obtained from the abdomen and thighs was 1844 mL. The maximum aspirated material was 3620 mL, and the minimum was 400 mL (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Subject Demographics and Procedural Data

Surgical Procedure

Liposuction with LipoLife (Alma Lasers, BeautiFill by LipoLife) involves the simultaneous action of laser and suction. The LipoLife system consists of a 1470-nm diode laser and LipoFlow system (Alma Lasers, Ltd.), which provides vacuum for liposuction and enables infiltration. The procedures were performed under general anesthesia. Before liposuction, the subjects were prepped with betadine. Tumescent solution (400 mg lidocaine and 1 mg adrenaline per liter saline) was introduced into the treated area using Lipoflow with a ratio of injected liquid (tumescent) to aspirated material of 2:1. For fat aspiration, a 4-mm cannula specially designed with a swivel handle (Alma Lasers, BeautiFill by LipoLife) was used. The 1470-nm, 600-micron, radial emitting laser fiber (Alma Lasers, Ltd.) was maneuvered and positioned at the center of the distal opening of the cannula. The harvested lipoaspirate was collected in a sterile canister and filtered through a canister mesh to separate the adipocytes from the tumescent fluid, blood, cell debris, and free oil.

Adipose Tissue Harvesting

Enzymatic or nonenzymatic manipulation processing began within 1 to 2 hours of harvesting. Lipoaspirate samples (100 mL) were washed extensively 3 times with sterile Dulbecco phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without calcium and magnesium (Biological Industries, Beit HaEmek, Israel) to dispose of tissue debris and blood residuals. Before the processing methods, small samples of lipoaspirate were taken for further RNA analysis (Fig. 1).

### Safe total corporal contouring with large-volume liposuction for the obese patient [^113WCxW9]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The advent of the tumescent technique in 1987 allowed for safe total corporal contouring as an ambulatory, single-session megaliposuction with the patient under regional anesthesia supplemented by local anesthetic only in selected areas. Safety and aesthetic issues define large-volume liposuction as having a 5,000-ml aspirate, mega-volume liposuction as having an 8,000-ml aspirate, and giganto-volume liposuction as having an aspirate of 12,000 mL or more. Clinically, a total volume comprising 5,000 mL of fat and wetting solution aspirated during the procedure qualifies for megaliposuction/large-volume liposuction. Between September 2000 and August 2005, 470 cases of liposuction were managed. In 296 (63%) of the 470 cases, the total volume of aspirate exceeded 5 l (range, 5,000–22,000 ml). Concurrent limited or total-block lipectomy was performed in 70 of 296 cases (23.6%). Regional anesthesia with conscious sedation was preferred, except where liposuction targeted areas above the subcostal region (the upper trunk, lateral chest, gynecomastia, breast, arms, and face), or when the patient so desired. Tumescent infiltration was achieved with hypotonic lactated Ringer's solution, adrenalin, triamcinalone, and hyalase in all cases during the last one year of the series. This approach has clinically shown less tissue edema in the postoperative period than with conventional physiologic saline used in place of the Ringer's lactate solution. The amount injected varied from 1,000 to 8,000 mL depending on the size, site, and area. Local anesthetic was included only for the terminal portion of the tumescent mixture, wherever the subcostal regions were infiltrated. The aspirate was restricted to the unstained white/yellow fat, and the amount of fat aspirated did not have any bearing on the amount of solution infiltrated. There were no major complications, and no blood transfusions were administered. The hospital stay ranged from 8 to 24 h for both liposuction and liposuction with a lipectomy. Serous discharge from access sites and serosanguinous fluid accumulation requiring drainage were necessitated in 32 of 296 cases (10.8%). Minor recontouring touch-ups were requested in 17 of 296 cases (5.7%). Early ambulation was encouraged for mobilization of third-space fluid shifts to expedite recovery and to prevent deep vein thrombosis. Follow-up evaluation ranged from 6 to 52 months, with 38 (12.8%) of 296 patients requesting further sessions for other new areas. Average weight reduction observed was 7 to 11.6 kg (approx. 4 to 10% of pre-operative body weight). Meticulous perioperative monitoring of systemic functions ensures safety in tumescent megaliposuction for the obese, and rewarding results are achieved in a single sitting.

### Estimated maximal safe dosages of tumescent lidocaine [^113jxEmt]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Tumescent lidocaine anesthesia consists of subcutaneous injection of relatively large volumes (up to 4 L or more) of dilute lidocaine (≤ 1 g/L) and epinephrine (≤ 1 mg/L). Although tumescent lidocaine anesthesia is used for an increasing variety of surgical procedures, the maximum safe dosage is unknown. Our primary aim in this study was to measure serum lidocaine concentrations after subcutaneous administration of tumescent lidocaine with and without liposuction. Our hypotheses were that even with large doses (i.e., > 30 mg/kg), serum lidocaine concentrations would be below levels associated with mild toxicity and that the concentration-time profile would be lower after liposuction than without liposuction.

Methods

Volunteers participated in 1 to 2 infiltration studies without liposuction and then one study with tumescent liposuction totally by local anesthesia. Serum lidocaine concentrations were measured at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 24 hours after each tumescent lidocaine infiltration. Area under the curve (AUC∞) of the serum lidocaine concentration-time profiles and peak serum lidocaine concentrations (Cmax) were determined with and without liposuction. For any given milligram per kilogram dosage, the probability that Cmax > 6 μg/mL, the threshold for mild lidocaine toxicity was estimated using tolerance interval analysis.

Results

In 41 tumescent infiltration procedures among 14 volunteer subjects, tumescent lidocaine dosages ranged from 19.2 to 52 mg/kg. Measured serum lidocaine concentrations were all < 6 μg/mL over the 24-hour study period. AUC∞s with liposuction were significantly less than those without liposuction (P = 0.001). The estimated risk of lidocaine toxicity without liposuction at a dose of 28 mg/kg and with liposuction at a dose of 45 mg/kg was ≤ 1 per 2000.

Conclusions

Preliminary estimates for maximum safe dosages of tumescent lidocaine are 28 mg/kg without liposuction and 45 mg/kg with liposuction. As a result of delayed systemic absorption, these dosages yield serum lidocaine concentrations below levels associated with mild toxicity and are a nonsignificant risk of harm to patients.

### Micro-autologous fat transplantation for treating a gummy smile [^113tnvVK]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Anesthesiology and MAFT Procedure

The patients were placed under total intravenous anesthesia during the MAFT procedure. The lipoaspirate was harvested mostly from the lower abdomen (or thigh) area after pre-infiltration with a tumescent solution. Appropriate local anesthesia was applied at the insertion sites for each patient (point X1–3 in Figure 1). In accordance with the "structural fat grafting" technique proposed by Coleman in 1998, the extracted lipoaspirate was processed and purified by standard centrifugation at 3000 rpm (approximately 1200 G) for 3 min. After centrifugation, the purified fat was transferred to a 1 mL syringe and then loaded into a MAFT-GUN (Dermato Plastica Beauty Co. Ltd. Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Figure 2). The volume of the fat parcel (each aliquot) injected by the trigger was set by adjusting the 6-grade dial to a setting of "120", which corresponds to 1/120 mL (0.0083 mL). The fat parcels were meticulously transplanted in three portions into the nasolabial groove, ergotrid area, and upper lip (Figure 1, marked in green, pink, and blue, respectively). The maneuver for transplanting the fat graft is visually demonstrated in Figure 1 and in Videos 1–2). The following sections outline how the procedure was performed.

### Advancing reduction mammaplasty surgery: advancements and outcomes with tumescent local anaesthesia [^116QpQ6D]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Over the course of a 10-year interval, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on a cohort comprising 120 individuals who had undergone reductive mammaplasty procedures, exclusively employing the tumescent local anaesthesia technique. A mean volume of 350 mL of tumescent solution was infiltrated, with a range between 250 and 500 mL, and no instances of adverse effects related to adrenaline or lidocaine toxicity were documented. General anaesthesia conversion was never necessitated during any of the procedures. The average time interval from solution infiltration to the initiation of skin incision was determined to be at least 20 min, a parameter determined through collaborative assessment by the surgical team and anaesthesiologist. Departing from this time threshold resulted in heightened patient discomfort, while exceeding it conferred no discernible benefits to the patient. During the surgical intervention, no reports of pain emerged during the skin incision or the removal of the mammary gland. The mean duration of surgery employing the TLA technique ranged from 60 min to 90 min, excluding bilateral infiltration and waiting periods. Within the scope of post-operative complications, comprising there were 4 cases of hematoma (3,3%), 3 cases of seroma (2,55%), 10 cases of wound dehiscence (8,3%), 5 cases of asymmetry (4,1%) 9 cases of T-junction breakdown (7,5%), 2 cases of (partial) nipple necrosis (1,6%), and 3 cases of liponecrosis (2,5%). No cases of infection or total nipple-areola loss were reported (Table 2).

Table 2
Post-operative complication rate after breast reduction in 120 patients

Patients expressed overall satisfaction with the TLA procedure, reporting no discomfort during the pre-operative infiltration or throughout the entire surgical process. Most patients conveyed contentment with the aesthetic outcomes at the 1-year follow-up. A satisfaction survey was administered 3 months post-surgery, enabling patients to rate their pain management and satisfaction with their aesthetic results on a scale ranging from "unsatisfactory" to "excellent". The majority of patients expressed high levels of satisfaction. Importantly, all patients were subject to a follow-up period exceeding 1 year (Figs. 1, 2).

### Aesthetic breast surgery under cold tumescent anesthesia: feasibility and safety in outpatient clinic [^112Re9Nr]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Throughout the last decade, aesthetic breast surgery has enormously spread in the outpatient clinic setting where plastic surgeons perform the vast majority of procedures under local anesthesia as day-case operations. The "tumescent anesthesia" is defined as the injection of a dilute solution of local anesthetic combined with epinephrine and sodium bicarbonate into subcutaneous tissue until it becomes firm and tense, which is "tumescent". The "cold tumescent anesthesia" (CTA) derives from Klein's solution with the introduction of a new concept, which is the low temperature (4°C) of the injected solution. This novelty adds further anesthetic and hemostatic power to the well-known benefits of tumescent anesthesia. The authors report their experience with CTA in the last 15 years in the setting of aesthetic breast surgery, describing in detail the anesthesia protocol, surgical outcomes, and patient satisfaction. A total of 1541 patients were operated on during the study period and were included in this retrospective analysis. The types of breast procedures were breast augmentation in 762 cases (49.4%), mastopexy with implants in 123 patients (8.0%), mastopexy without implants in 452 cases (29.3%), and breast reduction in 204 cases (13.3%). Patient mean age was 42.8 years (range, 18–67 years). The mean operating time was 37 ± 32 minutes for breast augmentation, 78 ± 24 minutes for mastopexy with implants, 58 ± 18 minutes for mastopexy without implants, and 95 ± 19 minutes for breast reduction. No major complications occurred, and no conversion to general anesthesia was required. The median recovery time was 150 minutes (range, 120–210 minutes), and all patients were discharged within 3 hours after surgery. Wound or implant infections occurred in 33 patients (2.1%), wound dehiscences in 21 (1.4%), and postoperative bleeding requiring return to theater in 2 cases (0.1%). Thirteen patients (0.8%) developed capsular contracture. Fifteen patients (1%) required reintervention due to implant rotation or rupture. The median visual analog scale score was 1.8 (interquartile range, 1–3) after discharge. Patient satisfaction was very high in 91.3% (n = 1407) of the cases. In experienced hands, CTA can shorten operating time with high patient satisfaction and a low complication rate. These preliminary data could be hypothesis generating for future multicenter prospective trials done to confirm the benefits of CTA in other surgical fields.

### Tumescent cervicofacial rhytidectomy [^112DiFv5]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2009). Low credibility.

A modification of the tumescent technique for body contouring has been adapted for patients undergoing face lift. Thirty women, average age 56 years, were prospectively studied, with a 1-year follow-up. All surgery was performed in a private ambulatory operating room facility. The patients were under intravenous sedation with a board-certified anesthesiologist in attendance at all times. The preferred solution was 0.3% lidocaine 1/250,000 epinephrine (average volume injected 500 mL). The solution was a mixture of Ringer's lactate 400 mL plus 2% lidocaine 50 mL and 1% lidocaine 50 mL plus 1:1000 epinephrine 2 mL. The average lidocaine dose per patient was 29.4 mg/kg. Serum lidocaine levels demonstrated a 1-hour peak at 2.7 microg/mL (no value exceeded 3.3 microg/mL). The technique began with superficial liposculpture followed by independent skin-lateral superficial musculoaponeurotic system-ectomy/platysmaplasty with wide skin undermining. Average operating time was 1 hour and 48 minutes. No operative complications were encountered. Excellent anesthetization was achieved in all patients without postoperative hematomas or nerve injuries. Tumescent cervicofacial rhytidectomy has been found to be a safe and effective rhytidectomy procedure that offers several advantages when compared with nontumescent techniques: avoidance of general inhalational agents, reduced operative bleeding and operative time, improved technical ease of superficial liposculpture and surgical dissection, and minimal postoperative bruising and swelling.

### Perioperative management of cosmetic liposuction [^112rx5zi]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Recent qualms about the safety of aesthetic lipoplasty may be attributable more to support system flaws than to technical process deficiencies. The authors here focus on perfunctory patient monitoring when sedative or analgesic drugs are given, cavalier infiltration of mega-dose lidocaine, cursory intraoperative patient observation by team members with conflicting responsibilities, anesthesia providers unfamiliar with the unique surgical physiology of liposuction, hurried-discharge policies that virtually ignore the residual depressant effects of sedatives and analgesics, and compressive dressings that impair postoperative chest-wall expansion and venous return. Whereas pulmonary embolism remains the leading process cause of morbidity from liposuction, complications from austere resource allocation to dedicated patient monitoring should be largely preventable. Not all lipoplasties require an anesthesia provider but-when heavy sedation, mega-dose lidocaine, or both, are projected-a trained team member dedicated exclusively to patient safety and comfort should be a minimum patient care standard. The potential role of lidocaine cardiotoxicity in tumescent anesthesia is widely underappreciated and that of hypothermia goes mostly unrecognized. These, plus largely preventable or potentially correctable perioperative events such as pulmonary edema, fluid imbalance, or improperly administered sedative and analgesic drugs, demand upgrading and expansion of monitoring, resuscitative, and recuperative facilities in physician offices. In fact, ASPS guidelines urge that anesthesia services be engaged for dedicated patient care whenever "major" liposuction or conscious sedation is projected, because liposuction is neither as benign nor as simple a procedure as heretofore reputed. To assess objectively the operative and anesthetic risk of obesity, document body mass index for the preoperative record; morbid obesity (body mass index ≥ 35.0), for instance, is a known risk multiplier for sedatives and analgesics. Other system issues such as the dynamic profile of high-dose lidocaine pharmacokinetics, the deportation of fat globules in the bloodstream, and the incidence of intraoperative hypothermia remain as unresolved topics for interdisciplinary, multi-institutional clinical research.

### Breast reduction: does the tumescent technique affect reimbursement? [^115PDzKg]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Breast reduction is a very common procedure within the field of plastic surgery, with many techniques. These techniques include differences in the location of the pedicles and of the scars. Another variation on the technique for breast reduction relates to preoperative infiltration of an epinephrine solution to reduce blood loss and operative time. The authors' technique for breast reduction and its effect on insurance reimbursement has not previously been discussed in a large prospective study.

Methods

The authors performed a prospective study to compare a cohort of 50 patients undergoing a traditional breast reduction without infiltration of epinephrine followed by electrocautery for resection versus 50 patients receiving tumescent infiltration of epinephrine followed by sharp resection.

Results

The patients who underwent the tumescent technique for breast reduction had shorter operative times and similar blood loss and pain compared with the traditional technique. The use of tumescence did not cause a significant difference in the weight of the amount resected when compared with the dry, pathologic weight.

Conclusions

In the first large prospective cohort study involving this technique, the authors can demonstrate the many advantages of the tumescent technique and refute their concern that tumescence can cause inaccurate weight measurements that might interfere with insurance reimbursement based on resected weight.

### Safety and efficacy of local tranexamic acid for the prevention of surgical bleeding in soft-tissue surgery: a review of the literature and recommendations for plastic surgery [^116BV8tV]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

COCKTAIL SOLUTIONS: ADDING TRANEXAMIC ACID TO LOCAL ANESTHETICS OR TUMESCENCE

Intraarticular tranexamic acid combined with adrenaline has shown superiority to tranexamic acid alone in reducing blood loss in joint arthroplasties.

Namazi first suggested adding tranexamic acid to tumescence solution both for hair transplantationand liposuction. Fernaureported adding 1 mg/ml tranexamic acid to tumescence and infiltrating flanks in a blinded paired randomized fashion and found consistently less bruising on the tranexamic acid side. In rhytidectomies, Schroeder and Langsdonused local anesthetics or tumescence containing 10 mg/ml tranexamic acid and found a 70 percent reduction in drain output on the first day in a recent retrospective cohort study; Couto et al. Nayak and Linkov, and Kochuba et al.reported reductions in operating time and drain production in rhytidectomy using tumescence with only 0.75 to 2 mg/ml tranexamic acid. In rhinoplasty, Brown et al.have reported adding tranexamic acid to the local anesthetic solution in addition to using intravaneous tranexamic acid. Randomized controlled trials on the use of tranexamic acid in rhinoplasty generally address systemic administration.

In the four randomized controlled trials by our group and Zilinsky's group, (Tables 1 and 2), the effect of tranexamic acid alone as a hemostatic was examined, although both groups normally use cocktails with both lidocaine and adrenaline. More research is needed on a possible synergy between adrenaline and tranexamic acid for hemostasis in soft tissue.

### Warm and neutral tumescent anesthetic solutions are essential factors for a less painful injection [^113wyGsL]. Dermatologic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Tumescent local anesthesia is widely used in dermatologic surgery. Minimizing pain associated with injections is crucial to successful surgical procedures.

Objective

This study investigates the pain associated with warm and room temperatures in neutralized or nonneutralized tumescent anesthetic solutions injection.

Methods

Thirty-six patients with axilla osmidrosis who underwent local anesthesia for surgery were randomly assigned to three groups. Group A received warm neutral (40 degrees C) and room-temperature neutral (22 degrees C) tumescent injections to each axillary region. Group B received warm neutral (pH 7.35) and warm nonneutral (pH 4.78) tumescent injections on each side of axilla. Group C received warm nonneutral and room-temperature nonneutral tumescent injections on each side of axilla. Pain associated with infiltration of anesthesia was rated on a visual analog scale (VAS).

Results

A statistically significant decrease (p < .001) in pain sensation was reported on the warm, neutral injection side (mean rating, 32.7 mm) compared with the room-temperature, neutral injection side (mean rating, 53.3 mm). Patient-reported pain intensity was significantly lower on the side that received warm, neutral tumescent anesthesia (mean rating, 26.8 mm) than on the side receiving warm, nonneutral tumescent anesthesia (mean rating, 44.9 mm; p < .001). The difference in VAS scores between warm neutral (mean rating, 23.9 mm) and room-temperature nonneutral (mean rating, 61.2 mm) was statistically significant (p < .001).

Conclusion

The warm, neutral tumescent anesthetic preparation effectively suppressed patient pain during dermatologic surgical procedures.

### Tumescent anesthesia: a brief history regarding the evolution of tumescent solution [^116eixLK]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Tumescent anesthesia, initially developed as a safer and more effective alternative to general anesthesia in performing liposuction, is used extensively today for a wide array of surgical procedures performed by various specialties. The make-up of the tumescent solution is variable, and it has evolved significantly over the past 40+ years. Even prior to Jefferey Klein&rsquo; s tumescent solution recorded in his article from 1987, &ldquo; The Tumescent Technique for Lipo-Suction Surgery,&rdquo; there were significant contributions paving the way to modern formulations.1 In this article, we attempt to provide the most comprehensive history and timeline documenting the evolution of tumescent solution to date.

### Effect of subcutaneous lidocaine infiltration on blood loss secondary to corporal lipoaspiration: a prospective, randomized, double-masked clinical trial [^111ZDbMf]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Lipoaspiration is one of the most frequently performed aesthetic surgical procedures worldwide. The use of tumescent solution containing lidocaine to infiltrate subcutaneous fat before surgery has been accepted as the standard of care for these procedures. Its objective is to diminish postoperative analgesic necessities and secondary blood loss, but its role in hematocrit reduction is not clear at this time. This study aimed to measure the effect of subcutaneous lidocaine infiltration on blood loss secondary to corporal liposuction.

Methods

A prospective, randomized, double-masked clinical trial was performed. Between November 2005 and July 2007, 70 consecutive female patients submitted to corporal liposuction as a single surgery were included in the study. All the patients were randomly assigned to two groups. The study group received tumescent solution containing lidocaine and epinephrine, whereas the control group received tumescent solution containing only epinephrine. Hematocrit was measured preoperatively, then 2 to 4, 12, and 24 h postoperatively.

Results

The comparison between the two groups did not show significant statistical differences with respect to age, body mass index, infiltrated volume, aspirated fat volume, surgical time, hospital stay, preoperative hematocrit, or comparison of the areas lipoaspirated. The mean hematocrit reduction in the study group was 10.8% ± 2.9% compared with 8.8% ± 2.6% in the control group (P = 0.004).

Conclusion

The use of lidocaine in the tumescent solution for subcutaneous fat infiltration significantly increases postoperative anemia compared with the results obtained when epinephrine infiltration alone is used.

### FENTANYL CITRATE injection, solution… [^11682Nvs]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fentanyl Citrate Injection is indicated for:

- analgesic action of short duration during the anesthetic periods, premedication, induction and maintenance, and in the immediate postoperative period as the need arises.
- use as a narcotic analgesic supplement in general or regional anesthesia.
- administration with a neuroleptic as an anesthetic premedication, for the induction of anesthesia and as an adjunct in the maintenance of general and regional anesthesia. Low Dose-2 mcg/kg For use in minor, but painful, surgical procedures. May also provide some pain relief in the immediate postoperative period. Moderate Dose-2 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg For use in more major surgical procedures, in addition to adequate analgesia, may abolish some of the stress response. Low Dose-2 mcg/kg Additional dosages infrequently needed in these minor procedures.

Moderate Dose-2 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg 25 mcg to 100 mcg Administer intravenously or intramuscularly as needed when movement and/or changes in vital signs indicate surgical stress or lightening of analgesia. High Dose-20 mcg/kg to 50 mcg/kg Maintenance dosage as needed based on vital signs indicative of stress and lightening of analgesia. Individualize the dosage especially if the anticipated remaining operative time is short. Adjunct to Regional Anesthesia. 50 mcg to 100 mcg may be administered intramuscularly or slowly intravenously, over one to two minutes, when additional analgesia is required. Postoperatively 50 mcg to 100 mcg may be administered intramuscularly for the control of pain, tachypnea and emergence delirium. The dose may be repeated in one to two hours as needed.

As a technique to attenuate the responses to surgical stress without the use of additional anesthetic agents, doses of 50 mcg/kg to 100 mcg/kg may be administered with oxygen and a muscle relaxant. In certain cases, doses up to 150 mcg/kg may be necessary to produce this anesthetic effect. It has been used for open heart surgery and certain other major surgical procedures in patients for whom protection of the myocardium from excess oxygen demand is particularly indicated, and for certain complicated neurological and orthopedic procedures.

### Tumescent analgesia in plastic surgery [^111E6YZE]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tumescent analgesia (TA) is commonly used for liposuction without needing sedation or general anesthesia.

Methods

A literature review of current use of TA in plastic surgery was done to determine other procedures where TA can be useful and present a standard protocol for use.

Results

TA is used for breast, body, face, and extremity procedures, both with and without supplemental anesthesia. The TA fluid commonly contains lidocaine as the anesthetic agent, but there is more recent experience with using bupivacaine. Despite concerns of high doses of local anesthetics, TA seems to be safe and effective.

Conclusions

TA can be implemented into practice to provide improved pain control and decrease anesthesia requirements.

### High volume liposuction in tumescence anesthesia in lipedema patients: a retrospective analysis [^116FyTYX]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lipedema is a chronic, progressive disease that occurs almost exclusively in women and leads to pathological, painful fat growths at the extremities. Only symptomatic therapy can be offered since the etiology of the disease has not yet been clarified. Liposuction in tumescent anesthesia has established itself as a surgical treatment method of choice. The complication rate associated with the procedure and the pharmacological course and safety of treatment in patients with lipedema has not yet been sufficiently studied. The aim of the study was to broaden the evidence on the safety of ambulatory high-volume liposuction in tumescent anesthesia in lipedema patients. Influencing factors of patients (weight, fat content, comorbidities) or the process technique (drug administration, volume of aspirates) should be investigated on the safety and risks of tumescent anesthesia. This was a retrospective data analysis in which data from 27 patients (40 liposuction procedures) treated at the Sandhofer and Barsch lipedema center between 2016 and 2018 were evaluated. The liposuctions were carried out in tumescent anesthesia and using a Power-Assisted Liposuction system. Clinical examinations and regular blood samples were carried out before the procedure, intra- and postoperatively. The procedures lasted an average of 118 minutes and an average of 6111 mL of aspirate was removed. For tumescent anesthesia, patients were given an average lidocaine dose of 34.23 mg/kg body weight and an epinephrine dose of 0.11 mg/kg body weight. No relevant complications associated with drug side effects, hypovolemia or hypervolemia or blood loss were detected. Liposuction under high volume tumescent anesthesia for the treatment of lipedema patients is, even for major intervention, a safe procedure.

### Tranexamic acid in body contouring surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116jddAn]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Reduced drain output may lead to earlier drain removal, a common discharge consideration, thereby leading to shorter hospital stays. However, it is important to note that drain output reduction, although indicative of decreased bleeding and fluid accumulation, should be interpreted alongside other meaningful clinical outcomes. The presence of surgical drains is often cited as a source of pain and discomfort for patients postoperatively. Additional factors such as decreased hospitalization days, improved patient-reported outcomes regarding pain levels, and reduced blood transfusion requirements are crucial for understanding the overall impact of TXA on patient care.

The choice between IV and topical administration of TXA remains a subject of ongoing research and debate. Both methods have demonstrated varying efficacy in reducing blood loss and postoperative complications; however, the optimal route of administration may depend on the specific surgical context and patient characteristics. One RCT found that the combined use of IV and topical TXA in liposuction procedures significantly reduced blood loss and postoperative bruising. IV TXA may be more convenient in body contouring procedures such as liposuction in which evenly applying topical TXA to all areas of bleeding can be challenging. Notably, the first RCT investigating TXA in liposuction directly compared IV administration with SQ TXA delivery within tumescent solution. It found IV TXA to be more effective than the control group and SQ TXA groups in terms of change to hemoglobin levels on postoperative Day 1 and Day 5, suggesting that SQ delivery may lead to lower systemic absorption and reduced antifibrinolytic effect.

### Estimated maximal safe dosages of tumescent lidocaine [^116HuJAR]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

For the 24 hours after infiltration, whenever serum samples were obtained, the awake patients were evaluated for any unpleasant subjective symptoms or signs of mild toxicity, including: lightheadedness, perioral numbness or nausea, tinnitus, blurred vision, nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, or confusion.

Patient monitoring during the first 12 to 14 hours included continuous cardiac rhythm, heart rate, pulse oximetry, and automatic arterial blood pressure. Heart rates, before, during, and after tumescent infiltration and immediately after liposuction were compared.

Serum samples were obtained from a peripheral vein using an indwelling 20-gauge IV catheter by a 2-syringe sampling technique. The first syringe contained 2 mL saline to flush the IV catheter and then remove and discard 2 mL of blood. Next, 10 mL blood was collected in a second syringe for assay of lidocaine by high-performance liquid chromatography by NMS Labs, Willow Grove, PA. The catheter was then flushed with 1 mL heparin 10 USP units per milliliter.

For each subject, the initial infiltration procedures were done without subsequent liposuction, and the final tumescent infiltration was followed by liposuction after allowing at least 1 hour of detumescence for gradual dispersion of subcutaneous tumescent fluid. Tumescent infiltration procedures were separated by at least 1 week. The liposuction aspirate was collected in clear plastic volumetric canisters. After allowing at least 1 hour for gravitational separation of the lipid and aqueous aspirate, the resulting supernatant fat, infranatant blood-tinged tumescent anesthetic solution, and the total aspirate volume were recorded.

Serum lidocaine concentrations as a function of time, Cmax, the time when Cmax occurred (Tmax), and Cmax as a function of milligram per kilogram dosage of lidocaine were determined. Area under the curve (AUC∞) of serum lidocaine concentration-time profile was calculated by the trapezoid method. AUC∞, Cmax, and Tmax without and with liposuction were compared by the paired t test.

### The outcome of primary subglandular breast augmentation using tumescent local anesthesia [^115SRHGh]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Tumescent local anesthesia (TLA) technique to obtain regional anesthesia and vasoconstriction of the skin and subcutaneous tissues is routinely adopted for several plastic surgery procedures. Here, we describe the use of TLA in primary subglandular breast augmentation. This series evaluates advantages and disadvantages of TLA in elective augmentation breast surgery as well as patients' response to this procedure.

Methods

Between December 2008 and November 2011, 150 patients underwent bilateral primary subglandular breast augmentation under TLA and conscious sedation in the presence of a board-certified anesthesiologist. Midazolam 0.05 mg/kg IV and ranitidine 100 mg IV were given as premedication. Tumescent local anesthesia was composed of 25 mL of lidocaine 2%, 8 mEq of sodium bicarbonate, and 1 mL of epinephrine (1 mg/1 mL) in 1000 mL of 0.9% NS. The solution was delivered between the pectoral fascia and the mammary gland via a spinal needle. After infiltration, 45 minutes were allowed before surgery for local anesthetic effects to take place.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 34.3 years. The average amount of tumescent solution infiltrated was 1150 mL, with a maximal dose of 17 mg/kg of lidocaine used. Operating time was 45 minutes and recovery room time averaged 125 minutes. Minor complications were found in a total of 9 (5.3%) patients, with no main surgery-related complications such as hematoma or seroma formation.

Conclusions

Breast augmentation under TLA and conscious sedation proved to be safe in the presence of a board-certified anesthesiologist and when performed with meticulous surgical technique.

### Micro-autologous fat transplantation (MAFT) for forehead volumizing and contouring [^112AG4cE]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Fat Harvesting

First, a tumescent solution was injected at the donor site; after 10–15 min, the fat was harvested using a blunt tip suction cannula (diameter, 2.5 or 3.0 mm, one side hole). The lipoaspirate volume approximated the amount of injected tumescent solution to ensure a high ratio of purified fat after processing by centrifugation. Low pressure was generally adopted during liposuction to minimize damage to the lipoaspirate. According to Lin et al. the plunger of a 10-mL syringe connected to the suction cannula was pulled back to maintain 2–3 mL of empty space, thereby creating a negative suction pressure of approximately 270–330 mm of mercury (mmHg) (Fig. 2 a).

Fig. 2
a Fat aspiration is performed by back-pulling the plunger of a 10-mL syringe to approximately 2–3 mL to maintain negative pressure. b The centrifugation is maintained at 3000 rpm (approximately 1200× g) for 3 min to process and purify the lipoaspirate. c The lower part of the centrifuged lipoaspirate (bloody content) is leaked out, and the oil is wiped off using gauze on the upper part. d The purified, condensed fat is transferred to a 1-mL Luer-slip syringe for transplantation. e The fat-filled syringe is loaded into the MAFT-GUN for the MAFT procedure. The six-graded dial is set at 120, indicating that the delivered volume of each fat parcel is 1/120 mL (0.0083 mL)

Fat Processing and Refinement

The lipoaspirate was poured into a 10 mL syringe screwed on a centrifugation cap to prepare it for centrifugation. In accordance with the "structure fat grafting" technique proposed by Coleman, the extracted lipoaspirate was processed and purified by standard centrifugation at 3000 rpm (approximately 1200×g) for 3 min. The lipoaspirate-filled syringes were balanced by placing the syringes in the centrifuge machine in pairs opposite each other (Fig. 2 b).

### Guidelines for the use of local anesthesia in office-based dermatologic surgery [^1178ZMb3]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Dermatologic surgery — dosing parameters for lidocaine infiltration and tumescent anesthesia: The maximum safe dose of local infiltrative anesthesia is unknown. For adults, manufacturer recommended maximum doses of 7 mg/kg of lidocaine with epinephrine and 4.5 mg/kg of lidocaine without epinephrine appear safe for local infiltration, whereas in children doses of 3.0 to 4.5 mg/kg with epinephrine and 1.5 to 2.0 mg/kg without epinephrine appear to be safe. For office-based liposuction using tumescent local anesthesia, a total lidocaine dose of 55 mg/kg has been found to be safe. Incremental dosing data include a prospective cohort in Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) where a total dose of 50 mL of 1% lidocaine (500 mg) delivered in multiple increments over an average of 8 hours was safe, with no signs of toxicity and serum lidocaine values not approaching toxic levels.

### Evidence-based medicine: liposuction [^113D3wCU]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Review the appropriate indications and techniques for suction-assisted lipectomy body contouring surgery. 2. Accurately calculate the patient limits of lidocaine for safe dosing during the tumescent infiltration phase of liposuction. 3. Determine preoperatively possible "red flags" or symptoms and signs in the patient history and physical examination that may indicate a heightened risk profile for a liposuction procedure. 4. Provide an introduction to adjunctive techniques to liposuction such as energy-assisted liposuction and to determine whether or not the reader may decide to add them to his or her practice.

Summary

With increased focus on one's aesthetic appearance, liposuction has become the most popular cosmetic procedure in the world since its introduction in the 1980s. As it has become more refined with experience, safety, patient selection, preoperative assessment, fluid management, proper technique, and overall care of the patient have been emphasized and improved. For the present article, a systematic review of the relevant literature regarding patient workup, tumescent fluid techniques, medication overview, and operative technique was conducted with a practical approach that the reader will possibly find clinically applicable. Recent trends regarding energy-assisted liposuction and body contouring local anesthesia use are addressed. Deep venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is mentioned, as are other common and less common possible complications. The article provides a literature-supported overview on liposuction techniques with an emphasis on preoperative assessment, medicines used, operative technique, and outcomes.

### Local anesthetic use in tumescent liposuction: an American Society of Plastic Surgeons survey [^112j9ukr]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines favor the use of lidocaine in liposuction wetting solutions. The use of bupivacaine as an alternative remains controversial despite reports of its use with safe and favorable outcomes suggesting faster postoperative recovery time secondary to improved pain control. The goals of this study were to determine the prevalence of bupivacaine use, examine liposuction practices of bupivacaine users, and elucidate opinions regarding bupivacaine use.

Methods

An online survey was distributed to 2500 randomly selected members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Data were collected and analyzed with special attention toward the practice and opinions of bupivacaine use.

Results

The response rate of the survey met the average American Society of Plastic Surgeons online survey response rate at 12.8% (n = 320). Respondents (7.2%; n = 22) reported using bupivacaine in their wetting solutions (bupivacaine group) and provided a dosage range of 62.5 to 150 mg. Respondents (83.5%; n = 254) reported using either lidocaine or prilocaine (no-bupivacaine group). There were no reports of bupivacaine toxicity in 2011. The demographic profile and liposuction practices of both groups were comparable. Although 36% of the no-bupivacaine group did not know or had no opinion on when it is appropriate to use bupivacaine in liposuction wetting solutions, 85% of this group has used bupivacaine for other clinical purposes.

Conclusions

A review of 320 plastic surgeons' experiences revealed that 7% of respondents are using bupivacaine in their tumescent solutions with no reported cases of toxicity. Bupivacaine users differed dramatically only in their opinion regarding the safety of bupivacaine in tumescent liposuction. The recent studies suggesting better postoperative pain control with bupivacaine along with the proportion of respondents reporting bupivacaine use call for distinct guidelines on bupivacaine use in liposuction. Further studies, including a rigorous clinical trial documenting the safety and efficacy of bupivacaine when compared with lidocaine, would be warranted.

### Enhancing safety in tumescent liposuction: managing sedation-related respiratory issues and serious complications under deep sedation with the propofol-ketamine protocol [^112QJ1uZ]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the past 4 years, aesthetic surgery, notably liposuction, has substantially increased. Tumescent liposuction, a popular technique, has two variants-true tumescent liposuction (TTL) and semi-tumescent liposuction. While TTL reduces risks, it has limitations. There is no literature reported on semi-tumescent liposuction under deep sedation using the propofol-ketamine protocol, which is proposed as a potentially safe alternative.

Methods

The retrospective analysis covered 8 years and included 3094 patients performed for tumescent liposuction under deep sedation, utilizing the propofol-ketamine protocol. The evaluation of patient safety involved an examination of potential adverse events with a specific focus on respiratory issues related to sedation, including instances of mask ventilation.

Results

Among the 3094 cases, no fatalities were recorded. Noteworthy events included 43 mask ventilation instances, primarily occurring in the initial 10 min. Twelve cases experienced surgery cancellation due to various factors, including respiratory issues. Three patients were transferred to upper-level hospitals, while another three required blood transfusions. Vigilant management prevented significant complications, and other adverse events like venous thromboembolism (VTE), fat embolism, severe lidocaine toxicity, and so on were not observed.

Conclusions

The analysis of 3094 tumescent liposuction cases highlighted the overall safety profile of the propofol-ketamine protocol under deep sedation. The scarcity of severe complications underscores its viability. The study emphasizes the significance of thorough preoperative assessments, careful patient selection, and awareness of potential complications. Prompt interventions, particularly in addressing sedation-related respiratory issues, further contribute to positive outcomes for patients.

### Liposuction: contemporary issues for the anesthesiologist [^113eEWeu]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Liposuction is a procedure that has emerged over the last 30 years as a method to remove subcutaneous fat for cosmetic purposes. Numerous liposuction techniques have been developed and the purpose of this article is to examine one such technique: "tumescent liposuction". Tumescent liposuction involves using large volumes of dilute local anesthetic and epinephrine to facilitate anesthesia and decrease blood loss. Questions remain about the appropriate dose of local anesthetic, the use of general anesthesia in liposuction, and the setting in which the chosen liposuction method is used. This article also attempts to shed light on this burgeoning field.

### Heating infiltration solutions used in tumescent liposuction: minimizing surgical risk [^114VfmD3]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Liposuction, one of the most common operations performed by plastic surgeons, is not free of complications. One of the most common factors is patient hypothermia, a factor little studied but one capable of producing severe arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. A comparative clinical study was conducted to determine what effect using tumescent infiltration solutions at room temperature and at body temperature has on vital signs.

Methods

Two similar groups of 15 healthy female subjects were studied. In the first group (group A), subcutaneous solutions were infiltrated at room temperature (24 degrees C), and in the second group (group B), solutions were infiltrated at body temperature (37 degrees C). Vital signs (i.e., heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and blood pressure) were monitored every 15 minutes until the basal vital signs were attained. Variables such as age, body mass index, infiltrated and aspirated liquids, and surgery time were very similar for both groups.

Results

Although there were differences in heart rate, respiratory rate, and arterial pressure, they were not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the differences between groups A and B for body temperature (34.9 ± 1.1 degrees C versus 35.7 ± 1.3 degrees C, respectively) and for the time necessary to attain basal vital signs (120 ± 8 minutes versus 69 ± 4 minutes, respectively) were statistically significant (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Despite the existence of a significant change in the body temperature in healthy female subjects during manipulation of the temperature of the infiltration solution, this change had no important effect on the intraoperative hemodynamic values. Nevertheless, it could have a more significant effect on patients with greater surgical risk.

### Tumescent infusion for liposuction: a practical method and pressure delivery system [^111MdFkv]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2009). Low credibility.

To facilitate tumescent liposuction, a pressure infusion technique is necessary. We have devised a new technique for anesthetic solution infusion-a pressure infusion bag along with an automatic low-pressure tourniquet pump-that can generate sustained and significant volume infusion. This system is readily available, requires a minimal capital outlay, and is economically advantageous to our patients.

### Safe extensive tumescent liposuction with segmental infiltration of lower concentration lidocaine under monitored anesthesia care [^115E5yys]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Tumescent anesthesia makes it feasible to perform liposuction in an office setting. There are often patients who desire extensive liposuction on approximately 30% of total body surface area, which means the lidocaine total dose might be over the dosing recommendation. So the segmental infiltration is applied, although the concentration of lidocaine in tumescent fluid is gradually reduced to 0.0252%. Moreover, supplemental intravenous (IV) sedation using monitored anesthesia care is usually applied concurrently to help alleviate discomfort and pain of the patients during tumescent anesthetic infusion and fat extraction which in turn increases the risks of potential lidocaine toxicity due to possible drug interactions. This study was to demonstrate the safety of segmental infiltration of tumescent fluid with lower lidocaine concentration combined with IV sedation in extensive liposuction and determine whether the risk of lidocaine toxicity is increased in this protocol. Ten female patients who requested the extensive liposuction participated in the study. The targeted areas were divided into 2 segments and treated in turn in 1 session. Lidocaine (1600 mg) was infiltrated into the first segment, and approximately 928 mg lidocaine was subsequently infiltrated after accomplishment of the first segment operation. Serum levels of lidocaine were taken every 4 hours during the first 24 hours after the second infiltration. The average time of the procedure is 222 (33) minutes. The dose and total amount of lidocaine injected are 40.7 (5.8) mg/kg and 2528.2 (155.2) mg, respectively. The total volume of the infusates and aspirates are 9918.1 (494) and 6325 (1461.6) mL, respectively, the ratio of total infusates to total aspirates is 1.66 (0.45). The total aspirated fat and fluids are 3280 (1051.8) and 3045 (824.1) mL, respectively. The peak lidocaine levels [2.18 (0.63) μg/mL] occurred after 12 to 20 hours [16.4 (2.27) hours]. No significant correlation between dose per kilogram body weight or total dose of lidocaine infiltrated and its peak levels or time existed. The extensive liposuction covering the 30% total body surface areas was well tolerated by the patients under tumescent anesthesia in combination with the supplemental IV sedation. Our previous study on the fluid management has demonstrated the risk of hypovolemia or fluid overload is very low with this technique, although the patients who received only maintenance fluid (500 mL) in the operating room and could discharge and resume oral intake after 6 hours of recovery room stay. The adequate anesthesia support is available in our office-based setting with adequate recovery facilities in place. It has a high margin of safety, without increasing of lidocaine toxicity or adverse cardiopulmonary sequelae while using a segmental tumescent infiltration with lower concentration of lidocaine.

### Guidelines for the use of local anesthesia in office-based dermatologic surgery [^115TJGpN]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Tumescent local anesthesia in office-based dermatologic liposuction — recommendations and strength: Lidocaine and prilocaine are both safe and recommended for use in tumescent local anesthesia for office-based liposuction. Bupivacaine is not recommended for this use. Use of prilocaine is not approved in the United States for this procedure as of the date of this publication. The addition of epinephrine to lidocaine is recommended and safe for use in tumescent local anesthesia for liposuction. A maximum dose of 55 mg/kg of lidocaine with epinephrine has been shown to be safe and can be used for tumescent local anesthesia for liposuction in patients weighing 43.6–81.8 kg. The use of warm anesthetic solution and a slow infiltration rate is recommended to decrease patient discomfort during administration of tumescent local anesthesia. Strength of recommendation and level of evidence are: Strength of recommendation A and Level of evidence I, II for lidocaine and prilocaine use; Strength of recommendation A and Level of evidence I, II for adding epinephrine; Strength of recommendation A and Level of evidence I for the maximum dose; Strength of recommendation B and Level of evidence II for a warm solution; and Strength of recommendation C and Level of evidence III for a slow infiltration rate.

### Optimizing gynecomastia correction surgery: efficacy and safety of tumescent local anesthesia approach [^114dX1uX]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Over the course of a 13-year interval, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on a cohort comprising 60 male individuals who had undergone gynecomastia correction procedures, exclusively employing the Tumescent Local Anesthesia technique. Most of the study subjects were between 21 and 43 years of age. The mean age of the patients was 31. Sixty percent of the subjects were classified as Simon's group IIa, while the remaining 40% were in group IIb. No statistically significant difference between the groups was observed as per age and Simon's grade. Among all the cases, 52 were bilateral and 8 unilateral, with the latter comprising nearly 13% of the total population. In those unilateral cases, both breasts were aspirated with liposuction, but only the gynecomastia side underwent incision and breast tissue removal. Low self-confidence was the reason for surgery in most of the cases (92%), while over half of the study's subjects were also under emotional distress. A mean volume of 300 mL of tumescent solution was infiltrated, with a range between 250 and 350 mL, and no instances of adverse effects related to adrenaline or lidocaine toxicity were documented. General anesthesia conversion was never necessitated during any of the procedures. The average time interval from solution infiltration to the initiation of skin incision was determined to be at least 20 min; a parameter determined through collaborative assessment by the surgical team and anesthesiologist. Departing from this time threshold resulted in heightened patient discomfort, while exceeding it conferred no discernible benefits to the patient. During the surgical intervention, no reports of pain emerged during the liposuction, the skin incision or the removal of the mammary gland. The mean duration of surgery employing the TLA technique ranged from 50 min to 75 min, excluding bilateral infiltration, waiting periods, and the surgical procedure until completion. For the unilateral cases, liposuction was performed on both breasts to achieve uniformity in the result, but the subcutaneous mastectomy was only performed on the breast with excess glandular tissue. Within the scope of major postoperative complications, comprising 6,7% of cases, three incident of hematoma and one case of seroma were recorded. A minor complication rate of 5% was observed: two cases of retraction of the NAC and one case of gynecomastia recurrence, the latter undergoing an additional combination procedure with liposuction and subcutaneous mastectomy (Table 1). Patients reported overall satisfaction with the TLA procedure, indicating no discomfort during the preoperative infiltration or throughout the entire surgery. Most patients were pleased with the esthetic results at the 1-year follow-up. A satisfaction survey conducted 3 months after the surgery allowed patients to rate their pain management and esthetic outcomes on a scale from "unsatisfactory" to "excellent". Most of the patients expressed high levels of satisfaction. Importantly, all patients were subject to a follow-up period exceeding one year (Figs. 1, 2).

### Efficacy of cold tumescent for prevention of intraoperative bleeding in patients undergoing liposuction: a double-blind randomized controlled trial-half-side comparison [^115fmUHL]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bleeding, a common intraoperative complication of liposuction, often causes pain and discomfort during recovery. Because of the vasoconstrictive effect of adrenaline in the tumescent solution, bleeding can be reduced; however, reports of postoperative bleeding persist. Cold temperatures also have a vasoconstrictive effect.

Objectives

This study aimed to determine the efficacy of cold tumescent solution in preventing and reducing intraoperative bleeding.

Methods

This prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted between June 2018 and June 2019. The liposuction areas in each participant were divided into left and right sides; one side received operative room temperature tumescent solution (25 °C), and the other side received low-temperature tumescent solution (4 °C). The areas of ecchymosis, pain scores, and patient and surgeon satisfaction scores were compared and analyzed.

Results

Ten patients with 36 pairs of liposuction areas were enrolled in the study. Cold tumescent liposuction resulted in a significantly lower lipocrit than was obtained on the standard tumescent side (1.56 ± 0.69 vs 2.92 ± 0.94; P < .001). The ecchymosis area and pain score were significantly lower in the cold tumescent group on days 2, 4, 7, and 14. The satisfaction evaluation scores did not differ between patients and surgeons at 12 months postoperatively.

Conclusions

The use of cold tumescent anesthesia significantly improved liposuction outcomes by reducing the intraoperative blood loss and the postoperative ecchymosis and pain, with no immediate or short-term complications in low-volume liposuction (< 1000 mL) procedures. Furthermore, it generated a standard outcome and good patient satisfaction scores.

### Safety of liposuction using exclusively tumescent local anesthesia in 3, 240 consecutive cases [^115w9ket]. Dermatologic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Many surgeons consider liposuction using tumescent local anesthesia (TLA) to be a safe technique, but when TLA has been combined with other techniques, such as general anesthesia or intravenous medication, or when the guidelines associated with TLA have been violated, serious complications and deaths have occurred. This has resulted in uncertainty concerning the safety of liposuction using TLA, which this article seeks to resolve.

Objective

To investigate whether liposuction using TLA is a safe procedure.

Methods

The same surgeon performed liposuction using exclusively TLA in 3,240 procedures. Detailed records were kept of the complications that occurred.

Results

In a series of 3,240 procedures, no deaths occurred, and no complications requiring hospitalization were experienced. In nine cases, complications developed that needed further action.

Conclusions

Liposuction using exclusively TLA is a proven safe procedure provided that the existing guidelines are meticulously followed.

### Cigarette burn after tumescent anesthesia and intravenous sedation: a case report [^115iMW9U]. Dermatologic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The tumescent anesthetic technique is widely used in cosmetic surgery. It is a safe technique and is easily administered in an outpatient setting. Tumescent anesthesia tends to have a prolonged duration of action, which can be a cause of patient morbidity, especially where intravenous sedation is also used.

Objective

To report a case in which a patient fell asleep while smoking a cigarette not long after having tumescent anesthesia for liposuction. The cigarette fell onto an anesthetized area of the patient's thigh, resulting in a third-degree burn. The patient was not aware of the burn because of skin anesthesia from the tumescent anesthetic solution and residual intravenous sedation and tiredness. There was delay in reporting the burn because it was not painful and because there was no significant damage to the compression hosiery worn by the patient.

Conclusion

The importance of advising patients in postoperative instruction information literature to avoid contact with hot objects, including hot drinks and smoking, after local anesthesia and sedation is emphasized.

### Estimated maximal safe dosages of tumescent lidocaine [^1111NJJZ]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our findings confirmed our main hypothesis that doses of TLA that are far larger than the current FDA limit of 7 mg/kg are a nonsignificant risk of harm to patients.

After the subcutaneous infiltration of tumescent lidocaine, we observed the serum concentration-time profiles without and with liposuction and found that tumescent lidocaine absorption continues beyond 24 hours. For a given dosage of a drug, prolonging its systemic absorption reduces its Cmax. This explains the remarkable safety of large dosages of tumescent lidocaine and epinephrine.

At equal doses of tumescent lidocaine, the average AUC∞ of the concentration-time profiles is 28% smaller with liposuction than it is without liposuction. This supports our hypothesis that liposuction removes a significant amount of subcutaneous tumescent lidocaine before it can be absorbed into the circulation. Thus, data derived from liposuction patients cannot be used to estimate the maximal safe milligram per kilogram dosage of tumescent lidocaine without liposuction.

Furthermore, these concentration-time profiles resemble the profile of a constant IV lidocaine infusion that is discontinued at Tmax. There is a growing literature indicating that systemic IV lidocaine may have beneficial perioperative effects, including preemptive analgesia, reduced postoperative narcotic requirements, and reduced systemic inflammatory response to surgical trauma.– The observation that tumescent infiltration produces a concentration-time profile similar to a constant IV infusion of lidocaine suggests a new hypothesis, to be tested in the future, that local TLA may have desirable systemic effects.

During each of the 41 studies, we observed heart rate, arterial blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and cardiac rhythm and inquired about any subjective symptoms suggestive of lidocaine toxicity. There were no episodes of tachycardia although most patients did receive oral clonidine (0.1 mg) for its anxiolytic effect and to counteract the positive chronotropic effects of epinephrine. One patient encountered a brief episode of nausea at 45mg/kg without liposuction. The data indicates that without liposuction 45mg/kg is risky, while 28mg/kg is a more reasonable maximal safe dosage. Otherwise, careful observation of patients over the course of 41 pharmacokinetic studies revealed no adverse events associated with the systemic effects of lidocaine and epinephrine. This finding confirmed our hypothesis that adverse events associated with the large dosages of tumescent lidocaine with epinephrine are infrequent.

### Viability of preadipocytes in vitro: the influence of local anesthetics and pH [^115YQWPS]. Dermatologic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Autogenous fat transfer with lipoinjection for soft tissue augmentation is a commonly used surgical technique. Abundant donor tissue availability and relative ease of harvesting have made autologous fat an attractive soft tissue filler. The overall reliability of this technique is often disputed, and different authors describe different results after autologous fat transplantation despite using similar techniques. In this study, we examined the influence of different local anesthetics commonly used in fat harvest and the pH of the anesthetic solution on the viability of harvested preadipocytes.

Methods and Materials

Preadipocytes were incubated with 1% lidocaine, 1% articaine plus epinephrine 1:200,000, 0.75% ropivacaine, and 1% prilocaine or our standardized tumescent solution (1 L of 0.9% sodium chloride solution plus 25 mL of 1% articaine plus epinephrine 1:200,000 plus 25 mL of bicarbonate) for 30 minutes. Additionally, we incubated cells with the local anesthetics as described above but diluted 1:2 with phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4). Viability was measured using trypan blue dying as well as propidium iodine staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis.

Results

There are significant differences in the viability of preadipocytes under the influence of various local anesthetics.

Discussion

Our data could partially explain the varying results after autogenous fat transfer.

### Advancing reduction mammaplasty surgery: advancements and outcomes with tumescent local anaesthesia [^116R8mxj]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Reduction mammaplasty, a surgical procedure aimed at reducing the size and reshaping the breasts, is commonly performed to alleviate physical discomfort, functional impairment, and psychological distress associated with macromastia. While traditional reduction mammaplasty techniques have demonstrated efficacy in achieving desirable aesthetic outcomes and improving patients' quality of life, advancements in anaesthesia protocols have revolutionised the perioperative experience and surgical outcomes. Tumescent local anaesthesia has emerged as a promising alternative to general anaesthesia in reduction mammaplasty surgery, offering several potential advantages including improved safety, enhanced post-operative pain management, and reduced systemic complications related to general anaesthesia. This technique involves the infiltration of a large volume of diluted local anaesthetic solution, typically containing lidocaine and epinephrine, into the breast tissue and surrounding areas. The tumescent solution not only provides effective anaesthesia but also serves as a vasoconstrictor, minimising intraoperative bleeding and facilitating surgical dissection. Despite the growing interest in tumescent local anaesthesia for reduction mammaplasty, comprehensive scientific investigations evaluating its efficacy, safety profile, and perioperative outcomes are relatively scarce. Thus, this study aims to address this gap by systematically examining the clinical outcomes and patient-reported experiences associated with reduction mammaplasty performed under tumescent local anaesthesia. By elucidating the benefits and potential limitations of tumescent local anaesthesia in reduction mammaplasty surgery, this research endeavours to contribute to the optimisation of surgical techniques and perioperative care protocols. Through rigorous evaluation of surgical outcomes, complication rates, and patient satisfaction measures, this study aims to provide valuable insights that can inform clinical decision-making and enhance the overall management of macromastia.

### Rapid absorption of tumescent lidocaine above the clavicles: a prospective clinical study [^115RZ2PR]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Tumescent local anesthesia has been adapted for surgery of the face and neck, but there are no data regarding drug absorption when tumescent injection is used in this region. The aim of this study was to characterize the changes in plasma lidocaine concentrations over time when a tumescent solution is injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the neck. The study was carried out in human volunteer subjects, and injection of lidocaine to the thighs provided control data.

Methods

Eight healthy female volunteer subjects were studied twice using a prospective, crossover design. Tumescent lidocaine solution was injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the neck in one session and the thighs in another session. The order of injection was randomized. Blood samples were collected for 14 hours after injection, and the plasma concentration of lidocaine measured. The injected solution consisted of lidocaine 0.1%, NaHCO3 12.5 mEq/L, and epinephrine 1:1,000,000 in normal saline. A standardized dose of lidocaine (7 mg/kg) was used for each injection and no surgical procedure was performed.

Results

All subjects completed the study. Subject weight was 66.1 ± 12.8 kg, body fat was 29.0 ± 4.7 percent, and body mass index was 23.8 ± 3.1 kg/m2. The average time to reach peak lidocaine concentration after neck injection was 5.8 hours, whereas peak lidocaine concentration after thigh injection did not occur until 12.0 hours. This difference of 6.2 hours was highly significant (p = 0.009). The average peak concentration after neck injection was 16 percent greater than that after thigh injection (0.94 microg/ml versus 0.81 microg/ml), with the difference approaching significance (p = 0.06). No adverse reactions were noted.

Conclusions

Tumescent injection above the clavicles results in a rapid rise in plasma lidocaine concentration when compared with injection to the lower extremities. Toxic symptoms could occur much earlier than expected for lower extremity tumescent anesthesia. In addition, dangerous plasma levels could occur if tumescent anesthesia in the lower extremities is followed by tumescent injection above the clavicles, because the absorption curves would be superimposed.

### Estimated maximal safe dosages of tumescent lidocaine [^1179TuKg]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Tumescent lidocaine anesthesia (TLA) was developed for performing liposuction totally by local anesthesia with virtually no surgical blood loss. TLA has been extended to a wide range of other surgical procedures involving cutaneous, subcutaneous, breast, and vascular tissues. – The maximum safe dosage of tumescent lidocaine for these procedures is unknown. There is a need for a pharmacokinetic-based estimate of the maximum safe milligram per kilogram dosage of tumescent lidocaine.

The package insert labeling approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for lidocaine with epinephrine states that the recommended maximal dosage is 7 mg/kg for infiltration local anesthesia. The FDA has no data to support this 7 mg/kg as the dosage limit, which was established in 1948 for epidural anesthesia. The liposuction guidelines of the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery recommended that the maximal safe milligram per kilogram dosage of tumescent lidocaine for liposuction totally by local anesthesia is 55 mg/kg.

Tumescent lidocaine solution contains at most 1 g lidocaine and 1 mg epinephrine in 100 mL plus 10 mEq sodium bicarbonate in 10 mL added to 1000 mL of 0.9% physiologic saline for a final lidocaine concentration of 1 g per bag containing 1110 mL or 0.9 g/L (0.09%). Sodium bicarbonate reduces the stinging discomfort of large volume subcutaneous tumescent infiltration.

Subcutaneous infiltration of large volumes of TLA solution causes the targeted tissue to become temporarily swollen and firm or tumescent. The resulting increased subcutaneous interstitial pressure spreads the TLA solution through adjacent tissues by bulk flow. Lidocaine toxicity is a function of serum lidocaine concentration. Dilute epinephrine produces intense local vasoconstriction, slows systemic absorption of lidocaine, and thus reduces peak serum lidocaine concentrations, which reduces the risk of systemic lidocaine toxicity. The removal of a significant volume of tumescent subcutaneous fat by liposuction removes a significant portion of the tumescent lidocaine before it is absorbed into the systemic circulation. The threshold serum concentration for mild lidocaine toxicity (lightheadedness, paresthesias, tinnitus, blurred vision, nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, confusion) is 6 μg/mL. –

### Optimizing gynecomastia correction surgery: efficacy and safety of tumescent local anesthesia approach [^113MxsHE]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We discussed our results with a surgical approach for treating gynecomastia, which involves a comprehensive rehabilitation regimen combined with the liposuction plus periareolar excision technique, all performed on an outpatient basis under local tumescent anesthesia. Our findings validate the feasibility of this proposal for gynecomastia treatment, resulting in expedited recovery and high patient satisfaction rates without an increase in complication rates. Consequently, the adoption of this approach, incorporating local anesthetic techniques, merits serious consideration in gynecomastia management strategies.

### Guidelines for the use of local anesthesia in office-based dermatologic surgery [^112CMLgX]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Tumescent local anesthesia — safety and comfort evidence for office-based liposuction: There is substantial evidence to support the safety of tumescent local anesthesia when used for office-based liposuction, with no reports of death associated with liposuction performed under tumescent local anesthesia by dermatologists and rates of serious adverse events estimated at 0.04% to 0.16%. A well conducted prospective study found local tumescent anesthesia with lidocaine doses of 55 mg/kg to be safe for use in office-based liposuction, and this recommendation is valid only for the weight range studied (43.6–81.8 kg). Prilocaine is not approved in the United States for tumescent local anesthesia, but it is also safe and effective for this procedure, and there are no data examining other anesthetics for use in tumescent local anesthesia, including bupivacaine, and therefore no recommendations can be rendered. For comfort during administration, the use of a warm (40°C) solution is associated with significantly less patient discomfort, and a single retrospective study of data from 4 experienced surgeons suggests that a slower rate of infusion also causes less patient discomfort during anesthetic administration but has no effect on pain level during liposuction.

### On beyond lidocaine: reconsidering local anesthetics in tumescent liposuction – A critical review [^112K6K56]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The use of tumescent solution in liposuction is now considered standard of care; however, much debate still exists regarding its ideal components, especially surrounding the inclusion of local anesthetics. This article reviews the discussion regarding the use of local anesthetics in tumescent liposuction and how it may evolve in the future. The need for local anesthetic additives in tumescent liposuction has been questioned, and the use of longer-acting agents discouraged; however, increasing number of reports in recent years have described the increasingly widespread use of tumescent anesthesia where a wetting solution is infiltrated to achieve anesthesia in an operative field for procedures other than liposuction. More high-level evidence, such as randomized controlled clinical trials, will be required; however, it should be possible to develop a useful standardized algorithm that can guide surgeons to optimize patient safety as well as patient experience.

### Outcomes of intramuscular gluteal augmentation with implants using tumescent local anesthesia [^111mimmH]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Body contouring has indeed been a part of the feminine beauty standard in many cultures throughout history. The breast and buttocks have often been seen as important areas for shaping and enhancing in order to achieve the desired aesthetic. In recent years, there has been a rise in gluteal augmentation surgery demand. There are a variety of different techniques that can be used to improve the contour of the gluteal area. Some of these techniques involve liposuction, which creates a slimmer, more sculpted appearance. In some cases, fat can be grafted into the gluteus to create a fuller shape. Implant placement have developed in recent years and although gluteal augmentation has a high rate of patient satisfaction, the rate of complications is still high. Implants visibility and palpability has mostly been associated with subcutaneous and subfascial placement, which can provide satisfactory postoperative recovery but at the same time confer a limited soft tissue coverage of the implant. The introduction of submuscular implant placement for buttocks augmentation has been associated with several benefits. Implants are placed under the muscle, they are less visible and can create a more natural-looking appearance. This can also help to reduce the risk of complications such as implant malpositioning, displacement, and extrusion. Undesirable shaping of the implant and the gluteal area, however, is sometimes observed in some groups of patients. Nonetheless, there is a growing trend toward the use of intramuscular implant placement. These studies have suggested that this approach may produce better results compared to other gluteal augmentation techniques such as subcutaneous, subfascial or submuscular implants placement. Moreover, we have found that satisfactory outcome and good results can be achieved in selected patients after intramuscular augmentation combined with autologous fat grafting.

At surgery, the choice of local or general anesthesia depends on many factors and on the preferences of the patient and the surgeon. Tumescent local anesthesia (TLA) consists in the infiltration of large volumes of saline solution with lidocaine and epinephrine in the muscular compartment. With this technique, the time of surgery is slightly longer, but intramuscular dissection is facilitated, and bleeding and postoperative pain are reduced. The use of TLA technique was developed in liposuction but is also routinely used for several other surgeries. To date, it had never been described for gluteoplasty.

We propose a surgical technique for placing the implants in an intramuscular position using the TLA technique, which can lower the most common complications, solve technical difficulties, and offer outcomes that are not always achieved through other methods.

### Estimated maximal safe dosages of tumescent lidocaine [^114S2SU8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Within our sample of 14 subjects there was no evidence of lidocaine or epinephrine toxicity. Preliminary estimates for maximum safe dosages of tumescent lidocaine are 28 mg/kg without liposuction and 45mg/kg with liposuction. As a result of delayed systemic absorption, these dosages yield serum lidocaine concentrations below levels associated with mild toxicity and represent a nonsignificant risk of harm to patients.

### Advancing reduction mammaplasty surgery: advancements and outcomes with tumescent local anaesthesia [^112pirnH]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this article, we present our 10-year experience with reduction mammaplasty, a procedure performed in 120 patients using the TLA technique.

The TLA technique (modified tumescent local anaesthesia) for reduction mammaplasty operations symbolises a new step for this type of surgery. The use of local anaesthesia for breast surgery has been described in the literature and there are several procedures that can be performed using this anaesthetic technique. The progression in studies concerning this anaesthetic technique, considering its potential for minimising complications and its less invasive nature compared to general anaesthesia, supports the hypothesis that it can be used as an excellent alternative in surgery.

Tumescent anaesthesia describes the practice of injecting a diluted solution of local anaesthetic combined with epinephrine and sodium bicarbonate into the subcutaneous tissue until it becomes firm and taut (tumescent). They are usually injected deep into the subcutaneous tissue. In addition to the anaesthetic action, this technique offers the advantage of performing tissue dissection (hydrodissection); by combining it, blood loss is reduced through the vasoconstriction induced by adrenaline together with the hydrostatic effects of injecting large volumes that tamponade local blood vessels. Adrenaline also significantly prolongs the blockade resulting in excellent post-operative anaesthesia and analgesia. Sodium bicarbonate accelerates the onset of blockade and reduces the pain associated with the injection of local anaesthetic.

### Intraoperative use of bupivacaine for tumescent liposuction: the Robert wood Johnson experience [^115AmaoP]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Bupivacaine anesthetic is commonly used as a wetting solution additive in tumescent liposuction, but its routine use remains controversial because of a lack of evidence in the current literature.

Methods

In accordance with local institutional review board regulations, a retrospective chart review was conducted of liposuction cases performed from 1997 to 2007 at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The primary endpoint was adverse perioperative events. Secondary endpoints included length of postanesthesia care unit stay and length of total postoperative hospital stay.

Results

Eighty-seven cases were analyzed and two subsets of patients were identified. In group 1, 24 patients were compared who underwent liposuction as the primary procedure and received bupivacaine, lidocaine, or no additive in their wetting solution. No adverse events were encountered and the average length of stay was not significantly different. In group 2, 20 patients were compared who underwent abdominoplasty and liposuction and received bupivacaine or no additive in their wetting solution. No adverse events occurred and patients receiving bupivacaine had a significantly shorter average length of stay, 19 hours versus 36 hours, compared with controls (p = 0.015).

Conclusions

A review of the experience at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital reveals that the intraoperative use of bupivacaine for tumescent liposuction in 27 cases appeared to be as safe as other tumescent additives. There did not appear to be a significant difference in the incidence of adverse events or postoperative length of stay for patients who underwent liposuction with bupivacaine compared with other wetting solutions. Among a subset of patients who underwent concurrent abdominoplasty and liposuction procedures, patients who received bupivacaine spent significantly less time in the hospital postoperatively than those who did not receive it. Conducting future prospective studies involving larger samples among multiple centers is an essential next step to confirm these findings.

### Advancing reduction mammaplasty surgery: advancements and outcomes with tumescent local anaesthesia [^112diRmb]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Lidocaine toxicity is closely related to its plasma levels, which may vary due to rapid systemic absorption, impaired hepatic metabolism, or drug interactions. It is therefore essential to monitor the patient during infiltration. Moreover, it is also important to start the injection of the tumescent solution slowly while palpating the breast to ensure that the solution is distributed in the correct tissue plane. The use of epinephrine induces vasoconstriction, thereby reducing blood loss and bleeding during surgery. However, it is essential to perform careful haemostasis as soon as the effect of epinephrine wears off to prevent post-operative bleeding. If adequate haemostasis is achieved, the use of drains will not be necessary, as is the case in our practice.

This type of anaesthesia can be used in patients who refuse general anaesthesia. It is also indicated in patients with myasthenia gravis; this approach can be used to avoid general anaesthesia and minimise the use of sedative or potentially aggravating medications. Amide local anaesthetics are recommended, as the metabolism of ester anaesthetics may be impaired by the patient's regular anticholinesterase medications.

### Optimizing gynecomastia correction surgery: efficacy and safety of tumescent local anesthesia approach [^114zjDNk]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Between 2010 and 2023, a total of 60 individuals underwent corrective surgery for gynecomastia. All operations took place at a certified outpatient facility. The surgical team comprised a plastic surgeon with board certification, an assistant surgeon, an operating room nurse, and a certified anesthesiologist. Patients received comprehensive information about the procedure, its indications, and potential complications, such as postoperative bleeding, scar retraction, and seroma formation. Prior to surgery, patients underwent standard preoperative tests, including blood work, cardiac evaluation, and breast ultrasound. All patients met the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) criteria for either status I or II. Exclusion criteria included ASA status III or higher, as well as BMI considerations, and patients with pseudogynecomastia, whose treatment typically involves weight loss and, in some cases, liposuction, but it does not require the surgical removal of glandular tissue. Simon's classification for gynecomastia was used for grading, including in our study patients with grade I, IIa, and IIb. Those patients with grade III gynecomastia with significant excess skin have been excluded, since this approach may be inadequate for addressing the skin redundancy, which often requires more extensive surgical techniques to achieve optimal esthetic outcomes. Medications affecting platelet function were discontinued 5–7 days before surgery or substituted with suitable alternatives. Each patient received peripheral intravenous access, and vital signs were continuously monitored throughout the surgical and recovery phases. Breast anesthesia involved the use of Rusciani's tumescent solution, consisting of 25 mL of 2% lidocaine, 8 mEq of sodium bicarbonate, and 1 mL of epinephrine (1 mg/1 mL) in 1000 mL of 0.9% saline solution, with a total volume of 250–350 mL per breast. Rusciani's tumescent solution differs from Klein's solution because it contains lower levels of lidocaine, reducing the risk of toxicity. The cutaneous incision site was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine containing 1:100,000 epinephrine. During the anesthesia process, the plane between the gland and the superficial fascia of the pectoralis major muscle was identified, and a spinal needle connected to a peristaltic infiltration pump was placed in this plane. The infusion was halted upon reaching an average volume of 300 mL per breast. The amount of tumescent solution administered varied based on chest size and BMI, ensuring breast turgidity and minimizing the risk of drug toxicity, particularly in patients with smaller chests and glandular tissue and lower body weights. Glandular infiltration ensured thorough anesthesia through direct contact. The initial incision was made 20 minutes later to allow for the full effect of epinephrine and lidocaine. Before anesthesia administration, the patient was positioned upright for preoperative markings and photography. Markings included the inframammary fold, sternal midline, and two small incisions on each side of the chest for introducing the liposuction cannula. These incisions were made along the anterior axillary line: one at the level of the inframammary fold and another at the superior border of the breast. A 3-mm-diameter liposuction cannula with a Mercedes tip was inserted through the inframammary incision for liposuction of the ipsilateral breast, followed by crisscross liposuction from the superior incision to disrupt the inframammary fold. This process was repeated on the opposite breast using the LipoSurg device.

### Estimated maximal safe dosages of tumescent lidocaine [^112TSjB7]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Statistical Analysis

We analyzed the data. The effect of liposuction on the systemic bioavailability of subcutaneous tumescent lidocaine was assessed by pairwise comparison of AUC∞s (paired t test) among subjects whose individual dosages of tumescent lidocaine were the same without and with liposuction.

To assure statistical independence of these observations when comparing AUC∞ without and with liposuction, if a subject had 2 tumescent infiltration procedures without liposuction, then only 1 AUC∞ measurement was used in the paired t test. When these 2 lidocaine doses without liposuction were not equal, then we chose the dose that was the same as the dose with liposuction. If a subject's 2 tumescent lidocaine doses without liposuction both equaled the dosage with liposuction, then we chose the smaller AUC∞ without liposuction. Because liposuction removes lidocaine before it can be absorbed systemically, the AUC∞ without liposuction is likely to be larger than the AUC∞ with liposuction. The choice of the smaller AUC∞ without liposuction was conservative, in the sense that it reduced the likelihood that the paired t test comparing AUC∞ without and with liposuction would incorrectly detect a significant difference between a subject's AUC∞s (type I error).

For linear regression analysis of Cmax as a function of milligram per kilogram lidocaine dosage, only 1 of the 2 dosages without liposuction was used to assure statistical independence of observations. When the milligram per kilogram doses of lidocaine without liposuction were not equal, then the smallest of the 2 doses of lidocaine was used in the linear regression analysis to maximize the range of milligram per kilogram doses. When the milligram per kilogram doses of lidocaine without liposuction were equal, then the largest of the 2 Cmax values was chosen. The choice of the larger Cmax is conservative, in the sense that it increased the estimated probability that any given milligram per kilogram dose would produce a Cmax ≥ 6 μg/mL.

We used tolerance interval analysis to estimate the probability that a future milligram per kilogram dosage of tumescent lidocaine given to an individual would result in a Cmax ≥ 6 μg/mL. – Tolerance intervals were calculated at a 99% level of confidence.

### American Society of Plastic Surgeons evidence-based clinical practice guideline revision: reduction mammaplasty [^115CahQU]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Reduction mammaplasty — Recommendation 7 on nonnarcotic postoperative pain control recommends that plastic surgeons incorporate nonnarcotic strategies for reducing postoperative pain in female patients undergoing reduction mammaplasty. Evidence grading indicates aggregate evidence quality is low and strength of recommendation is moderate, with benefits to reduce narcotic use, manage pain, reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and reduce potential for drug diversion, while risks include risk of bleeding and hematoma formation with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use and the overall benefit-harm assessment is a strong preponderance of benefit. Lidocaine tumescent infiltration studies had conflicting results, with one showing no difference in narcotic consumption (0.05 percent versus 0.35 percent). Data are much stronger for bupivacaine to lower postoperative narcotic use regardless of administration method, and all available studies demonstrated a significant decrease in postoperative intravenous or oral opioid administration compared to placebo or conventional treatment; additionally, general anesthesia with paravertebral block significantly lowered intraoperative opioid consumption versus general anesthesia without a paravertebral block in two low-quality studies. Limited evidence suggests preoperative celecoxib and gabapentin are more effective than adjunctive opioid use for reducing postoperative opioid use, and although ketorolac may reduce perioperative opioid use in other plastic surgery procedures, direct evidence in reduction mammaplasty is lacking; studies report only a slightly or minimally increased risk of hematoma with perioperative ketorolac, and further research is needed before drawing risk-to-benefit conclusions.

### Advancing reduction mammaplasty surgery: advancements and outcomes with tumescent local anaesthesia [^116fASUR]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Recovery from tumescent local anaesthesia (TLA) is generally quicker than from general anaesthesia because the latter requires the administration of strong anaesthetics that induce loss of consciousness and deep muscle relaxation. This takes time for the effects of the drugs to wear off, which can prolong recovery. TLA, on the other hand, only anaesthetises the specific area affected without affecting the patient's level of consciousness. In addition, the drugs used in TLA (such as lidocaine and adrenaline) have minimal systemic effects compared to those used in general anaesthesia. Another advantage of TLA is that it does not affect respiratory function, reducing the risk of complications such as hypoventilation or aspiration, which can delay post-operative recovery. General anaesthesia often requires intubation and mechanical ventilation, with the associated risk of post-operative respiratory complications. Surgery performed with the TLA technique allows early mobilisation, which, together with the lack of muscle relaxation associated with general anaesthesia, reduces post-operative complications such as deep vein thrombosis. No muscle relaxants were required during the procedure, maintaining muscle tone was not an obstacle. As the volume of the injected solution significantly alters the shape of the breasts, careful pre-operative marking is essential to ensure an accurate aesthetic result. In addition, patients should be thoroughly informed that post-operative breast swelling is to be expected and will persist for several weeks, initially affecting the final aesthetic result. This preparatory step is crucial for achieving optimal surgical results and for giving the patient realistic expectations regarding the immediate post-operative appearance. A comprehensive evaluation of results requires a minimum of 3 months post-operatively. This period allows for the full resolution of tissue imbibition, a process triggered by the significant volume of solution injected. During this period, the gradual resolution of tissue swelling and the stabilisation of breast contours occur, allowing a more accurate assessment of the final aesthetic results.

### Retrospective study on optimizing breast augmentation outcomes in transgender patients: a comprehensive analysis of tumescent local anesthesia technique [^113HjieQ]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Tumescent local anesthesia (TLA) involves the infusion of a saline solution containing lidocaine and epinephrine into tissues to achieve localized anesthesia and vasoconstriction. While the use of TLA in sub-glandular augmentation mammoplasty has been documented, we present a modified TLA approach for primary sub-muscular breast augmentation in transgender patients based on our experience over the past years.

Methods

Between the years 2014 and 2021, we performed primary sub-muscular breast augmentation on 20 transgender patients under TLA and conscious sedation. The tumescent solution consisted of 25 mL of 2% lidocaine, 8 mEq of sodium bicarbonate, and 1 mL of epinephrine (1 mg/1 mL) in 1000 mL of 0.9% saline solution. Initially, the solution was infiltrated between the pectoral fascia and the mammary gland, and subsequently, during the surgery, under the pectoralis major muscle.

Results

The average volume of tumescent solution infiltrated during TLA was 740 mL per breast. There were no reports of adrenaline or lidocaine toxicity, and no cases required a conversion to general anesthesia. Patients experienced no pain or discomfort during the preoperative infiltration or surgical procedure.

Reoperations due to short-term complications never occurred. We observed a major complication rate of 5%, represented by 1 hematoma. Long-term complications comprised one case of implant dislocation and one occurrence of dystrophic scar formation. No cases of capsular contracture needing reoperation, asymmetry, and implant rupture occurred. In total, one individual (5%) requested larger implants. Follow-up time ranged from 30 days to 1 years.

Conclusions

Overall, augmentation mammaplasty is a valuable choice for transgender women aiming to enhance their feminine characteristics and alleviate gender dysphoria. It is imperative for patients to conduct thorough research, grasp the potential pros and cons, and consult experienced healthcare professionals in transgender care. Additionally, tumescent local anesthesia (TLA) has proven to be a safe and efficient method for sub-muscular breast augmentation, providing effective pain control with minimal postoperative complications, resulting in high patient satisfaction.

### Estimated maximal safe dosages of tumescent lidocaine [^116DKX7u]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Among those who received 45 mg/kg tumescent lidocaine for liposuction, the mean total volume of aspirate was 2416 mL (range, 1525–3300 mL), mean volume of supernatant fat was 1863 mL (range, 1250–2900 mL), and mean volume infranatant blood-tinged anesthetic solution was 553 mL (range, 130–1100 mL).

At equal milligram per kilogram dosages of tumescent lidocaine without and with liposuction, the mean AUC∞ for serum lidocaine concentration-time profile without liposuction (56.2 μg·h/mL) was significantly higher than that with liposuction (40.7 μg·h/mL; P = 0.001). As presented in Figure 2, liposuction removed approximately 28% of the lidocaine before it could be absorbed into the systemic circulation.

Figure 2.
Comparison of serum lidocaine concentrations at sequential times over 24 h following 45 mg/kg tumescent lidocaine, without liposuction (closed circles) and with liposuction (open circles). The AUC∞ of the mean concentrations (solid line) at each time point without liposuction (56.2 μg·h/mL) is 28% greater than the AUC∞ of the mean concentrations (dashed line) with liposuction (40.7 μg·h/mL).

At equal milligram per kilogram dosages of tumescent lidocaine, the mean Cmax without liposuction 2.9 μg/mL (range, 1.2–4.4) was significantly higher than the mean Cmax with liposuction 2.38 μg/mL (range, 0.97–3.8) by the paired t test (P = 0.001). The mean Tmax without liposuction was 13.1 hours (range, 8–24), which was not significantly different from the mean Tmax with liposuction 12.5 hours (range, 8–18; P = 0.19).

### Efficacy of tumescent local anesthesia with variable lidocaine concentration in 3430 consecutive cases of liposuction [^114XECSw]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Lidocaine toxicity is a potential complication related to using tumescent local anesthesia (TLA) as the exclusive form of pain management in surgical procedures.

Objective

We sought to determine the minimum concentration of lidocaine in the tumescent solution required to provide adequate anesthesia in patients undergoing liposuction using TLA exclusively.

Methods

Liposuction using TLA exclusively was performed in 3430 procedures by the same surgeon. The initial concentration of 1000 mg/L lidocaine in the tumescent solution was gradually reduced to find the minimum required for adequate anesthesia.

Results

Adequate anesthesia was achieved using a lidocaine concentration of 500 mg/L saline in all areas treated and 400 mg/L saline for most of the areas treated.

Limitations

Data are based on the specific TLA technique used by the same surgeon. Lidocaine serum levels were not analyzed.

Conclusion

For patients undergoing liposuction using TLA exclusively, the concentration of lidocaine in the normal saline solution required for adequate anesthesia is 400 mg/L for most body areas and 500 mg/L for some sensitive areas.

### Safety of tumescent and laser-assisted liposuction: review of the literature [^1153LCVs]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Tumescent liposuction (TL) allows the removal of large volumes of fat with minimal blood loss or postoperative morbidity, excellent cosmesis, and a remarkable safety profile.

Objective

To review the literature on the safety of tumescent liposuction, liposuction under general anesthesia and laser-assisted liposuction.

Results

Aggregate safety data on liposuction under tumescent anesthesia reveals over 100,000 body areas treated with liposuction. There were no serious complications of death, emboli, hypovolemic shock, perforation of thorax or peritoneum, thrombophlebitis, seizures, or toxic reactions to drugs. In contrast, in the plastic surgery literature, liposuction under general anesthesia was associated with complications of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus, abdominal or other organ perforation, infection, and bleeding. Most recently, survey data in the European literature analyzed data showed 72 cases of severe complications from liposuction, including 23 deaths in a 5-year period from 1998 to 2002. The most frequent complications were bacterial infections such as necrotizing fasciitis, gas gangrene, and different forms of sepsis. Further causes of lethal outcome were hemorrhages, perforation of abdominal viscera, and pulmonary embolism.

Conclusion

Tumescent local anesthesia utilizing lidocaine with epinephrine allows the removal of large volumes of fat with minimal associated blood loss and postoperative morbidity.

### Advancing reduction mammaplasty surgery: advancements and outcomes with tumescent local anaesthesia [^115adLsW]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

No patient received sedation. Breast anaesthesia involved the use of tumescent solution, consisting of 25 mL of 2% lidocaine, 8 mEq of sodium bicarbonate, and 1 mL of epinephrine (1 mg/1 mL) in 1000 mL of 0.9% saline solution, with a total volume of 350 mL per breast. The standard lidocaine dosage ranged from 1.4 to 2.8 mg/kg. The amount of tumescent solution administered varied based on chest size and BMI, ensuring breast turgidity and minimising the risk of drug toxicity, particularly in patients with smaller chests and glandular tissue and lower body weights. The volume of mammary gland removed was between 160 and 250 grams.

### Optimizing gynecomastia correction surgery: efficacy and safety of tumescent local anesthesia approach [^112iEW8i]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Gynecomastia surgery, while generally safe and effective, is not without potential complications. Common risks include infection, hematoma, and seroma, which can occur postoperatively. Patients may also experience changes in nipple sensation, scarring, asymmetry, or irregular contours. More severe complications, although rare, can include necrosis of the nipple–areola complex and deep vein thrombosis. Understanding these risks is crucial for patients considering the procedure, as it underscores the importance of choosing an experienced surgeon and adhering to postoperative care guidelines to minimize potential complications. In our study, the overall complication rate was 11.7%, including both major and minor complications. Specifically, the rate of major complications (hematoma and seroma) was 6.7%, while minor complications (recurrence and NAC retraction) accounted for 5%. These findings align with existing literature on gynecomastia correction surgery using the TLA procedure. In a recent study by He et al. a fast-track approach combining tumescent anesthesia with liposuction and the pull-through technique was employed, resulting in a 5% complication rate, including seroma and superficial nipple necrosis. Another study by Mohan et al. used tumescent anesthesia with periareolar excision, reporting a 6% complication rate, which included recurrences, seromas, and hematomas. Tripathy et al. compared the outcomes of 20 patients treated with general anesthesia plus tumescent solution using either the pull-through or periareolar excision techniques. No complications were observed in the pull-through group, while two cases (10%) of hematoma were noted in the periareolar excision group. Boni reported no early postoperative complications with TLA-powered liposuction for treating enlarged male breasts, although this method is primarily effective for pseudogynecomastia. Tumescent liposuction, initially described by Klein, was combined with periareolar excision in our approach for several reasons. This technique is simple and effective, eliminates the need for drainage due to minimal tissue injury and careful hemostasis, and reduces postoperative complications. Additionally, the absence of drains significantly decreased recovery time, allowing patients to resume normal activities sooner.

### Estimated maximal safe dosages of tumescent lidocaine [^111MCXto]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

The association between the milligram per kilogram dosage of tumescent lidocaine and the subsequent peak serum lidocaine concentrations (Cmax) was analyzed both without and with liposuction. The data confirmed our hypothesis that there is a close linear relationship between the milligram per kilogram dosage of tumescent lidocaine without liposuction and Cmax. Thus, an increased milligram per kilogram dosage of tumescent lidocaine is associated with an increased risk of toxicity.

Liposuction removes lidocaine before it can be absorbed and thus reduces the correlation between the milligram per kilogram dosage of tumescent lidocaine liposuction and Cmax. With liposuction, an estimate of the maximum safe dosage of tumescent lidocaine is less reliable than without liposuction. Years of worldwide experience have shown that 55 mg/kg tumescent lidocaine for liposuction is remarkably safe. This dosage is safe most of the time. Multiple large surveys involving thousands of procedures have found no evidence of tumescent lidocaine toxicity at recommended dosages. – However, 55 mg/kg may be too risky if lidocaine absorption is too rapid (failure to add epinephrine to the solution of tumescent lidocaine) or if lidocaine metabolism is too slow (diabetes, adverse interactions with drugs that inhibit the hepatic microsomal isoenzymes cytochrome P450 3A4 and 1A2 such as erythromycin, sertraline, fluconazole or ciprofloxacin, propofol, or general anesthesia) or if patients have very low serum protein concentrations or if surgery is cancelled before liposuction can be completed. Based on the present data and considerable worldwide experience, we believe that 45 mg/kg is a safe and prudent maximum dosage of tumescent lidocaine for liposuction. Furthermore, 45 mg/kg is less likely than 55 mg/kg to permit excessive amounts of liposuction.

### Low osmolality and shear stress during liposuction impair cell viability in autologous fat grafting [^112z7JGQ]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Liposuction and subsequent autologous fat grafting have become essential techniques for fat augmentation in plastic surgery. However, standard harvesting techniques that ensure the survival of adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells and thus preserve the transplanted fat volume are lacking. In particular, the effect of different parameters of the tumescent solution has not been studied in this context. We hypothesized that the osmolality of the tumescent solution could have a significant effect on the survival of adipocytes and SVF cells.

Methods

We developed two distinct in vitro models based on freshly harvested excision fat from patients undergoing surgical treatment. First, we investigated the effect of osmolality by incubating excision fat in different tumescent solutions and analyzed the total cell survival and the differentiation potential of SVF cells. Vital whole-mount staining, isolation yield of SVF cells, clonogenicity, and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacities were analyzed. Second, we addressed the additional effect of mechanical stress by simulating a liposuction on pieces of excision fat after incubation with the tumescent solutions.

Results

Osmolality of the tumescent solution by itself did not have a significant effect on adipocyte and SVF viability or SVF differentiation. However, when osmolality was combined with liposuction, a significant trend toward lower viability and more lipid droplets with lower osmolality was observed. Especially, SVF viability was significantly lower after liposuction with a hypotonic (150 mOsm/kg) solution.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates the considerable effect of osmolality during liposuction and may lead to the development of "cell-protective" tumescent solutions.
