## Question

What is the target A1C level for most adults with type 2 diabetes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the target A1C level should be for most adults with type 2 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which major guidelines speak to a "typical" or "most patients" A1C target. Then, I should verify where there is consensus versus controversy. Next, I will consider how individualization modifies the default target. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically grounded answer with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the mainstream position. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Care 2025 recommends an HbA1c goal of less than 7% for many nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes, provided it can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or excessive treatment burden, which functions as the conventional default for most patients [^116uj2d1] [^114UCmQQ].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for that 7% target. The ADA's recommendation is grounded in randomized trials showing that lowering A1C to around or below 7% reduces microvascular complications, with long-term observational follow-up suggesting potential macrovascular benefits when achieved early in the disease course, which supports using < 7% as a reasonable default for many adults [^116uj2d1] [^1167fYmS].

> Hold on, I should also acknowledge the controversy. The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends a target range of 7% to 8% for most patients, arguing that more stringent targets do not clearly reduce mortality or macrovascular events and may increase harms such as hypoglycemia and polypharmacy, so a 7–8% range better balances benefits and risks in typical adults with type 2 diabetes [^114M26zM] [^113A6kBq].

> I need to check how other authorities weigh in. The VA/DoD guideline suggests an HbA1c range of 7.0–8.5% for most patients, explicitly emphasizing individualized targets based on comorbidities, complications, and life expectancy, which aligns with a more conservative default than ADA's < 7% for the average patient [^111t2kVN] [^114PdFx9]. By contrast, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) favors a more stringent target of ≤ 6.5% for most nonpregnant adults if safely achievable, reflecting a more aggressive glycemic stance in endocrinology practice [^111BPy4U] [^116ee3iZ].

> Let me consider the practical synthesis. For a typical adult with type 2 diabetes who is younger than 65, has no severe hypoglycemia, reasonable life expectancy, and manageable comorbidity, the ADA's < 7% target remains the most widely adopted default, while recognizing that ACP's 7–8% range is a reasonable, more conservative alternative when hypoglycemia risk, treatment burden, or comorbidity argue against tighter control [^116uj2d1] [^114M26zM].

> But wait, what if the patient is older, frail, or has limited life expectancy? I should confirm that guidelines consistently recommend relaxing targets in those scenarios. ADA and geriatric guidance support less stringent goals, often up to 8.0–8.5% or even 8.0–9.0% depending on frailty, comorbidity, and life expectancy, to avoid overtreatment and hypoglycemia-related harm [^114UCmQQ] [^112nSCZM] [^113ZYBmK].

> I will now examine the principle of individualization. Across ADA, VA/DoD, and AACE, targets should be tailored to age, duration of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypoglycemia risk, life expectancy, and patient preferences. More stringent targets may be appropriate in newly diagnosed, younger patients with low hypoglycemia risk, whereas less stringent targets are prudent in those with long-standing disease, established complications, or high hypoglycemia vulnerability [^114UCmQQ] [^111t2kVN] [^116ee3iZ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the VA/DoD "most patients" range was 6.0–7.0%, but that applies to a specific subgroup with longer life expectancy and minimal complications. I should correct that and affirm that VA/DoD's broader "most patients" range is 7.0–8.5%, with 6.0–7.0% reserved for carefully selected individuals who can safely achieve it [^113ZYBmK] [^111t2kVN].

> Putting this together, I should double-check the bottom line. For most nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes, a pragmatic, evidence-aligned answer is to target HbA1c less than 7% when feasible and safe, while recognizing that a target of 7–8% is a reasonable, guideline-supported alternative when individual risk, comorbidity, or hypoglycemia risk make < 7% impractical or potentially harmful. Individualization remains essential, and shared decision-making should guide the final goal [^116uj2d1] [^114M26zM] [^114UCmQQ].

---

The target A1C for most adults with type 2 diabetes is **< 7% (53 mmol/mol)** [^116uj2d1] if it can be achieved safely without significant hypoglycemia or treatment burden [^114UCmQQ]. For older adults or those with multiple comorbidities, limited life expectancy, or high hypoglycemia risk, **less stringent targets (7.0–8.0%)** are appropriate [^112nSCZM] [^116ee3iZ]. Individualization is essential [^114UCmQQ], balancing benefits and risks through shared decision-making [^112z9Yaz].

---

## General A1C target for most adults with type 2 diabetes

The ADA recommends an A1C target of **< 7% (53 mmol/mol)** for many nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes who do not experience significant hypoglycemia or treatment burden [^116uj2d1]. This target is supported by evidence that lowering A1C to < 7% reduces microvascular complications, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy [^112z9Yaz].

---

## Individualized A1C targets

While the general target is < 7%, the ADA emphasizes **individualization** based on patient-specific factors [^114UCmQQ]. Less stringent targets (7.0–8.0%) are appropriate for older adults, those with multiple comorbidities, limited life expectancy, or high hypoglycemia risk [^112nSCZM] [^113ZYBmK]. Conversely, more stringent targets (6.0–6.5%) may be considered for younger, healthier patients with a longer life expectancy and low hypoglycemia risk [^112z9Yaz].

---

## Evidence supporting the < 7% target

The < 7% target is supported by multiple randomized controlled trials and observational studies demonstrating **reduced microvascular complications** with intensive glycemic control [^112z9Yaz]. However, evidence regarding macrovascular benefits is mixed, with some studies showing no significant reduction in cardiovascular events or mortality with intensive control [^113iRTMM].

---

## Risks associated with intensive glycemic control

Intensive glycemic control carries risks, including:

- **Hypoglycemia**: Increased risk of severe hypoglycemia, particularly in older adults and those with comorbidities [^113iRTMM].
- **Weight gain**: Associated with insulin and sulfonylurea therapies [^notfound].
- **Polypharmacy**: Increased medication burden and complexity [^116WH32T].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines consistently recommend **individualized A1C targets** based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and preferences [^112z9Yaz]. The ADA, AACE, and VA/DoD guidelines all emphasize shared decision-making and periodic reassessment of targets [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Patient population** | **Recommended A1C target** |
|-|-|
| Most adults with type 2 diabetes | < 7% (53 mmol/mol) |
| Older adults, multiple comorbidities, limited life expectancy | 7.0–8.0% (53–64 mmol/mol) |
| Younger, healthier patients, low hypoglycemia risk | 6.0–6.5% (42–48 mmol/mol) |

---

The target A1C for most adults with type 2 diabetes is **< 7% (53 mmol/mol)** if it can be achieved safely, with individualization based on patient-specific factors and shared decision-making [^112z9Yaz].

### Hemoglobin A1c targets for glycemic control with pharmacologic therapy for nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a guidance statement update from the American College of Physicians [^114M26zM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians developed this guidance statement to guide clinicians in selecting targets for pharmacologic treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Methods

The National Guideline Clearinghouse and the Guidelines International Network library were searched (May 2017) for national guidelines, published in English, that addressed hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) targets for treating type 2 diabetes in nonpregnant outpatient adults. The authors identified guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement. In addition, 4 commonly used guidelines were reviewed, from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology, the American Diabetes Association, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense. The AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) instrument was used to evaluate the guidelines.

Guidance Statement 1

Clinicians should personalize goals for glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes on the basis of a discussion of benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy, patients' preferences, patients' general health and life expectancy, treatment burden, and costs of care.

Guidance Statement 2

Clinicians should aim to achieve an HbA1c level between 7% and 8% in most patients with type 2 diabetes.

Guidance Statement 3

Clinicians should consider deintensifying pharmacologic therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes who achieve HbA1c levels less than 6.5%.

Guidance Statement 4

Clinicians should treat patients with type 2 diabetes to minimize symptoms related to hyperglycemia and avoid targeting an HbA1c level in patients with a life expectancy less than 10 years due to advanced age (80 years or older), residence in a nursing home, or chronic conditions (such as dementia, cancer, end-stage kidney disease, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure) because the harms outweigh the benefits in this population.

### Effect of an intensive lifestyle intervention on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^117TF3Np]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

It is unclear whether a lifestyle intervention can maintain glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Objective

To test whether an intensive lifestyle intervention results in equivalent glycemic control compared with standard care and, secondarily, leads to a reduction in glucose-lowering medication in participants with type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, assessor-blinded, single-center study within Region Zealand and the Capital Region of Denmark (April 2015-August 2016). Ninety-eight adult participants with non-insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes who were diagnosed for less than 10 years were included. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1; stratified by sex) to the lifestyle group (n = 64) or the standard care group (n = 34).

Interventions

All participants received standard care with individual counseling and standardized, blinded, target-driven medical therapy. Additionally, the lifestyle intervention included 5 to 6 weekly aerobic training sessions (duration 30–60 minutes), of which 2 to 3 sessions were combined with resistance training. The lifestyle participants received dietary plans aiming for a body mass index of 25 or less. Participants were followed up for 12 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to 12-month follow-up, and equivalence was prespecified by a CI margin of ± 0.4% based on the intention-to-treat population. Superiority analysis was performed on the secondary outcome reductions in glucose-lowering medication.

Results

Among 98 randomized participants (mean age, 54.6 years [SD, 8.9]; women, 47 [48%]; mean baseline HbA1c, 6.7%), 93 participants completed the trial. From baseline to 12-month follow-up, the mean HbA1c level changed from 6.65% to 6.34% in the lifestyle group and from 6.74% to 6.66% in the standard care group (mean between-group difference in change of -0.26% [95% CI, -0.52% to -0.01%]), not meeting the criteria for equivalence (P = 0.15). Reduction in glucose-lowering medications occurred in 47 participants (73.5%) in the lifestyle group and 9 participants (26.4%) in the standard care group (difference, 47.1 percentage points [95% CI, 28.6–65.3]). There were 32 adverse events (most commonly musculoskeletal pain or discomfort and mild hypoglycemia) in the lifestyle group and 5 in the standard care group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with type 2 diabetes diagnosed for less than 10 years, a lifestyle intervention compared with standard care resulted in a change in glycemic control that did not reach the criterion for equivalence, but was in a direction consistent with benefit. Further research is needed to assess superiority, as well as generalizability and durability of findings.

### Hypoglycemia and diabetes: a report of a workgroup of the American diabetes association and the endocrine society [^111U3pG8]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

What are the implications of hypoglycemia on treatment targets for patients with diabetes?

The glycemic target established for any given patient should depend on the patient's age, life expectancy, comorbidities, preferences, and an assessment of how hypoglycemia might impact his or her life. This patient-centered approach requires that clinicians spend time developing an individualized treatment plan with each patient. For very young children, the risks of severe hypoglycemia on brain development may require a strategy that attempts to avoid hypoglycemia at all costs. For healthy adults with diabetes, a reasonable glycemic goal might be the lowest HbA 1c that does not cause severe hypoglycemia, preserves awareness of hypoglycemia, and results in an acceptable number of documented episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia. With current therapies, a strategy that completely avoids hypoglycemia may not be possible in patients with type 1 diabetes who strive to minimize their risks of developing the microvascular complications of the disease. However, glycemic goals might reasonably be relaxed in patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes and advanced complications or in those who are free of complications but have a limited life expectancy because of another disease process. In such patients, the glycemic goal could be to achieve glucose levels sufficiently low to prevent symptoms of hyperglycemia.

For patients with type 2 diabetes, the risk of hypoglycemia depends on the medications used. Early in the course of the disease, most patients are treated with lifestyle changes and metformin, neither of which causes hypoglycemia. Therefore, an HbA 1c of < 7% is appropriate for many patients with recent-onset type 2 diabetes. As the disease progresses, it is likely that medications that increase the risk of hypoglycemia will be added. This, plus the presence of complications or comorbidities that limit life expectancy, means that glycemic goals may need to be less aggressive. While the benefits of achieving an HbA 1c of < 7% may continue to be advocated for patients with type 2 diabetes at risk for microvascular complications and with sufficient life expectancy, less aggressive targets may be appropriate in those with known cardiovascular disease, extensive comorbidities, or limited life expectancy.

Older individuals with gait imbalance and frailty may experience a life-changing injury if they fall during a hypoglycemia episode, so avoiding hypoglycemia is paramount in such patients. Patients with cognitive dysfunction may have difficulty adhering to a complicated treatment strategy designed to achieve a low HbA 1c. Such patients will benefit from a simplification of the treatment strategy with a goal to prevent hypoglycemia as much as possible. Furthermore, the benefits of aggressive glycemic therapy in those affected are unclear.

### Association of hemoglobin A1c time in range with risk for diabetes complications [^1153aT4x]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Intervention studies are needed to determine whether sex-specific physical activity recommendations are needed as although moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity is associated with lower risk type 2 diabetes risk markers in men and women, light intensity physical activity seems to be beneficial in women only.
Diabetes increases the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications and incidence of complications appears to be increasing.
Individualized A1c targets may help management of diabetes.
Considering the amount of time in range (TIR) that an individual's A1c stays within a targeted range may be an important risk factor.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^116YSn1B]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with ASCVD/high-risk — A1C targets and treatment thresholds: A target A1C of < 6.5% in most nonpregnant adults can be used if safely achieved, whereas less stringent A1C goals (> 7%) should be adopted in specified situations. If further lowering is needed and renal function is eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m², metformin should be considered. If the initial A1C is ≥ 7.5%, early combination therapy with 2 agents may be needed, and with initial A1C > 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, 2 or 3 antihyperglycemic agents should be initiated concomitantly. If there is symptomatic hyperglycemia, an A1C > 10% and/or BG > 300 mg/dL, basal insulin should be initiated; in this scenario, a combination basal insulin with a GLP-1 RA can also be considered.

### Effect of continuous glucose monitoring on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin: a randomized clinical trial [^112c3VcS]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been shown to be beneficial for adults with type 2 diabetes using intensive insulin therapy, but its use in type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin without prandial insulin has not been well studied.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of CGM in adults with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin without prandial insulin in primary care practices.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial was conducted at 15 centers in the US (enrollment from July 30, 2018, to October 30, 2019; follow-up completed July 7, 2020) and included adults with type 2 diabetes receiving their diabetes care from a primary care clinician and treated with 1 or 2 daily injections of long- or intermediate-acting basal insulin without prandial insulin, with or without noninsulin glucose-lowering medications.

Interventions

Random assignment 2:1 to CGM (n = 116) or traditional blood glucose meter (BGM) monitoring (n = 59).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level at 8 months. Key secondary outcomes were CGM-measured time in target glucose range of 70 to 180 mg/dL, time with glucose level at greater than 250 mg/dL, and mean glucose level at 8 months.

Results

Among 175 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 57 [9] years; 88 women [50%]; 92 racial/ethnic minority individuals [53%]; mean [SD] baseline HbA1c level, 9.1% [0.9%]), 165 (94%) completed the trial. Mean HbA1c level decreased from 9.1% at baseline to 8.0% at 8 months in the CGM group and from 9.0% to 8.4% in the BGM group (adjusted difference, -0.4% [95% CI, -0.8% to -0.1%]; p = 0.02). In the CGM group, compared with the BGM group, the mean percentage of CGM-measured time in the target glucose range of 70 to 180 mg/dL was 59% vs 43% (adjusted difference, 15% [95% CI, 8% to 23%]; P < .001), the mean percentage of time at greater than 250 mg/dL was 11% vs 27% (adjusted difference, -16% [95% CI, -21% to -11%]; P < .001), and the means of the mean glucose values were 179 mg/dL vs 206 mg/dL (adjusted difference, -26 mg/dL [95% CI, -41 to -12]; P < .001). Severe hypoglycemic events occurred in 1 participant (1%) in the CGM group and in 1 (2%) in the BGM group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin without prandial insulin, continuous glucose monitoring, as compared with blood glucose meter monitoring, resulted in significantly lower HbA1c levels at 8 months.

### Dietary interventions to treat type 2 diabetes in adults with a goal of remission: an expert consensus statement from the American college of lifestyle medicine [^117AHJ9f]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission definitions — consensus statements state that remission is broadly defined as the disappearance of related signs and symptoms for a specified minimum time without excluding recurrence, and that remission requires achieving, for a specified minimum time, normal glycemic measures defined as normal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and normal fasting blood glucose with no surgery, devices, or active pharmacologic therapy for the specific purpose of lowering blood glucose; additional statements specify normal glycemic measures for at least 6 months without such interventions and that remission of T2D should be defined as HbA1c < 6.5% for at least 3 months with no surgery, devices, or active pharmacologic therapy, with consensus that remission of T2D should include a specific threshold or cut point for HbA1c and that remission of T2D requires HbA1c < 6.5%, and that remission is the optimal outcome for adults with T2D and is a realistic and achievable goal for some adults with T2D.

### Guidelines abstracted from the American Geriatrics Society guidelines for improving the care of older adults with diabetes mellitus: 2013 update [^113QouE3]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

Glycemic control targets for older adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) — target goal for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in older adults generally should be 7.5% to 8%; HbA1c between 7% and 7.5% may be appropriate if it can be safely achieved in healthy older adults with few comorbidities and good functional status, and higher HbA1c targets (8–9%) are appropriate for older adults with multiple comorbidities, poor health, and limited life expectancy; there is potential harm in lowering HbA1c to less than 6.5% in older adults with type 2 DM, and there is no evidence that using medications to achieve tight glycemic control in older adults with type 2 DM is beneficial; for adults younger than 65, using medications to achieve HbA1c levels of less than 6.5% is associated with harms, including hypoglycemia and mortality, except for reductions in MI and mortality with metformin; given the long time frame needed to achieve a reduction in microvascular complications, glycemic goals should reflect patient goals, health status, and life expectancy.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^1123awg6]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetes guidelines and organizations typically advocate a target glycated hemoglobin (A1C) value of 6.5–7.0% but highlight that glycemic management must be individualized. Whereas individualization of both glycemic targets and management is appealing to the clinician as a way of potentially maximizing benefit while minimizing risk, there is little evidence that such an approach will bring more patients to target. It may be argued that this approach could contribute to fewer patients attaining optimal glycemic targets. Nonetheless, the results of recent large outcome trials clearly highlight the fact that individual glycemic target achievement varied markedly, with some patients apparently deriving more clinical benefit and others deriving more harm. At the same time, there is ongoing evidence of a treatment gap in many surveys of clinical practice and a suggestion that algorithm-driven protocols may be more effective. Collectively, therefore, the currently available evidence suggests that algorithm-driven protocols that incorporate individualized targets based on patient characteristics designed to preserve a sound balance between the benefits and risk of good glycemic control may be an appropriate way of getting more patients to target in a safe and effective manner.

### Statement by an American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology consensus panel on type 2 diabetes mellitus: an algorithm for glycemic control [^116Vz6kN]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

This report presents an algorithm to assist primary care physicians, endocrinologists, and others in the management of adult, nonpregnant patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In order to minimize the risk of diabetes-related complications, the goal of therapy is to achieve a hemoglobin A1c (A1C) of 6.5% or less, with recognition of the need for individualization to minimize the risks of hypoglycemia. We provide therapeutic pathways stratified on the basis of current levels of A1C, whether the patient is receiving treatment or is drug naïve. We consider monotherapy, dual therapy, and triple therapy, including 8 major classes of medications (biguanides, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, incretin mimetics, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and bile acid sequestrants) and insulin therapy (basal, premixed, and multiple daily injections), with or without orally administered medications. We prioritize choices of medications according to safety, risk of hypoglycemia, efficacy, simplicity, anticipated degree of patient adherence, and cost of medications. We recommend only combinations of medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that provide complementary mechanisms of action. It is essential to monitor therapy with A1C and self-monitoring of blood glucose and to adjust or advance therapy frequently (every 2 to 3 months) if the appropriate goal for each patient has not been achieved. We provide a flow-chart and table summarizing the major considerations. This algorithm represents a consensus of 14 highly experienced clinicians, clinical researchers, practitioners, and academicians and is based on the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology Diabetes Guidelines and the recent medical literature.

### Association of hemoglobin A1c time in range with risk for diabetes complications [^116WH32T]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

We evaluated the association between A1c TIR and incidence and progression of microvascular and macrovascular complications among older Veterans with diabetes. A1c TIR is derived from A1c levels and individualized A1c target ranges that incorporate comorbidities, complications, and life expectancy. In models that controlled for patient characteristics, average A1c levels, and A1c SD, we found that lower A1c TIR is associated with greater risks of developing new microvascular and macrovascular complications and progression to more severe complications. Our prior studies showed that lower A1c TIR is also associated with increased risk of mortality and stroke/myocardial infarction. These findings suggest that A1c TIR is a potential marker of risk for major complications and mortality among older adults with diabetes. Collectively, these studies highlight that A1c stability within individualized target ranges may convey important and independent risk information beyond average A1c levels alone, and further exploration of this line of investigation is warranted.

Major clinical trials in type 2 diabetes emphasize the need to move beyond A1c levels alone as a means of assessing risk for major diabetes complications and mortality. Lower A1c per se may improve some microvascular complications but does not significantly affect macrovascular outcomes. A meta-analysis of several large trials reported that renal and retinal events may be improved with intensive control but neuropathic complications are unaffected. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study examined intensive treatment in younger patients with newly diagnosed diabetes and showed reductions in microvascular but not macrovascular events during the initial trial, although reduced cardiovascular events in the intensive treatment group were later observed after 10 years of post-trial follow-up. Despite these findings, many clinical practice guidelines still set A1c treatment goals with only upper limits, implying that a wide range of levels below that threshold are acceptable. This may expose older adults to risks of polypharmacy and potential overtreatment, such as hospitalization for hypoglycemia and falls, with uncertain benefits on risk of diabetes complications or mortality.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116xhM13]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) — 2017 VA/DoD individualized HbA1c target ranges described patient-tailored goals and tradeoffs: an "HbA1c range of 6–7% was suggested for patients with a life expectancy greater than 10–15 years and absent or mild microvascular complications, if it could be safely achieved", whereas "an HbA1c range of 7–8.5% was recommended for patients with established microvascular or macrovascular disease, comorbid conditions, or a life expectancy of 5–10 years". The Work Group noted that intensively lowering HbA1c "will reduce microvascular complications… but not other important clinical outcomes", and that any benefits are "counterbalanced by an increased risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, and, in one trial, all-cause mortality".

### Diabetic retinopathy preferred practice pattern ® [^114TqfYk]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic Retinopathy PPP — glycemic targets for type 2 diabetes in nonpregnant outpatient adults should be individualized, as guideline reviewers found that "the ideal target that optimally balances benefits and harms remains uncertain", and "their four guidance statements emphasize the importance of personalizing the glycemic goals in patients with type 2 diabetes on the basis of the benefits/harms balance of pharmacotherapy, patient preference, and life expectancy". For most patients, "they suggest an HbA1c (hemoglobin A1c) goal range of 7% to 8%", while "more stringent targets may be appropriate for patients who have a long life expectancy (> 15 years)", and "a target in the lower end of the range (7%) applied best to patients with newly diagnosed diabetes and those without substantial diabetes-related complications".

### Personalized management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: reflections from a diabetes care editors' expert forum [^113Us1wV]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Accordingly, these trials and their subsequent analyses raised important questions about rigid, algorithm-based, "glucocentric" approaches to therapy. One message, then, is that "one size does not fit all" for glucose targets, choice of therapy, or number of therapies used in combination. However, some questions pertinent to personalization remain unanswered. What were the characteristics of the small group of individuals in ACCORD who failed to respond to further glucose-lowering therapy but who contributed much of the excess case fatality? Similarly, what can these studies teach us about patients who benefitted most from the interventions? Gaining insight into the pathophysiological, genetic, lifestyle, adherence, comorbidity, or other factors responsible for these disparate responses could improve our ability to effectively personalize therapy.

The 2012 ADA/EASD position statement still recommends an A1C goal of < 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol) for most individuals with type 2 diabetes if it can be achieved safely in low-risk individuals with early diabetes or a relatively long life expectancy; it suggests an acceptance of higher A1C targets for individuals with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, long-standing diabetes, or advanced micro- and macrovascular complications. Prior guidelines from multiple organizations included recommendations about setting personalized glycemic targets based on phenotype and empirically matching "the right drugs to the right patients", but without hard evidence to substantiate such an approach. Personalized treatment was articulated more vigorously in the new position statement.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114PdFx9]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) glycemic targets — We suggest an HbA1c range of 7.0–8.5% for most patients, if it can be safely achieved (Weak for | Not reviewed, Amended). We suggest setting an individualized HbA1c target range based on the clinician's appraisal of the risk benefit ratio, patient characteristics, presence or absence of T2DM, comorbidities, and life expectancy. The discussion notes intensive control as targets such as HbA1c < 7.0%. Supporting evidence cited includes a Cochran review of 20 trials (n = 29,986) reporting no significant difference between intensive and conventional glucose control for all-cause mortality but reduced risk of amputation and microvascular diseases in the intensive treatment arm, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low.

For patients in whom A1C/eAG and measured blood glucose appear discrepant, clinicians should consider the possibilities of hemoglobinopathy or altered red cell turnover and the options of more frequent and/or different timing of SMBG or use of CGM. Other measures of chronic glycemia such as fructosamine are available, but their linkage to average glucose and their prognostic significance are not as clear as is the case for A1C.

2. Glycemic goals in adults

Lowering A1C to below or around 7% has been shown to reduce microvascular and neuropathic complications of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, for microvascular disease prevention, the A1C goal for nonpregnant adults in general is < 7%. (A)
In type 1 and type 2 diabetes, randomized controlled trials of intensive versus standard glycemic control have not shown a significant reduction in CVD outcomes during the randomized portion of the trials. Long-term follow-up of the DCCT and UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) cohorts suggests that treatment to A1C targets below or around 7% in the years soon after the diagnosis of diabetes is associated with long-term reduction in risk of macrovascular disease. Until more evidence becomes available, the general goal of < 7% appears reasonable for many adults for macrovascular risk reduction. (B)
Subgroup analyses of clinical trials such as the DCCT and UKPDS and the microvascular evidence from the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial suggest a small but incremental benefit in microvascular outcomes with A1C values closer to normal. Therefore, for selected individual patients, providers might reasonably suggest even lower A1C goals than the general goal of < 7%, if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Such patients might include those with short duration of diabetes, long life expectancy, and no significant CVD. (B)
Conversely, less stringent A1C goals than the general goal of < 7% may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, extensive comorbid conditions, and those with longstanding diabetes in whom the general goal is difficult to attain despite DSME, appropriate glucose monitoring, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents including insulin.

2 CHALLENGES IN ACHIEVING WEIGHT AND GLYCAEMIC TARGETS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH T2D

2.1 Difficulty of reaching glycaemic targets

Getting T2D under control by reaching the glycaemic targets proves challenging for many patients. Typically, 40%–60% of people with T2D across several geographic regions and in both low‐ and higher‐income countries have suboptimal glycaemic control. Despite the accelerated rate of introduction of new medicine classes since the mid‐1990s, the percentage of people reaching the HbA1c targets of < 7% has not substantially increased. Furthermore, reliance on pharmacotherapies only often fails to optimize glycaemic control. Despite the availability of insulin‐based therapies, roughly up to three quarters of patients failed to reach glycaemic targets. Long‐term maintenance of initial HbA1c level reduction proved an additional challenge when addressing glycaemic targets likely due to the progressive nature of beta‐cell dysfunction over time. Over a 10‐year period, a very modest improvement of 0.2 percentage points in HbA1c was demonstrated in T2D patients.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^111r8rbc]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Further analysis of ACCORD data has supported individualization of A1C targets. Thus, it appears that contrary to expectation, whereas hypoglycemia was higher in the intensively managed group, in both groups, more hypoglycemia was found at higher rather than at lower A1C levels. Hypoglycemia could not be found to be associated with risk of mortality. Furthermore, the death risk was associated with higher A1C and failure of the A1C to improve in the intensive group, with patients achieving lower A1C and falling to target levels faster doing better. This suggests that pursuing tight glucose control targets in those in whom it proves difficult to improve A1C is associated with higher death risk, even if insulin and oral agents are used appropriately.

This need for individualization according to what can be achieved is underlined by the actual A1C results in ACCORD (Fig. 1). In the standard therapy group, for example, < 50% of participants were within the target range of 7.0–7.9% at any one time, with some below and some above.

Further support for this notion comes from the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release and Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial, which compared intensive management (target A1C ≤ 6.5%) versus standard control (local guidelines) in patients at baseline ≥ 55 years of age with mean A1C of 7.5% who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at ≥ 30 years of age and had a history of major macrovascular or microvascular disease or at least one other risk factor for vascular disease. Better mean A1C levels were noted at the end of the median 5-year follow-up in the intensive control (6.5%) versus the standard control (7.3%) group. However, whereas all-cause and CV mortality appeared to be relatively reduced by 22 and 25%, respectively, for every 1% reduction in A1C, patients in the intensive care group also demonstrated more severe hypoglycemic episodes (2.7 vs. 1.5%, hazard ratio 1.86, 95% CI 1.42–2.40, P < 0.001), significantly more weight gain (0.7 kg difference, P < 0.0001), and higher incidences of any-cause hospitalizations (44.9 vs. 42.8%, P = 0.03).

### Individualizing targets and tactics for high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes: practical lessons from ACCORD and other cardiovascular trials [^1165nwTu]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Testable hypotheses

Like those of other commentators, our views derive from secondary or exploratory analyses and thus are based on hypotheses. Here we highlight three hypotheses that deserve further investigation.

A physiological hypothesis

Hypoglycemic preconditioning underlies the ACCORD paradox. Severe hypoglycemia is most dangerous when it is an isolated event. Repeated mild hypoglycemia reduces the risk of arrhythmias and other serious consequences of subsequent severe hypoglycemia.

A behavioral hypothesis

Failure to respond quickly to usual treatment predicts increased risk. If 4–12 months of evidence-based treatment does not reduce A1C at least 0.5%, reassessing targets and tactics will reduce risk.

A health system hypothesis

Failure to maintain A1C goals within a selected target range by algorithm-based tactics increases risks and calls for personalized treatment by specialized personnel. Integrating an algorithm-driven primary care system with a diabetes specialty group by automatic triggers for personalized attention will improve medical outcomes and reduce costs.

In summary, A1C < 7% remains a target for some people with long-duration diabetes, but those at highest risk should be identified and assigned different goals, usually a target range between 7 and 8%. High risk status can be identified by baseline characteristics or by failure to rapidly improve control with standard therapies. Individuals not maintaining appropriate A1C goals with algorithmic treatment may benefit from a personalized regimen with structured follow-up. These tentative conclusions are based on testable hypotheses.

### ACP calls for moderate glycemic control in type 2 diabetes… [^111AAVsm]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

March 09, 2018, 08: 39 am Chris Crawford – On March 6, the American College of Physicians published new evidence-based guidance statements in Annals of Internal Medicine that focus on loosening glycemic control targets. The ACP recommended patients with type 2 diabetes be treated to achieve a hemoglobin A1c level between 7 percent and 8 percent rather than the widely accepted range of 6. 5 percent to 7 percent. "The evidence shows that for most people with type 2 diabetes, achieving an A1c between 7 percent and 8 percent will best balance long-term benefits with harms such as low blood sugar, medication burden and costs. " Noting the policy implications of its recommendations, the ACP suggested that any physician performance measures developed to evaluate quality of care should not have a target HbA1c level below 8 percent for any patient population and should not have any HbA1c targets for elderly adults or younger individuals with limited life expectancy because of other serious diseases or illnesses. Clinicians should personalize goals for glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes based on a discussion of benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy, patients' preferences, patients' general health and life expectancy, treatment burden, and costs of care. Guidance Statement 1: Clinicians should aim to achieve an HbA1c level between 7 percent and 8 percent in most patients with type 2 diabetes. Guidance Statement 2: AAFP News that family physicians should use a patient-centered approach with patients who have type 2 diabetes when discussing the risks and benefits of HbA1c at different target levels. Until now, said Boltri, most family physicians usually have set a target HbA1c at 7 percent, unless patients are older and their life expectancy is shorter.

The new ACP guidance statements might allow family physicians to relax their goals, especially in patients for whom achieving 7 percent isn't a reasonable goal, he noted. "If a patient with type 2 diabetes' A1c is starting out at 8 or 7. 5 percent, less than 7 percent might be a good target, " Boltri explained. "If A1c is starting at 13 percent, getting to less than 7 percent is probably unreasonable; shooting for 7 percent to 8 percent is probably a lot more reasonable in those patients".

We recommend that in patients with type 2 diabetes, a range of HbA1c 7.0–8.5% is appropriate for most individuals with established microvascular or macrovascular disease, comorbid conditions, or 5–10 years life expectancy, if it can be safely achieved. We suggest a target HbA1c range of 8.0–9.0% for patients with type 2 diabetes with life expectancy < 5 years, significant comorbid conditions, advanced complications of diabetes, or difficulties in self-management attributable to e.g., mental status, disability or other factors such as food insecurity and insufficient social support.

### Optimal management of type 2 diabetes: the evidence [^111oZQ9e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the evidence in relation to the optimal target for HbA1c and outlines a global treatment algorithm for people with type 2 diabetes. While most guidelines recommend a general HbA1c target of 7%, recent large scale intervention studies have examined the potential benefits of lower targets. These studies have generally shown that lower HbA1c targets provide no macrovascular benefits and limited effects on microvascular complications while increasing rates of hypoglycaemia. Overall these studies do not support a general HbA1c target lower than 7.0%. However an individual's HbA1c target should be set and reviewed taking into account treatment benefits, safety, and tolerability. This may mean that an HbA1c target lower than 7% is appropriate for some when it can be easily and safely achieved but equally a higher HbA1c target may be appropriate in others. Clinicians and consumers are fortunate in having a wide range of pharmacological agents available to treat hyperglycaemia, however access to many of these options is limited in many middle and low income countries. Developing treatment algorithms is complex for several reasons. The major limitation is the limited evidence base for choosing particular treatment options or combinations of medications. However it is possible to derive a generic evidence-informed consensus algorithm which considers availability, access and cost of medications which can be adapted for local country use.

### Individualizing glycemic targets in type 2 diabetes mellitus: implications of recent clinical trials [^1171Uhw4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

One of the first steps in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is setting glycemic goals. Professional organizations advise setting specific hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) targets for patients, and individualization of these goals has more recently been emphasized. However, the operational meaning of glycemic goals, and specific methods for individualizing them, have not been well-described. Choosing a specific HbA(1c) target range for a given patient requires taking several factors into consideration, including an assessment of the patient's risk for hyperglycemia-related complications versus the risks of therapy, all in the context of the overall clinical setting. Comorbid conditions, psychological status, capacity for self-care, economic considerations, and family and social support systems also play a key role in the intensity of therapy. The individualization of HbA(1c) targets has gained more traction after recent clinical trials in older patients with established type 2 diabetes mellitus failed to show a benefit from intensive glucose-lowering therapy on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. The limited available evidence suggests that near-normal glycemic targets should be the standard for younger patients with relatively recent onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus and little or no micro- or macrovascular complications, with the aim of preventing complications over the many years of life. However, somewhat higher targets should be considered for older patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and evidence of CVD (or multiple CVD risk factors). This review explores these issues further and proposes a framework for considering an appropriate and safe HbA(1c) target range for each patient.

### Current strategies for evaluating, monitoring, and treating type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111HbxMX]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic progressive disease that has profound consequences for individuals, families, and society. Despite clear glycemic control targets articulated by the major medical societies, patients and physicians still struggle to meet and maintain these goals, leading to shortfalls in delivery of care. Recent advances in the treatment of type 2 diabetes seek to address these shortfalls: Modern oral hypoglycemic agents may be used with or in place of traditional therapies. Analogue insulins, whose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties allow patients improved lifestyle flexibility compared with regular insulins, have done much to improve glycemic control. Using these new classes of therapy, physicians should strive to help patients understand and reach the targets for control that we know to be beneficial for the majority of individuals. Such targets include those for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), but increasingly we also realize the central importance of maintaining postprandial glucose levels within recommended limits, and it is likely that the recent introduction of a serum marker for this purpose, 1,5-anhydroglucitol, will help improve patient outcomes. By intensifying therapy early during the course of the disease process, using the most effective and acceptable therapies available, and maintaining the lowest and safest HbA1c levels for as long as possible, we will be serving our patients well and living up to our responsibilities as diabetes care physicians.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^1151qPSn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Today's guidelines not only generally have the proviso that patients who do not meet the A1C goal be followed every 2–3 months to enable adjustment of the ongoing treatment regimen, but also indicate that clinical judgment should be individually tailored. However, this case-by-case approach may not be the best practice tactic for the vast majority of patients, since the progressive nature of diabetes demands prompt and consistent therapeutic attention.

A well-controlled A1C of < 7.0% with oral monotherapy for up to 3 years is typically achieved by ~50% of type 2 diabetic patients. It has been suggested that this unsatisfactory outcome is partly the consequence of first-line therapy being begun only after A1C reaches levels higher than those at which the expected glucose-lowering from monotherapy could be expected to return glucose control to target levels. This result has been attributed in part to physicians — both specialists and those in primary care — not being well prepared for early interventions and therefore often missing the critical window to launch effective management. Despite poor and worsening A1C, many people are kept on the same medications, thus aggravating their glycemic burden and risking worsening health problems. Interestingly, a recent survey of awareness and attitudes in eight countries found that 51% of patients had never heard of A1C and that > 10% of physicians measured it less than once a year.

Before the recent enhanced focus on more structured guidelines with specific recommended A1C targets, diabetes management with antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy was often inadequate, with appropriate changes in medical regimens implemented only when A1C levels were > 9.0% and/or several months to years after ascertaining that A1C readings were higher than acceptable. As a result of incremental treatment not keeping abreast with degenerating glycemic status (Fig. 2) and most individuals who managed to successfully achieve recommended A1C targets demonstrating an inability to maintain glycemic status, glycemic burden was unnecessarily extended in parallel with a substantial increase in CV risk. For example, Alvarez Guisasola et al. reported that 26% of the 2,025 people that they monitored from seven European countries had an average A1C of 7.2% after 2.6 years of metformin-sulfonylurea or metformin-thiazolidinedione combinations. After 5 years, 20% of the 176 patients with A1C assessments were under control (mean A1C 7.4%), with 30% of this subgroup on insulin, resonating the often-observed temporal decline in glycemic management.

American Geriatrics Society — glycemic targets in older adults with diabetes — states: "Avoid using medications to achieve hemoglobin A1c < 7.5% in most adults age 65 and older; moderate control is generally better". The rationale indicates "There is no evidence that using medications to achieve tight glycemic control in older adults with type 2 diabetes is beneficial" and that "using medications to achieve glycated hemoglobin levels less than 7% is associated with harms, including higher mortality rates". It further notes "Tight control has been consistently shown to produce higher rates of hypoglycemia in older adults". Suggested targets are specified: "Reasonable glycemic targets would be 7.0–7.5% in healthy older adults with long life expectancy, 7.5–8.0% in those with moderate comorbidity and a life expectancy < 10 years, and 8.0–9.0% in those with multiple morbidities and shorter life expectancy".

### Empirically establishing blood glucose targets to achieve HbA1c goals [^115GpKbF]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recent diabetes management guidelines specify that treatment goals should be individualized based on age, comorbidities, and duration of disease, with an American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes goal of < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) or American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) goal of ≤ 6.5% (≤ 48 mmol/mol) in otherwise healthy patients. Although HbA 1c is the target, it is measured once every 3 months, and day-to-day self-management of diabetes to achieve and maintain the individualized target HbA 1c is facilitated by self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) values, especially in patients treated with insulin. To achieve the recommended HbA 1c goals, the ADA, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the AACE, and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) have recommend SMBG targets (Table 1), the origins of which are obscure but appear to be based predominantly on expert opinion. As a result, there is wide variation in the recommended SMBG targets to achieve a HbA 1c < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) and little to guide clinicians and patients on how to achieve other, individualized, targets.

Summary of current SMBG targets

We sought to determine the average fasting, postprandial, and bedtime glucose values, based on empirical data, to achieve and maintain target HbA 1c levels in the outpatient setting.

### Individualizing targets and tactics for high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes: practical lessons from ACCORD and other cardiovascular trials [^117DVRPF]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

This realization has been sobering, but the unexpected occurrence of higher mortality accompanying the intensive treatment strategy in ACCORD has led to even greater concern and much commentary. Earlier diagnosis and better early treatment to forestall both microvascular and CV complications deserve consideration, but this is beyond the scope of this review. However, an equally pressing question is how best to treat people with long-term T2DM and established CV risk factors. The main proposals from various commentaries include the following: 1) individualize therapeutic targets and tactics for different groups of patients with type 2 diabetes; 2) reduce the intensity of treatment for high-risk people by aiming to keep A1C between 7 and 8% — the target range for the standard treatment group in ACCORD; and 3) consider older age, longer duration of diabetes, presence of known CV disease or other major illness, and prior severe hypoglycemic events as important predictors of risk. A statement of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) regarding therapeutic targets reads as follows: "Less stringent A1C goals (such as < 8%) may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, and extensive comorbid conditions, and those with longstanding diabetes in whom the general goal is difficult to attain despite DSME [diabetes self-management education], appropriate glucose monitoring, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents including insulin". A more recent statement of the ADA together with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) extends this statement by emphasizing the need to adapt therapeutic tactics for a given patient: "In a shared decision-making approach, clinician and patient act as partners, mutually exchanging information and deliberating on options, in order to reach a consensus on the therapeutic course of action". Another recent description of individualizing therapeutic tactics for specific patients also deserves repeating here: "Strategies to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia while improving glycemic control include addressing the problem of hypoglycemia at each patient contact, applying the principles of aggressive therapy through education of patients, encouraging frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose, setting up flexible regimens of treatment with insulin or other drugs and providing individualized glycemic goals and ongoing professional support, and considering both the conventional risk factors for hypoglycemia and the risk factors for hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure".

### Advances and counterpoints in type 2 diabetes. what is ready for translation into real-world practice, ahead of the guidelines [^116eaHkz]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This review seeks to address major gaps and delays between our rapidly evolving body of knowledge on type 2 diabetes and its translation into real-world practice. Through updated and improved best practices informed by recent evidence and described herein, we stand to better attain A1c targets, help preserve beta cell integrity and moderate glycemic variability, minimize treatment-emergent hypoglycemia, circumvent prescribing to "treatment failure", and prevent long-term complications. The first topic addressed in this review concerns updates in the 2023 and 2024 diabetes treatment guidelines for which further elaboration can help facilitate integration into routine care. The second concerns advances in diabetes research that have not yet found their way into guidelines, though they are endorsed by strong evidence and are ready for real-world use in appropriate patients. The final theme addresses lingering misconceptions about the underpinnings of type 2 diabetes-fundamental fallacies that continue to be asserted in the textbooks and continuing medical education upon which physicians build their approaches. A corrected and up-to-date understanding of the disease state is essential for practitioners to both conceptually and translationally manage initial onset through late-stage type 2 diabetes.

Interpretation and conclusions

Both the published reports and our own observations from ACCORD have influenced our view of managing high-risk patients with T2DM. Although the very ambitious 6% A1C target in ACCORD was not reached by most participants seeking it, the success of half of them in maintaining A1C at 6.4% or less for up to 6 years was a considerable accomplishment. It showed that even with treatment methods that are already obsolescent, near-normal glycemic control was often possible when necessary resources were provided. However, this achievement often depended on systematic individualization of tactics.

The 1.1% reduction of A1C beyond the 7.5% median level maintained by the standard strategy led to improvements in retinopathy and albuminuria, nonfatal MI, and age-related loss of brain volume. These desirable changes support the hypothesis from epidemiological data that reducing A1C can improve some medical outcomes even in this high-risk population. The meta-analyses including data from other trials reinforce this conclusion. At the same time, evidence for an excess of all-cause and CV mortality in ACCORD cannot be dismissed. Isolated severe hypoglycemia at present appears the leading candidate for a mediating cause of the excess mortality, but other potential factors have not been excluded and current evidence is indirect and inconclusive.

The problem, then, is weighing benefit versus risk. We do not believe current evidence justifies abandoning the general goal of attaining A1C < 7%. Rather, individualization of both targets and tactics is needed to minimize risks. Three separate strategies emerge from experience in ACCORD (Table 1).

Table 1
Proposed indicators of need to individualize therapeutic targets or tactics for high-risk type 2 diabetes

Individualizing the A1C target before treatment

As generally agreed, patients with the prominent risk factors emphasized in the ADA and ADA/EASD statements (notably, long-duration diabetes, severe vascular complications, short life expectancy, prior severe hypoglycemia) should not seek A1C < 7%, but rather the range from 7 to 8%. These characteristics should be more specifically defined, but the principle is clear. Individuals without these warning signs might still begin efforts to reach A1C < 7%.

This guidance statement is derived from other organizations' guidelines and is based on an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the available guidelines. We used the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation in Europe (AGREE) appraisal instrument to evaluate the guidelines from various organizations. On the basis of the review of the available guidelines, we recommend: STATEMENT 1: To prevent microvascular complications of diabetes, the goal for glycemic control should be as low as is feasible without undue risk for adverse events or an unacceptable burden on patients. Treatment goals should be based on a discussion of the benefits and harms of specific levels of glycemic control with the patient. A hemoglobin A1c level less than 7% based on individualized assessment is a reasonable goal for many but not all patients. STATEMENT 2: The goal for hemoglobin A1c level should be based on individualized assessment of risk for complications from diabetes, comorbidity, life expectancy, and patient preferences. STATEMENT 3: We recommend further research to assess the optimal level of glycemic control, particularly in the presence of comorbid conditions.

The number of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients achieving, and even more importantly, maintaining glycemic target is limited. No specific data are available, but in the UKPDS, which comprised only newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients with no previous CV events, average A1C was ∼7%. This threshold value, however, was not maintained for > 4 years, and more recent data indicated that < 50% of this patient population is at target. Therefore, effective treatment for type 2 diabetes would require an early and effective intervention, though flexible enough to ensure longstanding metabolic control. To set new paradigms of treatment, strategies should be elaborated that identify and overcome current limitations. Many hurdles may hamper the possibility of a greater number of patients achieving target, and a tentative list of such factors is given in Table 1 and discussed in this article.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^1167fYmS]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

For patients in whom A1C/eAG and measured blood glucose appear discrepant, clinicians should consider the possibilities of hemoglobinopathy or altered red cell turnover and the options of more frequent and/or different timing of SMBG or use of CGM. Other measures of chronic glycemia such as fructosamine are available, but their linkage to average glucose and their prognostic significance are not as clear as is the case for A1C.

2. Glycemic goals in adults

Lowering A1C to below or around 7% has been shown to reduce microvascular and neuropathic complications of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, for microvascular disease prevention, the A1C goal for nonpregnant adults in general is < 7%. (A)
In type 1 and type 2 diabetes, randomized controlled trials of intensive versus standard glycemic control have not shown a significant reduction in CVD outcomes during the randomized portion of the trials. Long-term follow-up of the DCCT and UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) cohorts suggests that treatment to A1C targets below or around 7% in the years soon after the diagnosis of diabetes is associated with long-term reduction in risk of macrovascular disease. Until more evidence becomes available, the general goal of < 7% appears reasonable for many adults for macrovascular risk reduction. (B)
Subgroup analyses of clinical trials such as the DCCT and UKPDS, and evidence for reduced proteinuria in the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial suggest a small but incremental benefit in microvascular outcomes with A1C values closer to normal. Therefore, for selected individual patients, providers might reasonably suggest even lower A1C goals than the general goal of < 7%, if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Such patients might include those with short duration of diabetes, long life expectancy, and no significant CVD. (B)
Conversely, less-stringent A1C goals than the general goal of < 7% may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, and extensive comorbid conditions and those with longstanding diabetes in whom the general goal is difficult to attain despite diabetes self-management education, appropriate glucose monitoring, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents including insulin.

### Association of hemoglobin A1c stability with mortality and diabetes complications in older adults with diabetes [^112XMeq8]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The relationship between chronic hyperglycemia and diabetes complications is complex. Several lines of evidence suggest that both the level of hemoglobin A1c (A1c) and its variability over time have clinical implications. Targeting A1c to < 7.0% in type 2 diabetes reduces the risk of microvascular complications but does not impact cardiovascular disease (CVD) or mortality, and there is a non-linear association between average A1c and mortality. Increased A1c variability is also associated with higher risk of CVD and mortality independent of A1c levels.

Many guidelines for treating older adults with diabetes recommend adjusting A1c goals based on life expectancy, comorbidities, and complications. In particular, the 2017 VA Department of Defense clinical practice guideline identifies specific A1c target ranges based on these clinical factors. However, clinicians and patients often focus on avoiding A1c upper limits without considering the risks and benefits of lower A1c levels. In addition, treatment decisions may be based on the most recent A1c level with less attention paid to its stability over time. This leads to many older adults being potentially overtreated, exposing them to polypharmacy, hypoglycemia risk, and increased A1c variability.

We developed a clinical measure that incorporates A1c levels and their stability over time, A1c time in range (TIR). A1c TIR represents the percentage of time that A1c levels fall within guideline-directed target rangesover a 3-year period. We showed that higher A1c TIR is associated with lower risk of mortality and macrovascular and microvascular complications independent of A1c mean and SD. However, patients with low A1c TIR may have patterns composed of varying times when A1c levels are mostly above, below, or fluctuating around their target ranges. Therefore, we evaluated the risks of mortality and macrovascular and microvascular complications among older adults with diabetes based on having A1c levels mostly within, above, or below their patient-specific target ranges.

Table 1
Summary of guidelines and HbA1c % targets for hypoglycaemic drug treatments in older adults

ADL, activities of daily living; bADL, basic activities of daily living (e.g. self-care abilities such as dressing, mobility, bathing and toileting); iADL, instrumental activities of daily living (e.g. abilities to maintain an independent household such as shopping, meal preparation, taking medication and handling finances); CVD, cardiovascular disease; CKD, chronic kidney disease; DM, diabetes mellitus; HbA1c, haemoglobin A1C.

Haemoglobin A1C targets

A specific HbA1c target for older adults was provided in 15 (71.4%) of the 21 CPGs that provided recommendations for older adults, while 1 (4.8%) suggested relaxing HbA1c targets in older adults, 1 (4.8%) suggested lower targets and 4 (19%) provided no specific guidance regarding HbA1c targets in this population (Table 1; Figure 2). Twelve CPGs provided an HbA1c target for healthier older adults, including those with a low disease burden or longer life expectancy, with the majority suggesting similar targets to the general population (< 7.0% to 7.5%). HbA1c targets varied for individuals with multiple comorbidities, shortened life expectancy, cognitive impairment, impairments in ADL and/or longer duration of diabetes. For these populations, most CPGs suggested an HbA1c target of ≤ 8.0%, or ≤ 8.5%–8.6%, while one CPG recommended an HbA1c of ≤ 9.0% (Table 1). A specific HbA1c range for patients who are frail was provided by 6 (42.9%) of the 14 CPGs that mentioned frailty. HbA1c targets for frail individuals ranged from 7.0% to 8.5%, and one CPG stated that targets should be individualised in this population.

### Public health implications of recommendations to individualize glycemic targets in adults with diabetes [^1132N5ii]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

For nearly a decade, diabetes care guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) have recommended that the goal of glycemic control should be to lower the A1C to < 7.0% for adults living with diabetes. This recommendation currently motivates diabetes public health programs and diabetes care translational research. All of these efforts have the overall intention of shifting the national distribution of A1C levels downward in order to improve diabetes outcomes and may lead to overtreatment of A1C levels in certain diabetes populations.

Although the standard A1C target of < 7.0% is probably the best-known feature of the ADA guidelines, the ADA guidelines also recommend that A1C targets should be based on individual clinical circumstances. Similar recommendations for individualized targets have been supported by the Veterans Health Administration-Department of Defense (VA-DoD), American Geriatric Society, American College of Physicians (ACP), and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE). Recommendations to individualize targets are based on major type 2 diabetes trials that found different levels of benefit, and even harm, from lower A1C levels depending on diabetes population characteristics (e.g. duration of diabetes, age, and comorbidity). According to the ADA, lower A1C targets are recommended for patients with a short duration of diabetes, long life expectancy, and no significant cardiovascular disease. Conversely, higher A1C targets are recommended for patients with longstanding diabetes, advanced age, limited life expectancy, a history of macrovascular or advanced microvascular complications, extensive comorbidities, or a high risk for severe hypoglycemia. Although guidelines have identified these special populations, recommendations on how to set individualized A1C targets have been open to interpretation.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1142jopc]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Glycemic management — HbA1c targets in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are described as uncertain regarding which patient characteristics would yield greater benefits than harms with lower target ranges, though there are valid reasons to speculate greater net benefit in younger, newly diagnosed patients with minimal or no T2DM complications, longer life expectancy, or low hypoglycemia risk medications. Trial design, conduct, and demographic limitations hinder definitive conclusions for specific subgroups, and additional research is needed to determine whether particular subsets achieve a favorable balance of benefits and harms by targeting lower HbA1c ranges.

### Cost-effectiveness of alternative thresholds of the fasting plasma glucose test to identify the target population for type 2 diabetes prevention in adults aged ≥ 45 years [^1115J3No]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is an intermediate state of hyperglycemia in which fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels do not meet the criteria for diabetes but are consistently elevated above what is considered normal. The concept of IFG has been endorsed by leading professional organizations and adopted as one measure for identifying the high-risk population for type 2 diabetes preventive interventions in clinical settings and large-scale, community-based prevention programs.

Despite the increasing use of FPG testing to identify the high-risk state, the appropriate threshold for the lower limit of IFG remains unclear. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) currently uses 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) as the threshold to define IFG, while the World Health Organization and the European Diabetes Epidemiology Group recommends using 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L). Varying standards exist in large part because there is no clear threshold at which an FPG value can be associated with a sharp increase in the risk of future diabetes and its complications. Recent ADA guidelines also recommend glycated hemoglobin (A1C) as a blood test to identify people at high risk for type 2 diabetes and such a continuous relationship with the incidence of diabetes and its complications also has been observed for A1C.

When FPG is used to identify the target population for type 2 diabetes prevention, the choice of the IFG-defining FPG threshold ultimately affects the intervention's cost-effectiveness. A lower FPG threshold would result in more people being eligible for intervention, which would likely lead to more cases of diabetes being prevented or delayed. However, a lower threshold might be less cost-effective because it incurs costs for intervening in a population with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. To better understand the potential cost implications, major clinical and public health organizations called for systematic economic analyses of the FPG thresholds. Our study sought to estimate and compare the long-term cost-effectiveness of alternative FPG thresholds for identifying high-risk adults for inclusion in type 2 diabetes prevention programs.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^112ncrVR]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Figure 2
A: Change in A1C levels in adults with type 2 diabetes within 3–12 months after initiation of a new diabetes therapy. Of the 15,125 patients starting a new regimen, 81% (12,215) maintained their new therapy regimen without further change throughout the 3- to 12-month postinitiation observation window, without achieving target levels. Adapted from Karter et al. B: Effect of community care vs. university care and standard "usual care" vs. treatment algorithm–driven therapy on A1C. Adapted from Fanning et al.

Poor glycemic management and the ensuing departure from A1C target levels are often attributed in part to clinical inertia and perhaps inappropriate individualization of glycemic targets. Although most people with type 2 diabetes will need insulin therapy to maintain A1C < 7.0% 9 years after diagnosis, there is substantial resistance to its introduction, both from patients and physicians. In many cases, the lag in insulin initiation can present a challenging hurdle, especially when insulin becomes the next treatment option. Choice of treatment is also often influenced by patient characteristics. In a cohort of 253,238 subjects, physicians were more likely to initiate therapy modifications in response to poor control if the patient had higher baseline risk factor values and a history of coronary artery disease or end organ damage and were less likely to do so if the patient was of a minority group. Both appear to be inappropriate individualization. Similarly, hypertension, patient adherence, age, weight, sex (female), and duration of diabetes increased the odds of therapy intensification.

### ACP releases updated guidance statement on A1c targets for… [^113pmsbw]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Goals of glycemic control should be individualized to each patient, after discussing harms and benefits, preferences, overall health status, treatment burden, and expense.
- An A1C target of 7% to 8% is recommended for most patients, because targets of 7% or less do not appear to result in reduced risk of mortality or macrovascular events.
- The medication regimen may be de-escalated in patients with an A1C level less than 6. 5%, because there is no evidence of clinical benefit in patients at this level. From the AFP Editors More than 9% of persons in the United States have type 2 diabetes mellitus. Increased blood glucose levels in these patients can lead to polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and dehydration. Although lowering blood glucose levels can decrease the risk of these symptoms and the associated complications, there are still disadvantages to doing so, including adverse effects, increased treatment burden, and expense.

A1C measurement is one method for determining blood glucose levels, but it is inconsistent and can change based on a patient's race and ethnicity. Previous guidelines have recommended the use of medications to reach A1C targets; however, an ideal target remains debatable. This guidance statement from the American College of Physicians aims to help physicians achieve appropriate A1C targets via medication for nonpregnant patients with type 2 diabetes based on a review of six health care organization guidelines. Guidance Statements Goals of glycemic control via medication should be individualized to each patient, after talking about benefits and harms of more vs. less control, preferences, overall health status, treatment burden, and expense. Because targets of 7% or less vs. approximately 8% do not appear to result in reduced risk of mortality or macrovascular events, an A1C target of 7% to 8% is recommended for most patients.

Treatment in older persons and those with a shorter life expectancy should aim to reduce symptoms of hyperglycemia, rather than to achieve A1C targets. In addition, because achieving certain A1C targets is associated with more harm than good, these targets are not recommended in any patient expected to live fewer than 10 years because of older age, living in a long-term care facility, or with a chronic condition.

### GOAL study: clinical and non-clinical predictive factors for achieving glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes in real clinical practice [^116Rv7pL]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes is one of the major health priority of the 21st centurycausing 1.5 million deaths in 2012. It is expected that by 2025–2030, there will be 380 million people with type 2 diabetes, and this pathology will move up to the seventh leading cause of death worldwide. Diabetes is recognized as a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), responsible for about a twofold excess risk for various vascular diseases such as coronary heart diseases (CHD), strokes, and other vascular deaths.

Type 2 diabetes requires the adoption of a healthy diet, physical activity and maintenance of a normal body weight. But, the cornerstone of type 2 diabetes treatment includes oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) and insulin use in the event of increased glycemia.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensusfor the management of type 2 diabetes recommends a glycemic target hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) < 7% (53 mmol/mol). The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) showed that each 1% reduction in HbA1c is associated with a risk reduction of complications that is clinically and statistically significant. After adjusting for multiple potential confounding factors, 1% rise in HbA1c was associated with a 7% increase in the risk of a first major CV event, a 12% rise in the risk of death, a 20% rise in the risk of heart failure. The goal of therapy for the majority of people with diabetes is to prevent CV events by achieving a sustained glycemic control (HbA1c < 7% (53 mmol/mol)). The choice of the medications used to achieve glycemic goals must be individualized for each patient and adjusted as diabetes is a progressive disease. When lifestyle, metformin, and sulfonylurea or basal insulin are insufficient and do not lead to a glycemic control, the next step should be an initiation or intensification of insulin therapy including additional injections of short-acting or rapid-acting insulins. Despite an availability of a range of pharmacological agents and the stepwise approach to type 2 diabetes treatment advocated by ADA/EASD position statement, many patients with type 2 diabetes remain in poor glycemic control for prolonged periods of time.

The aim of the present study was to assess the clinical and non-clinical predictive factors for achieving the glycemic goal HbA1c as targeted by the treating physician in adults with type 2 diabetes requiring insulin initiation, titration, and/or intensification.

### Systematic review of guideline recommendations for older and frail adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115rvm8A]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The application of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) across the spectrum of individuals living with diabetes can be challenging, particularly in older adults, where factors such as frailty and multimorbidity exacerbate the complexity of management.

Objective

This systematic review aimed to explore the guidance provided within diabetes CPGs for management of individuals who are older and/or frail, including recommendations for haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) target and pharmacotherapeutic management.

Methods

A systematic search was completed in Medline and Embase to identify national or international type 2 diabetes CPGs published in the last 10 years. Data extracted included recommendations for HbA1c targets and pharmacotherapy in older and frail adults, frailty screening and deprescribing. Quality of included CPGs was appraised with the AGREE II tool.

Results

Twenty-three CPGs were included, within which older adults and frailty were discussed in 21 and 14 CPGs, respectively. Specific HbA1c targets for older and/or frail adults were provided by 15 CPGs, the majority of which suggested a strict target (< 7.0%-7.5%) in healthier older adults and a more relaxed target (< 8.0%-8.5%) in those who are frail or medically complex. Ten CPGs provided recommendations for insulin therapy and 16 provided recommendations for non-insulin antihyperglycaemic agents that were specific to older and/or frail populations, which primarily focused on minimising risk of hypoglycaemia.

Conclusion

Most diabetes CPGs recommend strict HbA1c targets in healthier older adults, with more relaxed targets in those living with frailty or medical complexity. However, significant variability exists in pharmacotherapy recommendations and there were proportionately less recommendations for individuals who are frail.

### Management of blood glucose with noninsulin therapies in type 2 diabetes [^112YEnzx]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

A comprehensive, collaborative approach is necessary for optimal treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Treatment guidelines focus on nutrition, exercise, and pharmacologic therapies to prevent and manage complications. Patients with prediabetes or new-onset diabetes should receive individualized medical nutrition therapy, preferably from a registered dietitian, as needed to achieve treatment goals. Patients should be treated initially with metformin because it is the only medication shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce mortality and complications. Additional medications such as sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists should be added as needed in a patient-centered fashion. However, there is no evidence that any of these medications reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality. There is insufficient evidence on which combination of hypoglycemic agents best improves health outcomes before escalating to insulin therapy. The American Diabetes Association recommends an A1C goal of less than 7% for many nonpregnant adults, with the option of a less stringent goal of less than 8% for patients with short life expectancy, cardiovascular risk factors, or long-standing diabetes. Randomized trials in middle-aged patients with cardiovascular risk factors have shown no mortality benefit and in some cases increased mortality with more stringent A1C targets.

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^116Tc2ws]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Over 280 million people worldwide are known to have diabetes, and this number is projected to grow to 438 million by 2030. Current diabetes treatment guidelines encourage a multifaceted therapeutic approach. Central to these recommendations is early diagnosis and active intervention to realize and maintain glycemic control, with the aim of stopping the development of microvascular complications, reducing the risk of macrovascular events, and ameliorating the symptoms of acute hyperglycemia (,–).

The prognostic significance of A1C in regard to the incidence of diabetes complications, and the risk reductions associated with improvements in A1C, have been documented in both type 1 and type 2 (–,) diabetes. These have led to the underscoring of the importance of A1C target achievement. Many organizations around the world including the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the Canadian Diabetes Association, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the International Diabetes Federation, and the U.K. National Institute for Clinical Excellence currently advocate a general target level for A1C of 6.5–7.0%. They also all say that the targets of therapy must be individualized. Recently, a joint position statement from the American College of Cardiology, ADA, and the American Heart Association released in response to the premature discontinuation of the glycemic intervention in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial recommended that although an appropriate A1C target is generally < 7.0%, individualized glycemic targets may be appropriate for some patients. For example, they stated that higher A1C targets may be more appropriate for those patients who are older, have longer duration of diabetes, have a history of severe hypoglycemia, exhibit advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, or present with extensive comorbidities. Others have noted that where glucose control closer to normal, or in the normal range, is easily attained, the care necessary to achieve it should be offered to the individual concerned.

### Management of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113N7YTz]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus focus on three areas: intensive lifestyle intervention that includes at least 150 minutes per week of physical activity, weight loss with an initial goal of 7 percent of baseline weight, and a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet; aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., hypertension, dyslipidemia, and microalbuminuria) with the use of aspirin, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; and normalization of blood glucose levels (hemoglobin A1C level less than 7 percent). Insulin resistance, decreased insulin secretion, and increased hepatic glucose output are the hallmarks of type 2 diabetes, and each class of medication targets one or more of these defects. Metformin, which decreases hepatic glucose output and sensitizes peripheral tissues to insulin, has been shown to decrease mortality rates in patients with type 2 diabetes and is considered a first-line agent. Other medications include sulfonylureas and nonsulfonylurea secretagogues, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones. Insulin can be used acutely in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes to normalize blood glucose, or it can be added to a regimen of oral medication to improve glycemic control. Except in patients taking multiple insulin injections, home monitoring of blood glucose levels has questionable utility, especially in relatively well-controlled patients. Its use should be tailored to the needs of the individual patient.

3 PATIENT FACTORS IMPACTING GLYCEMIC GOALS AND THERAPY SELECTION

Most patients with T2D will require basal insulin. Patients with T2D requiring insulin therapy have, in most circumstances, a longer duration of diabetes, whether this time period is with diagnosed or undiagnosed T2D. In the context of FRCs, while the GLP‐1 RA component may mitigate the weight gain associated with basal insulin, insulin therapy is still associated with a net increase in body weight and hypoglycaemia risk vs. not using insulin. Thus, patients being treated with FRCs are more similar to subjects in older trials of glycemic control (e.g. ACCORD, ADVANCE and VDAT) vs. newer trials of incretins and SGLT2 inhibitors where lower or even HbA1c levels below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes may be beneficial.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) prefers an HbA1c of < 6.5% as the primary glycemic goal for people with T2D. However, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) prefer a HbA1c goal of < 7% as the primary glycemic goal for most adults with T2D. While these goals seem to contrast, they begin to mirror each other when patient‐specific adjustments to these goals are brought into focus.

### Glycemic control and obesity among people with type 2 diabetes in Europe and Australia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^113iALoY]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally, 537 million adults were living with diabetes in 2021, and this figure is expected to increase to 783 million by 2045. An estimated 90% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Obesity and T2D share key multi-system pathophysiological mechanisms, and obesity is an important modifiable risk factor for the development of T2D. Weight loss appears to reverse the underlying metabolic impairments of T2D. In people with T2D (PwT2D) who also have obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, healthy diet, regular physical activity, medication and surgical interventions, are recommended. Modest and sustained weight loss has been shown to improve glycemic control and reduce the need for glucose-lowering agents (GLAs). The Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial, conducted among PwT2D with overweight and obesity, found that loss of body weight was associated with improved overall fitness, reduced glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, reduced cardiovascular risk factors and reduced depression symptoms. Guidelines recommend a target HbA1c < 7% for most adult PwT2D.

1 INTRODUCTION

Most current guidelines for management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) recommend that patients maintain glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels below 7% to achieve long‐term glucose control. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 While a goal of HbA1c < 7.0% is given in guidelines as suitable for the majority of patients with T2D, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 the corresponding fasting blood glucose (FBG) target to achieve this goal is not clearly defined. Guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) in 2018 recommend an FBG target of 4.4‐7.2 mmol/L to achieve HbA1c < 7%. 1 Guidelines from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists‐American College of Endocrinology in 2018 and from the International Diabetes Federation in 2017 recommend an FBG target of < 6.1 mmol/L to achieve HbA1c < 6.5% 3 and < 7%, 4 respectively. Thus, the optimal FBG target to achieve HbA1c < 7.0% in patients with T2D remains controversial.

Only one study, conducted in a Western country, demonstrated that more patients randomized to an FBG target of 3.9‐5.0 mmol/L achieved HbA1c < 7.0% than those randomized to an FBG target of 4.4‐6.1 mmol/L. 6 However, the proportion of patients who achieved HbA1c < 7% without hypoglycaemia (glucose ≤ 3.1 mmol/L) was the same in the two target groups. 6 The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of three pre‐defined FBG targets on the proportion of Chinese patients with T2D who achieved HbA1c < 7.0%. 7 The FBG targets to which patients were randomized were 3.9 < FBG ≤ 7.0, 3.9 < FBG ≤ 6.1 and 3.9 < FBG ≤ 5.6 mmol/L. Titration with basal insulin glargine 100 U/mL was chosen to provide FBG control. In summary, this study aimed to elucidate the optimal FBG target for patients with T2D to maximize the proportion of patients to achieve HbA1c < 7% while minimizing hypoglycaemia risk.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to glycemic targets, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider achieving lower HbA1c levels than the goal of 7% (53 mmol/mol) as an acceptable option, even beneficial if it can be achieved safely without frequent or severe hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment, based on healthcare professional judgment and the preference of the patient with diabetes.

### Glycemic control in type 2 diabetes: time for an evidence-based about-face? [^116HHG4U]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Some diabetes guidelines set low glycemic control goals for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (such as a hemoglobin A(1c) level as low as 6.5% to 7.0%) to avoid or delay complications. Our review and critique of recent large randomized trials in patients with type 2 diabetes suggest that tight glycemic control burdens patients with complex treatment programs, hypoglycemia, weight gain, and costs and offers uncertain benefits in return. We believe clinicians should prioritize supporting well-being and healthy lifestyles, preventive care, and cardiovascular risk reduction in these patients. Glycemic control efforts should individualize hemoglobin A(1c) targets so that those targets and the actions necessary to achieve them reflect patients' personal and clinical context and their informed values and preferences.

The primary objectives of the management of diabetes are to reduce the incidence and burden of complications and to improve quality of life (figure 1). Historically, these objectives were pursued through control of hyperglycaemia. In this glucose centric approach, clinical practice guidelines recommend targeting haemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) concentrations at < 7% (53 mmol/mol) or < 6.5% (47.5 mmol/mol) and, more recently, continuous glucose monitoring time in range > 70% for most non-pregnant adults with type 2 diabetes, with lower or higher glycaemic thresholds individualised for each person. These recommendations for levels of HbA 1c come from data from randomised controlled trials showing a reduction in microvascular complications with more intensive glycaemic control, although data for the association between time in range and risk of complications of chronic diabetes are limited but emerging. Implementation of glycaemic targets based on continuous glucose monitoring has also been limited by gaps in insurance coverage and accessibility, although continuous glucose monitoring is increasingly recommended for and used by people with type 2 diabetes.

Randomised controlled trials of older antihyperglycaemic treatments, such as sulfonylureas and insulins, however, have not shown a consistent association between intensive glycaemic control and reduction in macrovascular complications or mortality. Nevertheless, longer term follow-up of intensively treated adults provides some evidence of a lower risk of macrovascular events and cardiovascular death. Conversely, intensive glycaemic control in individuals with frailty, advanced age, and multimorbidity was associated with an increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia and death. Therefore, future research is needed to examine the effect of intensive glycaemic control when achieved with newer glucose lowering drugs, which have a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and additional cardio-reno-metabolic benefits. Taken together, these data highlight the importance of individualised glycaemic management and the need to shift the emphasis away from the imperfect surrogate of levels of HbA 1c towards reducing hard outcomes of the adverse health effects of diabetes, while lessening the burden of treatment.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114Pp9LW]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — individualizing HbA1c targets should account for disease status, complications, comorbidities, and life expectancy; the guideline states the clinician should consider these factors and we suggest clinicians consider the magnitude of expected benefit using principles of absolute risk reduction (ARR) or number needed to treat (NNT), not relative risk, noting that the studies above can provide an order of magnitude of expected benefit, especially in older adults. Establishing an individualized therapeutic goal requires a thorough understanding of patient characteristics, including demographics, behavioral factors, cultural factors, and other social determinants that contribute to disparity in adult diabetes care and outcomes in the U.S. population; understanding the individual patient's characteristics will mitigate the negative impact social determinants of health can have on diabetes outcomes, and considering the presence of end–organ injury or other comorbidities and estimating life expectancy — which weighs the relative risk of death and, when viewed as a function of age, comorbidity, and disability, frailty, or both, can be valuable — supports a more relaxed HbA1c target range and offers clinician flexibility to establish expectations and to choose how to safely improve outcomes.

### The burden of type 2 diabetes and the value of achieving near normoglycemia from the patient perspective [^116mqpXo]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Achieving glycemic control is a crucial step to diabetes management and may reduce the risk of future complications. Current guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommend that people with T2D achieve a goal of < 7% (53 mmol/mol) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Treatment in combination with lifestyle modifications is often recommended to achieve this goal, and advancements in the last 10 years have led to new approaches to therapy and made this glycemic goal easier to achieve. More recently, research has shown that movement from above target HbA1c to normoglycemia (HbA1c < 5.7%), a blood glucose level similar to people without diabetes, may also be achieved therapeutically. To date, achieving near normoglycemia has rarely been a focus, or even considered, by people with T2D or their treatment providers.

Little is known about what achieving normoglycemia would mean to people with T2D. Given the distinct possibility that this may now be achievable for at least some individuals with T2D, this study examined the perceived value of achieving near normoglycemia (HbA1c < 5.7%) among people with T2D. In the current study, participants with T2D were asked to imagine the future and anticipate how their lives could be different should they achieve near normoglycemia. Through this approach, it was hoped that people with T2D could more easily prioritize and communicate the diabetes-related outcomes that are most meaningful to them.

### Optimizing care in diabetes: a quixotic challenge [^1135wmnP]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Illustrating the extent of change in targeted treatment outcomes is the evolving Standard of Care for targeted A1C by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) that in 2002 was to "develop or adjust the management plan to achieve normal or near-normal glycemia with an A1C goal of < 7%". A lower A1C is associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. A year ago, the ADA stated that "a reasonable A1C goal for many nonpregnant adults is < 7%". By 2012, however, although the ADA "glycemic goal" in adults with diabetes remained as "lowering A1C to below or around 7%", the recommendation was accompanied with the caution that "less-stringent A1C goals (such as < 8%) may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, [and] extensive comorbid conditions". The evidence prompting this redirection came from multiple sources. Typical of many reports is the 2009 notation in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the official journal of the American College of Physicians, that "randomized trial evidence does not strongly support tight glycemic control as more beneficial than harmful in reducing the risk for diabetic complications", noting that as A1C fell below 7.5%, mortality increased. As such, a target A1C of 7.5% rather than 7.0% in type 2 diabetes was proposed based on charting of mortality in a cohort of 27,995 patients treated with combinations of oral hypoglycemic agents and a cohort of 20,005 patients managed with insulin-based regimens in the U.K. General Practice Database and reported in the Lancet by Currie et al. Reaching a similar conclusion, using data on 71,092 subjects in The Diabetes and Aging Study of the Kaiser Permanente California Registry, Huang et al. stated that "a target A1C < 8.0% for older patients is advised". Adding to the need for caution in preparing definitive "marching orders" for management of metabolic control according to A1C levels is the reanalysis by Riddle et al. of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial results leading to the quixotic inference that factors associated with persisting higher A1C levels, rather than lower A1C per se are as likely to increase mortality in patients with diabetes. Thus, in 2012, the primary care physician greeting a newly diagnosed 65-year-old diabetic patient has blurry marching orders as to what extent of glucose regulation may not only be best in terms of slowing diabetes complications but safest in extending life.

### Insulin therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112xivsE]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus are increasing.

Objective

To review currently available insulin therapy, as well as evidence on the use, application, initiation, and intensification of insulin in the outpatient setting.

Evidence Review

Data sources included PubMed for trials and investigations in type 2 diabetes examining insulin use from January 1998 to April 2014.

Findings

The hemoglobin A1c target for most patients with type 2 diabetes is 7% but needs to be modified when there is increased risk of hypoglycemia, reduced life expectancy, extensive comorbidities, or reduced resources. Insulin therapy may be considered early or late in the disease course; adverse effects include weight gain and hypoglycemia. Basal insulin can be added to oral hypoglycemic agents (generally stopping sulfonylureas) initially, and later, prandial insulin can be added in a stepwise fashion. Insulin treatment must be individualized, and there are a number of challenges to insulin initiation and intensification.

Conclusions and Relevance

Insulin can help achieve ideal hemoglobin A1c goals for patients with type 2 diabetes. Barriers such as adherence, patient preferences, clinician preferences, and resource allocation must be addressed.

### Personalized management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: reflections from a diabetes care editors' expert forum [^115AzKJC]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

No single antihyperglycemic agent can correct all of these pathophysiological abnormalities. Thus, many patients may require multiple agents with different mechanisms of action to achieve their individualized A1C goal. Patients with type 2 diabetes who have a high initial A1C, in particular, may require two or more antihyperglycemic agents to achieve their A1C goal.

The precise choice of pharmacological agents to use remains a topic for debate, in part because of safety concerns involving several drug classes. But the basic point remains: To achieve durability of glycemic control, optimal regimens will likely need to address both insulin resistance and β-cell failure.

Does phenotype allow for personalized treatment?

The main characteristics that might influence approaches to treatment can be divided into two categories: patient features and disease features. Among the patient features are race/ethnicity, sex, age of onset or diagnosis, duration of diabetes, body weight, frailty/comorbidities, complications, propensity for side effects/drug tolerance, personality and aspirations, and psychosocial-economic context. Among the disease features are the balance between insulin deficiency and insulin insensitivity, fasting versus postprandial hyperglycemia, short versus long disease duration, and special circumstances such as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) or latent autoimmune diabetes in adulthood (LADA).

However, we are faced with a paucity of data on how patients with certain characteristics respond to specific therapies. We know that most glucose-lowering drugs for type 2 diabetes work in most patients. But we also know that there are nonresponders to any drug. Numerous post hoc studies have revealed some predictors of better responses, but the data are inconclusive. Furthermore, those response differences tend to be small, and the strongest predictor remains baseline A1C, with the patients with higher A1C levels responding with greater reductions although not necessarily attaining target levels.

### Meeting individualized glycemic targets in primary care patients with type 2 diabetes in Spain [^1156G6dc]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Recent clinical guidelines and expert committees on the management of type 2 diabetes have recommended individualization of glycemic targets based on patient characteristics, comorbid conditions, diabetes complications, duration of diabetes and risk of hypoglycemia. The American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) recommended a target HbA1c level < 7% (53 mmol/mol) for most patients with type 2 diabetes, however, a more relaxed target (HbA1c 7.5–8% (58–64 mmol/mol)) should be aimed in patients with multiple comorbidities, reduced life expectancy, history of hypoglycemia, or advanced diabetes complications. On the other hand, a more stringent target such as HbA1c < 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) was considered beneficial in younger patients without comorbid conditions and with no adverse effects of antihyperglycemic treatment. Similarly, the national consensus from the Sociedad Española de Diabetes (SED – Spanish Diabetes Society) recommended a stringent HbA1c target of < 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, age < 70 years, and absence of diabetic complications, otherwise, a less stringent HbA1c goal of < 7.5% (58 mmol/mol) should be the target in the absence of these conditions. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) also recommends the individualization of glycemic targets taking into account several factors that include concurrent illnesses and risk of hypoglycemia.

### Managing weight and glycaemic targets in people with type 2 diabetes-how far have we come? [^1151dUeE]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is a global public health burden, with type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounting for roughly 90% of all cases. This corresponds to approximately 537 million adults globally in 2021, and the number is projected to increase to 643 million by 2030 and to 784 million by 2045. In addition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), almost 90% of individuals with T2D in the United States are also overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 25 kg/m²) or obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²). This shows that overweight and obesity are almost invariably associated with T2D.

Glycaemic control represents the primary target for people with T2D, regardless of the individual's body weight. Recent guideline recommendations suggest a glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of less than 7% (53 mmol/mol) as a glycaemic target for the majority of adults without significant hypoglycaemia. However, glycaemic treatment goals should be individualized based on patient preferences and goals, risk of adverse effects of therapy (e.g. hypoglycaemia and weight gain) and patient characteristics, including frailty and comorbidities. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), more stringent HbA1c targets may be recommended if they can be achieved safely and with acceptable burden of therapy, and less stringent targets (e.g. up to 8% [64 mmol/mol]) may be adequate for patients with limited life expectancy or in cases where the harms of treatment outweigh the potential benefits. Similarly, the shared European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) guidelinesupports individualized HbA1c targets, with HbA1c targets of 6.0%–6.5% (42–48 mmol/mol) in younger patients with a short diabetes duration and no evidence of cardiovascular disease, if achieved without significant hypoglycaemia. Less‐stringent HbA1c goals of up to 9% (75 mmol/mol) may be appropriate for elderly patients with long‐standing diabetes, limited life expectancy and frailty with multiple comorbidities.

### Public health implications of recommendations to individualize glycemic targets in adults with diabetes [^115qBi7K]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To estimate how many U.S. adults with diabetes would be eligible for individualized A1C targets based on 1) the 2012 American Diabetes Association (ADA) guideline and 2) a published approach for individualized target ranges.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

We studied adults with diabetes ≥ 20 years of age from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007–2008 (n = 757). We assigned A1C targets based on duration, age, diabetes-related complications, and comorbid conditions according to 1) the ADA guideline and 2) a strategy by Ismail-Beigi focused on setting target ranges. We estimated the number and proportion of adults with each A1C target and compared individualized targets to measured levels.

RESULTS

Using ADA guideline recommendations, 31% (95% CI 27–34%) of the U.S. adult diabetes population would have recommended A1C targets of < 7.0%, and 69% (95% CI 66–73%) would have A1C targets less stringent than < 7.0%. Using the Ismail-Beigi strategy, 56% (51–61%) would have an A1C target of ≤ 7.0%, and 44% (39–49%) would have A1C targets less stringent than < 7.0%. If a universal A1C < 7.0% target were applied, 47% (41–54%) of adults with diabetes would have inadequate glycemic control; this proportion declined to 30% (26–36%) with the ADA guideline and 31% (27–36%) with the Ismail-Beigi strategy.

CONCLUSIONS

Using individualized glycemic targets, about half of U.S. adults with diabetes would have recommended A1C targets of ≥ 7.0% but one-third would still be considered inadequately controlled. Diabetes research and performance measurement goals will need to be revised in order to encourage the individualization of glycemic targets.

Appendix B — Glycemic control targets and monitoring — states that setting an HbA1c target range is an important treatment strategy in the management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, with general guidance for setting HbA1c target ranges based on patients' comorbidities, life expectancy, and extent of microvascular complications. It notes that other factors might also be considered, and these are addressed in several footnotes. Setting target ranges with upper and lower bounds highlights the importance of considering the risks associated with both hyper- and hypoglycemia. These guiding principles are intended to complement Recommendations 9 and 10 and to help in creating individualized treatment strategies using shared-decision making.

### Treatment patterns and glycated haemoglobin levels over 36 months in individuals with type 2 diabetes initiating second-line glucose-lowering therapy: the global DISCOVER study [^114qFkGE]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Target HbA1c levels should be personalized to each patient and a target HbA1c level of 48 to 53 mmol/mol (6.5‐7.0%) may not be appropriate for all individuals. For example, individuals with complex comorbidities may have less stringent glycaemic goals with an individualized target HbA1c level of > 53 mmol/mol (> 7.0%). In fact, a previous DISCOVER study report showed that 70.2% of patients had been set an individualized glycaemic control target; targets were 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) for 2513 patients (49.6%), < 53 mmol/mol (< 7.0%) for 2073 patients (40.9%), ≥ 53 mmol/mol (≥ 7.0%) for 484 patients (9.6%). As such, a proportion of participants with an HbA1c level of 53 to < 64 mmol/mol (7.0‐ < 8.0%) may be considered as having reached their individualized HbA1c target and therefore did not receive treatment intensification during follow‐up.

### Diabetes and frailty: an expert consensus statement on the management of older adults with type 2 diabetes [^115E9xBP]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Prognosis and appropriate treatment goals for older adults with diabetes vary greatly according to frailty. It is now recognised that changes may be needed to diabetes management in some older people. Whilst there is clear guidance on the evaluation of frailty and subsequent target setting for people living with frailty, there remains a lack of formal guidance for healthcare professionals in how to achieve these targets. The management of older adults with type 2 diabetes is complicated by comorbidities, shortened life expectancy and exaggerated consequences of adverse effects from treatment. In particular, older adults are more prone to hypoglycaemia and are more vulnerable to its consequences, including falls, fractures, hospitalisation, cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Thus, assessment of frailty should be a routine component of a diabetes review for all older adults, and glycaemic targets and therapeutic choices should be modified accordingly. Evidence suggests that over-treatment of older adults with type 2 diabetes is common, with many having had their regimens intensified over preceding years when they were in better health, or during more recent acute hospital admissions when their blood glucose levels might have been atypically high, and nutritional intake may vary. In addition, assistance in taking medications, as often occurs in later life following implementation of community care strategies or admittance to a care home, may dramatically improve treatment adherence, leading to a fall in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. As a person with diabetes gets older, simplification, switching or de-escalation of the therapeutic regimen may be necessary, depending on their level of frailty and HbA1c levels. Consideration should be given, in particular, to de-escalation of therapies that may induce hypoglycaemia, such as sulphonylureas and shorter-acting insulins. We discuss the use of available glucose-lowering therapies in older adults and recommend simple glycaemic management algorithms according to their level of frailty.

ANTIHYPERGLYCEMIC THERAPY

Glycemic targets

The ADA's "Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes" recommends lowering HbA 1c to < 7.0% in most patients to reduce the incidence of microvascular disease. This can be achieved with a mean plasma glucose of ∼8.3–8.9 mmol/L (∼150–160 mg/dL); ideally, fasting and premeal glucose should be maintained at < 7.2 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL) and the postprandial glucose at < 10 mmol/L (< 180 mg/dL). More stringent HbA 1c targets (e.g. 6.0–6.5%) might be considered in selected patients (with short disease duration, long life expectancy, no significant CVD) if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Conversely, less stringent HbA 1c goals — e.g. 7.5–8.0% or even slightly higher — are appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced complications, extensive comorbid conditions and those in whom the target is difficult to attain despite intensive self-management education, repeated counseling, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents, including insulin.

The accumulated results from the aforementioned type 2 diabetes cardiovascular trials suggest that not everyone benefits from aggressive glucose management. It follows that it is important to individualize treatment targets (,–). The elements that may guide the clinician in choosing an HbA 1c target for a specific patient are shown in Fig. 1. As mentioned earlier, the desires and values of the patient should also be considered, since the achievement of any degree of glucose control requires active participation and commitment. Indeed, any target could reflect an agreement between patient and clinician. An important related concept is that the ease with which more intensive targets are reached influences treatment decisions; logically, lower targets are attractive if they can be achieved with less complex regimens and no or minimal adverse effects. Importantly, utilizing the percentage of diabetic patients who are achieving an HbA 1c < 7.0% as a quality indicator, as promulgated by various health care organizations, is inconsistent with the emphasis on individualization of treatment goals.

### Considerations on blood glucose management in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116ecBXT]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

In recent years the benefits of more intensive management in preventing or delaying the development and progression of diabetic complications have been well documented. What is not as well documented is how to motivate the person with diabetes to manage the condition, how to set, assess and quantify glucose goals, and the glucose variables that should be routinely measured. This review discusses the importance of setting targets and communicating them in a way that the patient understands. When aiming for a glycaemia target, balance is required (1) between achieving reduction of complications and causing an increased degree of hypoglycaemia, and (2) between what is achievable and what degree of benefit is gained. Target values given in guidelines should be adapted by the clinician to take into account the patient's susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, stage and type of complications, age and life expectancy, co-morbidity, social environment, understanding of the steps required and level of commitment to the treatment. Several suggestions are given regarding possible improvements and amendments to existing guidelines for diabetes management in treating to glucose goal. For example, attention should be drawn to the need to individualize goals and to consider education, long-term support, patient needs and treatment outcome when formulating diabetes management plans. The relative properties of the different glucose variables-fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), and glycated protein-in terms of their convenience of measurement, usefulness and relevance to the physician and patient are also evaluated. When prioritising the variables to be measured it is suggested that where feasible, HbA(1c) should be the standard measurement by which to gauge risk and treatment efficacy. Serial measurements should be made and, where possible, the use of blood glucose meters encouraged, in order to obtain a blood glucose profile for the patient.

### The importance of glycemic control: how low should we go with HbA1c? Start early, go safe, go low [^112j7B6K]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2010). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic data indicate a continuous relationship between hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and risk for microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes. Intensive glycemic control reduces risk of microvascular complications in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, and long-term treatment and follow-up studies have shown that initial intensive control is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk. Recent intervention trials in older, high-risk patients with Type 2 diabetes have not shown a benefit of intensive control in reducing cardiovascular risk over a rather short-term follow-up period of up to 5 years, with some data indicating that intensive control accompanied by hypoglycemia is detrimental in patients with high cardiovascular risk. Indeed, hypoglycemia with current antidiabetic agents — primarily insulin and sulphonylureas — is the main limiting factor in achieving desirable levels of glycemic control. Still, the goal in treating both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes should be to safely get HbA1c as close to normal as possible. In Type 2 diabetes, this goal should be tempered for the time being in patients with shorter life expectancy or co-existing cardiovascular disease or other co-morbidities, in whom a target of 7.0–7.5% may be advisable until we can demonstrate that lower targets in such patients can be safely achieved. Newer agents with lower risk of hypoglycemia — e.g., insulin analogues, incretin mimetics and incretin enhancers-may form an integral component of strategies for safely achieving lower HbA1c levels.

### Systematic review of guideline recommendations for older and frail adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111U4Ccn]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The application of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) across the spectrum of individuals living with diabetes can be challenging, particularly in older adults, where factors such as frailty and multimorbidity exacerbate the complexity of management.

Objective

This systematic review aimed to explore the guidance provided within diabetes CPGs for management of individuals who are older and/or frail, including recommendations for haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) target and pharmacotherapeutic management.

Methods

A systematic search was completed in Medline and Embase to identify national or international type 2 diabetes CPGs published in the last 10 years. Data extracted included recommendations for HbA1c targets and pharmacotherapy in older and frail adults, frailty screening and deprescribing. Quality of included CPGs was appraised with the AGREE II tool.

Results

Twenty-three CPGs were included, within which older adults and frailty were discussed in 21 and 14 CPGs, respectively. Specific HbA1c targets for older and/or frail adults were provided by 15 CPGs, the majority of which suggested a strict target (< 7.0%–7.5%) in healthier older adults and a more relaxed target (< 8.0%–8.5%) in those who are frail or medically complex. Ten CPGs provided recommendations for insulin therapy and 16 provided recommendations for non-insulin antihyperglycaemic agents that were specific to older and/or frail populations, which primarily focused on minimising risk of hypoglycaemia.

Conclusion

Most diabetes CPGs recommend strict HbA1c targets in healthier older adults, with more relaxed targets in those living with frailty or medical complexity. However, significant variability exists in pharmacotherapy recommendations and there were proportionately less recommendations for individuals who are frail.

### Glycosylated haemoglobin (A1c) best values for type 2 diabetes in the battlefield much ado about nothing? (apparently) [^113e8Les]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite intensive research, therapy of diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) is far from be effective. The most important unresolved issue is to establish a safe glycosylated hemoglobin C (A1c) value well balanced between benefit and side effects. As a result different guidelines suggest different A1c targets generating confusion for patients and clinicians. Here we report two observations which might support a relaxed A1c as suggested by American college of physician (ACP).

### To what target hemoglobin A1c level would you treat this patient with type 2 diabetes? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^113A6kBq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 9.4% of all adults-and 25% of those older than 65 years-have diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness and end-stage renal disease and contributes to both microvascular and macrovascular complications. The management of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common and important activity in primary care internal medicine practice. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) provides an estimate of mean blood sugar levels and glycemic control. The optimal HbA1c target level among various persons with T2D is a subject of controversy. Guidelines regarding HbA1c targets have yielded differing recommendations. In 2018, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a guideline on HbA1c targets for nonpregnant adults with T2D. In addition to a recommendation to individualize HbA1c target levels, the ACP proposed a level between 7% and 8% for most patients. The ACP also advised deintensification of therapy for patients who have an HbA1c level lower than 6.5% and avoidance of HbA1c-targeted treatment for patients with a life expectancy of less than 10 years. This guidance contrasts with a recommendation from the American Diabetes Association to aim for HbA1c levels less than 7% for many nonpregnant adults and to consider a target of 6.5% if it can be achieved safely. Here, 2 experts, a diabetologist and a general internist, discuss how to apply the divergent guideline recommendations to a patient with long-standing T2D and a current HbA1c level of 7.8%.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^111E5Wj2]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Data supporting individualization of targets. A: In nearly 50,000 people with diabetes in regular care in New Zealand, 50% were already achieving A1C < 7.1% and 25% were achieving A1C < 6.4%, suggesting that even current target levels are easily achieved in a high percentage of the treated population without special effort. B: In both arms of the ACCORD study, the range of A1C achieved around the mean was large, with over 50% of people outside an interquartile range of 1.1%. Because these study participants were under active management, this suggests that individuals can only achieve very different personal targets.

At the other end of the scale, clinicians are equally familiar with individuals who, for lifestyle reasons or problems with insulin therapy, find it difficult to achieve conventional target levels. Incidence of hypoglycemia or fear of hypoglycemia is often a factor here, although other factors such as fear of weight gain are a factor for some. This reason for individualization has recently gained further attention because of the concerns arising from the results of the glycemic intervention in ACCORD. This large study was of people at high risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease, being a mean of 62 years old, duration of diabetes of 10 years, and 35% known CV disease at baseline. The intensive strategy aiming for an A1C of < 6.0% caused the study to be stopped prematurely after a median duration of 3.5 years because of a 22% higher mortality in this group, although the primary composite end point of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke was a nonsignificant 10% lower. It was feared by many that the increased mortality was a result of A1C levels being driven "too low" or "too quickly" and/or the result of an about threefold increase in the risk for major hypoglycemia. The risk for mortality appeared to be greater with a prior history of CV event(s) or baseline A1C > 8.0% (both not statistically significant), whereas a significantly reduced primary CV outcome was found in individuals with no history of a CV event and baseline A1C ≤ 8.0% (uncorrected P = 0.04 and 0.03).

AACE 2023 insulin intensification — parameters and targets: Although A1C is a key measure, insulin titration requires multiple glycemic parameters including FBG, premeal or 2-hour postprandial BG, and CGM metrics including TIR, time below range, and GMI. In general, targets for fasting and premeal glucose are < 110 mg/dL, without hypoglycemia and can be individualized based on comorbidities and clinical status. The use of CGM is recommended for persons treated with insulin to optimize glycemic control while minimizing hypoglycemia.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^113ZbYjm]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In contrast to the ongoing treatment gaps in reaching glycemic targets, several, albeit nonrandomized and observational, studies suggest that the consistent use of treatment algorithms by both physicians and other health care workers may assist in bringing more patients to target. In comparing type 2 diabetes management in three settings, Fanning et al. reported that A1C goal realization (Fig. 2), fasting plasma glucose levels, and lipid profiles improved appreciably in nurse manager–directed algorithm-managed groups when compared with the usual care group. Lending further credence to this school of thought are results from another nurse-led diabetes management care program that was supervised by an endocrinologist and that relied on detailed treatment algorithms based on current guidelines. Mean A1C fell to 8.7 from 9.3% in the year before entry into the program and to 7.0% by the end of the first management year (P < 0.001), at which point 60% fulfilled the ADA A1C target of < 7.0% versus 28% at entry. Whereas this somewhat "nonindividualized" algorithm-based approach appears to go against most physicians' desire to provide individualized care to their patients, it seems plausible that an appropriate algorithm-driven approach coupled with tangible A1C targets may be quite effective in getting more patients to target.

### Public health implications of recommendations to individualize glycemic targets in adults with diabetes [^112n68ch]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate how many U.S. adults with diabetes would be eligible for individualized A1C targets based on 1) the 2012 American Diabetes Association (ADA) guideline and 2) a published approach for individualized target ranges.

Research Design and Methods

We studied adults with diabetes ≥ 20 years of age from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007–2008 (n = 757). We assigned A1C targets based on duration, age, diabetes-related complications, and comorbid conditions according to 1) the ADA guideline and 2) a strategy by Ismail-Beigi focused on setting target ranges. We estimated the number and proportion of adults with each A1C target and compared individualized targets to measured levels.

Results

Using ADA guideline recommendations, 31% (95% CI 27–34%) of the U.S. adult diabetes population would have recommended A1C targets of < 7.0%, and 69% (95% CI 66–73%) would have A1C targets less stringent than < 7.0%. Using the Ismail-Beigi strategy, 56% (51–61%) would have an A1C target of ≤ 7.0%, and 44% (39–49%) would have A1C targets less stringent than < 7.0%. If a universal A1C < 7.0% target were applied, 47% (41–54%) of adults with diabetes would have inadequate glycemic control; this proportion declined to 30% (26–36%) with the ADA guideline and 31% (27–36%) with the Ismail-Beigi strategy.

Conclusions

Using individualized glycemic targets, about half of U.S. adults with diabetes would have recommended A1C targets of ≥ 7.0% but one-third would still be considered inadequately controlled. Diabetes research and performance measurement goals will need to be revised in order to encourage the individualization of glycemic targets.

### The Treat-to-target trial and related studies [^113DW8Hw]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the rationale for, and the findings of, the Treat-to-Target Trial and to compare its results with those of two subsequent studies based on the same concepts.

Methods

The 24-hour pattern of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes is presented, and its separate components are identified in an attempt to help optimize therapeutic interventions for diabetes. In addition, the treat-to-target concept, including glycemic outcomes and potential adverse effects, is discussed.

Results

Using a hemoglobin A1c (A1c) value of 7% as a treatment goal based on evidence from interventional studies and a fasting plasma glucose level of 100 mg/dL as a target for titration of dosage of basal insulin, the Treat-to-Target Trial tested two hypotheses. It confirmed that addition of basal insulin to previously unsuccessful oral therapies can, using a simple algorithm, restore glycemic control to 7% A1c or better in most patients with type 2 diabetes. It also confirmed that a long-acting insulin analogue, glargine, causes less hypoglycemia than human NPH insulin when used in this way. Two subsequent studies using similar treatment algorithms showed comparable ability to improve glycemic control but also demonstrated more frequent unwanted effects of insulin treatment when a different comparator regimen was used to initiate therapy than when a glargine-based regimen was used.

Conclusion

Initiation of insulin therapy with structured titration to glycemic targets can frequently, but not always, restore glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes when orally administered agents are no longer successful alone. Future trials should include hypoglycemia and weight gain as specific, objectively measured endpoints to assess their importance as adverse effects of titrating insulin dosage to target. Studies are needed to assess ways to control postprandial as well as basal hyperglycemia and thus enable almost all patients with type 2 diabetes to reach A1c targets.

Outpatient glucose targets for nonpregnant adults — Recommendation 2.1.1 states that for most nonpregnant adults, strive for an A1C goal of ≤ 6.5% if it can be achieved safely and affordably, with an acceptable risk of hypoglycemia or other adverse effects, and glucose targets should be individualized with consideration for life expectancy, disease duration, presence or absence of micro- and macrovascular complications, CVD risk factors, comorbid conditions, risk for hypoglycemia, and cognitive and psychological status (Grade A; BEL 1). Recommendation 2.1.2 advises to adopt less stringent glycemic goals (A1C 7% to 8%) in persons with a history of severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, limited life expectancy, advanced renal disease, extensive comorbid conditions, or long-standing DM in which the A1C goal has been difficult to attain despite intensive efforts, so long as the person remains free of hyperglycemia-associated symptoms (Grade A; BEL 1).
