## Question

Give first line and second line treatment for MDD including doses, drug interactions and adverse effects

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for first-line and second-line pharmacologic treatment of major depressive disorder, with explicit dosing, adverse effects, and drug–drug interactions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define first-line options and what high-credibility guidelines say. Then, I should verify optimal dosing strategies and where dose–response flattens. Next, I will consider patient-centered selection among first-line agents. After that, I need to check how to monitor and when to declare inadequate response. Then, I will review second-line strategies and their comparative evidence. Finally, I will detail drug–drug interactions, safety screening, and a concise clinical algorithm summary with key takeaways anchored to the strongest sources.

> Let me first confirm the first-line framework. High-credibility guidelines consistently recommend either cognitive behavioral therapy or a second-generation antidepressant as initial monotherapy for moderate-to-severe MDD, with the option of combination therapy as a conditional suggestion based on shared decision-making and patient preference, so medication is not mandatory if psychotherapy is preferred or more feasible in a given context [^1161dcHY] [^116h2m7R] [^112rD8qp].

> Wait, let me verify the role of antidepressants when psychotherapy is unavailable or declined. WHO 2023 supports considering antidepressants as monotherapy for moderate-to-severe depression when psychological interventions are not available, and VA/DoD similarly emphasizes choosing between psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy based on preference and clinical context, reinforcing that either modality can be first-line in routine care [^111Qj9fv] [^112C92B1].

> I will now examine the medication classes considered first-line. SSRIs, SNRIs, bupropion, and mirtazapine are all acceptable initial choices; nefazodone is not recommended as first-line due to hepatic toxicity risk, which I should explicitly keep in mind when listing options, and this aligns with guideline synopses listing SGAs broadly while cautioning about specific agents [^111odPUf] [^117Uomh2].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing principles because clinicians often over-titrate. High-quality dose–response meta-analyses show that SSRIs have a rising efficacy curve up to roughly 20–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents, then plateau or decline, with adverse effects increasing steadily; thus, the optimal balance of efficacy and tolerability sits in the lower licensed range rather than at maximal doses, and the same "sweet spot" concept applies to venlafaxine and mirtazapine in their lower ranges, which argues against routine high-dose strategies in first-line care [^112vEbnF] [^113h76DH] [^113t99r6].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said to target the maximum labeled dose for everyone; let me reconsider. That older "treat to max dose" approach conflicts with modern evidence showing diminishing returns and more adverse effects at higher doses, so the correct course is to titrate to the lowest effective dose in the 20–40 mg fluoxetine-equivalent band for SSRIs and avoid pushing beyond that unless there is a compelling individualized rationale and careful monitoring [^112vEbnF] [^113h76DH].

> Next, I should review how to choose among first-line agents. Because efficacy differences across SGAs are small, selection should be driven by adverse effect profile, comorbidities, prior response, and patient preference; for example, bupropion for smoking cessation or sexual dysfunction concerns, mirtazapine for prominent insomnia or appetite loss, SSRIs for anxiety comorbidity, and avoidance of paroxetine or fluoxetine in older adults due to anticholinergic burden or activation, respectively [^115QcBMD] [^112mZLVT] [^116JSLSa].

> I need to ensure I include practical dosing examples. Typical SSRI starting and target ranges include sertraline 50–100 mg/day, escitalopram 10–20 mg/day, and fluoxetine 20–40 mg/day, recognizing that pushing beyond these bands often adds side effects without proportional benefit; for mirtazapine, 15–30 mg/day captures the efficacy peak with better tolerability than higher doses, and for bupropion IR, 150 mg twice daily is a common target after titration, with attention to seizure risk and insomnia [^112vEbnF] [^113h76DH] [^111YpXkN].

> Let me first confirm monitoring cadence and thresholds for response. Guidelines advise reassessment within 1–2 weeks of initiation and again by 6–8 weeks to judge adequacy; using validated scales such as PHQ-9 supports measurement-based care, and I should double-check that dose optimization is attempted before declaring treatment failure, though the evidence suggests limited incremental benefit from dose escalation once a patient is in the therapeutic window [^115EPMFN] [^117S8eb5] [^113nRYr1].

> Hold on, I should verify what constitutes an adequate trial. An adequate antidepressant trial generally means at least 6–8 weeks at a therapeutic dose with good adherence; if response is inadequate, guidelines support switching to a different SGA, augmenting with a second pharmacologic agent, or adding CBT, with the choice individualized to prior benefit, side effects, comorbidities, and patient preference [^117S8eb5] [^115hqgCy] [^116ekByx].

> Next, I should review second-line pharmacologic strategies. Switching to a different SGA, combining two antidepressants with complementary mechanisms, or augmenting with non-antidepressant agents are all reasonable; evidence does not establish clear superiority among these approaches, so shared decision-making is key, and pragmatic data suggest that early combination or switching can yield modest gains over continuation in some patients [^117AgbRV] [^117S8eb5] [^113xZnMZ].

> I will now examine specific second-line options with representative dosing. Adding mirtazapine to an ongoing SSRI or SNRI is supported by pragmatic RCT data showing small but clinically meaningful improvements in symptoms and remission at 9 weeks; bupropion augmentation is commonly used and guideline-listed; buspirone is a lower-interaction augmentation option; among atypical antipsychotic augmentations, aripiprazole has the strongest contemporary evidence signal, though metabolic risks and extrapyramidal symptoms require counseling and monitoring [^113xZnMZ] [^117S8eb5] [^113nRYr1].

> But wait, what if I am overgeneralizing about switching efficacy. I should confirm that switching within or across classes is acceptable and that no single switch target is universally superior; meta-analytic and guideline summaries indicate broadly similar outcomes across switching strategies, so the choice should be tailored to prior tolerability, mechanism, and patient goals, with cross-tapering to mitigate withdrawal and interaction risks [^115QcBMD] [^117S8eb5] [^116REw2c].

> I need to check drug–drug interactions carefully because they can derail otherwise sound plans. SSRIs and SNRIs carry serotonin syndrome risk when combined with serotonergic opioids like tramadol, linezolid, or MAOIs; CYP2D6 inhibition by paroxetine or fluoxetine can raise levels of tamoxifen and some antipsychotics; bupropion lowers seizure threshold and interacts with CYP2D6 substrates; mirtazapine has fewer CYP interactions but adds sedation and weight gain risk; systematic reviews of guideline interaction content emphasize that developers cannot enumerate every pair, so clinicians should proactively screen medication lists for serotonergic stacking and enzyme-mediated interactions at each visit [^1174tPxj].

> Let me consider special populations and safety screening. In older adults, start low and go slow, prefer lower anticholinergic burden agents, and monitor falls and hyponatremia; in pregnancy and breastfeeding, prioritize psychotherapy when appropriate and, if medication is needed, select agents with the most favorable reproductive safety profile and lowest infant exposure when possible; for patients with cardiac disease, avoid TCAs and use caution with SNRIs that elevate blood pressure; for hepatic impairment, dose-adjust or avoid agents with prominent hepatic metabolism as indicated [^112mZLVT] [^116VdHo9] [^117S8eb5].

> I should double-check that I have included a concise clinical algorithm. Start with CBT or an SGA based on preference and access; if choosing medication, select an agent aligned to comorbidities and side-effect priorities; titrate to the lower end of the therapeutic window over 2–4 weeks; reassess at 6–8 weeks; if inadequate response, switch to a different SGA, augment with mirtazapine or bupropion or buspirone, or add CBT; if still inadequate, consider atypical antipsychotic augmentation such as aripiprazole or quetiapine with metabolic monitoring; throughout, screen for interactions, monitor suicidality early in treatment or after changes, and continue the effective strategy for 4–9 months after remission before cautious tapering [^117S8eb5] [^115EPMFN] [^112rD8qp].

> Finally, let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. First-line pharmacotherapy should be an SGA started at a conservative therapeutic dose with slow titration, targeting the lower end of the licensed range for optimal balance of benefit and tolerability; second-line strategies have broadly similar efficacy, so personalize among switching, combination, and augmentation based on prior response, side effects, comorbidities, and patient preference; and vigilance for drug–drug interactions, especially serotonergic combinations and CYP-mediated effects, is essential at every step [^112vEbnF] [^117S8eb5] [^1174tPxj].

First-line treatment for MDD is an SSRI or SNRI [^112o36JE] (e.g. sertraline 50–100 mg/day, escitalopram 10–20 mg/day, venlafaxine 75–150 mg/day) [^112vEbnF] [^111zEt6K] [^111YpXkN], with **CBT as an alternative or adjunct** [^1161dcHY] [^111mh1BW]. Second-line options include switching to a different class (e.g. bupropion 150–300 mg/day, mirtazapine 15–45 mg/day) [^116ekByx] [^111YpXkN] or augmenting with bupropion, mirtazapine, or an atypical antipsychotic (e.g. aripiprazole 2–10 mg/day, quetiapine 150–300 mg/day) [^113nRYr1] [^113Cf2Ty]. Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset, sexual dysfunction, sleep changes, and weight changes; **monitor for serotonin syndrome** with serotonergic combinations [^1174tPxj] and for hyponatremia in older adults [^112mZLVT]. Adjust dosing for hepatic or renal impairment, and avoid serotonergic combinations with MAOIs or tramadol [^1174tPxj].

## Clinical considerations

- **Patient-specific factors**: Tailor treatment to comorbidities, side-effect tolerance, and preferences [^115hqgCy].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess response, adherence, and adverse effects [^117S8eb5].
- **Special populations**: Use caution in elderly, pregnant, or breastfeeding patients; adjust dosing for hepatic/renal impairment [^116VdHo9].

---

First-line treatment for MDD is an SSRI or SNRI, with CBT as an alternative or adjunct; second-line options include switching classes or augmenting with bupropion, mirtazapine, or atypical antipsychotics. Treatment should be **individualized**, with close monitoring for adverse effects and drug interactions [^117S8eb5].

### How do you choose a second-line treatment option for depression? [^114qt5A5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A majority of patients with major depression do not remit or adequately respond to initial antidepressant therapy. When response is insufficient, a diagnosis of depression and any comorbidities should be confirmed, treatment adherence should be established, and antidepressant dosages should be optimized as tolerated. If response is still insufficient, then implementing second-line treatment strategies is warranted. Second-line strategies of switching to or combining/augmenting the initial agent with one of a variety of antidepressant medications and/or psychotherapies improves remission rates, although no single approach or agent has demonstrated clear superiority over any other. Second-line treatment selections should be driven by safety considerations, patients' symptom profiles, and patient preference. Comorbid medical conditions, especially cardiac and cerebrovascular complications, and potential drug-drug interactions should be considered when making treatment decisions.

Background

Every year, an estimated five million people in high-income countries alone start new antidepressants to treat their depression. In the United States, the annual prevalence of prescribed antidepressant use exceeds 10% of the population, almost double that of 10 years before. Antidepressant use is similarly high and increasing in European countries, ranging between 4 and 9%, with a 1-year incidence of new antidepressant prescription of approximately 1%. Clinicians need specific, detailed and appropriate guidelines to guide their antidepressant pharmacotherapy.

To initiate antidepressant treatment, modern guidelines recommend new generation antidepressants and in particular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A network meta-analysis of 12 new generation antidepressants suggested that the SSRI sertraline, because of its favourable balance of benefits, acceptability and cost, may be the best choice when starting treatment for major depression. Sertraline has been the most widely prescribed antidepressant in the United States and elsewhere.

Once they choose a first-line antidepressant, practitioners must optimise its dosage, considering the wide approved dose range for most drugs. Many guidelines only list such ranges and do not specify where within this range the initial treatment should aim. The American Psychiatric Association guideline is more specific and recommends that the initial doses be incrementally raised and maximised, side effects permitting (, p. 43). However, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have provided conflicting results regarding the benefits and harms of lower vs higher doses of various antidepressants within their therapeutic ranges. One review synthesised results from 33 RCTs comparing two or more doses of the same antidepressants and found that a dose level of 100–200 mg imipramine equivalents (or 20–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents) showed the highest response rate, while lower doses showed a reduction in efficacy and higher doses were not accompanied by increased efficacy. Adverse events increased monotonically with dose. However, this study included both old and new generation antidepressants. The dose-response curves may be different for different classes of antidepressants. More recent reviews focussing on a single agent or several agents suggested that there was no dose-response relationship within the approved dose ranges for SSRIs.

Even less is known about when to institute second-line treatment. The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline recommends 4–8 weeks, the American College of Physicians 6–8 weeks and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline 3–4 weeks at one place but 6–8 weeks at another.

Thus, in trying to optimise antidepressant pharmacotherapy for patients with major depression, clinicians face conflicting guidelines informed by low quality evidence. We therefore conducted a pragmatic RCT — an RCT that mimics the practice environment and thus maximises applicability — to examine the following two questions concerning the first- and second-line treatments for a hitherto untreated episode of major depression:
What is the relative effectiveness and safety of initially titrating to the lowest vs the highest value of the therapeutic dose range of an antidepressant? On the basis of the results of prior evidence and existing practices, we chose sertraline as the drug to be tested. Since the available evidence suggests that there may be differences between different classes of antidepressants with respect to dose-response relationship, the first hypothesis pertains to the choice of the initial target dose of an SSRI, and of sertraline in particular, within its therapeutic range.
When patients do not remit on first-line treatment, what is the relative effectiveness and safety of continuing initial treatment, combining with mirtazapine or switching to mirtazapine? We set 3 weeks as this decision point as the earliest time point in guideline recommendations. Our choice of mirtazapine is consistent with a systematic review reporting that combination of a reuptake inhibitor antidepressant such as an SSRI and a blocker of presynaptic alpha-2 autoreceptor (mirtazapine, mianserin, trazodone) was superior to other combinations. In addition, mirtazapine poses a very low risk of drug interaction. Finally, in the recently updated network meta-analysis of 21 antidepressants, mirtazapine was the second most potent antidepressant after amitriptyline; its less favourable acceptability profile renders it less suitable as first-line treatment, but when first-line treatment fails, mirtazapine represents a potentially appropriate second choice.

Clinicians face another challenge because, after several weeks of the first-line treatment, only 50% of patients respond (i.e. achieve depression severity less than half that at pre-treatment), and only 30% remit (i.e. return to a euthymic state). Patients' failure to respond or remit requires consideration of alternative treatments. Guideline recommendations for second-line treatment include dose escalation, switching to a different antidepressant or adding a different drug. The last strategy may be divided into 'augmentation' when a non-antidepressant drug is added to an antidepressant and 'combination' when two antidepressants are used together. Systematic reviews of RCTs agree that dose escalation confers no benefit beyond continuing the initial drug dose; consistent with these results, the German National Guideline clearly states that dose escalation for SSRI does not work. Two previous systematic reviews have found some support for the switching strategy, especially to an antidepressant from a different class. However, a recent more rigorous meta-analysis found no high-level evidence that switching the antidepressant is effective when compared to simply continuing the initial antidepressant. There are also reviews that support various augmentation strategies and combination strategies. However, most of the RCTs addressing patients who fail to respond to initial pharmacotherapy for depression compared new strategies against continuing preceding treatment; far less evidence exists comparing alternative second-line strategies against one another. For example, only two reports have directly compared switching vs combination strategies among patients who failed first-line treatment: one study compared combination vs switching vs continuing the prior treatment, while another compared dose escalation vs combination vs continuing the prior treatment. Unfortunately, neither study was sufficiently powered (only 32–38 patients in each arm in the first study and 98–99 patients in the second study) to reach meaningful conclusions. The STAR*D trial randomised 1439 patients with major depression who had not remitted on citalopram to various switching strategies or augmentation/combination strategies. However, they used an equipoise-stratified design which gave patients choices in their treatment regimen: only 105 patients consented to randomisation to any of the drug switching or augmentation strategies, and consequently the analyses had to be conducted separately among the switching strategies or among the augmentation/combination strategies. A recently published study compared switching to bupropion against combining with bupropion or augmenting with an antipsychotic aripiprazole among 1522 patients with antidepressant-refractory major depression and found that aripiprazole augmentation significantly increased response over bupropion combination or switching. Most patients in this trial were, however, chronically depressed and highly refractory (the mean duration of index episode was more than 85 months and the mean number of previous medication courses was 2.4). The trial does not, therefore, address the initial treatment of a new depressive episode.

### Strategies for achieving full remission when first-line antidepressants are not enough [^111mcX5y]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Remission rates for patients with major depressive disorder are discouragingly low. Even when first-line treatment is administered at an adequate dose for a sufficient duration, approximately two-thirds of patients will fail to achieve remission, and many who remit have residual symptoms. Clinicians must assess problems with the first treatment and select the most appropriate second-line treatment based on patient preference, clinical judgment, and any comorbid conditions. Strategies like implementing psychotherapy, switching agents, or augmenting antidepressants may help patients achieve remission. Patients may also require adjunctive therapy to target common residual symptoms such as fatigue or insomnia.

To compare the second-line strategies, we used the mixed-model repeated-measures analysis comparing model-adjusted least squares means of the PHQ-9 at week 9 among the three treatment arms. This model included the following: fixed effects of PHQ-9 at week 3, treatment, visit (as categorical), treatment-by-visit interaction, minimisation variables for step 2 randomisation. The model included individuals and sites as random effects. We applied the same modelling approach to the continuous secondary outcomes and the logistic regression model for the dichotomous secondary outcomes. In order to facilitate the clinical interpretation of the obtained odds ratio (OR), we calculated the risk difference (RD) and its CI by applying the model-adjusted OR and its CI to the event rate in the sertraline continuation arm. For the time to discontinuation, we applied Cox regression with the same covariates. We applied the Hochberg procedure for adjusting the multiple comparisons involved with three treatment arms in the primary comparison and reported adjusted P values. For step 2 analyses, we examined three pre-specified hypotheses regarding possible effect modifiers: (1) whether patients had achieved a 50% or greater reduction on PHQ-9 from week 1 to week 3, (2) whether FIBSER results indicated 'moderate' or greater impairment due to side effects or (iii) whether step 1 was high or low dose.

All efficacy and safety analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle, and all patents were analysed in the groups to which they were randomised.

### Initial treatment approaches for patients with major depressive disorder [^112J7rwi]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The mainstay of treatment for major depressive disorder has been antidepressant monotherapy or, preferably, the combination of psychotherapy and antidepressants. However, combining antidepressant agents as a first-line treatment is an emerging area of research that is not yet widely practiced. Factors for choosing an antidepressant include indication, efficacy, tolerability, and safety. Patient preference and treatment history should also be considered when deciding which initial treatment approach is appropriate.

Discussion

The SUN☺D trial involved two randomisations to examine the first- and second-line antidepressant pharmacotherapies for the acute phase treatment of hitherto untreated major depressive disorder.

The step 1 randomisation examined the impact of titrating to the minimum or maximum of the licenced dose of sertraline by week 3. In patients starting treatment for major depressive disorder, there were no important differences in effectiveness or adverse effects between these two starting sertraline doses. The results of the primary outcome at week 9 (0.25 point difference in adjusted PHQ-9 score, 95% CI − 0.58 to 1.07, P = 0.55) excluded an important difference in favour of the higher dose. Neither were there any important differences between the minimum vs the maximum target doses in side effects, burden or treatment acceptability up to either week 9 or week 25.

When patients do not remit after 3 weeks of sertraline treatment, however, adding mirtazapine or switching sertraline to mirtazapine resulted in approximately a one-point benefit in PHQ-9 at week 9, a standardised mean difference of around 0.16. This difference corresponded to RDs in response of 9.1% (95% CI 2.8–15.4%) for the combination and 8.2% (1.7–14.3%) for the switching strategy and, in remission, of 12.4% (6.1–19.0%) for the combination and 8.4% (2.5–14.8%) for the switching strategy. These values are slightly below or above the usually accepted clinically significant threshold of 10% RD, but they may be important to patients when one considers that they are differences between alternative active treatments and that RDs for antidepressants over placebo are approximately 20% only. In addition, these results were consistent with patients' self-reports by BDI-II. The benefits of combination and switching did not, however, persist after continuation treatment at the treating physician's discretion at week 25.

Statistical analysis

In order to examine the optimum initial target dose of sertraline, we analysed results from all those who were cluster-randomised at week 1 to titrate sertraline up to 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day and, had they followed the protocol, would have stayed on that sertraline dose up to week 9 — that is, those who had remitted and continued on sertraline; those who had not remitted and were randomised at week 3 to continue sertraline; and those who declined the second randomisation. We used a weighted mixed-model repeated-measures analysis to compare model-adjusted least squares means: the primary outcome was the PHQ-9 at week 9 as pre-specified in the study protocol. The model included random effects for subjects and sites and fixed effects of treatment, visit (as categorical) and treatment-by-visit interaction, adjusted for age, sex, education, marital status, number of previous depressive episodes and baseline scores at weeks 0 and 1. At the first blinded interpretation committee meeting, the statistician reported an imbalance in the baseline demographic and clinical variables. The writing committee therefore agreed, at that meeting, without knowledge of the identity of the arms and based on their prior knowledge regarding variables that may be associated with depression severity, on the following variables to be entered in the primary analysis as possible confounders: age, sex, education, marital status, number of previous depressive episodes and baseline PHQ-9 scores at weeks 0 and 1. Each observation was weighted by inverse probability of censoring (IPCW) to account for missing outcomes due to being allocated to the combination or switching arms at step 2 randomisation. The weight for IPCW was calculated by a logistic regression that included age, sex, education, marriage, number of episodes, PHQ-9 scores at weeks 0 and 1 and whether the participant was allocated to continue sertraline or otherwise at week 3 as predictors of missingness. We applied the same modelling approach to the continuous secondary outcomes. We used weighted generalised linear mixed models with the logit link and binomial distributions to account for clustering effects for the dichotomous secondary outcomes. For the time to discontinuation of the allocated or any treatment, we applied Cox regression with the same covariates and calculated the hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For step 1 analyses, we examined two subgroup hypotheses, pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan: (1) whether the PHQ-9 score at week 1 was less than or greater than 15 and (2) whether the patient had shown improvement from week 0 to week 1 at or above the median of the sample. We also conducted four sensitivity analyses employing mixed models with different assumptions, described in the statistical analysis plan.

Combination or switching strategies resulted in 6–8% fewer patients continuing the allocated treatments up to week 9 than continuing on sertraline. However, given the greater improvement in depressive symptoms with the strategies that included mirtazapine; similar global ratings of side effects among the treatment arms at weeks 9 and 25; and similar time to discontinuation of allocated treatment or any treatment when considered up to 25 weeks; this finding does not raise concern regarding the use of combination and switching strategies.

The most recent comprehensive network meta-analysis of antidepressants found that mirtazapine may have a greater response rate than sertraline (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.93–1.43) when used as first-line monotherapy. The current study findings are compatible with this network meta-analysis, and this superior efficacy of mirtazapine may be responsible for some of the benefits of switching or combination strategies over sertraline continuation found in the current study.

Some guidelines recommend dose increase within the approved range after non-response to a lower dose (, p. 356, p.53). Two previous studies have tested this strategy for sertraline and found that there was no additional benefit: one study compared 50 mg vs 150 mg of sertraline for 5 weeks after an initial 3 weeks on 50 mg and reported no difference. Another study compared 100 mg vs 200 mg of sertraline for 5 weeks after an initial 6 weeks in which patients received up to 100 mg and reported that the increase to 200 mg resulted in a lower response rate. Although the current study did not specifically address this strategy, our results with regard to the initial target dose are consistent with these previous studies.

There are limitations of our study. First, the step 1 cluster randomisation by clinic was performed at the start of the study. As a result, there was no concealment at the level of randomisation of individual patients, which explains the differences in characteristics of patients enrolled in the two arms. Clinicians at study sites allocated to the lower dose were less inclined to enrol severe patients or male patients than were clinicians at sites allocated to the higher dose. We dealt with this prognostic imbalance by adjusting for key variables in the mixed-model repeated-measures analyses and confirmed robustness of the primary findings against model assumptions through sensitivity analyses. Unknown confounders may still, however, have biased our findings, limiting strength of inference in the step 1 findings.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^112s7unP]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A further limitation is that, although it provides evidence that changing therapy after failure to remit at an early point (in our study 3 weeks) may be preferable to waiting a longer period (e.g. the oft-recommended 6 to 8 weeks), the design did not specifically address the optimal timing of the decision to switch or combine. One RCT compared switching to duloxetine immediately after non-response to 4weeks of escitalopram against continuing 4 more weeks on escitalopram and then switching if non-responsive: the two arms did not differ in their primary outcome of time to response, while there was significant increase in a secondary outcome of remission in the early switch arm than in the later switch arm. Another recent RCT examined the value of switching escitalopram to venlafaxine if patients have shown minimal improvement after 2 weeks; remission rates were 8% higher in the switched than in the continuation arm, but this difference did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to a small sample size (n = 192, p = 0.21). Thus, the optimal time to combine or switch remains uncertain.

Strengths of this pragmatic trial primarily relate to design features that enhance the real-world application of the results. We employed a large number of study sites using broad eligibility criteria, and thus enrolled sufficient patients to achieve high power to establish or refute differences between groups. Because Japan does not have a primary care system, patients with new onset depressive episodes usually consult office practice psychiatrists directly. Thus, in many other countries, primary care doctors would see and begin treatment of most participants entered in SUN☺D. In comparison to many multi-centre trials, we were able to enrol a large proportion (2011 of 7895) of potentially eligible patients. Enrolment of patients not yet treated for their current episode is another strength, eliminating a potential source of variability. For step 1 randomisation, we excluded patients who did not tolerate a low dose of sertraline, faithfully addressing the clinical question in which patients and clinicians are interested: In patients who tolerate an initial low dose of sertraline, should clinicians titrate to the maximum dose? For step 2 randomisation, we selected alternative interventions that are recommended in practice guidelines and are widely used.

### Pharmacologic management of adult depression [^111k87B8]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Major depression is a common and treatable disease. Many patients benefit from pharmacologic treatment and, because there is little variation in antidepressant effectiveness, medication choices should be made based on patient characteristics, safety, and anticipated side effects. Most patients respond favorably to treatment, but many do not have complete symptom relief. Changing medications or augmenting with a second medication is helpful for some partial or nonresponders. All antidepressants are capable of producing harmful side effects, and some are particularly prone to dangerous drug-drug interactions. The risk of suicide is always a concern in depression and this risk is not necessarily reduced by the use of antidepressants. Some persons may have an increase in suicidal thoughts with antidepressant treatment. Close follow-up is required when initiating therapy and adjusting dosages.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117EMNjg]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — Second-line treatment for adults with major depressive disorder in the acute phase who did not respond to an adequate dose of a second-generation antidepressant states that ACP suggests switching to or augmenting with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence) or switching to a different second-generation antidepressant or augmenting with a second pharmacologic treatment (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The informed decision should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms, comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences. The rationale notes that if a clinically satisfactory response or remission of symptoms (measured by validated scales, such as the PHQ-9) is not achieved with initial monotherapy with an SGA (including dose optimization), switching to monotherapy with CBT or to a different SGA or augmenting SGA monotherapy with CBT or with a second pharmacologic treatment (such as mirtazapine, bupropion, or buspirone) are reasonable approaches and show similar efficacy when compared with each other.

### Comparative benefits and harms of second-generation antidepressants for treating major depressive disorder: an updated meta-analysis [^115QcBMD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Second-generation antidepressants dominate the management of major depressive disorder (MDD), but evidence on the comparative benefits and harms of these agents is contradictory.

Purpose

To compare the benefits and harms of second-generation antidepressants for treating MDD in adults.

Data Sources

English-language studies from PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 1980 to August 2011 and reference lists of pertinent review articles and gray literature.

Study Selection

2 independent reviewers identified randomized trials of at least 6 weeks' duration to evaluate efficacy and observational studies with at least 1000 participants to assess harm.

Data Extraction

Reviewers abstracted data about study design and conduct, participants, and interventions and outcomes and rated study quality. A senior reviewer checked and confirmed extracted data and quality ratings.

Data Synthesis

Meta-analyses and mixed-treatment comparisons of response to treatment and weighted mean differences were conducted on specific scales to rate depression. On the basis of 234 studies, no clinically relevant differences in efficacy or effectiveness were detected for the treatment of acute, continuation, and maintenance phases of MDD. No differences in efficacy were seen in patients with accompanying symptoms or in subgroups based on age, sex, ethnicity, or comorbid conditions. Individual drugs differed in onset of action, adverse events, and some measures of health-related quality of life.

Limitations

Most trials were conducted in highly selected populations. Publication bias might affect the estimates of some comparisons. Mixed-treatment comparisons cannot conclusively exclude differences in efficacy. Evidence within subgroups was limited.

Conclusion

Current evidence does not warrant recommending a particular second-generation antidepressant on the basis of differences in efficacy. Differences in onset of action and adverse events may be considered when choosing a medication.

### Optimal dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine in major depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^113t99r6]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The number of people living with depression increased by around 18% between 2005 and 2015, and depression affects 322 million people, or about 4% of the world's population. Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are the two mainstays of depression treatment. In particular, second-generation antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are the first-line options in the pharmacological management of major depression.

However, there is still uncertainty about the dose dependency and optimal target dose of second-generation agents. Current practice guidelines provide conflicting recommendations: the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guideline in UK states that no dose dependency has been established within the therapeutic range of SSRIs, whereas the American Psychiatric Association (APA) guideline recommends titration up to the maximum tolerated dose: "Initial doses should be incrementally raised as tolerated until a therapeutic dose is reached… doses of antidepressant medications should be maximized, side effects permitting". Systematic and comprehensive reviews of the literature examining dose dependency of antidepressants should clarify the issue and inform the guideline recommendations. Unfortunately, the available reviews are few and their conclusions disagree. Moreover, they addressed mainly dose-efficacy relationships and gave little attention to the balance between efficacy, tolerability, and overall acceptability of treatment.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Second-generation antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are the mainstay in the pharmacological management of major depression; however, current practice guidelines provide conflicting recommendations as to their optimum target dose. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guideline in the UK states that no dose dependency has been established within the therapeutic range of SSRIs, whereas the American Psychiatric Association guideline recommends titration up to the maximum tolerated dose. We searched for reviews that analysed dose-response relationships for second-generation antidepressants in PubMed using the search terms "depressive disorder", "antidepressive agents, second-generation", and "dose-response relationship, drug", and in the references of the identified studies, up to March 21, 2019. We identified three systematic reviews: one concluded 21–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents provided maximum efficacy, another found 40–50 mg fluoxetine-equivalent dose category offered the greatest efficacy, and the third confirmed a linearly increasing dose-efficacy relationship from placebo, to low doses, to high doses of SSRIs. Only two studies examined dose dependency for adverse effects, and only one examined dose dependency for acceptability of treatment.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^116cJcjf]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

For patients starting treatment for depression, current guidelines recommend titrating the antidepressant dosage to the maximum of the licenced range if tolerated. When patients do not achieve remission within several weeks, recommendations include adding or switching to another antidepressant. However, the relative merits of these guideline strategies remain unestablished.

Methods

This multi-centre, open-label, assessor-blinded, pragmatic trial involved two steps. Step 1 used open-cluster randomisation, allocating clinics into those titrating sertraline up to 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day by week 3. Step 2 used central randomisation to allocate patients who did not remit after 3 weeks of treatment to continue sertraline, to add mirtazapine or to switch to mirtazapine. The primary outcome was depression severity measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (scores between 0 and 27; higher scores, greater depression) at week 9. We applied mixed-model repeated-measures analysis adjusted for key baseline covariates.

Results

Between December 2010 and March 2015, we recruited 2011 participants with hitherto untreated major depression at 48 clinics in Japan. In step 1, 970 participants were allocated to the 50 mg/day and 1041 to the 100 mg/day arms; 1927 (95.8%) provided primary outcomes. There was no statistically significant difference in the adjusted PHQ-9 score at week 9 between the 50 mg/day arm and the 100 mg/day arm (0.25 point, 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.58 to 1.07, P = 0.55). Other outcomes proved similar in the two groups. In step 2, 1646 participants not remitted by week 3 were randomised to continue sertraline (n = 551), to add mirtazapine (n = 537) or to switch to mirtazapine (n = 558): 1613 (98.0%) provided primary outcomes. At week 9, adding mirtazapine achieved a reduction in PHQ-9 scores of 0.99 point (0.43 to 1.55, P = 0.0012); switching achieved a reduction of 1.01 points (0.46 to 1.56, P = 0.0012), both relative to continuing sertraline. Combination increased the percentage of remission by 12.4% (6.1 to 19.0%) and switching by 8.4% (2.5 to 14.8%). There were no differences in adverse effects.

Conclusions

In patients with new onset depression, we found no advantage of titrating sertraline to 100 mg vs 50 mg. Patients unremitted by week 3 gained a small benefit in reduction of depressive symptoms at week 9 by switching sertraline to mirtazapine or by adding mirtazapine.

### Common questions about the pharmacologic management of depression in adults [^1154GbFB]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

One in 11 U.S. adults currently meets diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder, and a similar number report that they have taken an antidepressant medication in the past 30 days. In the primary care population, medications are modestly superior to placebo in achieving remission, with a number needed to treat of seven or eight for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and seven to 16 for tricyclic antidepressants. The benefit of antidepressants over placebo is more pronounced in patients with severe depression. Second-generation antidepressants are generally considered first-line therapy. Specific therapy choice should be based on cost, patient preference, and adverse effect profile. About two-thirds of patients receiving second-generation antidepressants experience at least one adverse effect during treatment. Nausea and vomiting are the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy. The optimal treatment duration is unclear, but clinical guidelines suggest four to 12 months for an initial episode of major depression. Patients with recurrent depression may benefit from prolonged treatment. High-quality evidence is lacking on the benefits and harms of antidepressant use in pregnancy. It is unclear whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use in breastfeeding mothers causes adverse effects in their infants, but sertraline and paroxetine transfer to breast milk in lower concentrations than other antidepressants. Consensus guidelines recommend a "start low, go slow" approach to antidepressant therapy in older persons; preferred medications include citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis for a clinical guideline by the American College of Physicians [^117AgbRV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary care patients and clinicians may prefer alternative options to second-generation antidepressants for major depressive disorder (MDD).

Purpose

To compare the benefits and harms of nonpharmacologic treatments with second-generation antidepressants as first-step interventions for acute MDD, and to compare second-step treatment strategies for patients who did not achieve remission after an initial attempt with antidepressants.

Data Sources

English-language studies from several electronic databases from 1 January 1990 to 8 August 2022, trial registries, gray literature databases, and reference lists to identify unpublished research.

Study Selection

2 investigators independently selected randomized trials of at least 6 weeks' duration.

Data Extraction

Reviewers abstracted data about study design and conduct, participants, interventions, and outcomes. They dually rated the risk of bias of studies and the certainty of evidence for outcomes of interest.

Data Synthesis

65 randomized trials met the inclusion criteria; eligible data from nonrandomized studies were not found. Meta-analyses and network meta-analyses indicated similar benefits of most nonpharmacologic treatments and antidepressants as first-step treatments. Antidepressants had higher risks for discontinuation because of adverse events than most other treatments. For second-step therapies, different switching and augmentation strategies provided similar symptomatic relief. The certainty of evidence for most comparisons is low; findings should be interpreted cautiously.

Limitations

Many studies had methodological limitations or dosing inequalities; publication bias might have affected some comparisons. In some cases, conclusions could not be drawn because of insufficient evidence.

Conclusion

Although benefits seem to be similar among first- and second-step MDD treatments, the certainty of evidence is low for most comparisons. Clinicians and patients should focus on options with the most reliable evidence and take adverse event profiles and patient preferences into consideration.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to management of inadequate response, ACP 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering any of the following options in patients in the acute phase of moderate-to-severe MDD not responding to initial treatment with an adequate dose of a second-generation antidepressant:

- switching to or augmenting with CBT

- switching to a different second-generation antidepressant or augmenting with a second pharmacologic treatment.

### Should this patient receive an antidepressant? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^117No1Zo]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Depression is a major public health problem and a common cause of disability. To help physicians choose among available treatment options, the American College of Physicians recently issued a guideline titled "Nonpharmacologic Versus Pharmacologic Treatment of Adult Patients with Major Depressive Disorder". The evidence review done for the guideline found no statistically significant difference in the efficacy of second-generation antidepressants (SGAs) versus most other treatments for this disorder. However, rates of adverse events and discontinuation were generally higher in patients treated with SGAs. This Beyond the Guidelines reviews the guideline and includes a discussion between 2 experts on how they would apply it to a 64-year-old man with depression who is reluctant to begin medication. They review the data on which the guideline is based, discuss the limitations of applying the data to real-world settings, review how they would incorporate patient preferences when making treatment decisions, and outline options for patients in whom first-line therapy has failed.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116h2m7R]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this guideline from the American College of Physicians (ACP) is to present updated clinical recommendations on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions as initial and second-line treatments during the acute phase of a major depressive disorder (MDD) episode, based on the best available evidence on the comparative benefits and harms, consideration of patient values and preferences, and cost.

Methods

The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on an updated systematic review of the evidence.

Audience and Patient Population

The audience for this guideline includes clinicians caring for adult patients in the acute phase of MDD in ambulatory care. The patient population includes adults in the acute phase of MDD.

Recommendation 1a

ACP recommends monotherapy with either cognitive behavioral therapy or a second-generation antidepressant as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder (strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 1b

ACP suggests combination therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy and a second-generation antidepressant as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The informed decision on the options of monotherapy with cognitive behavioral therapy versus second-generation antidepressants or combination therapy should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or fluctuation in appetite), comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences.

Recommendation 2

ACP suggests monotherapy with cognitive behavioral therapy as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of mild major depressive disorder (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP suggests one of the following options for patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder who did not respond to initial treatment with an adequate dose of a second-generation antidepressant:

- Switching to or augmenting with cognitive behavioral therapy (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence)
- Switching to a different second-generation antidepressant or augmenting with a second pharmacologic treatment (see Clinical Considerations) (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence) The informed decision on the options should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or fluctuation in appetite), comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences.

Thirdly, the tapering speed of sertraline in the switching arm was relatively slow and allowed some patients to take the combination of sertraline and mirtazapine for several weeks. The efficacy of the switching strategy might therefore be contaminated by that of the combination treatment. However, gradual tapering was appropriate for this pragmatic trial and allowed us to address the impact of interventions as clinicians would implement them in the real world.

Fourthly, one might question the generalisability of the current study findings beyond the specific drugs and dosages employed. As the initial target dose of the antidepressant, we compared the minimum and the maximum of the licenced dosage in Japan, 50 mg/day and 100 mg/day of sertraline. The maximum dosage for sertraline in the United States and in some other countries is 200 mg/day. The study specified dosing for mirtazapine between 7.5 and 45 mg, which is also lower than the dosing sometimes used in other countries. These differences may reflect differences in body weights and other ethnically specific variations in the genetic as well as non-genetic mechanisms affecting the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of psychotropic drugs. Up to now, however, inquiry has failed to identify ethnicity as a convincing modifier of antidepressant effect. Had we compared 50 mg/day vs 200 mg/day, or had we required higher dose ranges for mirtazapine, the results might have differed. However, consistent with our step 1 findings, RCTs using other drugs have in most cases also suggested no additional benefit with higher doses. It is also uncertain whether results would be similar had we chosen to begin with an antidepressant other than sertraline or chosen to combine or switch with a drug other than mirtazapine. Our step 2 findings for adding mirtazapine to sertraline are consistent with the previous systematic review examining various combination strategies. One might consider our step 2 findings for switching to mirtazapine at odds with the recent meta-analysis on this topic that found no additional benefit in switching to various antidepressants. However, the only study in this review specific to mirtazapine reported that using mirtazapine was more effective than continuing the prior medication.

Values and preferences for second-line treatment — patient expectations and public input — indicate that the rapid review identified 1 study assessing patient expectations that included a switch from one SGA to another in patients who did not respond after 8 weeks of the initial SGA, but no specific data were reported; the CGC Public Panel indicated a willingness to use second-line options if symptoms continued after initial treatment, with some members preferring augmentation with a second pharmacologic treatment citing small benefit and others preferring to avoid adding a pharmacologic treatment; the panel expressed that the recommendation allowed a flexible and personalized approach and that offering alternative options as effective as SGAs may help improve adherence and response rates.

### Drug-disease and drug-drug interactions: systematic examination of recommendations in 12 UK national clinical guidelines [^1174tPxj]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Potentially serious drug-drug interactions were much more common, but there are too many for all of them to be specifically mentioned by guidelines. From this perspective, we suggest that clinical guidelines produced and disseminated in a paper based format will only ever be able to adequately account for a minority of potential drug-drug interactions. Guideline developers should acknowledge potentially serious interactions and estimate their likely prevalence and severity. Prevalence will be determined both by whether the drug being recommended is first line (intended for all or nearly all people with the condition), by how commonly interacting drugs are used, which will depend on rates of comorbidity, and by how often the adverse drug event in question occurs. Of note is the requirement for detailed information about the real world population that the guideline is making recommendations for, which is currently much less commonly used in guideline development than trial data from narrowly selected populations. With the growth of large electronic primary care datasets, there is the option to define the population for which recommendations are being made and describe its demography, comorbidity, and current prescribing. As an example, there is a potentially serious interaction between statins recommended as first line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes and ciclosporin recommended as second line for those with rheumatoid arthritis because of the risk of myopathy (and rhabdomyolysis). Given that only 1.4% of people with type 2 diabetes also have rheumatoid arthritis and that ciclosporin is recommended as second line only for those with rheumatoid arthritis, this will only ever be a rare drug-drug interaction and so is unlikely to reach the threshold for explicit consideration by a guideline development group. In contrast, co-prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (recommended as first line treatment for patients with depression) and tramadol (recommended as second line for painful conditions) is likely to be common because tramadol is commonly used for pain in the UK and over 27% of people with depression also have painful conditions. Although serotonin syndrome is potentially fatal, the risk of this condition seems to be low, but it is poorly quantified. The guideline development group will have to make a judgment as to whether they believe the interaction requires specific mention to inform clinicians and patients to be aware of the signs and symptoms of this syndrome should they occur. The key issue is that interactions and risks should be systematically assessed and explicit decisions made about whether they require discussion in a guideline, similar to the requirement for treatment benefits to be systematically and explicitly assessed. Details of expected harm from the identified potentially serious drug-drug interactions (such as those in appendix 2) should be considered to inform clinicians about alternative drug choices or to inform their discussions with individual patients.

### Optimal dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine in major depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^112vEbnF]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Depression is the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss worldwide. Second-generation antidepressants are the first-line option for pharmacological management of depression. Optimising their use is crucial in reducing the burden of depression; however, debate about their dose dependency and their optimal target dose is ongoing. We have aimed to summarise the currently available best evidence to inform this clinical question.

Methods

We did a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of double-blind, randomised controlled trials that examined fixed doses of five selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline), venlafaxine, or mirtazapine in the acute treatment of adults (aged 18 years or older) with major depression, identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, AMED, PSYNDEX, websites of drug licensing agencies and pharmaceutical companies, and trial registries. We imposed no language restrictions, and the search was updated until Jan 8, 2016. Doses of SSRIs were converted to fluoxetine equivalents. Trials of antidepressants for patients with depression and a serious concomitant physical illness were excluded. The main outcomes were efficacy (treatment response defined as 50% or greater reduction in depression severity), tolerability (dropouts due to adverse effects), and acceptability (dropouts for any reasons), all after a median of 8 weeks of treatment (range 4–12 weeks). We used a random-effects, dose-response meta-analysis model with flexible splines for SSRIs, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine.

Findings

28 554 records were identified through our search (24 524 published and 4030 unpublished records). 561 published and 121 unpublished full-text records were assessed for eligibility, and 77 studies were included (19 364 participants; mean age 42.5 years, SD 11.0; 7156 [60.9%] of 11 749 reported were women). For SSRIs (99 treatment groups), the dose-efficacy curve showed a gradual increase up to doses between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents, and a flat to decreasing trend through the higher licensed doses up to 80 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Dropouts due to adverse effects increased steeply through the examined range. The relationship between the dose and dropouts for any reason indicated optimal acceptability for the SSRIs in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Venlafaxine (16 treatment groups) had an initially increasing dose-efficacy relationship up to around 75–150 mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for mirtazapine (11 treatment groups) efficacy increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. Both venlafaxine and mirtazapine showed optimal acceptability in the lower range of their licensed dose. These results were robust to several sensitivity analyses.

Interpretation

For the most commonly used second-generation antidepressants, the lower range of the licensed dose achieves the optimal balance between efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability in the acute treatment of major depression.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116dE1Ni]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Major depressive disorder — economic burden and early-treatment patterns are summarized as follows: The estimated economic burden attributable to MDD in the United States was $120 billion in 2020, including direct medical and pharmaceutical costs ($36 billion) of treating MDD, suicide-related costs ($13 billion), and effects on workplace productivity ($70 billion). Primary care clinicians most frequently prescribe second-generation antidepressants (SGAs) for initial (first-line) treatment, yet approximately up to 70% of patients with MDD do not achieve remission and remain in the acute phase after the initial pharmacologic treatment attempt.

### Antidepressant combinations: cutting edge psychopharmacology or passing fad? [^112XAEf8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

This article reviews the rationale for and history of combining antidepressants, as well as the current state of the evidence, in the treatment of major depression. Although it has long been suggested that some individuals may benefit from regimens that combine two dissimilar antidepressants, enthusiasm for this practice has waxed and waned and there was never a strong empirical foundation to support this practice. The tangibly better safety profiles of the newer generation antidepressants, both singly and in combination, have permitted greater use of such combinations in contemporary practice than ever before. Combinations that pair a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) with a dissimilar antidepressant, such as bupropion or mirtazapine, are now widely used for patients who have not responded to trials of first- or second-line antidepressant monotherapies and have been tested as a potential way of speeding the benefits of treatment. However, there still is no strong evidence that even the most widely used combinations have particular merit and clinicians should be mindful that alternatives exist with more established efficacy. Moreover, aside from selected cases of drug-drug interactions, it may take full therapeutic doses of both drugs across a typically adequate duration of exposure to achieve the desired effects of combined treatment.

### Mental health gap action programme (mhGAP) guideline for mental, neurological and substance use disorders [^111Qj9fv]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering psychological interventions or combined treatment in adults with moderate-to-severe depression based on individual preferences and careful consideration of the balance of benefits and harms. Consider offering monotherapy with antidepressants only when psychological interventions are not available while keeping in mind the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressants and individual preferences.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) clinical guidelines for the management of major depressive disorder in adults. III. pharmacotherapy [^113PVR2R]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In 2001, the Canadian Psychiatric Association and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) partnered to produce evidence-based clinical guidelines for the treatment of depressive disorders. A revision of these guidelines was undertaken by CANMAT in 2008–2009 to reflect advances in the field.

Methods

The CANMAT guidelines are based on a question-answer format to enhance accessibility to clinicians. An evidence-based format was used with updated systematic reviews of the literature and recommendations were graded according to Level of Evidence using pre-defined criteria. Lines of Treatment were identified based on criteria that included Levels of Evidence and expert clinical support. This section on "Pharmacotherapy" is one of 5 guideline articles.

Results

Despite emerging data on efficacy and tolerability differences amongst newer antidepressants, variability in patient response precludes identification of specific first choice medications for all patients. All second-generation antidepressants have Level 1 evidence to support efficacy and tolerability and most are considered first-line treatments for MDD. First-generation tricyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants are not the focus of these guidelines but generally are considered second- or third-line treatments. For inadequate or incomplete response, there is Level 1 evidence for switching strategies and for add-on strategies including lithium and atypical antipsychotics.

Limitations

Most of the evidence is based on trials for registration and may not reflect real-world effectiveness.

Conclusions

Second-generation antidepressants are safe, effective and well tolerated treatments for MDD in adults. Evidence-based switching and add-on strategies can be used to optimize response in MDD that is inadequately responsive to monotherapy.

### Switching treatments for complicated depression [^116REw2c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The majority of depressed patients will not experience remission when treated with a first-line antidepressant. As a next-step strategy for patients who achieve partial response to the initial antidepressant, clinicians may opt to augment the first antidepressant with another medication or combine it with a second antidepressant. For nonresponders or for patients experiencing intolerable side effects, clinicians may choose to switch medications. Switching can be done within the same drug class to obtain different pharmacologic properties, or to another class to obtain a different neurochemical effect. Switching appears to be fairly well tolerated and effective for patients with treatment-resistant depression, but should be tailored to the individual patient's needs and preferences.

### A review of the current guidelines for depression treatment [^112PXfBN]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A variety of American and European guidelines are available for clinicians treating major depressive disorder and depressive subtypes. Major Western guidelines published since 2000 make similar recommendations for all stages of treatment for depression, including a reliance on measurement-based care. First-line treatment is usually a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, psychotherapy, or a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Next-step treatment recommendations are switching or augmentation, depending on patient response to the initial treatment. Maintenance therapy continues the approach that led to remission. The American Psychiatric Association will release a new treatment guideline to offer information on developments made since the last guidelines were published in 2000. Despite progress made during the last decade, no major breakthroughs in the treatment of depression have occurred, and genetic testing developments allowing for personalized care remain the goal of research.

### Comparative benefits and harms of second generation antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapies in initial treatment of major depressive disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114AUyaz]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder is the most prevalent and disabling form of depression, affecting more than 32 million Americans. In any given year, nearly 7% of the American adult population has an episode of major depressive disorder, but only about half of these people seek care. For patients who do obtain care, only 20% receive adequate treatment. Based on available evidence based guidelines, this would include either drug therapy (at least two months of an appropriate drug for major depressive disorder plus more than four visits to any type of physician) or psychotherapy (at least eight visits with any healthcare professional lasting an average of at least 30 minutes).

Treatment for major depressive disorder is often started in a primary care setting, and patients generally receive drugs as the standard treatment. Of the available antidepressants, second generation antidepressants are the most commonly prescribed agents. These drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and other drugs with related mechanisms of action that target specific neurotransmitters. Although these drugs have different mechanisms of action, evidence suggests that no substantial differences in benefits exist among them as a class.

Although drug therapy is the treatment most frequently offered to depressed primary care patients, data from studies of antidepressant drugs show that approximately 20% of patients do not fill their prescriptions. Moreover, even if they start a course of treatment, they may discontinue early before receiving an adequate course. One reason for lack of adherence to second generation antidepressants is the frequency and severity of side effects. More than 60% of patients have at least one adverse effect during treatment with a second generation antidepressant. Although most adverse effects are minor (for example, constipation, diarrhea, and dizziness), they frequently lead to discontinuation of treatment.

Patients' preferences for starting or switching treatment may also play a key role in acceptance and continuation of treatment for major depressive disorder. Some research suggests that patients might prefer treatment with psychotherapy over drugs. Reasons for preferring psychotherapy over drugs include concerns about side effects and perceived "addictiveness" of drugs. In addition, women and ethnic minorities may be more likely to prefer psychotherapies over drugs. Regardless of which treatment patients prefer, some evidence suggests that patients who receive their treatment of choice fare better than those whose treatment is incongruous with their preferences.

### Using second-generation antidepressants to treat depressive disorders: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^113927Jk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians developed this guideline to present the available evidence on the pharmacologic management of the acute, continuation, and maintenance phases of major depressive disorder; dysthymia; subsyndromal depression; and accompanying symptoms, such as anxiety, insomnia, or neurovegetative symptoms, by using second-generation antidepressants.

Methods

Published literature on this topic was identified by using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 1980 to April 2007. Searches were limited to English-language studies in adults older than 19 years of age. Keywords for search included terms for depressive disorders and 12 specific second-generation antidepressants-bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone, and venlafaxine-and their specific trade names. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations by using the American College of Physicians clinical practice guidelines grading system. RECOMMENDATION 1: The American College of Physicians recommends that when clinicians choose pharmacologic therapy to treat patients with acute major depression, they select second-generation antidepressants on the basis of adverse effect profiles, cost, and patient preferences (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 2: The American College of Physicians recommends that clinicians assess patient status, therapeutic response, and adverse effects of antidepressant therapy on a regular basis beginning within 1 to 2 weeks of initiation of therapy (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 3: The American College of Physicians recommends that clinicians modify treatment if the patient does not have an adequate response to pharmacotherapy within 6 to 8 weeks of the initiation of therapy for major depressive disorder (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 4: The American College of Physicians recommends that clinicians continue treatment for 4 to 9 months after a satisfactory response in patients with a first episode of major depressive disorder. For patients who have had 2 or more episodes of depression, an even longer duration of therapy may be beneficial (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

### Major depressive disorder treatment guidelines in America and Europe [^117HqvqH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The various major American and European guidelines for the treatment of depression provide similar basic principles of treatment, which include individualizing the treatment plan, preparing the patient for potential long-term treatment, providing measurement-based care, and treating to remission. While the guidelines are all evidence-based, certain factors can influence differences in specific recommendations, such as the consensus group's composition, underlying mandates, and cultural attitudes. The similarities and differences among 6 sets of guidelines from Europe and the Americas published in the past decade are reviewed here (American Psychiatric Association, British Association for Psychopharmacology, Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, Texas Medication Algorithm Project, and World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry). In the guidelines, mild depression has the most variance in treatment recommendations; some, but not all, guidelines suggest that it may resolve with exercise or watchful waiting, but psychotherapy or antidepressants could be used if initial efforts fail. Moderate and severe major depression carry broadly similar recommendations among the guidelines. First-line treatment recommendations for moderate major depressive disorder include antidepressant monotherapy, psychotherapy, and the combination of both. Severe depression may require the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, electroconvulsive therapy, or the combination of an antidepressant and psychotherapy. Benzodiazepines play a very limited role in the treatment of depression; if the patient has catatonic depression, acutely suicidal depression, or depression with symptoms of anxiety, agitation, or insomnia, benzodiazepines are recommended by some guidelines for short-term treatment only.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117S8eb5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — acute-phase major depressive disorder monitoring and management directives are as follows: Monitor for new or increased suicidal or self-harming thoughts and behaviors during the first 1 to 2 months of treatment (25, 54, 55). Periodically assess adherence to treatment (with both SGAs and CBT). For patients in the acute phase of mild MDD for whom CBT is not available or feasible, monotherapy with an SGA is a reasonable alternative approach. Reevaluate symptoms to monitor treatment efficacy (response and remission) and potential adverse events using validated scales, such as the PHQ-9, and clinical history. Once remission is achieved with an SGA, clinicians should continue the treatment strategy for at least an additional 4 to 9 months (25). When SGA treatment is discontinued, the dose should be gradually decreased (tapered) to minimize withdrawal symptoms. When using augmentation as a second-line treatment in patients who do not respond to initial treatment, consider augmentation of an SGA with mirtazapine, bupropion, or buspirone. Refer patients who have severe symptoms, marked functional impairment, or risk for self-harm to mental health services. Encourage exercise as a healthy lifestyle practice for adults with MDD. Consider team-based collaborative care involving appropriate psychiatric care and mental health specialists, such as psychiatrists, in adults with MDD.

American College of Physicians guideline — key questions on comparative effectiveness and harms in major depressive disorder (MDD) specify: for adults attempting initial treatment, the effectiveness of SGA monotherapy compared with nonpharmacologic monotherapy or combination therapy (Key Question 1a) and whether comparative effectiveness varies by MDD severity (1b); for adults who did not achieve remission after an initial adequate trial with 1 SGA, the comparative effectiveness of second-line therapies (2a) and whether comparative effectiveness varies by MDD severity (2b); the comparative risks for harms for those attempting initial treatment or those who did not achieve remission after an initial adequate trial with an SGA (3a) and whether comparative risks vary by MDD severity (3b); and whether benefits and risks differ by subgroups defined by psychiatric symptoms or demographics (4). The Clinical Guidelines Committee was particularly interested in comparative effectiveness of treatment according to MDD severity because screening is becoming more widespread and may increase diagnosis of milder MDD.

A search of MEDLINE (1966-August 2010) and EMBASE (1980-August 2010) was conducted, using the terms risperidone and major depressive disorder. In addition, a manual search of the references cited in each publication identified from the database search was conducted to identify relevant articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language, peer-reviewed publications identified from the data sources were evaluated. Four clinical trials and 1 subanalysis of a clinical trial were included for analysis.

Data Synthesis

Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that displays antidepressant properties due to its activity at various serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors. Studies have demonstrated that risperidone augmentation may be effective and safe when used at low doses. Although several of the studies identified had limited sample sizes, all studies demonstrated improvement on various standardized depressive symptom assessment scales. Study durations ranged from 4 to 24 weeks, with doses ranging from 0.25 to 2 mg/day. The most common adverse effects associated with risperidone therapy were headache, dry mouth, and increased appetite.

Conclusions

Clinical evidence suggests that the use of risperidone as adjunctive therapy for treatment-resistant depression may improve rates of response and remission, but long-term effectiveness and safety cannot be determined at this time. Therefore, an adequate trial of first-line agents from different classes and/or a combination of agents from different classes would be recommended prior to initiation of risperidone. If the decision is made to start risperidone, health-care providers should ensure that patients are educated regarding the potential benefits and adverse effects before initiating risperidone.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^1149nZgo]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — Recommendation 1b for initial treatment of moderate to severe major depressive disorder states: ACP suggests combination therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy and a second-generation antidepressant as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The informed decision on the options of monotherapy with cognitive behavioral therapy versus second-generation antidepressants or combination therapy should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or fluctuation in appetite), comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences.

American College of Physicians guideline — Initial treatments for adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder states that ACP recommends monotherapy with either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or a second-generation antidepressant (SGA) as initial treatment in patients with moderate to severe major depressive disorder. ACP suggests combination therapy with CBT and an SGA as initial treatment in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder. ACP also suggests monotherapy with CBT as initial treatment in the acute phase of mild major depressive disorder. The informed decision among CBT, SGAs, or combination therapy should be personalized and based on discussion of benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, specific symptoms, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and patient preferences.

### Are old-old patients with major depression more likely to relapse than young-old patients during continuation treatment with escitalopram? [^114r78zT]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Older adults with depression often have several chronic disorders and are more treatment-resistant. These patients also have a higher risk of medication side effects, due to co-morbid medical conditions and age-associated changes in organ function. Moreover, a higher risk for drug-drug interactions may cause them to terminate treatment prematurely.

Second generation antidepressants [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)] are recommended as first-line treatments in clinical practice guidelines and are most commonly prescribed for depressive disorders in older patients. Nevertheless, until 2003, only one large placebo-controlled trial of a non-tricyclic antidepressant, marketed in the US, in outpatients 60 years of age or older with major depressive disorder had been published. The first trials of second-generation antidepressants, including a large study of patients aged 75 years and above treated with citalopram, reported no advantage over placebo or small drug-placebo differences, hence the clinical value of these agents in treating older depressed adults was uncertain.

A later meta-analysis of 10 randomised placebo-controlled trials in depressed patients aged 60 years and older concluded that antidepressants are more effective than placebo, although effects were modest and variable. A major limitation was that the average age of patients in these trials ranged from 60 to 72 years, with only a small number over 75. Late-life spans a broad age range and can be divided into young-old (60–74 years), and old-old (≥ 75 years). Among the old-old, antidepressant treatment may be especially complicated because of the high frequency and severity of co-morbid conditions, such as cognitive impairment or heart disease.

In addition to being well tolerated as an antidepressant in older persons, escitalopram is effective in preventing relapse of MDD in patients ≥ 65 years. The latter study, as well as open-label data, suggests that escitalopram is safe and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of older patients with MDD.

In order to compare the efficacy and safety of escitalopram in the old-old with the young-old, we undertook a secondary analysis of a published clinical trial. The primary aim was to compare the effect of escitalopram in preventing relapse of MDD among young-old and old-old patients. A secondary objective was to compare the initial response to open-label escitalopram in these two age groups. We hypothesized that old-old and young-old patients on escitalopram would have comparable benefits with regard to prevention of relapse and initial remission.

### Comparative benefits and harms of second generation antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapies in initial treatment of major depressive disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113BKPJD]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Finally, comparative effectiveness at a group level did not detect a difference between second generation antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapies, but how best to tailor this information to an individual patient is still not clear, especially given the low strength of evidence for most of the included outcomes. Preliminary evidence suggests that biomarkers may have a role in predicting response to cognitive behavioral therapy compared with second generation antidepressants, but these findings have yet to be replicated or implemented in clinical practice. Analyses of individual patient level data are best suited to answer that question and should be done in the future. Although we searched for unpublished literature, publication bias and selective outcome reporting may still be potential limiting factors. Finally, because we did not compare active treatment with placebo or no treatment, we cannot rule out the possibility that cognitive behavioral therapy and second generation antidepressants may be similarly ineffective. However, because evidence of benefit from both treatments exists, a provider would be unlikely recommend no treatment instead.

Conclusions and policy implications

In clinical decision making, providers should consider not only the efficacy of second generation antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy interventions but also patients' preferences about potential adverse events, the costs and availability of each treatment, and expected treatment effects. Currently, the biggest barrier to offering psychotherapy either alone or in combination with drugs may be how well patients can gain access to such mental healthcare clinicians. Given that the benefits of second generation antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy do not seem to differ significantly in treating major depressive disorder and that primary care patients may have personal preferences for one first line treatment over the other, both treatments should be made accessible, either alone or in combination, to primary care patients with major depressive disorder.

Having access to psychotherapeutic interventions in the primary care setting might improve treatment outcomes for patients with major depressive disorder. It has the potential to improve use of psychiatric consultations and therapy and to enhance coordination of care between primary care clinicians and mental health professionals. It may also have additional downstream effects of reducing the stigma associated with mental illness in general, empowering patients to tackle the symptoms and problems associated not only with depression but also with other mental health related concerns and encouraging them to seek and maintain treatment more quickly at an earlier stage of their illness.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^1168irY6]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Adult depression — Kaiser Permanente Care Management Institute guideline recommends either antidepressant medication or psychotherapy (cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, or problem-solving therapy) as first line treatments for patients whose major depressive disorder is mild to moderate, and recommends a combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy for patients with chronic or severe major depressive disorder. According to that guideline, first line medication classes can include tricyclics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), or dopamine agonist, and it does not recommend for or against St. John's Wort (hypericum) for mild to moderate major depressive disorder but recommends against St. John's Wort for severe major depressive disorder. The guideline recommends consulting with specialized behavioral health providers for patients with suicidal ideation, plans, intent, or previous suicide attempts. For persistent and impairing symptoms after first line treatment, it discusses second line options including augmenting treatment, increasing antidepressant dosage, and switching treatments; it recommends against augmenting with pindolol and does not recommend for or against providing atypical antipsychotics or inositol or folate as second line treatments.

### Evidence-based guidelines for treating depressive disorders with antidepressants: a revision of the 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines [^112SK9Qc]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

A revision of the 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology evidence-based guidelines for treating depressive disorders with antidepressants was undertaken in order to incorporate new evidence and to update the recommendations where appropriate. A consensus meeting involving experts in depressive disorders and their management was held in September 2012. Key areas in treating depression were reviewed and the strength of evidence and clinical implications were considered. The guidelines were then revised after extensive feedback from participants and interested parties. A literature review is provided which identifies the quality of evidence upon which the recommendations are made. These guidelines cover the nature and detection of depressive disorders, acute treatment with antidepressant drugs, choice of drug versus alternative treatment, practical issues in prescribing and management, next-step treatment, relapse prevention, treatment of relapse and stopping treatment. Significant changes since the last guidelines were published in 2008 include the availability of new antidepressant treatment options, improved evidence supporting certain augmentation strategies (drug and non-drug), management of potential long-term side effects, updated guidance for prescribing in elderly and adolescent populations and updated guidance for optimal prescribing. Suggestions for future research priorities are also made.

VA/DoD major depressive disorder (MDD) guideline — perinatal and geriatric populations: For individuals with mild to moderate MDD who are breastfeeding or pregnant, we recommend offering an evidence-based psychotherapy as a first-line treatment (see Recommendation 7). In patients with a history of MDD prior to pregnancy who responded to antidepressant medications, and are currently stable on pharmacotherapy, weigh risk/benefit balance to both mother and fetus in treatment decisions. For older adults (≥ 65 years) with mild to moderate MDD, we suggest offering a first-line psychotherapy (see Recommendation 7). Patient preference and the additional safety risks of pharmacotherapy should be considered when making this decision.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^112o36JE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — scope and evidence base are stated as follows: The purpose of this guideline is to present updated clinical recommendations on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions as initial and second-line treatments during the acute phase of an MDD episode, based on the best available evidence on the comparative benefits and harms, consideration of patient values and preferences, and costs. This update adds new key questions on patient values and preferences and costs of interventions and incorporates network meta-analyses on initial treatment strategies, and it evaluates the comparative effectiveness between treatment options but does not evaluate the effectiveness of the included treatments compared with no treatment. For initial treatment, the systematic review limited pharmacologic treatment to SGAs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; and others such as bupropion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, trazodone, vilazodone, and vortioxetine.

American College of Physicians guideline — Rationale for mild major depressive disorder states that the CGC extrapolated from evidence because most studies enrolled patients with moderate to severe MDD and downgraded the overall certainty of evidence to low and the recommendation strength to conditional due to lack of direct evidence in mild MDD. The CGC had concerns about adverse effects of SGAs in these patients and suggests that initial SGA use should be based on additional considerations, such as limited access to or cost of CBT, history of moderate or severe MDD, or patient preferences.

### Psychedelics and ketamine / esketamine in depressive disorders: biological mechanisms and associated neuroimaging and clinical changes [^113BdoTe]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

First-line non-pharmacological treatments for mild cases include psychoeducation, self-management, and psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy.

Pharmacological treatments should be considered for mild depression, considering the patient's preference, previous response to antidepressants, or lack of response to non-pharmacological interventions. Other factors include the patient's clinical features and dimensions, any comorbid conditions, and intrinsic drug-related factors (e.g. comparative efficacy/tolerability and interactions with other medications). Currently, the first-line recommendations for pharmacotherapy for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) include: selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs); Serotonin and Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) like venlafaxine, and duloxetine; the Noradrenaline and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor (NDRI) bupropion; the Noradrenergic and Specific Serotonergic Antidepressant (NaSSA) mirtazapine; and the Serotonin Modulator and Stimulator (SMS) vortioxetine. Recommended second-line agents include Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) and the Serotonin Antagonist and the Reuptake Inhibitor Antidepressant (SARI) trazodone, which show all more side effects compared to first-line treatments. Finally, due to the higher side-effect burden and potentially severe drug and dietary interactions, third-line recommendations include monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). 'Adjunctive strategies' refers to the addition of a second medication to the initial medication, i.e. adding a second antidepressant to the first or adding another medication that is not an antidepressant (i.e. aripiprazole, lithium, or quetiapine, etc.), taking into consideration both efficacy and tolerability.

Despite the availability of various therapeutic options, approximately 30–50% of patients with depression do not achieve complete symptom remission even after multiple treatment steps. This has led to a significant 'revolution' in the field of antidepressant therapies over recent years, with the exploration of new, rapid-acting treatments based on pharmacodynamic mechanisms that differ from conventional monoaminergic treatments.

### Pharmacological approaches to manage persistent symptoms of major depressive disorder: rationale and therapeutic strategies [^11348yug]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent chronic psychiatric illness associated with significant morbidity, mortality, loss of productivity, and diminished quality of life. Typically, only a minority of patients responds to treatment and meet criteria for remission as residual symptoms may persist, the result of an inadequate course of treatment and/or the presence of persistent side effects. The foremost goal of treatment should be to restore patients to full functioning and eliminate or relieve all MDD symptoms, while being virtually free of troublesome side effects. The current available pharmacological options to manage persistent depressive symptoms include augmentation or adjunctive combination strategies, both of which target selected psychobiological systems and specific mood and somatic symptoms experienced by the patient. As well, non-pharmacological interventions including psychotherapies may be used in either first-line or adjunctive approaches. However, the evidence to date with respect to available adjunct therapies is limited by few studies and those published have utilized only a small number of subjects and lack enough data to allow for a consensus of expert opinion. This underlines the need for further longer term, large population-based studies and those that include comorbid populations, all of which are seen in real world community psychiatry.

4.4.3 Step 3: add on or switch therapy (alternate first‐line agents)

Across several different medications for bipolar depression, early improvement (after 2 weeks) has been found to be a reasonable predictor of overall response, whereas lack of early improvement is a more robust predictor of non‐response. 255 Lamotrigine is the exception to this rule, given a necessary slow titration initiating the medication. In the case of non‐response, dosing should be optimized and issues of non‐adherence identified and addressed (see Section 2) prior to adjusting treatment strategies.

When determining whether an agent should be switched or another first‐line agent be added on to any current treatment, the effectiveness of each of the medications needs to be understood in the context of all the goals of managing BD. It is often the case that a medication may be selected to address several goals; for instance, lithium could be added for acute depression with intent to also bolster anti‐manic prophylaxis. In this scenario, if lithium is ineffective in the individual patient for an acute bipolar depression but is also being used over the long term for anti‐manic prophylaxis, then an "add‐on" intervention should be the next treatment for the acute bipolar depression. If, for instance, the anti‐manic prophylaxis is already being fully provided by an atypical antipsychotic, then the new medication could replace lithium via a switch strategy. Decision‐making must also address efficacy for comorbid conditions, as well as tolerability concerns. In principle, all things being equal, a switch is preferred over add‐on to limit the degree of polypharmacy, but the clinical reality is that medications may be helpful for some but not all components of the illness, and using rational polypharmacy via add‐on treatments is often required. For situations in which patients experience a depressive episode while already receiving an adequately dosed antidepressant, strong consideration should be given to discontinuing or switching the class of antidepressant, unless clear benefits are apparent in reducing the severity or frequency of depressive episodes. Switch of medications should be done in an overlap and taper manner unless there is medical necessity for abrupt discontinuation. 257

All first‐line options should be tried in adequate doses for an adequate duration of time before considering second‐line options either as an add‐on or switch strategy.

### Comparative effectiveness of pharmacogenomic-guided versus unguided antidepressant treatment in major depressive disorder: new insights from subgroup and cumulative meta-analyses [^116FMRYW]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder marked by persistent sadness, loss of interest and emotional and physical symptoms that severely impact daily functioning, affecting one out of five individuals in their lifetime. The standard of care for MDD involves a combination of evidence-based interventions, primarily pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Psychotherapeutic approaches, such as cognitive–behavioural therapy and interpersonal therapy, are effective in treating mild-to-moderate depression and in preventing relapse. Pharmacotherapy is essential for moderate-to-severe cases, offering rapid symptom relief and neurochemical balance. It typically begins with first-line antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, due to their broad efficacy and favourable side-effect profiles. For patients who do not respond to initial therapy or who have specific clinical indications, alternatives such as tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and atypical antidepressants may be considered. Despite the widespread use of antidepressants, substantial variability in treatment response remains, with 30%–40% of patients failing to achieve adequate response or remission, partly due to genetic differences impacting drug efficacy and side effects. This variability, coupled with a trial-and-error approach to prescribing, can result in delayed relief, prolonged suffering and an elevated suicide risk. These challenges highlight the urgent need for more precise, personalised treatment strategies to improve outcomes for individuals with MDD.

### The Korean medication algorithm for depressive disorder: second revision [^111bLM5z]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

This study constitutes a revision of the guidelines for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) issued by the Korean Medication Algorithm Project for Depressive Disorder (KMAP-DD) 2006. In incorporates changes in the experts׳ consensus that occurred between 2006 and 2012 as well as information regarding newly developed and recently published clinical trials.

Methods

Using a 44-item questionnaire, an expert consensus was obtained on pharmacological treatment strategies for (1) non-psychotic MDD, (2) psychotic MDD, (3) dysthymia and depression subtypes, (4) continuous and maintenance treatment, and (5) special populations; consensus was also obtained regarding (6) the choice of an antidepressant (AD) in the context of safety and adverse effects, and (7) non-pharmacological biological therapies.

Results

AD monotherapy was recommended as the first-line strategy for nonpsychotic depression in adults, children and adolescents, elderly adults, and patients with postpartum depression or premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The combination of AD and atypical antipsychotics (AAP) was recommended for psychotic depression. The duration of the initial AD treatment for psychotic depression depends on the number of depressive episodes. Most experts recommended stopping the initial AD and AAP therapy after a certain period in patients with one or two depressive episodes. However, for those with three or more episodes, maintenance of the initial treatment was recommended for as long as possible. Monotherapy with various selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) was recommended for dysthymic disorder and melancholic type MDD.

Conclusion

The pharmacological treatment strategy of KMAP-DD 2012 is similar to that of KMAP-DD 2006; however, the preference for the first-line use of AAPs was stronger in 2012 than in 2006.

### Cost-effectiveness of first-and second-step treatment strategies for major depressive disorder: a rapid review [^115MYZpm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most prevalent, disabling form of depression, with a high economic effect.

Purpose

To assess evidence on cost-effectiveness of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions as first- and second-step treatments in patients with MDD.

Data Sources

Multiple electronic databases limited to English language were searched (1 January 2015 to 29 November 2022).

Study Selection

Two investigators independently screened the literature. Seven economic modeling studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria.

Data Extraction

Data abstraction by a single investigator was confirmed by a second; 2 investigators independently rated risk of bias. One investigator determined certainty of evidence, and another checked for plausibility.

Data Synthesis

Seven modeling studies met the eligibility criteria. In a U.S. setting over a 5-year time horizon, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was cost-effective compared with second-generation antidepressants (SGAs) as a first-step treatment from the societal and health care sector perspectives. However, the certainty of evidence is low, and the findings should be interpreted cautiously. For second-step treatment, only switch strategies between SGAs were assessed. The evidence is insufficient to draw any conclusions.

Limitations

Methodologically heterogeneous studies, which compared only CBT and some SGAs, were included. No evidence on other psychotherapies or complementary and alternative treatments as first-step treatment or augmentation strategies as second-step treatment was available.

Conclusion

Although CBT may be cost-effective compared with SGAs as a first-step treatment at a 5-year time horizon from the societal and health care sector perspectives, the certainty of evidence is low, and the findings need to be interpreted cautiously. For other comparisons, the evidence was entirely missing or insufficient to draw conclusions.

### International consensus statement on major depressive disorder [^113T3BEW]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Because considerable variability exists between countries in the management of major depressive disorder, experts in psychiatry gathered for the International Consensus Group on Depression to outline a universal treatment algorithm for this illness. The experts decided to adapt the existing treatment algorithm developed in Japan and discuss strategies for clinical issues that have been problematic in some countries. Specific recommendations were made by the consensus group for screening for, diagnosing, and treating depression, which include periodically screening all patients for depression, completing a differential diagnosis of depression, referring to a psychiatric specialist if needed, establishing a therapeutic alliance with patients and their families, choosing and optimizing the dose of appropriate antidepressants based on individual patient's needs, and incorporating nonpharmacologic treatment strategies as necessary.

### Managing partial response or nonresponse: switching, augmentation, and combination strategies for major depressive disorder [^113Cf2Ty]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the multitude of agents approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder, approximately 50% of patients experience no response to treatment with a first-line antidepressant. Clinicians have 4 broad pharmacologic strategies to choose from for treating antidepressant nonresponders: increasing the dose of the antidepressant, switching to a different antidepressant, augmenting the treatment regimen with a nonantidepressant agent, and combining the original antidepressant with a second antidepressant. To date, the most comprehensively studied treatment strategy for nonresponse or partial response to antidepressants is augmentation with atypical antipsychotic agents, including aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. However, augmentation or combination with other agents such as mirtazapine, mianserin, and omega-3 fatty acids is also supported by considerable efficacy data. Lithium, desipramine, triiodothyronine, and modafinil have mixed data. While more studies are needed, agents such as bupropion, desipramine, mecamylamine, and testosterone look promising. Switching antidepressants, especially to the newer agents, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine, is also supported by considerable efficacy data. Clinicians should carefully reevaluate patients with major depressive disorder who are nonresponders to treatment, particularly those who have had several adequate trials. When choosing the best treatment strategy for antidepressant nonresponders, clinicians should take into account the efficacy and tolerability of treatment as well as patient preference and treatment history. Finally, the risk of potential loss of partial therapeutic benefit from the first-line antidepressant, as well as the risk of withdrawal symptoms, should be taken into account when considering switching antidepressants, while the risk of drug interactions and poor adherence should be taken into account when considering combination and augmentation treatments.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^112jofy1]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

AACAP guideline — SSRI switching, monitoring, discontinuation, and treatment duration in children and adolescents with depressive disorders notes that there is "no definitive empirical guidance for switching from one SSRI to another", and while tapering and discontinuing the first SSRI before adding the second (with a fluoxetine washout) is the most conservative strategy, "Cross-tapering may avoid these outcomes, but should be closely monitored". When a concerning adverse effect could be linked to medication, the dose "would be reduced", and if it persists, the medication "would be discontinued", with monitoring recommended and "no specific laboratory tests" in the absence of relevant comorbidities. For continuation, a generally accepted approach is to continue an effective dose for "approximately 6 to 12 months after remission", with discontinuation "during a relatively stress-free period", and longer maintenance "from more than 1 year to several years or longer" in higher-risk presentations. Discontinuation syndrome has been reported after missed doses or abrupt stopping of short-acting SSRIs "notably paroxetine but also (to a lesser extent) fluvoxamine and sertraline", warranting "close adherence… and a slow discontinuation taper", whereas "fluoxetine… is unlikely to be associated with discontinuation syndrome" and has not shown withdrawal symptoms when doses are missed.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^113VEmQd]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

American Psychiatric Association (APA) guideline — adult major depressive disorder (MDD) treatment sequencing is as follows: For mild to moderate MDD, first line pharmacotherapy treatments include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (except fluvoxamine), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, mirtazapine, and bupropion; if a patient has not demonstrated sufficient response after 4 to 6 weeks of trying a pharmacotherapy, the patient should switch to another medication or to psychotherapy or augment with another medication or psychotherapy. Patient preference should be used to determine psychotherapy format (individual or group), and computer-based cognitive-behavioral therapy can be offered as a first-line treatment or as an augmentation to treatment for mild to moderate MDD; for those who decline or are unable to access first line recommended psychotherapies or pharmacotherapies, the guideline suggests offering short term psychodynamic psychotherapy or nondirective supportive psychotherapy. In treating severe or chronic or recurrent complex MDD the guideline recommends a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.

### Beneficial and harmful effects of tricyclic antidepressants for adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^1144dxYs]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder is a psychiatric condition characterised by depressed mood and diminished interest or pleasure. Major depressive disorder is estimated to affect more than 264 million people globallyand is associated with a high risk of suicidal behaviour. Tricyclic antidepressants are used in the treatment of major depressive disorder worldwide. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are generally recommended as first-line treatment for major depressive disorder, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists clinical practice guidelines for mood disorders recommend tricyclic antidepressants for patients with chronic or melancholic depression or as an alternative for patients who do not benefit from newer antidepressants. The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines also includes the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline as one of just two essential antidepressants for the treatment of depressive disorders.

It has previously been shown that antidepressants reduce depressive symptoms with statistically significant effects, but it is uncertain how important these effects are to patients and whether they represent genuine pharmacological effects or just amplified placebo effects. One systematic review suggests that amitriptyline has larger effects than other antidepressants compared with placebo. However, previous reviews have not systematically assessed suicides, suicide attempts and all serious and non-serious adverse events for all tricyclic antidepressants, so it remains unclear whether the harmful effects of tricyclic antidepressants outweigh the potential beneficial effects.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering the following antidepressants in adults with moderate-to-severe depression:

- citalopram

- escitalopram

- fluoxetine

- fluvoxamine

- paroxetine

- sertraline

- amitriptyline.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^115FXR4W]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, APA 2019 guidelines recommend to offer either psychotherapy or second-generation antidepressant therapy as initial treatment, recognizing that insufficient evidence to recommend any of the following specific monotherapies over another:

- behavioral therapy

- cognitive, cognitive-behavioral, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy

- interpersonal psychotherapy

- psychodynamic therapy

- supportive therapy.

How Should a Physician Choose a Medication for a Patient Who Has Not Previously Used Antidepressants. Second-generation antidepressants are generally considered first-line treatment because of their better adverse effect profile, fewer serious drug interactions, and less lethality in overdose compared with TCAs and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Because effectiveness is similar among second-generation antidepressants, agents should be chosen based on patient preferences, with adverse effect profiles, cost, and dosing frequency taken into consideration.
42. For patients with accompanying anxiety, there are no conclusive data supporting the use of one agent over another. For patients with accompanying insomnia, SSRIs appear to have similar effectiveness, but some studies have shown trazodone and nefazodone to be superior. Mirtazapine has a faster onset of action than some SSRIs, but it is associated with long-term weight gain.

12 Sertraline has a higher incidence of diarrhea than most other second-generation antidepressants. 6 Other adverse effects are listed in Table 1. 8–22. EVIDENCE SUMMARY Because older adults are at significantly greater risk of adverse drug reactions compared with younger populations. 47 lower starting doses are often recommended. A Cochrane meta-analysis comparing SSRIs with TCAs in older patients reported no difference in effectiveness between the two drug classes, but noted that patients receiving TCAs were more likely to withdraw from the study and discontinue drug therapy because of adverse reactions. 48 Tertiary-amine TCAs are associated with significant adverse anticholinergic effects and are considered a potentially inappropriate medication in the American Geriatric Society's Beers Criteria. 49 Secondary-amine TCAs are thought to be safer because of their lower affinity for muscarinic receptor antagonism.
50. Guidelines recommend several SSRIs as good first-line options. 50 Bupropion, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine are also considered appropriate because of their favorable adverse effect profiles. Paroxetine is associated with more anticholinergic effects, and fluoxetine has a greater risk of agitation and overstimulation; neither should be used in older adults. 50.
