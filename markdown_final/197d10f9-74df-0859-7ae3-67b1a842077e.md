## Question

causes of hypoglycemia in a pt with type 2 dibetes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of hypoglycemia in a patient with type 2 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of iatrogenic hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes. Then, I should categorize the major causal domains, especially medication-related drivers. Next, I will examine patient-specific and disease-related risk factors, followed by behavioral and situational contributors. After that, I need to consider counterregulatory failure and hypoglycemia unawareness. Finally, I will integrate these into a practical clinical framework and highlight special scenarios and prevention implications, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and high-quality reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic foundation. In type 2 diabetes, iatrogenic hypoglycemia arises when therapeutic hyperinsulinemia from insulin or insulin secretagogues exceeds what the body's glucose counterregulatory defenses can compensate for, especially as beta-cell function wanes and glucagon responses fail, with epinephrine defenses also blunted by antecedent hypoglycemia, creating a vicious cycle of recurrent events and impaired awareness [^113NzJEZ] [^116cxZfz] [^115GdowE].

> I will now examine medication-related causes, since these are the most common and modifiable. Insulin therapy is the leading cause, with risk rising with longer duration of insulin use and intensified regimens; severe hypoglycemia becomes more frequent after several years of therapy and can approach rates seen in type 1 diabetes in advanced disease, which I should double-check against longitudinal data and contemporary cohorts [^116p5Hy8] [^113iqTGV] [^111KdtZV]. Sulfonylureas and meglitinides are the next major culprits because they increase insulin independent of glucose; even though severe events are less frequent than with insulin, the absolute burden is substantial given the large number of users, and guidelines advise deintensifying or switching when risk is high [^114xHmo9] [^11173599] [^111kAfi1]. Wait, let me verify the newer agents: DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors have low intrinsic hypoglycemia risk, but hypoglycemia can still occur when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas, so I need to ensure I don't overstate their safety in polypharmacy contexts [^113hfwna] [^111BQDLD] [^1167TNwB].

> Next, I should review patient-specific and disease-related risk factors. Longer diabetes duration and insulin therapy duration independently increase risk as beta-cell reserve declines and counterregulation falters, which is consistent across observational cohorts and pathophysiology reviews [^116p5Hy8] [^116cxZfz]. Older age, frailty, and cognitive impairment heighten susceptibility and consequences, prompting guideline emphasis on medication simplification and lower, individualized A1c targets in older adults [^111WDuK5] [^111xggdm] [^115bPvR5]. Renal impairment and CKD reduce insulin clearance and blunt responses, and albuminuria predicts future severe hypoglycemia, so I should flag these as high-risk features requiring dose adjustments and closer monitoring [^114gZKP8] [^112Q2FSf]. I also need to check for prior severe hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia unawareness, which are strong predictors of recurrence and mandate proactive risk mitigation [^113NzJEZ] [^1121AWRz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about behavior being "just patient error". Behavioral and situational contributors are common and often predictable. Skipped or delayed meals, irregular carbohydrate intake, and fasting can precipitate hypoglycemia when insulin or secretagogues are on board, so I should confirm meal patterns and timing at every visit [^114cDxfS] [^1125DXVA]. Alcohol impairs hepatic glucose production and can cause delayed hypoglycemia, which patients frequently under-recognize, so counseling is essential [^113NzJEZ] [^1125DXVA]. Exercise increases glucose utilization and can cause immediate or delayed hypoglycemia, particularly with glycogen-depleting activities; pre-exercise glucose checks and carbohydrate strategies are recommended for those on insulin or secretagogues [^1125DXVA]. I should also consider acute illness, vomiting, and erratic schedules, which can unpredictably alter intake and insulin needs, necessitating sick-day rules and flexible dosing plans [^1145SjR5].

> I need to ensure I address counterregulatory failure and hypoglycemia unawareness explicitly. With progressive beta-cell loss, the first-line defenses — falling insulin and rising glucagon — are lost, leaving patients dependent on epinephrine, which itself is attenuated by recent hypoglycemia, producing hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure and a vicious cycle of recurrent, often asymptomatic lows that are easy to miss and hard to treat [^113NzJEZ] [^116cxZfz]. Impaired awareness is common in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and correlates with severe events, and the good news is that structured avoidance of hypoglycemia can restore awareness in many patients, which is why guidelines recommend screening for impaired awareness and implementing education and technology-enabled prevention [^115pVL54] [^111sBngi] [^116FdDsw].

> Let me consider special scenarios that can masquerade or amplify risk. Nocturnal hypoglycemia is frequent and often unrecognized; risk rises with lower A1c, older age, longer diabetes duration, renal disease, and concomitant sulfonylurea use, so I should ask about dreams, sweats, morning headaches, and review overnight glucose data when available [^114u32WN]. Hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes have high rates of inpatient hypoglycemia, which tracks with worse outcomes; implementing standardized hypoglycemia surveillance and individualized plans is recommended [^112792Rc] [^116Z2CmG]. But wait, what if hypoglycemia persists despite stopping diabetes drugs? I should double-check for non-iatrogenic causes like insulinoma in refractory cases, although this is rare and requires dedicated endocrine evaluation [^112wRjF9].

> Next, I should review the clinical implications to frame prevention. Severe hypoglycemia is associated with higher risks of macrovascular events, microvascular events, and mortality, and while causality is debated, it at minimum flags high-risk vulnerability; this strengthens the case for proactive risk reduction rather than tolerance of recurrent events [^111yZBb5] [^115GdowE]. Fear of hypoglycemia drives under-treatment and nonadherence, so I need to balance glycemic goals with safety and patient preferences, especially in older or comorbid patients [^112Q2FSf] [^111pppov].

> I should confirm the practical clinical framework. Guidelines advise assessing hypoglycemia risk at every visit for patients on insulin or secretagogues, screening for impaired awareness annually, and using structured education with follow-up to reduce recurrence; CGM is recommended for high-risk patients to detect asymptomatic events and guide therapy adjustments [^114HhVpJ] [^111sBngi] [^116FdDsw] [^112EQWYH]. For patients with level 2 or 3 hypoglycemia, prompt reevaluation and deintensification or switching of hypoglycemia-prone agents is advised, and glucagon should be prescribed for those at risk with education of caregivers [^111bSFYh] [^11173599] [^1142RU2U]. In older adults, simplify regimens, prefer lower-risk agents, and individualize A1c targets to mitigate harm, which I should document clearly in the care plan [^111WDuK5] [^111xggdm] [^115bPvR5].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis remains precise: hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes is primarily iatrogenic, driven by insulin and insulin secretagogues, amplified by disease progression that erodes counterregulation, and shaped by patient-specific vulnerabilities and behavioral triggers. Recognition of these interlocking causes enables individualized prevention, including medication adjustment, education, and technology, to safely maintain glycemic control while minimizing hypoglycemia burden [^113NzJEZ] [^116p5Hy8] [^113trkuQ].

Hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes is **primarily iatrogenic** [^113NzJEZ], most often due to insulin or sulfonylureas [^114xHmo9] that raise insulin independent of glucose [^114xHmo9]. Risk rises with **longer diabetes duration** [^116p5Hy8], **renal impairment** [^114gZKP8], **older age** [^112C8FU2], and **prior hypoglycemia** [^113NzJEZ]; impaired awareness is common and under-recognized [^115pVL54] [^111PY9CM]. Other contributors include skipped meals, erratic carbs, alcohol, and intense or prolonged exercise [^1125DXVA] [^114cDxfS]. Less common causes include non-glycemic drugs (e.g. beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors) [^113JiKUR] and, rarely, insulinoma [^112wRjF9]. Management centers on **reviewing medications** [^11173599], **individualizing A1c targets** [^111t2kVN], **structured education** [^112sbFB5], and **CGM** for high-risk patients [^112EQWYH] [^1167vzLV].

---

## Medication-related causes

Medication-related factors are the **most common cause** of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes:

- **Insulin therapy**: Exogenous insulin can cause hypoglycemia if dosing is excessive, mistimed, or mismatched to intake or activity [^113NzJEZ] [^115pdv2o].

- **Sulfonylureas**: These insulin secretagogues can cause hypoglycemia, especially in older adults or those with renal impairment [^114xHmo9] [^111kAfi1].

- **Meglitinides**: Like sulfonylureas, they can cause hypoglycemia, though less commonly [^113trkuQ].

- **Combination therapy**: Using insulin with sulfonylureas or meglitinides increases hypoglycemia risk [^notfound].

---

## Patient-specific factors

Several patient-specific factors increase **hypoglycemia risk**:

- **Duration of diabetes**: Longer diabetes duration increases risk due to progressive beta-cell failure and impaired counterregulation [^116p5Hy8] [^116cxZfz].

- **Age**: Older adults have higher risk due to reduced counterregulatory responses and comorbidities [^112C8FU2] [^111xggdm].

- **Renal impairment**: Reduced insulin clearance increases hypoglycemia risk [^114gZKP8] [^112Q2FSf].

- **Cognitive impairment**: Increases risk due to medication errors and impaired awareness [^112Q2FSf] [^115bPvR5].

- **Prior hypoglycemia**: Strong predictor of future episodes [^113NzJEZ] [^112Q2FSf].

---

## Lifestyle and behavioral factors

Lifestyle and behavioral factors also contribute to **hypoglycemia**:

- **Skipping or delaying meals**: Reduces glucose availability, especially with insulin or sulfonylureas [^114cDxfS] [^1125DXVA].

- **Erratic carbohydrate intake**: Inconsistent carbs destabilize glucose and increase risk [^notfound].

- **Alcohol consumption**: Impairs hepatic glucose production and can cause delayed hypoglycemia [^113NzJEZ] [^1125DXVA].

- **Exercise**: Prolonged or intense exercise increases glucose utilization and can cause hypoglycemia, especially with insulin or sulfonylureas [^1125DXVA] [^114cDxfS].

---

## Physiological and disease-related factors

Physiological changes in type 2 diabetes also contribute to **hypoglycemia**:

- **Impaired counterregulation**: Loss of glucagon and blunted epinephrine responses increase risk, especially with longer diabetes duration [^113NzJEZ] [^116cxZfz].

- **Hypoglycemia unawareness**: Common in insulin-treated patients, increasing severe hypoglycemia risk [^115pVL54] [^111PY9CM].

- **Glycemic variability**: Fluctuating glucose levels increase hypoglycemia risk [^111t2kVN] [^111Dpmwg].

---

## Less common causes

Less common causes include **non-glycemic medications** (e.g. beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors) [^113JiKUR] and, rarely, **insulinoma** — a pancreatic tumor causing autonomous insulin secretion [^112wRjF9].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes has **significant clinical consequences**, including increased mortality, cardiovascular events, and reduced quality of life [^111yZBb5] [^115GdowE]. Management includes:

- **Medication review**: Adjust or switch high-risk agents (insulin, sulfonylureas) when possible [^11173599] [^111kAfi1].

- **Individualized A1c targets**: Use less aggressive targets in high-risk patients [^111t2kVN] [^116WnFYZ].

- **Structured education**: Teach recognition, prevention, and treatment of hypoglycemia [^112sbFB5] [^116FdDsw].

- **Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)**: Recommended for high-risk patients to detect and prevent hypoglycemia [^112EQWYH] [^1167vzLV].

---

Hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes is **multifactorial**, with medication-related factors predominating, compounded by patient-specific, lifestyle, and physiological factors. Effective management requires a **comprehensive, individualized approach** to reduce risk and improve outcomes [^113trkuQ].

Objective

To review and discuss the risks and impact of hypoglycemia and provide guidance for the prevention of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

Methods

We review and discuss the risks and impact of hypoglycemia, providing specific guidance regarding the prevention of hypoglycemia and judicial selection of glucose-lowering agents in individuals with T2DM.

Results

Hypoglycemia in T2DM is underrecognized and underreported. Emerging evidence from large clinical trials suggest that hypoglycemia may be an important risk factor for morbidity and mortality in T2DM. In addition, hypoglycemia is associated with reduced quality of life, greater healthcare utilization costs, and poor adherence to medical regiments.

Conclusion

These findings have led professional organizations to emphasize the prevention of hypoglycemia as an important consideration when initiating or intensifying treatment regimens. In clinical settings, particular attention should be paid to a patient's risk for hypoglycemia when initiating or intensifying the pharmacological treatment regimen. The endocrinologist can play an important role in educating not only the patient, but also other members of the diabetes-management team regarding the need for individualized therapy.

5 HYPOGLYCAEMIA

5.1 Incidence and risk factors

The incidence of hypoglycaemia in patients with T2DM initiating basal insulin is relatively low. It is estimated that less than 10% of patients with T2DM initiating basal insulin experience hypoglycaemia after 1–2 years of follow‐up. The incidence of severe hypoglycaemia in these patients is even lower,: less than 1% up to 4 years follow‐up.

Fear of hypoglycaemia is common and associated with discontinuation of insulin therapy even in patients who have not actually experienced hypoglycaemia. Understanding and addressing patients' feelings and concerns about hypoglycaemia is critical for successful treatment. It is important for patients to understand the potential risk factors for hypoglycaemia. Some of the common causes of hypoglycaemia are listed in Table 3.

TABLE 3
Common causes of hypoglycaemia

Patients at risk of hypoglycaemia should be identified and modifiable risk factors should be adjusted (e.g. discontinuation of SU therapy). Risk factors for developing severe hypoglycaemia include comorbidities (e.g. renal function impairment), diabetes duration, advanced age, history of severe hypoglycaemia, high glycaemic variability, microvascular complications, and SU use. In such patients, less stringent glycaemic goals may need to be set and some may need additional monitoring or education.

5.2 What guidance should be provided for recognizing and treating hypoglycaemia?

Patients and their family members/caregivers should be educated on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia can occur quickly, and people can experience different symptoms. The advice given to patients and their family members/caregivers should empower them to recognize and address hypoglycaemia effectively without scaring them. Understanding and addressing feelings and concerns about hypoglycaemia before and during insulin treatment is critical. If experiencing symptoms of hypoglycaemia, patients should measure their blood glucose if possible, follow the '15–15 rule' and contact their healthcare provider (See Table 4). Where appropriate, care providers should be educated in rescue treatments such as oral glucose gels and intramuscular or nasal glucagon. Glucagon should be prescribed for all individuals at increased risk of level 2 hypoglycaemia, defined as blood glucose < 54 mg/dl (3.0 mmol/L), to ensure availability in emergency situations.

TABLE 4
The '15–15' rule a

5.3 What steps should be taken following an episode of hypoglycaemia?

It is critical to understand what may have induced the hypoglycaemic episode and how future episodes can be prevented. Table 5 lists steps to be considered when evaluating the cause of hypoglycaemia. Preventive measures should be considered in high risk patients such as always carrying a source of rapid‐acting carbohydrate whenever leaving home.m

What are the implications of hypoglycemia on both short- and long-term outcomes in people with diabetes?

Iatrogenic hypoglycemia is more frequent in patients with profound endogenous insulin deficiency — type 1 diabetes and advanced type 2 diabetes — and its incidence increases with the duration of diabetes. It is caused by treatment with a sulfonylurea, glinide, or insulin and occurs about two to three times more frequently in type 1 diabetes than in type 2 diabetes. Event rates for severe hypoglycemia for patients with type 1 diabetes range from 115 to 320 per 100 patient-years. Severe hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes has been shown to occur at rates of 35 to 70 per 100 patient-years. However, because type 2 diabetes is much more prevalent than type 1 diabetes, most episodes of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia, occur in people with type 2 diabetes.

There is no doubt that hypoglycemia can be fatal. In addition to case reports of hypoglycemic deaths in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, four recent reports of mortality rates in series of patients indicate that 4%, 6%, 7%, and 10% of deaths of patients with type 1 diabetes were caused by hypoglycemia. A temporal relationship between extremely low subcutaneous glucose concentrations and death in a patient with type 1 diabetes who was wearing a CGM device and was found dead in bed has been reported. Although profound and prolonged hypoglycemia can cause brain death, most episodes of fatal hypoglycemia are probably the result of other mechanisms, such as ventricular arrhythmias. In this section, we will consider the effects of hypoglycemia on the development of hypoglycemia unawareness and how iatrogenic hypoglycemia may affect outcomes in specific patient groups.

### Hypoglycemia in patient with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin: it can happen [^114RZRwd]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The risk of hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is clearly appreciated as a side effect of treatment. It is not as clearly understood in those with type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated with insulin. The risk of hypoglycemia in people with T2D has been considered less important, with the implication that it can often be ignored. Recent evidence contradicts this belief and suggests that serious consequences of hypoglycemia may, in some respects, be greater in individuals with T2D, particularly with regard to its effects on the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, in older people with T2D who often live alone, comorbidities (eg, cognitive impairment and dementia, impaired renal function, other medications and frailty) can make hypoglycemia far more dangerous and difficult to manage.

Despite several studies addressing this topic, there are still lingering myths about hypoglycemia in people with T2D treated with insulin:

People with T2D rarely experience hypoglycemia.
People with T2D with elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) are not at risk of hypoglycemia.
People with T2D can have hypoglycemia, but it is not severe due to the body's counter-regulatory responses.
Hypoglycemia does not result in adverse consequences for people with T2D.

This narrative review aims to dispel these myths by examining the physiology, comorbidities and reported incidence and rates of hypoglycemia in people with T2D. Moreover, we consider why hypoglycemia is often under-reported and under-identified by individuals and healthcare providers (HCPs), and how we can improve hypoglycemia detection, prevention and treatment education. Throughout this narrative review, the term 'hypoglycemia' is intended to generally refer to any level of severity; concepts related to 'severe hypoglycemia' are specified as such.

### Hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus… [^116ZqtYb]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Patients treated with pharmacologic therapy tended to have lower reported blood glucose values during hypoglycemia than did those treated with diet alone, whereas patients treated with diet alone reported significantly fewer values of less than 60 mg/dL than did those treated with pharmacologic agents. Since the report of hypoglycemia in each group of patients includes subjects with measured blood glucose levels of at least 60 mg/dL, we estimated the prevalence of biochemical hypoglycemia that would have been obtained if all patients had monitored their glucose values during symptoms. The estimated prevalence of biochemical hypoglycemia was 2. 4% for patients treated with diet alone.

Surprisingly, 9 of the 76 patients treated with diet alone reported some hypoglycemic symptoms, although only 1 patient reported biochemical hypoglycemia. Measurement error may explain the apparent biochemical hypoglycemia in the single patient reporting a blood glucose level of 42 mg/dL during symptoms, as such low glucose levels were not reported by this patient at subsequent visits. Because of population differences and the cross-sectional design of this study, our results cannot be compared directly with those of the UKPDS or DCCT. However, some trends were similar. As in the UKPDS, we found that any hypoglycemia was more common in insulin-treated patients than in those treated with oral hypoglycemic agents or diet alone. 11 We also found a low prevalence of severe hypoglycemia at the visits studied, but, unlike the UKPDS, all episodes in our study were associated with insulin therapy.

The DCCT found that the prevalence of severe hypoglycemia increased as HbA1c levels fell and that patients with previous episodes of hypoglycemia were more likely to experience hypoglycemia in the future. 22 In our study, multiple logistic regression also showed lower HbA1c levels and a report of hypoglycemia at the baseline visit to be independent predictors of any hypoglycemia.

### The barrier of hypoglycemia in diabetes [^112JBsLU]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

Perspective on hypoglycemia in diabetes.

Diabetes is a common chronic disease. Its human and economic costs are large and, despite therapeutic advances, growing because of the increasing prevalence of diabetes. Glycemic control is only one aspect of the management of diabetes. It is now possible to drive plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations to subphysiological levels and to normalize blood pressure pharmacologically, usually without major side effects, in most people with diabetes. Weight reduction and smoking cessation are more challenging, but worthy, goals in obese patients or those who smoke. However, it is not possible to maintain euglycemia over a lifetime of diabetes because of the barrier of hypoglycemia.

Nonetheless, people with diabetes and their caregivers should keep the problem of iatrogenic hypoglycemia in perspective. The principle of the glycemic management of diabetes is that maintenance of glycemia as close to the nondiabetic range as can be accomplished safely over time is generally in the patient's best interests. The extent to which that goal can be met is a function of many factors, including the type of diabetes and the stage in the progression of the disease in the individual patient. Early in the course of type 2 diabetes, by far the most common type of diabetes, hyperglycemia may respond to lifestyle changes, specifically weight loss, or to plasma glucose–lowering drugs that should not, and probably do not, cause hypoglycemia. In theory, when such drugs are effective in the absence of side effects, there is no reason not to accelerate their dosing until euglycemia is achieved. Over time, however, as people with type 2 diabetes become progressively more insulin deficient, these drugs, even in combination, fail to maintain glycemic control. Insulin secretagogues are also effective early in type 2 diabetes, but they can cause hyperinsulinemia and therefore introduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Euglycemia is not an appropriate goal during therapy with an insulin secretagogue or with insulin in people with type 2 diabetes. Nonetheless, as discussed earlier, the frequency of hypoglycemia is relatively low (at least with current glycemic goals that are above the euglycemic range) during treatment with an insulin secretagogue, or even with insulin, early in type 2 diabetes when defenses against hypoglycemia are intact. Thus, over much of the course of the most common type of diabetes it is possible to achieve a meaningful degree of glycemic control with no risk or relatively low risk of hypoglycemia. The challenge is greater in people with advanced type 2 diabetes or type 1 diabetes because of compromised defenses against hypoglycemia. In such patients, therapy with insulin is demonstrably effective, but it is not demonstrably safe. Nonetheless, concerns about hypoglycemia should not be used as an excuse for poor glycemic control by patients or their caregivers. Both should strive to achieve and maintain the greatest degree of glycemic control that can be accomplished safely in a given person with diabetes at a given stage of the progression of his or her diabetes. It should be recalled that the relationship between mean glycemia and microvascular complications is curvilinear. While near euglycemia is desirable, some degree of long-term glycemic control puts the patient at lower risk than little or no glycemic control.

### Hypoglycemia in patient with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin: it can happen [^113iqTGV]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

There are many misconceptions about the prevalence and effects of hypoglycemia in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), including hypoglycemia does not occur or does not have adverse consequences in T2D. This narrative review aims to help dispel these myths. Around 25% of people with T2D taking insulin for > 5 years were found to have severe hypoglycemic events, which is comparable to the severe hypoglycemia rate in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) diagnosed within 5 years. The total number of hypoglycemic events among insulin-treated T2D, including severe hypoglycemia, is as high or higher than among those with T1D. Recent evidence suggests serious consequences of hypoglycemia may, in some respects, be greater in individuals with T2D, particularly regarding effects on the cardiovascular system. Hypoglycemia is generally patient-reported. Issues with hypoglycemia unawareness, limited glucose testing, limited recall, lack of event logging and fear of failure or shaming limits the number of hypoglycemic episodes reported by people with diabetes. Barriers to healthcare provider inquiry and reporting include lack of knowledge regarding the problem's magnitude, competing priorities during patient visits, lack of incentives to report and limitations to documentation systems for adequate reporting. All people with diabetes should be encouraged to discuss their experiences with hypoglycemia without judgment or shame. Glucose targets, testing schedules (blood glucose or continuous glucose monitoring) and treatment plans should be reviewed often and individualized to the minimize risk of hypoglycemia. Finally, people with T2D on insulin should always be encouraged to have oral glucose and rescue medication immediately available.

### Hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes [^116E8DWS]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

In healthy individuals, blood glucose concentrations are maintained within a very narrow range, despite major fluctuations in glucose entry into the body and glucose utilization in tissue metabolism. In people with diabetes mellitus, inadequate insulin secretion results in high blood glucose concentrations. The treatment of diabetes mellitus focuses on avoidance of hyperglycaemia in order to avoid its associated symptoms and to minimize the risk of vascular complications over time.

Treatments that elevate insulin concentrations in the blood independent of the ambient glucose inevitably carry risk of intermittent hypoglycaemia. Episodes of hypoglycaemia are distressing, either because of the symptom response to the falling blood glucose concentration, or because of the alteration in brain function that occurs if the plasma glucose falls too low to sustain normal neuronal function. Hypoglycaemia, particularly when severe, is associated with considerable cost, both to the individual and to the health service.

Most of the research into hypoglycaemia has used insulin-induced hypoglycaemia as a tool and has looked at hypoglycaemia in the insulin-deficient Type 1 diabetic population. The occurrence of hypoglycaemia in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes is also well recognized, but is more protean in nature, having different risk factors and clinical features according to the nature of the hypoglycaemic therapy, the extent of the insulin secretory deficit and the duration of diabetes. With the increasing drive for more strict glucose control in Type 2 diabetes and new therapies which may carry different risks for hypoglycaemia from established therapies, a review of what is known about hypoglycaemia in Type 2 diabetes is timely.

### Impact of therapeutic advances on hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes [^1141CuNw]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with type 2 diabetes experience hypoglycaemia less frequently than those with type 1 diabetes. Some protection against hypoglycaemia is afforded by the relatively intact glucose counter-regulatory pathways that characterize the pathophysiology of early type 2 diabetes. To some extent, this protection explains why hypoglycaemic episodes in intensively treated individuals with type 2 diabetes, when they occur, are rarely severe. As diabetes progresses and therapy intensifies to achieve recommended glycaemic goals, hypoglycaemia frequency and severity increase. Thus, when it comes to instituting intensive therapy, fear of hypoglycaemia may contribute to health-care providers' 'clinical inertia'. Because maintaining glycaemic control is so important to both public and individual health, many new therapies and technologies have been developed. This manuscript reviews and considers whether these advancements in therapy make glycaemic goals easier to achieve by minimizing hypoglycaemia. Putting the hypoglycaemia experienced by type 2 diabetes patients into appropriate clinical perspective, the impact of recent progress made in pharmacotherapy, drug delivery systems, and BG monitoring on hypoglycaemia incidence is largely positive. The extent to which this progress can effect improvement over traditional therapies will, however, depend upon patient (and provider) education, motivation and behaviour change.

### Hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes [^114s1eqG]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

There is a degree of consensus when defining hypoglycaemia by clinical picture alone. Most authorities now accept that severe hypoglycaemia is an episode in which the mental state of a patient is so disturbed that they are unable to self-treat. The defining feature is the need for assistance from another person, with subdivisions for cases where parenteral therapy is required or coma or seizure occur. Mild hypoglycaemia encompasses all other episodes, recognized by the patient and self-treated. The category of moderate hypoglycaemia, self-treated episodes involving significant disruption to lifestyle, is now little used because of its imprecision and subjective nature. It is important to recognize that people with diabetes may refer to very symptomatic episodes of hypoglycaemia as severe when from a medical perspective they are justifiably mild, because the symptomatic patient self-treats and avoids the morbidity of impaired conscious level.

The lack of consensus regarding definitions makes it difficult to compare rates of hypoglycaemia across studies. Clinically this is important, since treatment decisions may be made on the evidence that one treatment is associated with less hypoglycaemia than another. For the benefit of changing therapies to be real, it is important to demonstrate that the prevented hypoglycaemic events would have been clinically problematic.

### Hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes [^114xHmo9]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The primary cause of hypoglycaemia in Type 2 diabetes is diabetes medication-in particular, those which raise insulin levels independently of blood glucose, such as sulphonylureas (SUs) and exogenous insulin. The risk of hypoglycaemia is increased in older patients, those with longer diabetes duration, lesser insulin reserve and perhaps in the drive for strict glycaemic control. Differing definitions, data collection methods, drug type/regimen and patient populations make comparing rates of hypoglycaemia difficult. It is clear that patients taking insulin have the highest rates of self-reported severe hypoglycaemia (25% in patients who have been taking insulin for > 5 years). SUs are associated with significantly lower rates of severe hypoglycaemia. However, large numbers of patients take SUs in the UK, and it is estimated that each year > 5000 patients will experience a severe event caused by their SU therapy which will require emergency intervention. Hypoglycaemia has substantial clinical impact, in terms of mortality, morbidity and quality of life. The cost implications of severe episodes-both direct hospital costs and indirect costs-are considerable: it is estimated that each hospital admission for severe hypoglycaemia costs around pound1000. Hypoglycaemia and fear of hypoglycaemia limit the ability of current diabetes medications to achieve and maintain optimal levels of glycaemic control. Newer therapies, which focus on the incretin axis, may carry a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. Their use, and more prudent use of older therapies with low risk of hypoglycaemia, may help patients achieve improved glucose control for longer, and reduce the risk of diabetic complications.

### Hypoglycemia. pathophysiology and treatment [^114GE8JL]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia is a common consequence of many diabetes treatments. As is true for many therapies for diseases with major pathologic consequences, the benefits and risks of treatment must be balanced. In intensified diabetes management, hypoglycemia is not an insurmountable problem but is unfortunately inevitable using the methods of glucose control currently available. Patients with type 1 diabetes seem to be at greater risk than patients with type 2 disease. The health care team must strive to help the patient maintain normoglycemia. The results of the DCCT and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study prove that near normoglycemia is clearly in the patient's best interest. Patient education has become focused on minimizing hyperglycemia; counseling on the dangers of hypoglycemia has not been given the same stature. Emphasis must be placed on minimizing even minor subclinical hypoglycemia because it will contribute to a vicious cycle of hypoglycemia begetting hypoglycemia.

Hypoglycemia reporting

Patient under-identifying and under-reporting

As described above, hypoglycemia does occur in people with T2D; however, both recognition and reporting are limited. Effective mitigation measures can only be implemented by the individual, the healthcare team and the payer once the incidence and causes of hypoglycemia are identified.

Although there are many potential sources of information about the frequency and severity of hypoglycemic episodes in the general diabetes population, the individual is the primary source of information. Unfortunately, people with diabetes often do not report hypoglycemic episodes to their HCPs. In one study, 67% of people with T1D and 43%–53% of those with T2D rarely reported hypoglycemia to their HCPs. In another study, 60% (T1D) and 46% (T2D) rarely or never report hypoglycemia to their HCPs. Given the central role of individuals in making HCPs aware of hypoglycemia, it is important to understand the process that generates opportunities for sharing and the factors affecting the responses to these opportunities. Below we describe this chain of events: (1) identifying/recognizing hypoglycemic events, (2) involving HCPs in treating hypoglycemic events, (3) recalling hypoglycemic episodes and (4) sharing information about hypoglycemic episodes during HCP visits.

Identifying/Recognizing hypoglycemic events

The first item in the chain is identifying/recognizing a hypoglycemic event. There is general understanding that individuals with insulin-treated diabetes can develop impaired hypoglycemic awareness or hypoglycemic unawareness. This results in increased numbers of asymptomatic, non-severe hypoglycemic events, which contributes to a higher incidence of severe episodes when corrective action is not taken until hypoglycemic symptoms become severe. People with diabetes may not collect a glucose data point when experiencing hypoglycemia because they are occupied treating the low blood glucose. This limits any quantitative measure of the episode or a record for future analysis. Non-severe episodes can also be misinterpreted by people with diabetes and/or family members as a decrease in cognition, particularly in the elderly and not recognized as hypoglycemia. Moreover, one-third or more of people with T1D and T2D define/identify hypoglycemia by the presence of symptoms. Thus, only a portion of hypoglycemic episodes are available for sharing.

Hypoglycemia is the major barrier to good glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, randomized controlled trials have emphasized the grave risks associated with severe hypoglycemia in patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypoglycemia has also been recognized as a complication of bariatric surgery. New endocrine society guidelines on adult hypoglycemic disorders are, therefore, extremely pertinent.

### Hypoglycemia in diabetes [^113NzJEZ]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Iatrogenic hypoglycemia causes recurrent morbidity in most people with type 1 diabetes and many with type 2 diabetes, and it is sometimes fatal. The barrier of hypoglycemia generally precludes maintenance of euglycemia over a lifetime of diabetes and thus precludes full realization of euglycemia's long-term benefits. While the clinical presentation is often characteristic, particularly for the experienced individual with diabetes, the neurogenic and neuroglycopenic symptoms of hypoglycemia are nonspecific and relatively insensitive; therefore, many episodes are not recognized. Hypoglycemia can result from exogenous or endogenous insulin excess alone. However, iatrogenic hypoglycemia is typically the result of the interplay of absolute or relative insulin excess and compromised glucose counterregulation in type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes. Decrements in insulin, increments in glucagon, and, absent the latter, increments in epinephrine stand high in the hierarchy of redundant glucose counterregulatory factors that normally prevent or rapidly correct hypoglycemia. In insulin-deficient diabetes (exogenous) insulin levels do not decrease as glucose levels fall, and the combination of deficient glucagon and epinephrine responses causes defective glucose counterregulation. Reduced sympathoadrenal responses cause hypoglycemia unawareness. The concept of hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure in diabetes posits that recent antecedent hypoglycemia causes both defective glucose counterregulation and hypoglycemia unawareness. By shifting glycemic thresholds for the sympathoadrenal (including epinephrine) and the resulting neurogenic responses to lower plasma glucose concentrations, antecedent hypoglycemia leads to a vicious cycle of recurrent hypoglycemia and further impairment of glucose counterregulation. Thus, short-term avoidance of hypoglycemia reverses hypoglycemia unawareness in most affected patients. The clinical approach to minimizing hypoglycemia while improving glycemic control includes 1) addressing the issue, 2) applying the principles of aggressive glycemic therapy, including flexible and individualized drug regimens, and 3) considering the risk factors for iatrogenic hypoglycemia. The latter include factors that result in absolute or relative insulin excess: drug dose, timing, and type; patterns of food ingestion and exercise; interactions with alcohol and other drugs; and altered sensitivity to or clearance of insulin. They also include factors that are clinical surrogates of compromised glucose counterregulation: endogenous insulin deficiency; history of severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, or both; and aggressive glycemic therapy per se, as evidenced by lower HbA(1c) levels, lower glycemic goals, or both. In a patient with hypoglycemia unawareness (which implies recurrent hypoglycemia) a 2- to 3-week period of scrupulous avoidance of hypoglycemia is advisable. Pending the prevention and cure of diabetes or the development of methods that provide glucose-regulated insulin replacement or secretion, we need to learn to replace insulin in a much more physiological fashion, to prevent, correct, or compensate for compromised glucose counterregulation, or both if we are to achieve near-euglycemia safely in most people with diabetes.

### The importance of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients [^116GzGuR]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia is one of the most important complications of diabetes treatment. The risk of severe hypoglycemia is higher in elderly patients, those having comorbidities such as vascular disease or renal failure, pregnant women and in children with type 1diabetes. Moreover, in type 2 diabetes, progressive insulin deficiency, longer duration of diabetes, and tight glycemic control increase the risk of hypoglycemia as much as type 1 diabetes. Episodes hypoglycemia may lead to impairment of counter-regulatory system, with the potential of development of hypoglycemia unawareness. So, hypoglycemia may increase the vascular events even death in addition to other possible detrimental effects. Glycemic control should be individualized based on patient characteristics with some degree of safety. Recognition of hypoglycemia risk factors, blood glucose monitoring, selection of appropriate regimens and educational programs for healthcare professionals and patients with diabetes are the major issues to maintain good glycemic control, minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, and prevent long- term complications.

It also discusses the benefits and challenges associated with new basal insulins, and their potential role in reducing hypoglycemia risk.

Understanding hypoglycemia from a management perspective

Pathophysiology of hypoglycemia

In people without diabetes, hypoglycemia is rare since endogenous insulin secretion is inhibited as glucose levels fall below normal. Individuals with diabetes, treated with insulin, sulfonylureas or other insulin secretagogues, are at increased hypoglycemic risk because glucose levels will continue to fall until either insulin boluses or the effect of oral medication are cleared. At diagnosis, individuals with diabetes are protected, at least in part, from the glucose-lowering effect of insulin by physiological responses initiated by stress pathways. As blood glucose falls below normal, glucagon is released by α cells probably due to a paracrine response within the islets. Glucagon is a powerful counter-regulatory hormone that defends individuals against hypoglycemia by stimulating release of glucose from the liver through glycogenolysis.

With increased duration of diabetes, in both T1D and advanced T2D, progressive loss of β cells prevents paracrine cross-talk between the α and β cells leading to impaired glucagon release during hypoglycemia. This increases vulnerability to hypoglycemia. Thus, duration of T1D and, in T2D, the duration of insulin treatment are important predictors of hypoglycemic risk.

Those affected with declining β-cell function and impaired glucagon responses are still protected from hypoglycemia by activation of the sympathoadrenal nervous system and associated release of circulating epinephrine, but this defense also can become impaired. It is particularly sensitive to antecedent episodes of hypoglycemia, which reset the threshold for epinephrine release to a lower glucose level. One consequence is that the counter-regulatory response is delayed and, as glucose levels fall below 3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL), individuals can become cognitively impaired and are at major risk of a severe hypoglycemic episode. This has been described by some as 'hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure'. However, it is important to note that this condition is not closely related to diabetic autonomic neuropathy, which reflects structural and irreversible damage to the autonomic nervous system. Defective counter-regulatory responses to hypoglycemia as a result of antecedent episodes are functional rather than structural, at least in part. They can be reversed by scrupulous avoidance of hypoglycemia, an important treatment option in those affected in this way.

In summary, these pathophysiological changes, which both diminish symptomatic responses as well as reduce the ability of the body to resist the glucose-lowering effect of insulin, explain why individuals with T1D or long-standing T2D both are vulnerable to hypoglycemia during treatment.

### Early insulin use in type 2 diabetes: what are the cons? [^116dnmM3]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

INSULIN THERAPY AND ITS ADVERSE EVENTS

Hypoglycemia is considered to occur less frequently in type 2 diabetes than in type 1 diabetes. However, in recent years, the pursuit of strict glycemic control in type 2 diabetes has encouraged the earlier introduction of insulin and the use of more intensive regimens. This is bound to have a significant impact on the risk of hypoglycemia in these patients. Again, the pivotal study is the UKPDS. In this population with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, the incidence of any hypoglycemic event in insulin-treated newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients was 36.5 per 100 patient-years, at least twice as frequent as in sulfonylurea-treated patients. Although the incidence of severe hypoglycemia was much lower than in type 1 diabetes, it was still 2.3 per 100 patient-years, a four- to sixfold increase compared with the sulfonylurea-treated group. Even more disturbing is that the risk of severe hypoglycemia is far greater with increasing duration of diabetes and insulin therapy. Henderson et al. observed that in those type 2 diabetic patients treated with insulin for over 10 years, the estimated incidence of severe hypoglycemia was 28 episodes per 100 patient-years (Fig. 3). This is nearly half the rate documented during intensive insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial. The risk of severe hypoglycemia should not be underestimated. This does not indicate that we should not start insulin in a timely fashion. But we should try to minimize the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia.

### The barrier of hypoglycemia in diabetes [^111KdtZV]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

Frequency of hypoglycemia.

Hypoglycemia is a fact of life for most people with type 1 diabetes. The average patient has untold numbers of episodes of asymptomatic hypoglycemia and suffers two episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia per week (thousands of such episodes over a lifetime of diabetes). He or she suffers one or more episodes of severe, temporarily disabling hypoglycemia, often with seizure or coma, per year. There is no evidence that this problem has abated over the decade and a half since it was highlighted by the report of the DCCT in 1993. For example, in 2007 the U.K. Hypoglycemia Study Group reported an incidence of severe hypoglycemia of 110 episodes per 100 patient-years (nearly twice that in the DCCT) in patients with type 1 diabetes, who were necessarily treated with insulin, for < 5 years and an incidence of 320 episodes per 100 patient-years in those with type 1 diabetes for > 15 years.

Overall, hypoglycemia is less frequent in type 2 diabetes. However, for pathophysiological reasons that will be discussed shortly, hypoglycemia becomes progressively more frequent and limiting to glycemic control later in the course of type 2 diabetes. For example, when the U.K. Hypoglycemia Study Group contrasted patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin for < 2 years with those treated with insulin for > 5 years, they found severe hypoglycemia prevalences of 7 and 25% and incidences of 10 and 70 episodes per 100 patient-years, respectively. The corresponding values for mild hypoglycemia were 51 and 64% and 410 and ∼1,020 episodes per 100 patient-years, respectively. Thus, while the risk of hypoglycemia is relatively low in the first few years of insulin treatment of type 2 diabetes (at least with current glycemic goals that are above the euglycemic range), the risk increases substantially (approaching that in type 1 diabetes) in advanced type 2 diabetes.

### The barrier of hypoglycemia in diabetes [^115fFryT]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, maintenance of euglycemia over a lifetime of diabetes cannot be accomplished safely with currently available treatment methods because of the barrier of hypoglycemia. Even if they are effective initially, medications that should not, and probably do not, cause hypoglycemia (a biguanide [metformin], thiazolidinediones, α-glucosidase inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and dipeptidyl dipeptidase-IV inhibitors) seldom maintain euglycemia in the long-term in type 2 diabetes. The same is true of insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas or glinides), which can cause hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes. Therapy with insulin causes hypoglycemia progressively more frequently over time in type 2 diabetes and throughout the course of established type 1 diabetes. Elimination of iatrogenic hypoglycemia from the lives of people with diabetes will require new treatment methods that provide plasma glucose–regulated insulin replacement or secretion.

### Advances and counterpoints in type 2 diabetes. what is ready for translation into real-world practice, ahead of the guidelines [^116eaHkz]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This review seeks to address major gaps and delays between our rapidly evolving body of knowledge on type 2 diabetes and its translation into real-world practice. Through updated and improved best practices informed by recent evidence and described herein, we stand to better attain A1c targets, help preserve beta cell integrity and moderate glycemic variability, minimize treatment-emergent hypoglycemia, circumvent prescribing to "treatment failure", and prevent long-term complications. The first topic addressed in this review concerns updates in the 2023 and 2024 diabetes treatment guidelines for which further elaboration can help facilitate integration into routine care. The second concerns advances in diabetes research that have not yet found their way into guidelines, though they are endorsed by strong evidence and are ready for real-world use in appropriate patients. The final theme addresses lingering misconceptions about the underpinnings of type 2 diabetes-fundamental fallacies that continue to be asserted in the textbooks and continuing medical education upon which physicians build their approaches. A corrected and up-to-date understanding of the disease state is essential for practitioners to both conceptually and translationally manage initial onset through late-stage type 2 diabetes.

### Hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes [^111pppov]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Studies indicate that patients may balance their glucose levels against the risk of a hypoglycaemic event, with some choosing to keep their blood glucose higher than recommended to avoid hypoglycaemia. Such patients may sacrifice the long-term benefits of reducing micro- and macrovascular complications. With growing evidence that macrovascular disease may require lower mean glycaemia than that required for microvascular disease, the limitation of hypoglycaemia associated with current therapies may become more problematic, inhibiting patients' ability to lower mean glucose concentrations sufficiently or long enough to impact on macrovascular end-points as required.

Hypoglycemia is an essential issue for diabetic patients and considered a limiting factor in the glycemic management. Heterogeneity of the diseases in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus can affect the frequency of hypoglycemia, especially when the patient has cardiovascular diseases. There are several factors that lead to hypoglycemia including sulfonylurea therapy, insulin therapy, delaying or missing a meal, physical exercise, or alcohol consumption. Long-term studies reported that repeated hypoglycemia could increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. During Ramadan fasting, diabetic patients have high incidence of hypoglycemia. Therefore, focused education about hypoglycemia in routine life of diabetic patients and during fasting in Ramadan is important to reduce the complications.

### The barrier of hypoglycemia in diabetes [^115M5q72]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

Although they represent only a small fraction of the total hypoglycemia experience, estimates of the frequency of severe hypoglycemia, particularly if determined in prospective, population-based studies, are the most reliable because they are dramatic events that are more likely to be reported (by the patient or an associate). The prospective, population-based data of Donnelly et al. indicate that the overall incidence of hypoglycemia in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes is approximately one-third of that in type 1 diabetes. The incidence of any and of severe hypoglycemia was ∼4,300 and 115 episodes per 100 patient-years, respectively, in type 1 diabetes and ∼1,600 and 35 episodes per 100 patient-years, respectively, in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes. In addition, in population-based studies the incidence of severe hypoglycemia requiring emergency treatment in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes was ∼40% and ∼100% of that in type 1 diabetes. Since the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is ∼20-fold greater than that of type 1 diabetes, and most people with type 2 diabetes ultimately require treatment with insulin, these data suggest that most episodes of iatrogenic hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia, occur in people with type 2 diabetes.

### Income and severe hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes… [^1152YSQ6]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Managing the risk of hypoglycemia is a critical component of improving patient care in type 2 diabetes. 1–3 Severe hypoglycemia, a major diabetes complication, poses significant risks, including increased diabetes-related mortality, morbidity, and heightened medical costs. 4, 5 Understanding the factors that contribute to severe hypoglycemia is essential for developing targeted interventions. In the NHID, T2D was defined using a combination of a diabetes diagnosis code, fasting glucose level, and the use of diabetes medication. In contrast, the UKBB defined T2D through a combination of questionnaire responses, diagnosis codes, HbA1c level, and the use of diabetes medication. Even after adjusting for various income-related confounding variables, the risk of severe hypoglycemia in the group that had been aid beneficiaries for more than 1 year was nearly double that of the group that had not received aid.

However, risk of severe hypoglycemia did not show a dose-dependent pattern based on the duration of being a medical aid beneficiary; rather, the risk significantly increased if the patient had been a beneficiary at any point. Well-known risk factors for severe hypoglycemia include advanced age, long duration of diabetes, low body weight, excessive alcohol consumption, insulin and sulfonylurea use, and cognitive dysfunction. 4, 15–17 Individuals with low income are likely to exhibit a variety of these known risk factors. Specifically, low-income individuals often require more insulin due to poor diabetes management and are at high risk of neglect due to hypoglycemia unawareness, both stemming from a lack of education on advanced diabetes care. 9 Additionally, they have higher rates of major comorbidities, including CKD, a significant risk factor for hypoglycemia.

18 Low-income individuals also face nutritional imbalances, leading to both obesity and a higher risk of being underweight, further increasing their risk of severe hypoglycemia. Previous literature has consistently reported that low-income groups have elevated risk of developing hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemia. A previous cross-sectional analysis found that food insecurity and exhaustion of food budgets at the end of the month were significantly associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia in low-income groups, with a reduction in hospitalizations due to hypoglycemia being observed during periods when food support through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program was increased. 11, 19.

### Minimizing hypoglycemia in diabetes [^116ajzEM]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia caused by treatment with a sulfonylurea, a glinide, or insulin coupled with compromised defenses against the resulting falling plasma glucose concentrations is a problem for many people with diabetes. It is often recurrent, causes significant morbidity and occasional mortality, limits maintenance of euglycemia, and impairs physiological and behavioral defenses against subsequent hypoglycemia. Minimizing hypoglycemia includes acknowledging the problem; considering each risk factor; and applying the principles of intensive glycemic therapy, including drug selection and selective application of diabetes treatment technologies. For diabetes health-care providers treating most people with diabetes who are at risk for or are suffering from iatrogenic hypoglycemia, these principles include selecting appropriate individualized glycemic goals and providing structured patient education to reduce the incidence of hypoglycemia. This is typically combined with short-term scrupulous avoidance of hypoglycemia, which often will reverse impaired awareness of hypoglycemia. Clearly, the risk of hypoglycemia is modifiable.

### Hypoglycemia in patient with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin: it can happen [^111HJKe6]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

A newly diagnosed person with T2D is not representative of the typical insulin-taking person with T2D since, as described above, counter-regulatory defenses that confer protection against severe episodes are intact at diagnosis. At the time of the UKPDS and DCCT trials, it was perhaps underappreciated that conclusions based on a study in newly diagnosed individuals are, therefore, not a reliable guide to the risks of hypoglycemia in individuals with T2D on insulin. The need for insulin treatment in people with T2D reflects a progressive failure of β-cell secretion of endogenous insulin. Newly diagnosed individuals with T2D, if prescribed insulin, will require significantly less exogenous insulin and have a significantly better counter-regulatory response compared with individuals with advanced diabetes. However, insulin is not a first-line treatment recommendation for newly diagnosed individuals with T2Dand is not frequently prescribed in those individuals. On average, insulin was found to be initiated in people with T2D > 7 years after initiation of oral antidiabetic agent(s) even despite elevated HbA1c levels. The insulin resistance of T2D may also reduce hypoglycemic risk. As endogenous insulin diminishes, the physiological counter-regulatory defense also decreases, as described in Pathophysiology of hypoglycemia.

Finally, prior to a recent International Hypoglycaemia Study Group position statement, no consistent, standardized reporting of levels of hypoglycemia were used in clinical trials. Each clinical trial protocol defined the glucose levels used to determine hypoglycemic events, which contributed to the misconceptions about the prevalence and effects of hypoglycemia in people with T2D on insulin. The position statement provided guidelines for the standardization of reporting levels for hypoglycemia, with clinically important hypoglycemia (level 2) defined as glucose level < 3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) and severe hypoglycemia (level 3) denoted by severe cognitive impairment requiring external assistance for recovery. In addition, time-in-range goals have been defined as metrics for CGM.

### Exercise and type 2 diabetes: the American College of Sports Medicine and the American diabetes association: joint position statement [^1125DXVA]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia: causes and prevention.

Of greatest concern to many exercisers is the risk of hypoglycemia. In individuals whose diabetes is being controlled by lifestyle alone, the risk of developing hypoglycemia during exercise is minimal, making stringent measures unnecessary to maintain BG. Glucose monitoring can be performed before and after PA to assess its unique effect. Activities of longer duration and lower intensity generally cause a decline in BG levels but not to the level of hypoglycemia. While very intense activities can cause transient elevations in BG, intermittent high-intensity exercise done immediately after breakfast in individuals treated with diet only reduces BG levels and insulin secretion.

In insulin or insulin secretagogue users, who frequently have the effects of both exercise and insulin to increase glucose uptake, PA can complicate diabetes management. For preexercise BG levels of less than 100 mg/dl (5.5 mmol/l), ADA recommends that carbohydrate be ingested before any PA, but this applies only to individuals taking insulin or the secretagogues more likely to cause hypoglycemia (e.g. sulfonylureas such as glyburide, glipizide, and glimepiride, as well as nateglinide and repaglinide). If controlled with diet or other oral medications, most individuals will not need carbohydrate supplements for exercise lasting less than an hour. Insulin users should likely consume up to 15 g of carbohydrate before exercise for an initial BG level of 100 mg/dl or lower, with the actual amount dependent on injected insulin doses, exercise duration and intensity, and results of BG monitoring. Intense, short exercise requires lesser or no carbohydrate intake.

Later-onset hypoglycemia is a greater concern when carbohydrate stores (i.e. muscle and liver glycogen) are depleted during an acute bout of exercise. In particular, high-intensity exercise (e.g. repeated interval or intense resistance training) can result in substantial depletion of muscle glycogen, thereby increasing risk for postexercise hypoglycemia in users of insulin or insulin secretagogues. In such cases, the consumption of 5–30 g of carbohydrate during and within 30 min after exhaustive, glycogen-depleting exercise will lower hypoglycemia risk and allow for more efficient restoration of muscle glycogen.

Evidence statement.

Persons with type 2 diabetes not using insulin or insulin secretagogues are unlikely to experience hypoglycemia related to PA. Users of insulin and insulin secretagogues are advised to supplement with carbohydrate as needed to prevent hypoglycemia during and after exercise. ACSM evidence category C. ADA C level recommendation.

### Hypoglycaemia and its management in primary care setting [^117EeJYq]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypoglycaemia is common in patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes and constitutes a major limiting factor in achieving glycaemic control among people with diabetes. While hypoglycaemia is defined as a blood glucose level under 70mg/dL (3.9mmol/L), symptoms may occur at higher blood glucose levels in individuals with poor glycaemic control. Severe hypoglycaemia is defined as an episode requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions to assure neurologic recovery. Hypoglycaemia is the most important safety outcome in clinical studies of glucose lowering agents. The American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care recommends that a management protocol for hypoglycaemia should be designed and implemented by every hospital, along with a clear prevention and treatment plan. A tailored approach, using clinical and pathophysiologic disease stratification, can help individualize glycaemic goals and promote new therapies to improve quality of life of patients. Data from recent large clinical trials reported low risk of hypoglycaemic events with the use of newer anti-diabetic drugs. Increased hypoglycaemia risk is observed with the use of insulin and/or sulphonylureas. Vulnerable patients with T2D at dual risk of severe hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular outcomes show features of "frailty". Many of such patients may be better treated by the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors rather than insulin. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) should be considered for all individuals with increased risk for hypoglycaemia, impaired hypoglycaemia awareness, frequent nocturnal hypoglycaemia and with history of severe hypoglycaemia. Patients with impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia benefit from real-time CGM. The diabetes educator is an invaluable resource and can devote the time needed to thoroughly educate the individual to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia and integrate the information within the entire construct of diabetes self-management. Conversations about hypoglycaemia facilitated by a healthcare professional may reduce the burden and fear of hypoglycaemia among patients with diabetes and their family members. Optimizing insulin doses and carbohydrate intake, in addition to a short warm up before or after the physical activity sessions may help avoiding hypoglycaemia. Several therapeutic considerations are important to reduce hypoglycaemia risk during pregnancy including administration of rapid-acting insulin analogues rather than human insulin, pre-conception initiation of insulin analogues, and immediate postpartum insulin dose reduction.

### Hypoglycemia: still the limiting factor in the glycemic management of diabetes [^113LzePM]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the prevalence of, risk factors for, and prevention of hypoglycemia from the perspective of the pathophysiologic aspects of glucose counterregulation in diabetes.

Methods

This review is based on personal experience and research and the relevant literature.

Results

Although it can result from insulin excess alone, iatrogenic hypoglycemia is generally the result of the interplay of therapeutic insulin excess and compromised defenses against declining plasma glucose concentrations. Failure of beta-cells of the pancreas — early in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus but later in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) — causes loss of the first 2 physiologic defenses: a decrease in insulin and an increase in glucagon. Such patients are critically dependent on epinephrine, the third physiologic defense, and neurogenic symptoms that prompt the behavioral defense (carbohydrate ingestion). An attenuated sympathoadrenal response to declining glucose levels — caused by recent antecedent hypoglycemia, prior exercise, or sleep — causes hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) and thus a vicious cycle of recurrent hypoglycemia. Accordingly, hypoglycemia is infrequent early in T2DM but becomes increasingly more frequent in advanced (absolutely endogenous insulin-deficient) T2DM, and risk factors for HAAF include absolute endogenous insulin deficiency; a history of severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, or both; and aggressive glycemic therapy per se.

Conclusion

By practicing hypoglycemia risk reduction — addressing the issue, applying the principles of aggressive glycemic therapy, and considering both the conventional risk factors and those indicative of HAAF — it is possible both to improve glycemic control and to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia in many patients.

### Variation in hypoglycemia ascertainment and report in type 2 diabetes observational studies: a meta-epidemiological study [^114HKKai]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

Hypoglycemia is a common, serious, yet potentially preventable, adverse health outcome in the management of type 2 diabetes. Hypoglycemia prevention is predicted on the ability to capture, track and evaluate events as they occur in real-world practice. In this meta-epidemiological review of observational studies of patients with type 2 diabetes, we found substantial heterogeneity in the definition, ascertainment and report of hypoglycemia, particularly for non-severe events.

Recognizing the importance of a uniform definition for hypoglycemia, on 21 November 2016, the IHSG proposed a taxonomy for non-severe (further subdivided into level 1 and level 2) and severe (level 3) hypoglycemia. The IHSG further advised that all clinical trials of diabetes management report on level 2 and level 3 hypoglycemia, with an option to also report level 1 hypoglycemia. However, observational (ie, non-randomized) studies are an invaluable source of information on adverse events in real-world settings and as such it was critical to examine how hypoglycemia was defined in such studies. This is especially important for retrospective studies that rely on secondary analyses of existing data collected for other reasons, whether for clinical care or billing/administrative purposes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically examine the definitions of non-severe and severe hypoglycemia used by observational studies that form the evidence base for hypoglycemia prevention among adults with type 2 diabetes. Although most of the recent studies tend to adhere to the IHSG recommendations, the hypoglycemia definitions remained inconsistent. Overall, almost a fifth of the studies provided no definition of hypoglycemia at all. An additional 17% were loosely adherent, as they relied on ICD diagnosis codes from clinical encounters and may be construed to indirectly imply need for medication attention. Such heterogeneity in hypoglycemia reporting hinders comparisons across studies and precludes generalizable inferences about the safety of diabetes management across populations and settings.

Question 9 — structured patient education with follow-up vs unstructured advice for people receiving insulin therapy at high risk for hypoglycemia — has the following background: Most people receiving insulin therapy are at risk for hypoglycemia; repeated hypoglycemia confers high risk for impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) and hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure; studies using CGM in T1D and T2D identify that serious hypoglycemia occurs in many individuals; in 6 studies including individuals with T1D most participants had serious hypoglycemia with a majority having multiple episodes per week including episodes not associated with symptoms; studies of people with T2D show hypoglycemia is common, especially in those taking insulin; and studies have identified level 2 hypoglycemia in patients with both good and poor glycemic control and in patients with T2D and renal dysfunction.

### A rare cause of hypoglycemia in a type 2 diabetic patient: insulinoma [^112wRjF9]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2012). Low credibility.

Recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes are often associated with the ongoing treatment regimen. However, despite changes in treatment modalities, assessment of the causes of hypoglycemia in nondiabetic patients in the presence of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia is very important. The treatment that had been provided for 6 years in a 67-year-old female patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus was discontinued due to hypoglycemic episodes that presented for the previous 2 years. The patient experienced persistent hypoglycemia after cessation of the treatment and was hospitalized for further examination. Spontaneous hypoglycemia with a final diagnosis of insulinoma was established following histopathologic evaluation and was relieved postoperation. Insulinoma is rarely encountered as a cause of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Insulin-secreting tumors should be considered where hypoglycemic episodes occur despite discontinuation of insulin and other antidiabetic treatment with endogenous hyperinsulinemia being noncompliant with the blood glycemic levels.

### Management of individuals with diabetes at high risk for hypoglycemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1167vzLV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

Hypoglycemia in people with diabetes is common, especially in those taking medications such as insulin and sulfonylureas (SU) that place them at higher risk. Hypoglycemia is associated with distress in those with diabetes and their families, medication nonadherence, and disruption of life and work, and it leads to costly emergency department visits and hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality.

Objective

To review and update the diabetes-specific parts of the 2009 Evaluation and Management of Adult Hypoglycemic Disorders: Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline and to address developing issues surrounding hypoglycemia in both adults and children living with diabetes. The overriding objectives are to reduce and prevent hypoglycemia.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of clinician experts, together with a patient representative, and methodologists with expertise in evidence synthesis and guideline development, identified and prioritized 10 clinical questions related to hypoglycemia in people living with diabetes. Systematic reviews were conducted to address all the questions. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on 10 questions specific to hypoglycemia risk and prevention in people with diabetes for which 10 recommendations were made. The guideline includes conditional recommendations for use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and algorithm-driven insulin pumps in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D), use of CGM for outpatients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for hypoglycemia, use of long-acting and rapid-acting insulin analogs, and initiation of and continuation of CGM for select inpatient populations at high risk for hypoglycemia. Strong recommendations were made for structured diabetes education programs for those at high risk for hypoglycemia, use of glucagon preparations that do not require reconstitution vs those that do for managing severe outpatient hypoglycemia for adults and children, use of real-time CGM for individuals with T1D receiving multiple daily injections, and the use of inpatient glycemic management programs leveraging electronic health record data to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

Conclusion

The recommendations are based on the consideration of critical outcomes as well as implementation factors such as feasibility and values and preferences of people with diabetes. These recommendations can be used to inform clinical practice and health care system improvement for this important complication for people living with diabetes.

### Hypoglycemia in patient with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin: it can happen [^116p5Hy8]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Hypoglycemia prevalence in people with T2D

In a trial of participants with T2D treated with insulin glargine, hypoglycemia (defined as blood glucose ≤ 3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL)) was detected in 56.9% of the participants by open-label, 3-day, blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) as compared with 26.4% of the participants by their 8-point profile, self-monitored blood glucose. In a study using 5-day blinded CGM, Gehlaut et al found that 75% of participants with T2D were unaware of hypoglycemic episodes (defined as glucose < 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)) detected by CGM. While best practice is to confirm suspected or CGM-identified hypoglycemia by self-monitored blood glucose, it is clear that much hypoglycemia objectively identified by CGM is not checked when CGM readings are not available in real-time. These studies suggest that the frequency of hypoglycemia in T2D is much higher than previously appreciated by both clinicians or people with T2D themselves.

Insulin treatment duration and hypoglycemia rates

In a multicenter observational study, UK researchers recruited individuals with either T2D or T1D to participate in a 9-month to 12-month prospective study in which their hypoglycemic burden was measured by questionnaires and CGM. People with T2D were divided into three treatment groups: insulin for < 2 years, insulin for > 5 years and sulfonylureas. The study reported in 2007 that self-reported severe hypoglycemic episodes occurred in about 7% of the group with T2D who had been taking insulin for < 2 years, a frequency comparable to the group taking sulfonylureas. The group with T2D taking insulin for over 5 years had a significantly higher risk of severe hypoglycemia, with around 25% reporting a severe hypoglycemic episode during the study. Thus, between 2 and 5 years of insulin treatment, rates of self-reported severe hypoglycemia in individuals with T2D had tripled.

The UK Hypoglycaemia Study Group also reported that the proportion of patients with T2D taking insulin for over 5 years who reported at least one severe hypoglycemic event was comparable to that of adults with T1D diagnosed within the last 5 years, and lower than adults with T1D for > 15 years. Although reported per-person-year rates of hypoglycemia are higher for T1D than insulin-treated T2D, there are many more people with insulin-treated T2D, resulting in more events of hypoglycemia (especially severe hypoglycemia resulting in hospitalization) among the insulin-treated T2D population.

### Update in the CNS response to hypoglycemia [^1132Jfbv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia remains a major clinical issue in the management of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Research in basic science is only beginning to unravel the mechanisms that: 1) underpin the detection of hypoglycemia and initiation of a counterregulatory defense response; and 2) contribute to the development of defective counterregulation in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, particularly after prior exposure to repeated hypoglycemia. In animal studies, the central nervous system has emerged as key to these processes. However, bench-based research needs to be translated through studies in human subjects as a first step to the future development of clinical intervention. This Update reviews studies published in the last 2 yr that examined the central nervous system effects of hypoglycemia in human subjects, largely through neuroimaging techniques, and compares these data with those obtained from animal studies and the implications for future therapies. Based on these studies, it is increasingly clear that our understanding of how the brain responds and adapts to recurrent hypoglycemia remains very limited. Current therapies have provided little evidence that they can prevent severe hypoglycemia or improve hypoglycemia awareness in type 1 diabetes. There remains an urgent need to increase our understanding of how and why defective counterregulation develops in type 1 diabetes in order for novel therapeutic interventions to be developed and tested.

### Severe hypoglycemia and risks of vascular events and death [^111yZBb5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Severe hypoglycemia may increase the risk of a poor outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes assigned to an intensive glucose-lowering intervention. We analyzed data from a large study of intensive glucose lowering to explore the relationship between severe hypoglycemia and adverse clinical outcomes.

Methods

We examined the associations between severe hypoglycemia and the risks of macrovascular or microvascular events and death among 11,140 patients with type 2 diabetes, using Cox proportional-hazards models with adjustment for covariates measured at baseline and after randomization.

Results

During a median follow-up period of 5 years, 231 patients (2.1%) had at least one severe hypoglycemic episode; 150 had been assigned to intensive glucose control (2.7% of the 5571 patients in that group), and 81 had been assigned to standard glucose control (1.5% of the 5569 patients in that group). The median times from the onset of severe hypoglycemia to the first major macrovascular event, the first major microvascular event, and death were 1.56 years (interquartile range, 0.84 to 2.41), 0.99 years (interquartile range, 0.40 to 2.17), and 1.05 years (interquartile range, 0.34 to 2.41), respectively. During follow-up, severe hypoglycemia was associated with a significant increase in the adjusted risks of major macrovascular events (hazard ratio, 2.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01 to 4.12), major microvascular events (hazard ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.19 to 2.74), death from a cardiovascular cause (hazard ratio, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.72 to 4.19), and death from any cause (hazard ratio, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.97 to 3.67) (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Similar associations were apparent for a range of nonvascular outcomes, including respiratory, digestive, and skin conditions (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). No relationship was found between repeated episodes of severe hypoglycemia and vascular outcomes or death.

Conclusions

Severe hypoglycemia was strongly associated with increased risks of a range of adverse clinical outcomes. It is possible that severe hypoglycemia contributes to adverse outcomes, but these analyses indicate that hypoglycemia is just as likely to be a marker of vulnerability to such events.

### Insulin therapy and hypoglycemia [^115pdv2o]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia is the most important and common side effect of insulin therapy. It is also the rate limiting factor in safely achieving excellent glycemic control. A three-fold increased risk of severe hypoglycemia occurs in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes with tight glucose control. This dictates a need to individualize therapy and glycemia goals to minimize this risk. Several ways to reduce hypoglycemia risk are recognized and discussed. They include frequent monitoring of blood sugars with home blood glucose tests and sometimes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in order to identify hypoglycemia particularly in hypoglycemia unawareness. Considerations include prompt measured hypoglycemia treatment, attempts to reduce glycemic variability, balancing basal and meal insulin therapy, a pattern therapy approach and use of a physiological mimicry with insulin analogues in a flexible manner. Methods to achieve adequate control while focusing on minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia are delineated in this article.

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112d7Shs]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes — definition and classification of hypoglycemia describes that hypoglycemia is often the major limiting factor in the glycemic management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with Level 1 hypoglycemia defined as a measurable glucose concentration < 70 mg/dL (< 3.9 mmol/L) and ≥ 54 mg/dL (≥ 3.0 mmol/L), and a blood glucose concentration of 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) recognized as a threshold for adrenergic responses to falling glucose in people without diabetes. Level 2 hypoglycemia is defined as a blood glucose concentration < 54 mg/dL [< 3.0 mmol/L] and is the threshold at which neuroglycopenic symptoms begin to occur and requires immediate action to resolve hypoglycemia. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include, but are not limited to, shakiness, irritability, confusion, tachycardia, sweating, and hunger.

### Frequency and risk factors of severe hypoglycemia in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes: a literature survey [^116yEnhz]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2006). Low credibility.

Intensive treatment regimens including early initiation of insulin treatment are important to prevent late complications in type 2 diabetes. The assumed risk of severe hypoglycemia (SH) is a major barrier to initiation of insulin treatment. To assess the relevance of this risk we evaluated the frequency of SH as reported in the literature. Using Medline and Embase search we identified 11 studies (5 retrospective and 6 prospective) including at least 50 patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes followed for at least 6 months in which frequency of SH was reported. The incidence of SH in the retrospective studies varied from 15 to 73 episodes per 100 patient-year with a proportion of the patients having one or more episodes between 1.4 to 15%. In the prospective studies, both incidence rate and proportion of the patients having one or more episodes of SH were lower than in the retrospective studies. Only few studies looked into the impact of risk factors on the rate of SH. Impaired hypoglycemia awareness, high age, long duration of diabetes and insulin therapy increased the risk, while no association was found with HbA1c and insulin dose. The present knowledge of SH in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes is characterized by the paucity of data and the heterogeneity of the few studies available. Large and long-lasting studies with SH as primary endpoint are warranted in order to further clarify the occurrence of SH and influence of the risk factors in unselected patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.

1 INTRODUCTION

With progressive pancreatic β‐cell failure, many people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) will eventually require insulin, either alone or in combination with other glucose‐lowering agents. A common adverse side effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycaemia. Its causes and risk factors are well established, particularly in type 1 diabetes (T1DM), and hypoglycaemia is an important and potentially preventable cause of morbidity, mortality, substantial socio‐economic costs, diminished productivity and reduced quality of life. In particular, severe hypoglycaemia (SH), characterized by incapacitating cognitive impairment and defined by necessitating assistance for recovery, is a marker of high absolute risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in people with T2DM. Fear of SH is a significant barrier to optimizing glycaemic control in T2DM, both for patients, whose motivation to adhere to intensive regimens is diminished, and for health care providers, who are often reluctant to initiate or intensify treatment. By identifying the potential risk factors in people with insulin‐treated T2DM and introducing measures to minimize SH, it may be possible to overcome this barrier and deliver better glycaemic control.

While the role of insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as the sulphonylureas, in provoking SH is well recognized, the range of potential factors that are associated with an increased risk of SH has received less attention in adults with T2DM than in those with T1DM. Established risk factors in T2DM include a preceding history of SH, older age, longer duration of diabetes, renal impairment and chronic kidney disease (CKD), cognitive impairment, cardiovascular disease, depression, cardiac failure and impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia. In addition, the risk of SH is known to rise with increasing duration of insulin treatment. Karter et al. developed a hypoglycaemia risk stratification tool in T2DM that uses six predictors, namely a history of hypoglycaemia‐related health care utilization, insulin use, sulphonylurea use, emergency department use, renal dialysis or CKD stage 4 or 5, and age. These predictors can be applied in clinical practice to identify patients at higher risk. However, as other patient‐related and treatment characteristics have been described that are associated with increased risk of hypoglycaemia, further real‐world investigation of these and other unidentified factors is warranted.

The present study aimed to identify factors associated with increased risk of SH that resulted in emergency medical treatment in insulin‐treated T2DM in addition to those already established, by using data derived from a large administrative health care claims database in the USA.

### Drug-related risk of severe hypoglycaemia in observational studies: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111LErRG]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common disease with increasing prevalence. DM can lead to microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, as well as macrovascular complications caused mainly by atherosclerotic changes that cause myocardial infarction, stroke, TIA, and peripheral vascular disease. Hyperglycaemia is an important pathophysiological factor in the development of these complications and key to keeping the glucose concentration close to euglycaemic levels in the treatment of diabetes. This is very challenging in clinical practice because of the risk of treatment-induced hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia can be perceived from clinical, physiological, or pathophysiological perspectives through risk factors and preventive measures. Clinical hypoglycaemia is described by the Whipple triad. A plasma glucose concentration < 3.9 mmol/l (< 70 mg/dl) with (documented symptomatic) or without symptoms (asymptomatic) is regarded as the threshold for hypoglycaemic events. A severe hypoglycaemic event (SHE) is defined as one requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Plasma glucose measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of normal plasma glucose levels is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration. Severe hypoglycaemia is common in both types of DM, but less frequent in type 2 (T2). The number of events depends on many factors, including type, duration of diabetes, and types of treatment. The event rates for severe hypoglycaemia in insulin-treated patients as reported in the literature and expressed as episodes per 100 patient-years range from 62 to 320 in type 1 (T1) DM, and from 0 to 73 in T2 DM.

### Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) | Diabetes… [^1145SjR5]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Low blood sugar can be dangerous if left untreated.
- Blood sugar below 70 mg/dL is considered low.
- Low blood sugar is especially common in people with type 1 diabetes. Overview Blood sugar levels change often during the day. When they drop below 70 mg/dL, this is called having low blood sugar. At this level, you need to take action to bring it back up. Low blood sugar is especially common in people with type 1 diabetes. Knowing how to spot low blood sugar is important because it can be dangerous if left untreated. Read more about what causes low blood sugar and common symptoms. You may wake up when you have low blood sugar, but you shouldn't rely on that. A continuous glucose monitor can alert you if your blood sugar gets low while you're sleeping. Severe low blood sugar As your low blood sugar gets worse, you may have more serious symptoms, including:

- Feeling weak.
- Having trouble walking or seeing clearly.
- Acting strange or feeling confused.
- Having seizures. Severe low blood sugar is below 54 mg/dL. Blood sugar this low may make you faint. Often, you'll need someone to help you treat severe low blood sugar. Hypoglycemia unawareness You may not have any symptoms when your blood sugar is low. If you don't have symptoms, it will be harder to treat your low blood sugar early. This increases your risk of having severe lows and can be dangerous. This is more likely to happen if you:

- Have had diabetes for more than 5–10 years.
- Often have low blood sugar.
- Take certain medicines, such as beta blockers for high blood pressure. If you meet one or more of the above and you have hypoglycemia unawareness, check your blood sugar more often. Checking is especially important to do before driving or being physically active. Causes There are many reasons why you may have low blood sugar, including:

- Taking too much insulin.
- Not eating enough carbohydrates for how much insulin you take.
- Timing of when you take your insulin.
- The amount and timing of physical activity.
- Drinking alcohol.
- How much fat, protein, and fiber are in your meal.
- Hot and humid weather.
- Unexpected changes in your schedule.
- Spending time at a high altitude.
- Going through puberty.
- Having your period.

### Variation in hypoglycemia ascertainment and report in type 2 diabetes observational studies: a meta-epidemiological study [^113DNsvV]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Observational studies constitute an important evidence base for hypoglycemia in diabetes management. This requires consistent and reliable ascertainment and reporting methodology, particularly in studies of type 2 diabetes where hypoglycemia risk is heterogeneous. Therefore, we aimed to examine the definitions of hypoglycemia used by observational studies of patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

We conducted a meta-epidemiological review of observational studies reporting on hypoglycemia or evaluating glucose-lowering medications in adults with type 2 diabetes. MEDLINE and Google Scholar were searched from January 1970 to May 2018. The definitions of non-severe, severe and nocturnal hypoglycemia were examined.

Results

We reviewed 243 studies: 47.7% reported on non-severe hypoglycemia, 77.8% on severe hypoglycemia and 16.9% on nocturnal hypoglycemia; 5.8% did not specify. Among 116 studies reporting non-severe hypoglycemia, 18.1% provided no definition, 23.3% used glucose values, 38.8% relied on patient-reported symptoms, 17.2% accepted either glucose values or patient-reported symptoms and 2.6% relied on International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes. Among 189 studies reporting severe hypoglycemia, 11.1% provided no definition, 53.4% required symptoms needing assistance, 3.7% relied on glucose values, 14.8% relied on ICD codes, 2.6% relied on ICD codes or glucose values and 15.9% required both symptoms needing assistance and glucose values. Overall, 38.2% of non-severe and 67.7% of severe hypoglycemia definitions were consistent with the International Hypoglycemia Study Group.

Conclusions

The marked heterogeneity in how hypoglycemia is defined in observational studies may contribute to the inadequate understanding and correction of hypoglycemia risk factors among patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Effects of intensive therapy and antecedent hypoglycemia on counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes [^112v9H4C]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Large randomized controlled multicenter clinical trials have demonstrated the benefit of improved glycemic control on microvascular complications in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. These compelling data have produced a paradigm shift in the treatment of diabetes (particularly type 2 diabetes) striving for A1C values < 7.0%. The major drawbacks of tight metabolic control in patients with type 1 diabetes are well documented and include increased hypoglycemia and weight gain.

Recently, three large studies have investigated the effects of rigorous metabolic control (A1C < 7.0%) on the prevalence of macrovascular disease in type 2 diabetes. The overall conclusion of these studies was that A1C values < 7.0% did not produce a statistically significant reduction in macrovascular events but did produce a marked increase in hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes. The effects of intensive therapy on physiological counterregulatory responses during hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes have not been thoroughly investigated. Burge et al. demonstrated that improving glycemic control during an 8-day in-patient admission could lower symptom responses and plasma glucose levels for activation of epinephrine during hypoglycemia. Levy et al. using a cross-sectional study design, also concluded that improved glycemic control in type 2 diabetes shifts the thresholds for counterregulatory hormone release to lower plasma glucose concentrations during hypoglycemia. Korzon-Burakowska et al. improved A1C from 11.3 ± 1.1 to 8.1 ± 0.9% during a 4-month period. Thresholds (i.e. plasma glucose values) for counterregulatory hormone release and epinephrine and cortisol responses were lowered by improved glycemic control. Spyer et al. investigating a group of seven type 2 diabetic patients with an A1C of 7.4%, also found that the glycemic thresholds for counterregulatory hormone release were reduced from elevated to normal physiological glucose levels. However, similar to some but not all studies, there was no difference in values of the key counterregulatory hormones, epinephrine and glucagon, during hypoglycemia when compared with nondiabetic control subjects. Studies investigating the mechanisms regulating counterregulatory responses during hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes are even fewer. Segel et al. determined that antecedent hypoglycemia in a group of type 2 diabetic patients with an A1C of 8.1% resulted in hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure similar to patients with type 1 diabetes. Despite the above data, two questions remain unanswered: 1) What are the effects of a period of rigorous glycemic control to reduce A1C < 7.0% on counterregulatory responses in type 2 diabetes, and 2) what are the effects of antecedent hypoglycemia on autonomic nervous system (ANS), neuroendocrine, and metabolic counterregulatory mechanisms before and after a period of rigorous metabolic control in type 2 diabetes? In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that 6-month intensive therapy to lower A1C < 7.0% would impair counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia and that antecedent hypoglycemia would further impair key homeostatic counterregulatory mechanisms during subsequent hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes.

Involving healthcare providers in treating hypoglycemic events

The second item in the chain is involving HCPs in treating hypoglycemic events. HCPs often are not informed when hypoglycemia occurs, whether severe or non-severe; only 26% (T1D) and 33% (T2D) of people with diabetes sought medical care for hypoglycemic events and only 24% (T1D) and 31% (T2D) consulted with their own physician/nurse. The opportunity for treatment support is missed, and sharing information with the individual's HCP requires a separate action following the event, which creates additional barriers to sharing.

Recalling hypoglycemic episodes

The third item in the chain is recalling hypoglycemic episodes. While almost 90% of individuals with a documented, severe hypoglycemic episode within the last year recalled that they had such an episode, those experiencing frequent episodes 'had incomplete recall, resulting in a 15% underestimation of the overall rate'. In a research study of mild hypoglycemia, recall was low over a 4-week period (48% for T1D and 75% for T2D); given the 3-month to 4-month interval for routine diabetes care visits (even among conscientious individuals), it is likely that recall would be even lower during such visits.

### Rates and predictors of hypoglycaemia in 27 585 people from 24 countries with insulin-treated type 1 and type 2 diabetes: the global HAT study [^113VeX2Q]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Insulin therapy is essential for the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D), and is often required for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Hypoglycaemia remains a limiting factor in achieving good glycaemic control 1 and recent diabetes treatment guidelines highlight the need for personalized glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) targets to balance reductions in hyperglycaemia with the potential risks of hypoglycaemia 2, 3.

Previous studies in hypoglycaemia have been focused on the safety and efficacy of particular drugs 4, 5, 6, 7. Data regarding hypoglycaemia rates obtained from randomized controlled trials, as opposed to observational studies, must be interpreted with caution as these often exclude older patients, and those with recurrent hypoglycaemia, very poor glycaemic control (HbA1c > 10%), or concomitant medical conditions, even though these variables are often seen in the clinic. In addition, such studies are conducted under controlled conditions, with regular contact and follow‐up between patients and trial physicians, and are often of a treat‐to‐target design to meet regulatory requirements 8. Both this selection of patients and trial design are likely to influence the observed rate of hypoglycaemia.

Observational studies and surveys conducted thus far have reported somewhat higher non‐severe hypoglycaemia frequency ranges of 3.5–7.2 events/month for T1D 1, 9, 10, 11 and 0.8–4.0 events/month for T2D 1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13; however, these studies were primarily retrospective or cross‐sectional studies (leading to potential recall bias), conducted online (restricting participation to those who have access to and ability to use the internet, which is a potential source of selection bias, particularly for older patients), and have thus far been limited to North America and Europe.

Beyond hypoglycaemia rates, it is also important to examine factors associated with hypoglycaemia to identify higher‐risk patients and to tailor treatment appropriately, particularly with regard to setting realistic targets for glycaemic control. Large‐scale studies of hypoglycaemia rates in clinical practice are therefore required to determine any factors associated with hypoglycaemia, and to ascertain the real‐life magnitude and impact of hypoglycaemia rates, particularly outside Europe and North America.

The aim of the present study, the HAT study, was to examine the impact of hypoglycaemia in an insulin‐using global patient population in an epidemiological observational study covering a 6‐month retrospective and a 4‐week prospective time period.

Definition, Frequency, and Severity of Hypoglycemia in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The Scope of the Problem

Hypoglycemia is a common problem in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), occurring most frequently with medications that raise insulin levels independently of blood glucose, such as oral insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas and glinides) and exogenous insulin. Unfortunately, there is no consensus definition of hypoglycemia in diabetes, and no standard definition of hypoglycemia has been used in clinical trials, making it difficult to assess its incidence, with substantial variation in reported rates. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) Workgroup on Hypoglycemiadefined hypoglycemia as "any abnormally low plasma glucose concentration that exposes the subject to potential harm" with a proposed threshold of plasma glucose < 70 mg/dL (< 3.9 mmol/L), with or without symptoms, below which the neuroendocrine counterregulatory response is physiologically activated, prompting the behavioral defense of rapid carbohydrate ingestion. The European Medicines Agency (EMA), on the other hand (in the 2006 note for guidance on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of diabetes mellitus), recommended a lower threshold of plasma glucose (< 3 mmol/L) to define hypoglycemia when assessing the hypoglycemic risk of different treatment regimens, to allow for a more robust detection of clinically relevant hypoglycemia. Of note, most recent trials have consistently defined clinically severe hypoglycemia as any episode in which a patient is unable to self-treat, and thus requires the assistance of another person, making the data on severe hypoglycemia less subjective and, likely, more reliable.

### Risk of any hypoglycaemia with newer antihyperglycaemic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111BQDLD]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

To date, the heterogeneity of hypoglycaemia definitions, especially of nonsevere events, has deterred comparative research on this important adverse outcome. In 2005, an overarching definition of hypoglycaemia was suggested as; "all episodes of an abnormally low plasma glucose concentration that exposes the individual to potential harm". 42 It has been argued that a single definition to encompass all the varying severities, blood glucose values, symptom perception, monitoring, reporting and ascertainment of events is not appropriate. 43 Following the Diabetes Complication and Control Trial (DCCT), severe hypoglycaemia has typically been defined as requiring external assistance 44 with or without blood glucose documentation. The International Hypoglycaemia Study Group, in a joint position statement with the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) now recommends a blood glucose concentration of < 3.9 mmol/L to denote an alert value, < 3.0 mmol/L to indicate a serious episode, and requiring external assistance, a severe episode. 45

Systematic review and meta‐analyses allow for sufficient power to evaluate low‐frequency outcomes. However, pooling estimates of rare adverse events compared to efficacy end‐points presents with its own unique challenges. 46 For instance, consensus is lacking on the optimal pooling methods and handling of studies with zero events in both arms. 47 Some argue that studies with zero events lack information and its inclusion may negate an otherwise statistical finding. 48 Others claim exclusion of studies with zero events does not consider all the available evidence and may overestimate risk. 49 Recently, inclusion of studies with zero events has fostered support 50 and providing results of both analyses has been recommended. 48

In this systematic review and meta‐analysis, we evaluate the risk of any and severe hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes relative to placebo in studies which only permit the use of metformin, DPP4i, GLP1RA or SGLT2i administered alone or in any combination with each other.

2 SEVERE HYPOGLYCAEMIA

2.1 Pathophysiology

In β‐cell failure, as occurs in T1D and in advanced T2D, normal physiology is disrupted, whereby a decrease in plasma glucose does not suppress β‐cell insulin secretion, and the signal to increase pancreatic α‐cell glucagon secretion during hypoglycaemia is absent. 10, 11 Additionally, the sympathoadrenal response is reduced with diminished release of catecholamines, which would normally be secreted to raise blood glucose and thus compensate for a deficiency of glucagon; this results in compromised glucose counter‐regulation and is also associated with impairment of hypoglycaemia awareness. 10, 11 Although excess insulin per se is sufficient to cause hypoglycaemia, the influence of both relative or absolute therapeutic hyperinsulinaemia, and compromised physiological and behavioural defences against falling plasma glucose concentrations, ultimately contribute to iatrogenic hypoglycaemia. 12

Hypoglycaemia can induce a myriad of pathophysiological adverse effects including oxidative stress, 13 result in life‐threatening events such as cardiac arrhythmias, 14 contribute to sudden cardiovascular death, 14 and cause ischaemic cerebral damage. 15, 16 These responses may potentially exert adverse effects via various mechanisms whereby acute and chronic hypoglycaemia events could increase cardiovascular risk. 17 Evidence suggests an association between severe hypoglycaemia and mortality among patients with diabetes. 18, 19 In the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease (ADVANCE) trial, death from cardiovascular and non‐cardiovascular causes was associated with severe hypoglycaemia. 19 That trial included 11 140 patients with T2D, and 19.5% of those who reported severe hypoglycaemia died versus 9.0% of those who did not. 19 Of those who died, 49% died from cardiovascular causes in those who reported severe hypoglycaemia compared with 53% in those who reported no hypoglycaemia. 19 Possible reasons for the impact of hypoglycaemia upon cardiovascular death were assumed to be sympathoadrenal activation, increased thrombogenesis or inflammation. 19 Additionally, while 16.8% and 11.5% of patients who had reported severe hypoglycaemia experienced major subsequent macro‐ and microvascular events, respectively, only 10.2% and 10.1% of patients who had no reported severe hypoglycaemia experienced events. 19 However, the authors cautioned that hypoglycaemia should not be causally linked to the outcomes reported in the ADVANCE trial, rather that hypoglycaemia might instead indicate a vulnerability to adverse events. 19 Similar results were reported in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes trial, whereby a history of severe hypoglycaemia was associated with higher mortality, and the authors cautioned that hypoglycaemia might be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease or an indicator of patient vulnerability. 18

### Attenuated sympathoadrenal responses, but not severe hypoglycemia, during aggressive glycemic therapy of early type 2 diabetes [^116mSGeH]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Iatrogenic hypoglycemia is a major limiting factor in the strict glycemic management of diabetes. Hypoglycemia can cause recurrent morbidity in many people with type 1 diabetes and also in some with advanced type 2 diabetes. Rarely fatal, fear of hypoglycemia precludes maintenance of euglycemia over a lifetime with diabetes and full realization of the vascular benefits of glycemic control. Hypoglycemic events compromise defenses against subsequent falling plasma glucose concentrations and thus cause a vicious cycle of recurrent hypoglycemia.

Hypoglycemia in diabetes is fundamentally the result of episodes of therapeutic hyperinsulinemia caused by treatment with an insulin secretagogue or insulin. In general, the incidence of iatrogenic hypoglycemia is a function of the degree of β-cell failure, and risk is predicted by the absence of evidence of endogenous insulin secretion (C-peptide). Incidence of hypoglycemia is lower in people with type 2 diabetes, who are not usually completely insulin deficient, than in those with type 1 diabetes, and this is especially true early in the course of type 2 diabetes. However, the incidence of hypoglycemia increases progressively over time, ultimately approximating that in those with type 1 diabetes, as type 2 diabetic individuals approach the insulin-deficient end of the spectrum. Because type 2 diabetes is ∼20-fold more prevalent than type 1 diabetes and many people with type 2 diabetes ultimately require treatment with insulin, most episodes of iatrogenic hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia, occur in those with type 2 diabetes.

### Minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia with vildagliptin: clinical experience, mechanistic basis, and importance in type 2 diabetes management [^115mjDkP]. Diabetes Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Even if the true incidence of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains difficult to estimate, with highly variable rates reported in the literature, it is likely more common than previously thought. While most hypoglycemic episodes in T2DM are considered "mild", they still have a substantial clinical impact. Severe hypoglycemia also exists in T2DM, with recent landmark studies prompting much debate about the potential role of severe hypoglycemia in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, even though there is currently no definitive evidence for causality. The challenge in the treatment of T2DM remains the achievement of optimal glycemic control to lower the risk for long-term complications while avoiding hypoglycemia. Successful treatment strategies should therefore include careful selection of therapies to prevent hypoglycemia, starting early in the disease management process, in order to best preserve counterregulation. The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, vildagliptin, is a good treatment option to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia over time, while maintaining good glucose control. Extensive clinical experience is available for vildagliptin, with data published for all stages of the condition and with the low hypoglycemic potential stemming from a solid mechanistic basis.

### Hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during hospitalization: associated factors and prognostic value [^116Z2CmG]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The risk factors for hypoglycemia during hospital admission and its consequences in patients with diabetes are not entirely known. The present study aimed to investigate the risk factors for hypoglycemia, as well as the potential implications of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus admitted to the hospital.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included 324 patients (214 [66.0%] men; median age 70 years, range 34–95 years) with type 2 diabetes admitted to a university hospital who were consulted the Endocrinology Department for glycemic control during a 12-month period. We investigated the potential role of demographic factors, metabolic factors, therapy, and comorbidities on the development of in-hospital hypoglycemia. We explored the prognostic value of hypoglycemia on mortality (both in-hospital and in the long-term), hospital readmission in the following year, and metabolic control (HbA1c value) after discharge (median follow-up, 886 days; range 19–1255 days).

Results

Hypoglycemia occurred in 154 (47.5%) patients during their hospitalization and was associated with advanced age, previous insulin therapy, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, lower body mass index and lower baseline HbA1c values. Hypoglycemia was associated with greater in-hospital and long-term mortality, longer hospital stays, higher readmission rates, and poorer metabolic control after discharge. These negative consequences of hypoglycemia were more frequent in patients with severe (≤ 55 mg/dL) hypoglycemia and in patients who had hypoglycemia during a greater percentage of hospitalization days.

Conclusions

Hypoglycemia during hospital admission is a marker of a poor prognosis in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Sharing information about hypoglycemic episodes during every healthcare provider visit

The fourth item in the chain is sharing information about hypoglycemic episodes during HCP visits. The loss of information due to under-recognition and incomplete recall limits the information available for sharing. But even when individuals have the relevant information in hand, there are reasons they may not raise the subject of hypoglycemia. The needs of the individual and provider are not always aligned due to limitations in visit times and competing agendas. This can lead to less frequent inquiries about hypoglycemia.

Beyond competing priorities, there may be specific disincentives in reporting hypoglycemic experience. For example, when EU legislation was implemented allowing withdrawal of a driver's license for repeated, severe hypoglycemic episodes, the number of such episodes recorded in medical records during the year following enactment dropped by 55%. The conclusion that this was a result of reduced reporting rather than a reduced episode rate was supported by an anonymous survey of the cohort of 309 adults with T1D, which demonstrated that the medical record episodes were 70% lower than reported in the survey. Finally, HCPs sometimes express negative judgments to people with diabetes regarding less than desired treatment outcomes, which creates a barrier to sharing information about hypoglycemia. People with diabetes express hesitation to report episodes of hypoglycemia due to fear of HCP disappointment, as well as feelings of guilt and shame.

Healthcare provider under-identifying and under-reporting

HCPs often under-identify and under-report episodes of hypoglycemia. The combination of HCP expectations/beliefs regarding hypoglycemia, limited time during clinical visits, variable degrees of provider-patient trust and competing agendas may all limit the HCP's ability to identify or report hypoglycemia.

Expectations based on published rates of hypoglycemia

HCPs look to the literature for rates of hypoglycemia, but the available information can be confusing. For example, Elliot et al published a review of hypoglycemia rates from 19 RCTs and 11 real-world data studies. We might expect that the higher level of oversight, more frequent data collection, and increased expectations of individuals enrolled in RCTs would increase the detection rate of hypoglycemia, but intensified patient follow-up and engagement decreases the actual incidence of hypoglycemia. Furthermore, individuals with an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including those with impaired awareness, are frequently excluded from trials. Thus, rates of hypoglycemia are consistently higher in real-world data studies compared with RCTs. This suggests that published rates of hypoglycemia from clinical trials underestimate the actual rate of hypoglycemia in the population, which may skew expectations of those who care for people with diabetes.

### High prevalence of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemia among people with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes: the Dutch diabetes pearl cohort [^115pVL54]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Insulin-related hypoglycemia is a common adverse effect of insulin therapy. Recent data show almost 98 000 visits to the emergency department and 30 000 hospitalizations in the USA per year due to insulin-related hypoglycemia. Over 75% of these emergency department visits occur in middle-aged or elderly people, suggesting that most of these people suffer from type 2 diabetes.

The reported prevalence of hypoglycemic events in people with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy is highly variable and partly determined by the duration and intensity of insulin therapy. Previous studies have shown that people with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin for < 2 years experience on average four non-severe episodes per person-year, whereas those treated for > 5 years experience 10 episodes per person-year. Similarly, severe hypoglycemia, defined as an event requiring external help to recover, rarely occurs in the first years after the start of insulin therapy but becomes more common during later years. One report estimated the overall prevalence of severe hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes treated with insulin in secondary care at 0.28 episodes per patient per year.

Recurrent exposure to hypoglycemia can induce a process of habituation leading to impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH). This syndrome increases the risk for developing severe hypoglycemia considerably, yet reflects a functional defect that can be reversed by strict avoidance of hypoglycemia. IAH has been well described in type 1 diabetes and affects approximately 25% of people with type 1 diabetes, a percentage that appears relatively stable across different cohorts and over time. Less information is available concerning the prevalence of IAH in type 2 diabetes, with reported prevalence of IAH in single-centre surveys varying between 7% and 46% among those treated with insulin. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and determinants of IAH and severe hypoglycemia in a large nationwide cohort of patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.

High-Risk Groups for Hypoglycemia and Other Special Populations

Given that one of the primary advantages of the second-generation BI is the reduction in hypoglycemia in the overall diabetes population, are there data specifically in high-risk groups for hypoglycemia? In particular, older adults (≥ 65 years), those with renal insufficiency, longer duration of diabetes or duration on insulin treatment and those with prior severe hypoglycemia are at higher risk of hypoglycemia. The focus of this section is the evaluation of hypoglycemia risk with second-generation BI analogues in the aforementioned patient populations.

Older Adults

It is estimated that approximately 40% of people with T2DM are ≥ 65 years of age. Population-based cohort studies show that older individuals have a substantially increased risk of morbidity and mortality compared to younger people with T2DM. Older adults with diabetes often have an increased duration of diabetes and other comorbidities, such as CV events, retinopathy and renal impairment. Impaired cognitive function, dementia and falls are also increased in older persons compared to younger people with T2DM. All of these factors increase the complexity of managing older people with T2DM and may substantially increase the risk of hospitalization for hypoglycemia and associated death.

Hospitalization rates for hypoglycemia reported in a large retrospective observational study carried out in the USA from 1999 to 2011 were two-fold higher in persons aged ≥ 75 years compared to those aged 65–74 years. In a 2-year prospective study, 124 subjects with T2DM aged ≥ 80 years were hospitalized with hypoglycemia, of whom 31 (25%) had severe hypoglycemia (defined as a symptomatic event requiring treatment with intravenous glucose and confirmed blood glucose level of < 50 mg/dL). This group of patients had marked comorbidity and was found to have HbA1c values of 5.1%, indicating that their diabetes was well controlled.

### Risk factors for nocturnal hypoglycemia in insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes: a secondary analysis of observational data derived from an integrated clinical trial database [^114u32WN]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

A trade-off exists in most diabetes therapies between the benefits of good glycemic control and the morbidity of hypoglycemia. Balancing these factors to achieve desired outcomes is a key consideration for personalized diabetes therapy. Hypoglycemia at night (nocturnal hypoglycemia [NH]) is a common but often under-reported problem in insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes. To better understand the risk for NH, we pooled data from multiple clinical trials of insulin treatment and specifically examined NH risk factors in relation to glycemic goals.

Methods

Of 53 randomized trials involving insulin treatment, 18 trials that collected NH data were included. Risk factors associated with NH were identified by using gradient-boosting methods. A proportional hazards model was used to quantify the hazard ratio (HR) for risk factors. By modeling with individual patient data, a patient-level NH risk score distribution was created. Finally, results of the model were used to quantify an adjustment to the glycemic goal that would fully offset each risk factor, all other factors being equal.

Findings

Data pooling resulted in the inclusion of 7341 patients with type 2 diabetes from 18 randomized clinical trials. In the mean 6-month treatment period, 43% of patients experienced at least 1 episode of NH (mean [SD], 1.1 [1.5] events/month). Reduction of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) levels during the trial was a risk factor for NH (HR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.38–1.43] per -1% of HbA 1c). Higher baseline HbA 1c level was a protective factor against NH (HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.74–0.77] per +1% of HbA 1c); and the adjustment to HbA 1c goal required to offset 1% higher baseline HbA 1c was -0.825%. Patient characteristics for risk of NH included older age (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01–1.02]) per 1-year increase), female sex (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.15–1.22]), black or African-American race (HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.33–1.50] vs white race), longer diabetes duration (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01–1.02] per 1-year increase), diabetic nephropathy (HR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.27–1.54]), and concomitant sulfonylurea use (HR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.05–1.15]). Asian race was associated with a lower risk of NH (HR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.48–0.53] vs white race); this finding could be offset with a 2.03% adjustment to the HbA 1c goal.

Implications

Data on NH are scarce. By pooling multiple clinical trials, this study was able to evaluate patient-level data. A quantitative understanding of the trade-off between individual risk factors for NH and glycemic reduction may help clinicians to personalize patients' glycemic goals, while effectively managing NH risk. Limitations of the study include that patients were selected through inclusion/exclusion criteria and that patient compliance may be better in a trial setting. Validating the findings in the real world will be helpful.

### Presence of macroalbuminuria predicts severe hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 10-year follow-up study [^114gZKP8]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The importance of glycemic control in type 2 diabetes is well-recognized because strict glycemic control decreases the incidence and progression of diabetic microvascular and macrovascular complications. However, recent, large, prospective, clinical trials showing the clinical outcomes of intensive glucose-lowering treatment observed increased risk of severe hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes, and hypoglycemia is regarded as the main barrier to achieving optimal glycemic targets in patients with type 2 diabetes.

During strict glycemic control, hypoglycemia is an inevitable clinical problem in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and all diabetic patients are exposed to the risk of hypoglycemia as long as they use glucose-lowering treatment. Hypoglycemia can impact patient quality of life, deter the pursuit of lowering blood glucose to the target range, and increase the risk of sustaining acute vascular events in patients with comorbidities. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial and the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) study have shown that intensive glucose control led to increases in macrovascular disease and cardiovascular events, although HbA 1c reached the target range, and hypoglycemia is supposed to contribute to the increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, prevention of hypoglycemic events and early detection of patients at high risk for hypoglycemia has important clinical implications in patients with diabetes.

The proportion of diabetic patients with development of severe hypoglycemia and the incidence of hypoglycemic episodes vary markedly between studies. Although most of the existing studies about severe hypoglycemia have been based on retrospective or cross-sectional data, hypoglycemic events in patients with type 2 diabetes are generally less frequent compared with those with type 1 diabetes. This finding suggests the relative preservation of β-cell function with counter-regulatory hormone responses and, consequently, a relatively lower prevalence of impaired hypoglycemia awareness in type 2 diabetes. With a steadily growing number of people with type 2 diabetes and increasing use of insulin or hypoglycemic agents for strict glycemic control, the number of cases of type 1 and type 2 diabetes with severe hypoglycemia have been increasing.

Irrespective of the type of diabetes or hypoglycemic treatment, risk factors for future development of hypoglycemic events in subjects with diabetes include advanced age, duration of diabetes, polypharmacy, history of previous hypoglycemia, and duration of insulin treatment. In addition, the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important risk factor for the development of hypoglycemia. However, the association of the presence of albuminuria with future development of severe hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetic patients without CKD is not known.

Introduction

In Japan, the goal of type 2 diabetes (T2D) treatment is to achieve good glycemic control. To do this, clinicians are free to use two injectable hypoglycemic drugs and seven oral hypoglycemic drugs. The mechanisms of action of hypoglycemic agents differ, depending on the drug group, and each group has characteristic side effects. Nevertheless, the most notable side effect common to all hypoglycemic agents is hypoglycemia. Therefore, utmost attention should be paid to it since it is associated with decreased quality of life, decreased work efficiency, and increased risk of falls and car accidents. Furthermore, hypoglycemia due to T2D drug therapies has been reported to increase the risk of cardiovascular events, dementia, and death. Hypoglycemia is listed as an adverse effect in the package inserts of not only hypoglycemic agents but also many other drugs. It is speculated that hypoglycemia caused by non-hypoglycemic agents is more likely to be severe in patients with T2D taking hypoglycemic agents than in those not taking hypoglycemic agents. It is considered that patients taking hypoglycemic medications pay attention to severe hypoglycemia caused by hypoglycemic medications but do not pay enough attention to hypoglycemia caused by non-hypoglycemic medications. By investigating the relationship between concomitantly used drugs other than hypoglycemic agents and hypoglycemia in detail, hypoglycemia severe enough to require hospitalization could be prevented in patients with T2D. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to clarify real-world factors related to an increased risk of hypoglycemia-related hospitalization (HRH) in Japanese patients with T2D on non-hypoglycemic agents that have been reported to be associated with hypoglycemia.

VA/DoD type 2 diabetes mellitus — glycemic management: For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, we suggest using high glycemic variability over time (e.g., fluctuation in HbA1c or fasting blood glucose) as a prognostic indicator for risk of hypoglycemia, morbidity, and mortality. We suggest setting an individualized HbA1c target range based on the clinician's appraisal of the risk benefit ratio, patient characteristics, presence or absence of type 2 diabetes mellitus complications, comorbidities, and life expectancy. We suggest an HbA1c range of 7.0–8.5% for most patients, if it can be safely achieved. In insulin-treated adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not achieving glycemic goals, we suggest real-time continuous glucose monitoring to decrease hypoglycemia and improve HbA1c.

### A patient-centered approach to managing patients with type 2 diabetes [^114rUBAx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of a number of therapeutic options, management of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and hyperglycemia remains suboptimal. Evidence shows that physicians are not adequately individualizing incretin-based therapies as there is lack of clear understanding of the similarities and differences between various incretin-based therapies. Additionally, sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a very recent addition to the therapeutic armamentarium, are not adequately utilized in managing patients with T2DM due to a lack of awareness or an increased concern regarding their safety, efficacy, and the mechanism of action. Insulin therapy is also not initiated or intensified appropriately due to a lack of clear understanding on when to add and how to intensify them and, more importantly, due to fear of increasing the risk of hypoglycemia in patients. To address these gaps, in the first section of this educational activity, the expert faculty will review the current understanding of the risks associated with hypoglycemia-one of the main factors that limit the successful use of insulin therapy-and when to initiate insulin therapy, as well as the available data on the risk of hypoglycemia with emerging agents. The expert faculty will also provide practical strategies on how to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia in patients. In the second section, the expert faculty will highlight the differences between the various incretin-based therapies in addition to providing strategies for physicians to individualize their choice of incretin-based therapy. The expert faculty will also review the mechanism of action, safety, efficacy, and the appropriate place for this class of therapies in the treatment continuum. In the third section, the expert faculty will discuss the mechanism of action, safety, and efficacy of the currently available SGLT2 inhibitors as well as the appropriate use of these newer agents in T2DM management.

1 INTRODUCTION

For patients with type 2 diabetes and their physicians, fear of hypoglycaemia limits attainment of glycaemic targets, 1, 2 increasing the risk of developing diabetes‐related complications. 3 The last decade has witnessed a dramatic shift favouring the use of three newer classes of antihyperglycaemic agents (AHA) including the dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors (DPP4i), glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA) and sodium glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). 4 For patients with type 2 diabetes, these AHA lower blood glucose with the promise of lower hypoglycaemia risk.

Certainly, relative to sulfonylurea (SU) or insulin, the lower risk of hypoglycaemia with AHA is clear and widely accepted. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 However, relative to placebo, efficacy‐focused studies have been unable to delineate hypoglycaemia risk with these newer AHA, mainly due to the use of background SU and insulin. For instance, a number of systematic review and meta‐analyses have found a significantly higher risk of hypoglycaemia relative to placebo. To explain the increased risk with DPP4i, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 GLP1RA 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and SGLT2i, 9, 20, 21, 22 authors have pointed to studies allowing background SU or insulin, 17, 22 have conducted post hoc sensitivity analyses to exclude studies with SU or insulin 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 23 or have left the findings unaddressed. 9, 15, 19 Thus, a meta‐analysis with hypoglycaemia of newer AHA as the primary objective which a priori excludes studies allowing other background agents is necessary.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — hypoglycemia risk minimization: In adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially those 65 years and older, we suggest prioritizing drug classes other than insulin, sulfonylureas, or meglitinides to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, if glycemic control can be achieved with other treatments. The benefits of prioritizing treatments to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia outweighed the potential harm, and patient values and preferences were similar because it was felt that most patients would want to avoid hypoglycemia.

### Real-world risk of hypoglycemia-related hospitalization in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes using SGLT2 inhibitors: a nationwide cohort study [^1167TNwB]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by a chronic hyperglycemic state due to insufficient insulin action. Persistent hyperglycemia causes microvascular disorders peculiar to diabetes, such as neuropathy, retinopathy, and renal disorder, as well as large vascular disorders, such as myocardial and cerebral infarction. In Japan, the goal when treating T2D is to achieve good glycemic control; to do this, clinicians have two types of injectable hypoglycemic drugs and seven types of oral hypoglycemic drugs at their disposal. Among the latter are sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which appeared on the market in 2014. SGLT2 inhibitors have a unique mechanism of action among hypoglycemic drugs, lowering the blood glucose level by inhibiting SGLT2 in the kidneys, which prevents reabsorption of urinary glucose and promotes glucose excretion. Of further note, in large-scale clinical trials it was reported that these drugs also lowered the risk of cardiovascular events and/or the related hospitalization and mortality rate, as well as lowering the rate of decline in renal function.

Despite these beneficial effects, SGLT2 inhibitors pose a risk of hypoglycemia, in those taking certain concomitant medications and in specific patient situations; hypoglycemia is a common side effect of hypoglycemic drugs. Hypoglycemia has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of mortality; therefore, the risk should be minimized. The goal in treating T2D is to achieve good glycemic control in the absence of hypoglycemic events, and iatrogenic hypoglycemia may necessitate a higher glycemic goal than is desirable for patients with T2D. Other notable risks of hypoglycemia include a reduced health-related quality of life, reduced work productivity, and an increased risk of hospitalization due to falls and car accidents. The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes currently position SGLT2 inhibitors as the center of management of patients with T2D, and it is particularly recommended as first-line treatment for patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease.SGLT2 inhibitors are a relatively new class of drugs and need to be further evaluated for their safety and tolerability in clinical practice. Since T2D manifests as various pathological conditions, it is necessary to individualize treatment based on the patient's risk of hypoglycemia. The purpose of this study was to identify clinical factors, such as those associated with patient backgrounds and concomitant medications, linked to a higher risk of hypoglycemia among patients with T2D treated with SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Glucose counterregulation in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113q5zfQ]. Diabetic Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Glucose counterregulatory failure and hypoglycaemia unawareness frequently complicate treatment of Type 1 diabetes mellitus, especially when aiming for intensive metabolic control. Since tight metabolic control reduces microvascular long-term complications in Type 2 diabetes mellitus, the integrity of glucose counterregulation in Type 2 diabetic patients is important. Using a Medline search, we identified 12 studies in which counterregulatory responses to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia were compared between Type 2 diabetic patients and appropriate controls. A review of these studies showed that some patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus develop mild counterregulatory dysfunction and reduced awareness of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. Some studies suggested an association between counterregulatory impairment and intensity of metabolic control. We speculate that the relatively low frequency of (severe) hypoglycaemic events in Type 2 diabetes may explain why glucose counterregulation remains unaffected in most patients. We hypothesize that residual beta-cell reserve and insulin resistance provide protection against severe hypoglycaemia and limit impaired counterregulation. Diabet. Med. 18, 519–527 (2001)
