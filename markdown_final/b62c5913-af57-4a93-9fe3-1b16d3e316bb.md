## Question

What are common injuries due to strangulation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most common injuries due to strangulation are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and epidemiology to frame what "common" means in practice. Then, I should categorize injury types by pathophysiology and frequency. Next, I will review external and internal soft-tissue injuries, followed by vascular, neurologic, and airway/aerodigestive injuries. After that, I should consider special populations and contexts, and finally synthesize a concise, prioritized list of the most common injuries with supporting data and clinical implications for screening and imaging [^111PSn2W] [^116yUAGM].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and epidemiology so I don't overgeneralize from forensic literature. Nonfatal strangulation is common in intimate partner violence, with survivors frequently lacking obvious external injuries, which means "common injuries" must include subtle or internal findings as well as overt marks. In a large forensic series, most survivors were strangled manually and had little to no visible injury, yet otolaryngology and emergency medicine literature consistently document internal soft-tissue and airway changes, and IPV-focused studies show high prevalence of strangulation with substantial lethality risk markers, underscoring the need to screen and image selectively when indicated [^111PSn2W] [^116DJCPA] [^116yUAGM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "common" equaling "severe". I should categorize injuries by mechanism and frequency to reflect what clinicians actually encounter: external soft-tissue injuries (visible or subtle), internal soft-tissue injuries (edema, petechiae, hemorrhage), vascular injuries (carotid or vertebral dissection, pseudoaneurysm), neurologic injuries (hypoxic/anoxic brain injury, diffuse axonal injury), and airway/aerodigestive injuries (laryngeal or tracheal trauma, hyoid fracture), while remembering that many patients have minimal or no external findings despite clinically meaningful internal injury [^111PSn2W] [^112JzyPY].

> I will now examine external soft-tissue injuries, which are the most frequently documented but often subtle. Let me verify the patterns: neck redness or bruising, abrasions or fingernail scratches, and facial or conjunctival petechiae are repeatedly reported on exam, though their absence is common and does not exclude significant injury. Wait, I initially thought "redness/bruising 51.4%" applied broadly, but I should double-check — those figures come from a CTA cohort where 51.4% had redness/bruising and 33.1% had neck tenderness, reinforcing that external signs can be present yet have low predictive value for vascular injury, so I need to be cautious about overinterpreting them [^111v53QH] [^111PSn2W].

> Next, I should review internal soft-tissue injuries, which are common but require deliberate examination or imaging. Let me consider the airway and neck structures: fiberoptic laryngoscopy can reveal mucosal petechiae and edema, and MRI may show intramuscular hemorrhage/edema, platysmal swelling, subcutaneous bleeding, and hemorrhagic lymph nodes; these MRI features track with more life-threatening strangulation in radiologic scoring systems. I need to ensure I note that MRI outperforms CT for detecting these subtle soft-tissue injuries in alert patients, which has implications for imaging selection and medicolegal documentation [^111PSn2W] [^112JzyPY] [^115FrqxP].

> Now, vascular injuries — wait, let me verify how "common" these are because I don't want to overstate risk. Large series suggest low but nontrivial yields: CTA of the neck identified vascular injuries in about 4.2% in one trauma-center cohort, and a multicenter series found 4.6% positivity with no reliable clinical predictors to exclude injury, arguing for liberal CTA in appropriate presentations. But hold on, I should also acknowledge conflicting data showing very low BCVI rates in some centers, which supports a selective imaging approach anchored to exam and symptoms rather than routine CTA for all. The clinical stakes are high given stroke risk if dissections are missed, so I need to balance yield, radiation, and risk while maintaining a low threshold to image when red flags are present [^111v53QH] [^115ZTLWx] [^115s37Tc] [^115xS2hm].

> I will now examine neurologic injuries, which are both common in symptom reporting and potentially underrecognized. Survivors frequently endorse dysphonia, sore throat, and odynophagia, but I should confirm the burden of hypoxic injury: in a specialized forensic sample, 54.3% reported amnesia and nearly half of those with amnesia did not recall loss of consciousness, indicating that LOC is an imperfect marker of anoxia. Let me reconsider the broader TBI context — IPV-related brain injury from repetitive head impacts and nonfatal strangulation is increasingly recognized, with neuropathology series documenting TBI stigmata and white matter abnormalities in IPV-exposed women, reinforcing the need to screen for cognitive, memory, and mood symptoms even when external findings are minimal [^113TeUBa] [^113a2DS3] [^111c5Mqh].

> Airway and aerodigestive injuries are less common but high consequence, so I should confirm the red flags. Fiberoptic evaluation may reveal laryngeal or tracheal mucosal injury, and CT can identify laryngeal fractures or hyoid fractures when suspected; although hyoid fracture is classically associated with fatal strangulation, case reports confirm it can occur after blunt neck trauma in survivors and may present with dysphagia or pain, warranting airway vigilance and ENT involvement. Hold on, I should verify that imaging yield for internal aerodigestive injury is modest overall, aligning with selective CT use rather than blanket imaging in alert patients with a normal exam [^111PSn2W] [^111EyTCa] [^117RJ4Fn].

> But wait, what about special populations and contexts that shift the injury spectrum. In children, accidental hanging and strangulation carry high mortality and risk of anoxic brain injury, and routine CTA rarely reveals cervical arterial injury, suggesting that pediatric imaging should be tailored to neurologic status and exam rather than default vascular imaging. In elders, bruising distribution and injury patterns may help distinguish abuse from falls, with larger bruises on the face, lateral arms, or posterior torso raising concern. In sexual assault, attempted strangulation is associated with increased odds of general body trauma, reinforcing the need for comprehensive head-to-toe and neck examinations [^114ujKto] [^111RdnHZ] [^116Hgb7G] [^113tS4Bv].

> Let me synthesize the most common injuries now, keeping the caveat that "common" spans visible and invisible findings. The most frequent are external soft-tissue injuries such as neck redness or bruising, abrasions or fingernail scratches, and facial or conjunctival petechiae, often subtle or absent. Internal soft-tissue injuries including laryngeal or pharyngeal petechiae and edema, strap muscle hemorrhage, and subcutaneous or intramuscular edema/hemorrhage on MRI are also common in significant cases. Neurologic symptoms reflecting hypoxic injury are frequently reported, including amnesia, confusion, headache, and transient loss of consciousness, even when not recalled. Vascular injuries, particularly carotid or vertebral dissection, are uncommon but high consequence and not reliably predicted by exam alone. Airway injuries such as laryngeal hematoma, vocal cord dysfunction, and occasional hyoid fracture are less frequent but mandate airway assessment and ENT input when suspected [^111v53QH] [^111PSn2W] [^112JzyPY] [^113TeUBa] [^115ZTLWx] [^111EyTCa].

> I should double-check the clinical implications for practice so the synthesis is actionable. Universal screening for IPV and strangulation with validated tools, careful head-and-neck examination with attention to subtle petechiae and voice changes, and a low threshold for airway evaluation are foundational. Imaging should be selective: MRI is preferred over CT for soft-tissue injury in alert patients, whereas CTA is appropriate when vascular injury is suspected or when exam and symptoms raise concern, recognizing that some centers report low yields and others argue for broader CTA given stroke risk if dissections are missed. Documentation using standardized injury terminology and attention to injury patterns improves care and legal corroboration, and counseling about lethality risk after strangulation is essential for safety planning [^116yUAGM] [^115FrqxP] [^115ZTLWx] [^115s37Tc] [^1136fM2s].

Common strangulation injuries include **external neck injuries** (bruising, abrasions, fingernail marks, ligature marks) [^111PSn2W], **internal neck injuries** (laryngeal fracture, hyoid fracture, tracheal injury, thyroid cartilage injury) [^116rD563], **vascular injuries** (carotid or vertebral artery dissection, thrombosis, pseudoaneurysm) [^115xS2hm], and **neurological injuries** (hypoxic brain injury, cerebral edema, seizures, memory loss, focal deficits) [^113TeUBa]. Victims may also have **soft-tissue injuries** (muscle strain, hematoma, edema) [^112JzyPY], **respiratory complications** (dyspnea, stridor, aspiration pneumonia) [^111PSn2W], and **psychological trauma** (PTSD, anxiety, depression) [^111b3Fdv]. Many injuries are **not externally visible** [^111PSn2W], so a high index of suspicion and appropriate imaging (CTA, MRI) [^115FrqxP] are essential for diagnosis and management [^115ZTLWx].

---

## External neck injuries

External injuries are often visible on examination and may include:

- **Bruising and abrasions**: Commonly found on the neck, often in the shape of fingers or hands, indicating manual strangulation [^notfound].

- **Fingernail marks**: Linear scratches or abrasions caused by the perpetrator's fingernails or the victim's own nails during struggle [^notfound].

- **Ligature marks**: Linear, horizontal marks on the neck caused by ropes, cords, or other ligatures used in strangulation [^notfound].

- **Petechiae**: Small, pinpoint hemorrhages on the face, conjunctiva, or oral mucosa resulting from increased venous pressure during strangulation [^111PSn2W].

---

## Internal neck injuries

Internal injuries are often not visible externally but can be severe and life-threatening:

- **Laryngeal fractures**: Fractures of the thyroid or cricoid cartilage, which can cause airway obstruction and respiratory distress [^notfound].

- **Hyoid bone fracture**: A U-shaped bone in the neck that may fracture during strangulation, particularly in older individuals [^notfound].

- **Tracheal injury**: Damage to the trachea, potentially causing airway compromise and respiratory difficulties [^117RJ4Fn].

- **Thyroid cartilage injury**: Damage to the thyroid cartilage, which can impair vocal cord function and airway patency [^notfound].

---

## Vascular injuries

Strangulation can cause significant vascular trauma, including:

- **Carotid artery dissection**: Separation of the layers of the carotid artery, potentially leading to stroke or neurological impairment [^115xS2hm].

- **Vertebral artery dissection**: Similar to carotid dissection, involving the vertebral arteries, with risk of stroke or neurological deficits [^111Yjpmo].

- **Thrombosis**: Formation of blood clots within the carotid or vertebral arteries, potentially causing ischemic stroke [^112z1VHA].

- **Pseudoaneurysm**: A false aneurysm resulting from vascular wall injury, which may rupture and cause hemorrhage [^112z1VHA].

---

## Neurological injuries

Neurological complications are common due to hypoxia and vascular injury:

- **Hypoxic brain injury**: Resulting from prolonged lack of oxygen, potentially causing cognitive impairment, memory loss, and neurological deficits [^113TeUBa].

- **Cerebral edema**: Swelling of the brain tissue due to hypoxia or vascular injury [^111RdnHZ].

- **Seizures**: Occurring as a result of hypoxic brain injury or vascular compromise [^116tQfJ7].

- **Memory loss and cognitive impairment**: Commonly reported by survivors of strangulation, often due to hypoxic brain injury [^113TeUBa].

---

## Soft-tissue injuries

Soft-tissue injuries are common and may include:

- **Muscle strain**: Injury to the sternocleidomastoid and strap muscles of the neck [^notfound].

- **Hematoma**: Collection of blood within the soft tissues of the neck, potentially causing swelling and discomfort [^1136fM2s].

- **Edema**: Swelling of the neck tissues, which may compromise airway patency [^111PSn2W].

---

## Respiratory complications

Respiratory complications are frequent and may include:

- **Dyspnea**: Difficulty breathing due to airway obstruction or injury [^111PSn2W].

- **Stridor**: High-pitched respiratory sounds indicating partial airway obstruction [^notfound].

- **Aspiration pneumonia**: Resulting from inhalation of blood or vomitus during strangulation [^notfound].

---

## Psychological trauma

Psychological trauma is common among survivors of strangulation and may include **post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)** — with anxiety, nightmares, and flashbacks — as well as anxiety and depression, which are frequently reported and may require psychological intervention [^111b3Fdv].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Given the often subtle nature of strangulation injuries, a thorough diagnostic evaluation is essential:

- **Physical examination**: Detailed examination of the neck, head, and neurological status [^111PSn2W].

- **Imaging studies**: CT angiography (CTA) or MRI may be necessary to identify vascular or internal injuries [^115FrqxP].

- **Fiberoptic laryngoscopy**: Useful for identifying internal airway injuries [^111PSn2W].

---

Strangulation injuries span external and internal neck trauma, vascular and neurological complications, soft-tissue injury, respiratory compromise, and psychological trauma. Many injuries are **not externally visible**, so clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion and use appropriate imaging and evaluation techniques to identify and manage these injuries effectively [^111PSn2W].

### Recognition and documentation of strangulation crimes: a review [^111PSn2W]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Strangulation accounts for 10% of violent deaths in the United States and 15% to 20% of deaths associated with domestic violence. However, strangulation deaths represent only a small fraction of nonfatal strangulation assaults, which occur with daily frequency in medium to large US cities. Careful evaluation and documentation of strangulation injuries may identify life-threatening medical conditions, and may facilitate prosecution of strangulation crimes.

Observations

The most recent article on strangulation identified in the otolaryngology literature was published in 1989, leaving a generation of head and neck surgeons without current guidance regarding this injury. However, strangulation is a common form of intimate partner violence. Among the 300 cases of strangulation reviewed in San Diego in 1995, most survivors (94%) were women who were strangled by a male member of their own household. Many state laws require evidence of injury to prosecute felony strangulation, but as shown in the review of 300 cases, most survivors (97%) were strangled with the perpetrator's hands, leaving little to no sign of injury in most cases. Survivors may seek an otolaryngology consultation with complaints of hoarseness, sore throat, respiratory disturbance, or accidental injury to the neck. A thorough head and neck examination may reveal marks on the neck, facial petechiae, and neck swelling. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy is recommended to look for petechiae and swelling in the airway. Chest radiographs may demonstrate postobstructive edema, and computed tomography of the neck may demonstrate vascular injuries. The most sensitive test for subtle strangulation injuries is magnetic imaging of the neck. Careful examination and documentation can provide critical evidence for the prosecution of these crimes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Otolaryngologists should be knowledgeable of the subtle patterns of injury and potentially life-threatening complications of strangulation and should consider domestic violence in women presenting with throat complaints or bruises on the neck.

### Frequency and relationship of reported symptomology in victims of intimate partner violence: the effect of multiple strangulation attacks [^112wVaei]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to examine the correlation between the number of times a victim of intimate partner violence (IPV) has been strangled and symptom development subsequent to the attacks. One hundred and one female subjects responded to a series of questions regarding the history and characteristics of the strangulation and the development of specific medical symptoms. Multiple strangulation victims, individuals who had experienced more than one strangulation attack, on separate occasions, by the same abuser, reported neck and throat injuries, neurologic disorders, and psychological disorders with increased frequency. Despite the increased frequency of symptoms, only 39% of the multiple strangulation victims sought medical care. These observations strongly support the need for health care professionals to inquire about the incidence of strangulation, examine the victim closely for evidence of injuries caused by the attacks, and recommend immediate care in anticipation of the potentially long term medical needs.

### A review of 300 attempted strangulation cases part II: clinical evaluation of the surviving victim [^1156cAyx]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Medical literature describing victims who survive strangulation is scant. The majority of articles on strangulation are found in the forensic literature, describing the post-mortem findings on autopsy. This article presents a suggested protocol for the evaluation and treatment of the surviving victim of strangulation, based upon a review of the available literature. It also corroborates the findings of Strack et al., in the study by the San Diego City Attorney's Office, described in Part I of this series.

Three hundred strangulation cases, submitted for misdemeanor prosecution to the San Diego City Attorney's Office, were evaluated to determine the signs and symptoms of attempted strangulation that could be used to corroborate the victim's allegation of being "choked" for purposes of prosecution. The study reveals that a lack of training may have caused police and prosecutors to overlook symptoms of strangulation or to rely too heavily on the visible signs of strangulation. Because most victims of strangulation had no visible injuries or their injuries were too minor to photograph, opportunities for higher level criminal prosecution were missed.

### Strangulation injuries in children [^114ujKto]. Resuscitation (2007). Low credibility.

In this article we present a case of fatal strangulation with playground equipment in a 4-year-old child and a review of the literature. Playground injuries are a major cause of injury in children but fatalities are rare. However, strangulation is the cause of death in more than 50% of all playground fatalities. Neurological damage and death are caused by airway obstruction and venous congestion leading to hypoxia, acidosis, brain congestion and brain cell death. Airway injury in survivors is an exception and spinal cord injury has not been found in survivors. The mortality rate in strangulation is high. In cardiac arrest survival is unlikely and full neurological recovery has never been reported. However, all resuscitative efforts should be undertaken in patients with a residual circulation because neurologically intact survival is possible even in deeply comatose patients.

### Penile strangulation: two case reports and review of the literature [^1118yRfx]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Entrapment or strangulation of the penis is a rare emergency situation that can lead to a wide range of vascular and mechanical injuries.

Aim

The aim of this article is to present our experience dealing with penile strangulation. A review of the literature is also summarized in this report. Current treatment options and outcomes are also evaluated.

Methods

We performed a computerized MEDLINE search followed by a manual bibliographic review of cross-references. These reports were analyzed and the important findings summarized.

Results

Penile strangulation has been first time reported in 1755. Since that time, sporadic reports have appeared in the literature describing a variety of foreign bodies on the penis that have in common only the property of circularity. We noted motives, types of objects, types of strangulation, symptomatology, trauma grades, diagnoses, including psychological involvement, as well as possible treatment options. Furthermore, two cases of penile strangulation from our clinical practice are presented involving different degrees of vascular insult leading to different pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and surgical approach.

Conclusion

Penile strangulation is an unusual clinical condition and the consequences can be severe. Penile strangulation could lead to different degrees of vascular obstruction. Consequently, several clinical syndromes can occur: from mild nonsignificant vascular obstruction that resolves after decompression to severe gangrene of the penis accompanied with impaired renal function. The most common motive associated with foreign bodies on the penis is sexual or erotic in nature. The choice of method for removal depends upon type, size, incarceration time, trauma grade, and availability of the equipment. Prompt diagnosis and early treatment are essential to avoid the potential complications of ischemic necrosis and autoamputation.

### Evaluation and management for carotid dissection in patients presenting after choking or strangulation [^115xS2hm]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Carotid dissection (CD) is often overlooked as a concern in strangulation and choking cases. When the diagnosis is considered, the question remains what is the best means of evaluation, and which imaging study should be obtained.

Objective

To evaluate the literature for evaluation of choking- and strangulation-related injuries and their association with CD.

Discussion

This article will review the literature on blunt carotid injuries, with particular attention to subjects with choking and strangulation mechanisms of injury, and will include important physical findings, when and which radiographic evaluations are indicated, and treatment.

Conclusion

Although rare, CD can occur after strangulation and choking. When suspected, evaluation should include imaging studies including computed tomography angiography.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^1136fM2s]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Documentation — correct medical injury terminology provides standardized definitions for common trauma findings to support consistent charting, including: Abrasion — "wearing, grinding, rubbing, or scraping surface layer of cells or tissue from an area of the skin or mucous membrane"; Avulsion — "a tearing away of a body part (skin) accidentally or surgically"; Bruise — "CONTUSE – an injury transmitted through unbroken skin to underlying tissue causing rupture of small blood vessels and escape of blood into the tissues with resulting discoloration: CONTUSION"; Contusion — "injury to tissue usually without laceration: BRUISE"; Choke (choking) — "to keep from breathing in a normal way by compressing or obstructing the windpipe or constricting the windpipe – to have the windpipe blocked entirely or partly"; Cut — "to penetrate with or as if with an edged instrument – an opening made with an edged instrument – a wound made by something sharp"; Hematoma — "a mass of usually clotted blood that forms in a tissue, organ, or body space as a result of broken blood vessel"; Hemorrhage — "a copious discharge of blood from the blood vessels"; Laceration — "the act of making a rough or jagged wound tear - a torn or ragged wound"; Patterned injury — "a representation of the shape of the object that caused the injury"; Petechia(e) — "a minute reddish or purplish spot containing blood that appears in skin or mucous membrane as a result of localized hemorrhage"; and Strangulation — "the action or process of strangling or becoming constricted so as to stop circulation".

### Vascular imaging is the only reliable method to exclude blunt cerebrovascular injury post hanging or strangulation [^115ZTLWx]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Strangulation and hanging injuries are a common form of self-inflicted harm. The incidence of associated blunt cerebrovascular injury and its correlation with clinical findings remains unclear. Furthermore, the decision to image and the choice of imaging remains unresolved.

Methods

A multicenter retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was performed of all patients who presented with a hanging or strangulation injury. All patients underwent a CT angiogram. Inferential and descriptive statistics were performed. Patient demographics, clinical data, laboratory results, and imaging findings were reviewed.

Results

Over an 11-year period (2013–2023), 194 patients presented with hanging or strangulation type injuries. The median age was 28.7 years, and 24% were female. All patients underwent a CT angiogram with only 9 patients (4.6%) having a positive finding. There was no correlation between positive findings on CT angiogram and any clinical or laboratory finding. The in-hospital mortality rate was 1%, none of whom had an associated vascular injury.

Conclusion

The incidence of vascular injury in strangulation or hanging injuries is 4.6%. In light of the reported incidence of stroke in blunt carotid injury (23%-30%) when left untreated, it is imperative that these injuries are found and treated. Based on the above data, there are no clinical or lab indicators (or combination thereof) that can be safely used to exclude an injury and avoid imaging. Thus, is it advised that all patients are imaged with a CT angiogram.

### Prevalence of strangulation in survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence [^116DJCPA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Both sexual assault (SA) survivors and domestic violence (DV) survivors are populations at risk of strangulation injury. Our goal was to identify the prevalence of strangulation in patients who are survivors of SA and DV, identify presence of lethality risk factors in intimate partner violence, and assess differences in strangulation between SA and DV populations.

Methods

We reviewed all patient encounters from our health system's SA/DV forensic nurse examiner program from 2004 to 2008. Medical records were reviewed for documented physical signs of strangulation or documentation of strangulation. Risk factors for lethality included presence of firearm, threats of suicide/homicide by the perpetrator, significant bodily injury, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder or bowel control, voice changes, or difficulty swallowing. Data were analyzed with Pearson χ(2) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

A total of 1542 encounters were reviewed. The mean patient age was 30 (range, 13–98) years and 97% were female. Six hundred forty-nine encounters were for DV assaults and 893 were SA. An intimate partner was the assailant 46% of the time; 84% DV vs 16% SA (P < .001). Patients reported strangulation in 23% (351/1542; 95% CI, 21%-25%) of their assaults. The prevalence of strangulation was 38% with DV and 12% with SA (P < .001). Most of the intimate partner encounters with strangulation had significant risk for lethality (97%, 261/269; 95% CI, 94%-99%).

Conclusions

Patients presenting to our forensic nurse examiner program who were survivors of DV were more likely than SA patients to sustain strangulation. Lethality risk factors were common.

### Intimate partner violence-related brain injury: unmasking and addressing the gaps [^113a2DS3]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2024). Medium credibility.

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant, global public health concern. Women, individuals with historically underrepresented identities, and disabilities are at high risk for IPV and tend to experience severe injuries. There has been growing concern about the risk of exposure to IPV-related head trauma, resulting in IPV-related brain injury (IPV-BI), and its health consequences. Past work suggests that a significant proportion of women exposed to IPV experience IPV-BI, likely representing a distinct phenotype compared with BI of other etiologies. An IPV-BI often co-occurs with psychological trauma and mental health complaints, leading to unique issues related to identifying, prognosticating, and managing IPV-BI outcomes. The goal of this review is to identify important gaps in research and clinical practice in IPV-BI and suggest potential solutions to address them. We summarize IPV research in five key priority areas: (1) unique considerations for IPV-BI study design; (2) understanding non-fatal strangulation as a form of BI; (3) identifying objective biomarkers of IPV-BI; (4) consideration of the chronicity, cumulative and late effects of IPV-BI; and (5) BI as a risk factor for IPV engagement. Our review concludes with a call to action to help investigators develop ecologically valid research studies addressing the identified clinical-research knowledge gaps and strategies to improve care in individuals exposed to IPV-BI. By reducing the current gaps and answering these calls to action, we will approach IPV-BI in a trauma-informed manner, ultimately improving outcomes and quality of life for those impacted by IPV-BI.

### Assault-related anoxia and neck injuries in US emergency departments [^114cqjxH]. Injury Prevention (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Early identification of non-fatal strangulation in the context of intimate partner violence (IPV) is crucial due to its severe physical and psychological consequences for the individual experiencing it. This study investigates the under-reported and underestimated burden of IPV-related non-fatal strangulation by analysing assault-related injuries leading to anoxia and neck injuries.

Methods

An IRB-exempt, retrospective review of prospectively collected data were performed using the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System All Injury Programme data from 2005 to 2019 for all assaults resulting in anoxia and neck injuries. The type and mechanism of assault injuries resulting in anoxia (excluding drowning, poisoning and aspiration), anatomical location of assault-related neck injuries and neck injury diagnosis by morphology, were analysed using statistical methods accounting for the weighted stratified nature of the data.

Results

Out of a total of 24 493 518 assault-related injuries, 11.6% (N = 2 842 862) resulted from IPV (defined as perpetrators being spouses/partners). Among 22 764 cases of assault-related anoxia, IPV accounted for 40.4%. Inhalation and suffocation were the dominant mechanisms (60.8%) of anoxia, with IPV contributing to 41.9% of such cases. Neck injuries represented only 3.0% of all assault-related injuries, with IPV accounting for 21% of all neck injuries and 31.9% of neck contusions.

Conclusions

The study reveals a significant burden of IPV-related anoxia and neck injuries, highlighting the importance of recognising IPV-related strangulation. Comprehensive screening for IPV should be conducted in patients with unexplained neck injuries, and all IPV patients should be screened for strangulation events.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^113LmVs1]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition — information to ask of adult victims of assault outlines general information to collect (time and place of assault; full or partial names, if known, of those involved; witnesses to the assault; manner of assault; any verbal threats of harm; any verbal threats of death) and, for assault with a weapon, details about punching (where, how many times, with an open or closed hand, or both), kicking (where, how many times, bare feet or type of shoe), licking/sucking or biting (where, number of times, and swab for DNA even if bathed), spitting (where, number of times, and swab for DNA even if bathed), and strangulation (where to the neck, number of times, manual and/or ligature) with associated symptoms including loss of consciousness, voice changes, difficulty breathing and/or swallowing, and loss of bowel/bladder control, plus presence or absence of petechial hemorrhage to eyes/face; for assault with a weapon or object used as a weapon, document the specific weapon type and number of times, or the object used and number of times, with location.

### Evaluation of nonfatal strangulation in Alert Adults [^113Npj2J]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

There is a paucity of evidence to guide the diagnostic evaluation of emergency department (ED) patients presenting after nonfatal strangulation (manual strangulation or near hanging). We seek to define the rate of serious injuries in alert strangled patients and determine which symptoms and examination findings, if any, predict such injuries.

Methods

Using prospectively populated databases and electronic medical record review, we performed a retrospective analysis of alert strangled patients treated in the ED of an academic Level I trauma center. Exclusions were Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score less than 13, younger than 16 years, and interhospital transfers. Trained researchers used structured forms to abstract demographics, symptoms, examination findings, radiology and operative findings, and final diagnoses. Injuries requiring greater than 24 hours' observation or specific treatment (surgery, procedure, specific medication) were considered clinically important. The electronic medical record was searched for 30 days after presentation to identify missed injuries.

Results

Advanced imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance maging) was obtained in 60%. Injuries were identified in 6 patients (1.7%, 95% CI, 0.7% to 3.6%). Two injuries were clinically important (0.6%, 95% CI, 0.1% to 2.0%). Both were cervical artery dissections with no neurologic deficits, treated with aspirin. No additional injuries were identified within 30 days or at next medical contact. Of 343 uninjured patients, 291 (85%) had documented medical follow up confirming the absence of any new diagnosis of injury or stroke. The small number of injuries precluded analyses of associations.

Conclusion

Alert, strangled patients had a low rate of injuries. All patients with neck injuries had concerning findings besides neck pain; specifically, GCS score less than 15 or dysphagia. Our findings suggest, but do not prove, that a selective imaging strategy is safe in alert patients after strangulation findings besides neck pain.

### Non-fatal strangulation is an important risk factor for homicide of women [^111atvHS]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine non-fatal strangulation by an intimate partner as a risk factor for major assault, or attempted or completed homicide of women. A case control design was used to describe non-fatal strangulation among complete homicides and attempted homicides (n = 506) and abused controls (n = 427). Interviews of proxy respondents and survivors of attempted homicides were compared with data from abused controls. Data were derived using the Danger Assessment. Non-fatal strangulation was reported in 10% of abused controls, 45% of attempted homicides, and 43% of homicides. Prior non-fatal strangulation was associated with greater than six-fold odds (odds ratio [OR] 6.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.91–11.49) of becoming an attempted homicide, and over seven-fold odds (OR 7.48, 95% CI 4.53–12.35) of becoming a completed homicide. These results show non-fatal strangulation as an important risk factor for homicide of women, underscoring the need to screen for non-fatal strangulation when assessing abused women in emergency department settings.

### Imaging of intimate partner violence, from theSpecial series on emergency radiology [^117UMXDf]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2023). Medium credibility.

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a highly prevalent public health issue with multiple adverse health effects. Radiologists are well suited to assessing a patient's likelihood of IPV. Recognition of common IPV injury mechanisms and resulting target and defensive injury patterns on imaging and understanding of differences between patients who have experienced IPV and those who have not with respect to use of imaging will aid radiologists in accurate IPV diagnosis. Target injuries often involve the face and neck as a result of blunt trauma or strangulation; defensive injuries often involve an extremity. Awareness of differences in injury patterns resulting from IPV-related and accidental trauma can aid radiologists in detecting a mismatch between the provided clinical history and imaging findings to support suspicion of IPV. Radiologists should consider all available current and prior imaging in assessing the likelihood of IPV; this process may be aided by machine learning methods. Even if correctly suspecting IPV on the basis of imaging, radiologists face challenges in acting on that suspicion, including appropriately documenting the findings, without compromising the patient's confidentiality and safety. However, through a multidisciplinary approach with appropriate support mechanisms, radiologists may serve as effective frontline physicians for raising suspicion of IPV.

### Physical injury after sexual assault: findings of a large case series [^113tS4Bv]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to determine characteristics associated with physical injury in female sexual assault victims.

Study Design

All females who were 15 years or older presenting after sexual assault to an urban emergency department during a 34-month period underwent standardized evaluation. Analysis was performed by chi(2) and logistic regression.

Results

Of 819 women, 52% had general body and 20% had genital-anal trauma; 41% were without injury. General body trauma was independently associated with being hit or kicked (odds ratio [OR] = 7.7, 95% CI, 5.1–11.7), attempted strangulation (OR = 4.2, 95% CI, 2.5–7.2), oral or anal penetration (OR = 1.7, 95% CI, 1.2–2.3), and stranger (OR = 2.4, 95% CI, 1.7–3.4) assault. Genital-anal injury was more frequent in victims younger than 20 and older than 49 years (P < .05), in virgins (OR = 2.7, 95% CI, 1.4–5.4) and those examined within 24 hours (OR = 1.7, 95% CI, 1.2–2.4) and after anal assault (OR = 1.7, 95% CI, 1.1–2.6).

Conclusion

General body injury is primarily associated with situational factors, whereas genital-anal injury is less frequent and related to victim age, virginal status, and time to examination.

### Imaging of alert patients after non-self-inflicted strangulation: MRI is superior to CT [^115FrqxP]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the accuracy of CT and MRI reports of alert patients presenting after non-self-inflicted strangulation (NSIS) and evaluate the appropriateness of these imaging modalities in NSIS.

Material and Methods

The study was a retrospective analysis of patient characteristics and strangulation details, with a comparison of original radiology reports (ORR) to expert read-outs (EXR) of CT and MRI studies of all NSIS cases seen from 2008 to 2020 at a single centre.

Results

The study included 116 patients (71% women, p < .001, χ 2), with an average age of 33.8 years, mostly presenting after manual strangulation (97%). Most had experienced intimate partner violence (74% of women, p < .001, χ 2) or assault by unknown offender (88% of men, p < 0.002 χ 2). Overall, 132 imaging studies (67 CT, 51% and 65 MRI, 49%) were reviewed. Potentially dangerous injuries were present in 7%, minor injuries in 22%, and no injuries in 71% of patients. Sensitivity and specificity of ORR were 78% and 97% for MRI and 30% and 98% for CT. Discrepancies between ORR and EXR occurred in 18% of all patients, or 62% of injured patients, with a substantial number of unreported injuries on CT.

Conclusions

The results indicate that MRI is more appropriate than CT for alert patients presenting after non-self-inflicted strangulation and underline the need for radiologists with specialist knowledge to report these cases in order to add value to both patient care and potential future medico-legal investigations.

Clinical Relevance Statement

MRI should be preferred over CT for the investigation of strangulation related injuries in alert patients because MRI has a higher accuracy than CT and does not expose this usually young patient population to ionizing radiation.

Key Points

- Patients presenting after strangulation are often young women with a history of intimate partner violence while men typically present after assault by an unknown offender.
- Expert read-outs of CT and MRI revealed potentially dangerous injuries in one of 14 patients.
- MRI has a significantly higher sensitivity than CT and appears to be more appropriate for the diagnostic workup of alert patients after strangulation.

### Manual strangulation as a form of child abuse in an adolescent causing vertebral artery dissection: a case report [^111Yjpmo]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Manual strangulation as a form of child abuse is rarely reported, yet it carries significant risks for both medical and mental health outcomes. Here, we present the case of a 16-year-old female who presented to the ED following non-fatal strangulation by her mother and brother. While physical exam demonstrated minor abrasions and bruising, CT angiogram head and neck revealed a vertebral artery dissection. Following this incident, the patient re-presented several times for suicide attempts. This case highlights the importance of considering imaging as part of the ED workup of non-fatal strangulation and ensuring access to mental health resources for victims.

### Utilization of CTA in strangulation evaluation [^115s37Tc]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is a commonly utilized study in the setting of strangulation-related injuries due to the concern for blunt cerebrovascular injuries (BCVIs). However, patients can present with a variety of histories and symptoms, which can make screening for at-risk populations in this group difficult. Therefore, this study aimed to identify risk factors and rates of BCVIs in the setting of strangulation-related injuries to guide imaging strategies.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of 138 patients who presented with strangulation and received a CTA in a Level II trauma center between 2019 and 2023. Patients with CTAs were identified using a structured search of radiology reports. Clinical, demographic, and imaging findings were analyzed to assess for potential risks for BCVIs.

Results

Among 138 patients, only 1 of 138 was found positive for a BCVI, who was discharged with no complications from the injury. 2 of 138 was positive for an acute cervical fracture. A variety of various symptoms/findings included neck pain, loss of consciousness, bruising, tenderness, and a sore throat.

Conclusions

In patients presenting with strangulation, the rates of BCVI and even acute cervical fractures were low. These findings suggest that broad use of CTAs in this setting may be of low diagnostic value. Further studies are needed to find more relevant symptoms and signs that could best suggest the need for CTAs in this patient population to best optimize diagnosis and patient safety.

### Sexual infidelity as trigger for intimate partner violence [^115oBynK]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Background

We conducted a qualitative study to examine acute, situational factors and chronic stressors that triggered severe intimate partner violence (IPV) in women.

Methods

Our sample consisted of 17 heterosexual couples, where the male was in detention for IPV and made telephone calls to his female victim. We used up to 4 hours of telephone conversational data for each couple to examine the couple's understanding of (1) acute triggers for the violent event and (2) chronic stressors that created the underlying context for violence. Grounded theory guided our robust, iterative data analysis involving audiotape review, narrative summation, and thematic organization.

Results

Consistently across couples, violence was acutely triggered by accusations of infidelity, typically within the context of alcohol or drug use. Victims sustained significant injury, including severe head trauma (some resulting in hospitalization/surgery), bite wounds, strangulation complications, and lost pregnancy. Chronic relationship stressors evident across couples included ongoing anxiety about infidelity, preoccupation with heterosexual gender roles and religious expectations, drug and alcohol use, and mental health concerns (depression, anxiety, and suicide ideation/attempts).

Conclusions

Disseminated models feature jealousy as a strategy used by perpetrators to control IPV victims and as a red flag for homicidal behavior. Our findings significantly extend this notion by indicating that infidelity concerns, a specific form of jealousy, were the immediate trigger for both the acute violent episode and resulting injuries to victims and were persistently raised by both perpetrators and victims as an ongoing relationship stressor.

### Strangulation of penis by a ball bearing device [^1153TPEP]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Penile strangulation is rare and usually results following placement of constricting objects to enhance sexual stimulation. It requires urgent treatment as delay may lead to irreversible penile ischemia and gangrene. Various objects causing penile strangulation have been reported. Nonmetallic and thin metallic objects can be removed easily as compared to heavy metallic objects. Cutting is the commonest method described, although procuring special cutting tools may be difficult and the process of cutting may be tedious with the possibility of iatrogenic penile injury.

Aim

To present a simple, safe, minimally invasive, effective, and feasible technique for removing heavy metallic objects constricting the penis.

Methods

The published English literature (PubMed™) was searched for cases of "penile strangulation" using the keywords penile strangulation, penile injury, penile trauma, penile constriction, penile entrapment, and penile incarceration. The described treatment modalities were carefully reviewed and studied.

Main Outcome Measures

Reviewed published English literature on the various causes of penile incarceration and the various techniques used for their extrication.

Results

Search results yielded several cases of penile strangulation caused by a variety of metallic and nonmetallic objects. Various modalities have been described in the English literature for their safe removal, each with its own merits and demerits.

Conclusions

Penile strangulation should be viewed and managed as an emergency in order to prevent penile necrosis and urethral injury and to preserve erectile function. The modified method described herein for managing penile strangulation due to heavy metallic rings is minimally invasive, safe, effective, does not require any special cutting instrument(s) or skill, and is free of causing iatrogenic collateral thermal or mechanical damage to the penile organ. A stepwise algorithm depicting a rational and comprehensive approach to the diagnosis and management of penile incarceration is also suggested for the clinicians.

### Anoxic brain injury: a subtle and often overlooked finding in non-fatal intimate partner strangulation [^113TeUBa]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A paucity of literature exists dedicated to the identification of anoxic brain injury in patients that survive non-fatal intimate partner strangulation (NF-IPS). While some individuals report experiencing symptoms of brain hypoxia followed by a loss of consciousness, other individuals report symptoms of brain hypoxia prior to amnesia, rendering some unable to recall loss of consciousness (LOC).

Objective

Using a standardized clinical assessment tool, the purpose of this retrospective analysis is to describe anoxic brain injury symptom prevalence in a sample of patients reporting NF-IPS.

Methods

One hundred and ninety-one unique patients, reporting a total of 267 strangulation events, were assessed by a member of the Shasta Community Forensic Care Team utilizing the Strangulation Hypoxia Anoxia Symptom TBI Assessment (SHASTA) tool. The sample is 98% female and includes adult patients ages 18–68. Examination records were categorized based on the presence or absence of hypoxia and anoxia symptoms. This manuscript utilizes the STROBE checklist.

Results

Amnesia was reported in 145 of the 267 strangulations (54.3%). Of those, 74 reported LOC (51.0%) while 71 did not recall LOC (49.0%).

Conclusions

Within our sample, 49% of patients with amnesia did not recall losing consciousness, demonstrating that LOC is an imperfect measure of anoxia for patients following NF-IPS. Healthcare providers examining NF-IPS patients should inquire about additional symptoms of hypoxia and amnesia, which can be captured on the SHASTA tool.

### Pediatric hanging and strangulation: is vascular injury a true risk? [^111RdnHZ]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute screening of pediatric strangulation and hanging injuries has evolved at many institutions to include cervical arterial vascular imaging. As current standards in pediatric imaging support less radiation exposure and increased imaging appropriateness, it is questionable whether vascular arterial injury is a true risk in this population.

Objective

To determine the role of cervical vascular arterial imaging in the evaluation of pediatric hanging and strangulation injuries.

Materials and Methods

This is a retrospective study of patients who present at a Level 1 pediatric trauma center with a history of hanging and strangulation injuries. All relevant studies, including computed tomography (CT) angiography of the neck, contrast-enhanced neck CT, cervical magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or CT of the brain and cervical spine and associated clinical records, were reviewed.

Results

Sixty-six patients were identified, 60 with vascular arterial imaging studies. No vascular injury was identified. Soft-tissue injury was noted in 20/66 (30%) patients and craniocervical injury was suspected in 2/66 (3%), but no cervical spine fracture was identified. Only 49 patients had brain imaging, with 7/49 (14%) demonstrating changes consistent with cerebral edema, which correlated negatively with survival (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Vascular arterial imaging, particularly with CT angiography, performed in the pediatric population after hanging and strangulation injury resulted in no positive studies for cervical arterial injury. This study supports the need to reevaluate routine screening CT angiography in this study population.

### An unusual foreign object attached to a child's finger: emergency department management and subsequent intervention [^114YDbBx]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Strangulation injuries due to foreign objects are uncommon presentations of hand and finger injuries presenting to the emergency department (ED). Ring avulsion and hair tourniquet injuries are more commonly recognized mechanisms of strangulation, and algorithms for subsequent management and emergent treatment exist for these injuries. It is important to distinguish between hand injuries that can be managed in the setting of the ED and those that need emergent surgical management upon patient presentation. Nonemergent presentations of finger injuries include metallic bands or other objects trapped on digits without signs of neurovascular compromise. A 2-year-old girl presented to our ED with her right index finger trapped within a stainless steel salt shaker (2.55 in. H × 3.5 in. W × 4.9 in. D). The distal aspect of the digit was unable to be visualized, and communication with the patient was difficult secondary to distress and young age. Multiple attempts were made to remove the object in the ED by multiple health care providers, when concern for degloving injury prompted the patient to be taken to the operating room for removal with an electric saw by the hand surgeon and orthopedic team.

### Dissemination strategies of a nonfatal strangulation program: success of an interagency initiative [^114ABRPw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonfatal strangulation has been identified as a common occurrence in intimate partner violence and can be associated with significant injuries and, at times, increased mortality.

Objective

This article describes a county interagency nonfatal strangulation initiative that efficiently disseminated an educational program for police, emergency medical services, emergency department staff, forensic nursing teams, and prosecuting attorneys, along with a forensic nurse response program. Prior to initiation of this program, no educational programs existed and no forensic examinations were being offered to victims of nonfatal strangulation.

Methods

Early cooperation between agencies was crucial, particularly between the two major health care systems in the county. A standardized forensic evaluation tool was developed, along with nonfatal strangulation courses. Education of forensic nurses together with prosecutors was unique and training of police, emergency medical services, and emergency department staff was coordinated. Forensic nurses traveled to meet victims for standardized examinations at 11 emergency departments. Creation of a secure Research Electronic Data Capture database captured forensic examination information and a strangulation task force provided means to assess the goals.

Results

This initiative educated > 80% of the county's first responders and 79% of emergency department staff within 3 months. During the first year of the program, 259 forensic nurse examinations for nonfatal strangulation were recorded. Police reported a total of 367 arrests for felony assault by strangulation.

Conclusions

Professionals providing legal and medical care to victims of nonfatal strangulation can be educated and forensic nurse examinations can be implemented successfully in an expeditious period of time with a county collaborative program approach.

### Screening for brain injury sustained in the context of intimate partner violence (IPV): measure development and preliminary utility of the brain injury screening questionnaire IPV module [^117EkbCp]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract Intimate partner violence (IPV) is associated with risk for multi-etiology brain injury (BI), including repetitive head impacts, isolated traumatic brain injuries (TBI), and anoxic/hypoxic injury secondary to nonfatal strangulation (NFS). IPV-related injuries are often unreported, but evidence suggests that survivors are more likely to report when asked directly. There are currently no validated tools for screening of brain injury related to IPV that meet World Health Organization guidelines for this population. Here, we describe measure development methods and preliminary utility of the Brain Injury Screening Questionnaire IPV (BISQ-IPV) module. We culled items from existing IPV and TBI screening tools and sought two rounds of stakeholder feedback regarding content coverage, terminology, and safety of administration. The resulting stakeholder-informed BISQ-IPV module is a seven-item self-report measure that uses contextual cues (e.g., being shoved, shaken, strangled) to query lifetime history of IPV-related head/neck injury. We introduced the BISQ-IPV module into the Late Effects of TBI (LETBI) study to investigate rates of violent and IPV-specific head/neck injury reporting in a TBI sample. Among those who completed the BISQ-IPV module (n = 142), 8% of the sample (and 20% of women) reported IPV-related TBI, and 15% of the sample (34% of women) reported IPV-related head or neck injury events that did not result in loss or alteration of consciousness. No men reported NFS; one woman reported inferred BI secondary to NFS, and 6% of women reported NFS events. Those who endorsed IPV-BI were all women, many were highly educated, and many reported low incomes. We then compared reporting of violent TBIs and head/neck injury events among individuals who completed the core BISQ wherein IPV is not specifically queried (administered from 2015–2018; n = 156) to that of individuals who completed the core BISQ preceded by the BISQ-IPV module (BISQ+IPV, administered from 2019–2021; n = 142). We found that 9% of those who completed the core BISQ reported violent TBI (e.g., abuse, assault), whereas 19% of those who completed the BISQ+IPV immediately preceding the core BISQ reported non-IPV-related violent TBI on the core BISQ. These findings suggest that standard TBI screening tools are inadequate for identifying IPV-BI and structured cueing of IPV-related contexts yields greater reporting of both IPV- and non-IPV-related violent BI. When not queried directly, IPV-BI remains a hidden variable in TBI research studies.

### Life-threatening versus non-life-threatening manual strangulation: are there appropriate criteria for MR imaging of the neck? [^112JzyPY]. European Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to determine objective radiological signs of danger to life in survivors of manual strangulation and to establish a radiological scoring system for the differentiation between life-threatening and non-life-threatening strangulation by dividing the cross section of the neck into three zones (superficial, middle and deep zone). Forensic pathologists classified 56 survivors of strangulation into life-threatening and non-life-threatening cases by history and clinical examination alone, and two blinded radiologists evaluated the MRIs of the neck. In 15 cases, strangulation was life-threatening (27%), compared with 41 cases in which strangulation was non-life-threatening (73%). The best radiological signs on MRI to differentiate between the two groups were intramuscular haemorrhage/oedema, swelling of platysma and intracutaneous bleeding (all p = 0.02) followed by subcutaneous bleeding (p = 0.034) and haemorrhagic lymph nodes (p = 0.04), all indicating life-threatening strangulation. The radiological scoring system showed a sensitivity and specificity of approximately 70% for life-threatening strangulation, when at least two neck zones were affected. MRI is not only helpful in assessing the severity of strangulation, but is also an excellent documentation tool that is even admissible in court.

### An unusual cause of accidental hanging in a toddler [^116tQfJ7]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Accidental hanging in children, although uncommon, has been reported worldwide. We report a case of a toddler who was brought to our hospital with an alleged history of hanging with his head trapped in-between the railings of a balcony. He became unconscious and developed seizures secondary to asphyxial injury and survived. Hanging is an important cause of homicidal and suicidal injury in adults, but in children, it is usually accidental, leading to death because of asphyxia as a result of partial or complete hanging. There is paucity of data in Indian literature regarding accidental hanging injuries in children. According to available data from western countries, strangulation ranks fourth among the causes of unintentional injury in children younger than 1 year after roadside accidents, drowning, and burns. The unique mode of hanging in this child has prompted us to report this case.

### A retrospective analysis of the clinical use and utility of advanced imaging in the evaluation of near-hanging and strangulation injuries at a Canadian level one trauma centre [^117RJ4Fn]. Injury (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Computed tomography (CT) of the neck is highly sensitive and may effectively rule-out cervical spine, cerebrovascular, and aerodigestive injuries after blunt and penetrating trauma. However, CT may be overutilized in the evaluation of hanging or strangulation injuries. The objective of this study was to determine the diagnostic yield of CT imaging among patients evaluated for hanging or strangulation mechanisms at a Canadian level-1 trauma center.

Methods

All adult patients evaluated for hanging or strangulation injuries over an eight-year period were reviewed. The primary outcome was the diagnostic yield of CT imaging for major aerodigestive, cervical spine, cerebrovascular, or neurological injuries. Multiple logistic regression were performed to determine predictive factors for the use of CT imaging and the identification of injury on imaging.

Results

Among 124 patients evaluated for hanging or strangulation injuries during the study period, 101 (80%) were evaluated with CT of the head or neck. A total of 26 injuries were identified in 21 patients (18 anoxic brain injuries, 4 aerodigestive, 3 cerebrovascular, and 1 of cervical spine injury). The overall diagnostic yield of neck CT for cervical injuries was 7.8%, 4.7% for laryngeal-tracheal injuries, 3.5% for carotid and vertebral artery injuries, and 1.1% for cervical spine injury. The diagnostic yield of CT head for anoxic brain injury was 22.8%. Factors predicting the use of CT imaging were abnormal physical exam findings (RR 1.7 95% CI [1.2, 2.3]) and transfer accepted by the trauma team leader (RR 1.3 95% CI [1.1, 1.5]).

Conclusion

CT imaging is often used in the evaluation of patients presenting with hanging or strangulation mechanisms. Seven cerebrovascular, aerodigestive, or cervical spine injuries were identified on imaging during the study period, representing a diagnostic yield of 7%. No injuries were identified among patient with a normal GCS or physical exam. Factors predicting the use of CT imaging included transfer accepted by the trauma team leader and abnormal physical exam findings. The variable clinical presentation of near-hanging and strangulation injuries and the relatively low diagnostic yield of CT imaging should prompt the development of tools and institutional protocols to guide the evaluation of hanging and strangulation injuries.

### Clinician perspectives on characteristics and care of traumatic brain injury among asylum seekers and refugees [^112gX4hu]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) disproportionately affects asylum-seekers and refugees (ASR), although underdiagnosed and undertreated. Our study assesses clinicians' perspectives on characteristics and management of TBI among ASR, with the hope of improving TBI management in this population.

Materials and Methods

We conducted six focus groups of 16 clinicians across two academic medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. Clinicians in our sample included primary care clinicians, nurse practitioners, social workers, psychologists, neurologists, psychiatrists, and neuropsychologists. We analyzed the qualitative data following a hybrid inductive-deductive thematic analytic approach.

Results

Clinicians characterized TBI among ASR as mostly mild and remote, involving head strikes, perpetrated predominantly by interpersonal violence and strangulation-related brain injury, and involving symptom overlap with mental health diagnoses, challenging diagnosis. Clinicians also described inadequate screening, the importance of connecting the physical and psychological symptoms of the brain injury rather than viewing them as distinct, and addressing diagnosis-related stigma and shame. Finally, they discussed lack of TBI-specific knowledge among providers and patients alike, and resource limitations affecting the continuum of care for this population.

Conclusion

Integrating clinicians' perspectives in caring for this population allows us to best meet their needs, including in TBI recovery.

### CT angiograms of the neck in strangulation victims: incidence of positive findings at a level one trauma center over a 7-year period [^111v53QH]. Emergency Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine the incidence of acute findings diagnosed with computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the neck among emergency department patients presenting with strangulation injury.

Method and Materials

This institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective review was performed at our academic urban level 1 trauma center. The PACS database was queried for all consecutive patients who had CTAs of the neck performed for the exam indication of strangulation between January 1, 2009, and April 30, 2016, resulting in 142 included patients. Analysis of the individual cases was then performed, recording any positive results, with clinical findings classified using, when possible, standardized terminology found in the literature. Frequency of acute injury in the CTA neck examinations was determined with the calculation of 95% confidence interval (CI) and positive clinical findings were evaluated by calculation of prevalence. Additionally, two board certified radiologists with training in neuroradiology assessed the cases for vascular injury.

Results

There were 142 patients who met inclusion criteria (average age, 32.6 years) and 116 (81.7%) patients were female. CTA of the neck revealed 21 patients to have acute injuries (15.5%, 95% CI 9.5, 21.4) including 6 initially reported vascular injuries (4.2%, 95% CI 0.9, 7.5). Although neck pain (73, 51.4%), loss of consciousness (67, 47.2%), and headache (31, 21.8%) were frequently reported in the ROS, their predictive value of vascular injury was weak (4.1%, 4.5%, and 3.2%, respectively). On physical exam, redness/bruising of the neck (73, 51.4%) and neck tenderness (47, 33.1%) were both the most common and had the highest prevalence (19.2% and 12.8%, respectively), however, when selecting for vascular injuries alone were found to have low predictive yield (vascular injury 4.1% and 2.1%, respectively). The above statistics were based on the initial radiologist report and Emergency Department findings. After retrospective review, 3 Grade 1 BIFFL vascular injuries were identified (2.1%), with one false negative case (0.7%).

Conclusion

Performing CTA of the neck after acute strangulation injury rarely identifies clinically significant findings, with vascular injuries proving exceedingly rare. As positive vascular injury could not be clinically predicted by history and physical examination, prospective validation of a clinical prediction rule in this population is warranted.

### Survey results of women who have been strangled while in an abusive relationship [^113kgiBX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Few studies attempt to examine individual methods of domestic abuse. The objectives of this study are to evaluate strangulation as a method of domestic violence abuse: to determine the incidence of strangulation occurrence within the cycle of domestic violence, the subjective medical symptoms experienced by victims of intimate partner strangulation, and the elective utilization of health care following a strangulation incident. Sixty-two women were surveyed at two women's shelters in Dallas, Texas and Los Angeles, California and the Parkland Health & Hospital (PHHS) Violence Intervention Prevention (VIP) Center in Dallas, Texas. Each patient was individually interviewed and verbal responses were recorded. Statistics were performed using the SPSS program. Of the 62 surveyed, 42 (68%) had been strangled by their intimate partner who was a husband (23, 55%), boyfriend (13, 31%), or fiancé (2, 5%), by a mother, stranger, or friend (1 each). Strangulation, as a method of domestic violence, is quite common in women seeking medical help or shelter in a large urban city. This study suggests that strangulation occurs late in the abusive relationship; thus, women presenting with complaints consistent with strangulation probably represent women at higher risk for major morbidity or mortality.

### Intimate partner sexual violence: an often overlooked problem [^111b3Fdv]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Intimate partner sexual violence (IPSV) is a common but often overlooked form of intimate partner violence (IPV) that may have unique consequences for those who experience it. We aimed to explore how outcomes associated with IPSV differ from outcomes associated with other forms of intimate partner and sexual violence.

Methods

We conducted a narrative review of the English-language literature, including original research studies and reports that focused on outcomes associated with IPSV. We aimed to quantify the risk for health outcomes associated with exposure to IPSV in comparison with exposure to other forms of interpersonal violence or nonexposure to interpersonal violence.

Results

Twenty-eight publications were reviewed, most were small observational studies focused on women exposed to IPSV. Reported outcomes were related to mental health (n = 20 studies), physical and sexual health (n = 19 studies), and health of children with a parent exposed to IPSV (n = 1 study). Compared with other forms of interpersonal violence, exposure to IPSV was associated with greater risk for posttraumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms, problematic substance use, suicidality, pain and other somatic symptoms, adverse sexual health problems, specific physical injuries including strangulation, and death by homicide. Children with an exposed parent were at higher risk for internalizing symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and somatization.

Conclusions

Sexual violence in intimate partner relationships is common and has distinct consequences compared with other forms of interpersonal violence including elevated risks for suicidality and death by homicide. It should be given special consideration within the assessment and management of interpersonal violence.

### Hyoid bone fracture secondary to a blunt neck trauma: a report of 2 cases [^111EyTCa]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyoid bone fracture unrelated to strangulation is a rare occurrence characterized by a subtle presentation. However, it may manifest as a fatal respiratory distress due to airway obstruction. We present 2 cases of hyoid bone fractures that occurred following a traffic accident in 2 male patients. Both patients presented with either a neck pain or a dysphagia. Physical examination findings were limited to neck sensibility at palpation, saliva stasis, and laryngeal congestion at the laryngeal endoscopy. In both patients, the diagnosis was confirmed through computed tomography. In the first patient, the fracture was simple and located at the body of the hyoid bone, while in the second patient, it involved the greater horn with a medial displacement of the fractured fragment. Due to the clinical presentation, we successfully treated both our patients conservatively through a 48 hour observation, analgesics, steroids, antibiotics, neck rest, and semiliquid diet. This study highlights a rare occurrence of 2 cases of hyoid bone fracture unrelated to strangulation, which emphasizes on the importance of a high clinical suspicion to make the diagnosis of this entity.

### Which injuries may indicate child abuse? [^116H4YbJ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2010). Low credibility.

Making the decision as to whether an injury is a result of child abuse or not is stressful for both the family involved and the clinical team. It is not a decision that is taken lightly, and with an increasing expectation by the investigating agencies, lawyers and the public in general, to ensure that it is based on explicit 'evidence', clinicians need to be up to date with the latest scientific publications in the field. This article aims to summarise the current evidence in relation to all physical injuries except those pertaining to the central nervous system, which will form a separate article. It will examine the pattern of accidental and abusive bruises, fractures, burns, abdominal injuries and oral injuries focusing on discriminating features and necessary investigations.

Table 5: Summary of the Signs of Child Abuse and Neglect — signs are organized as ocular signs, general physical signs of abuse or neglect, emotional and behavioral signs of abuse or neglect, and case history inconsistencies. Ocular signs include cortical blindness, ruptured globe, retinal, preretinal, vitreous hemorrhages particularly if child is less than 2 years old, detached retina, retinal dialysis, chorioretinal atrophy, and additional findings such as conjunctival, subconjunctival hemorrhages, orbital, periorbital edema, lid lacerations, and disconjugate eye movements. General physical signs include bruises around cheeks, jaw, eyes, ears, or mastoid area; soft tissue bruises on upper arms, thighs, buttocks or genitals; burns on any posterior part of the body, particularly buttocks, perineum, hands, or feet; multiple lesions or fractures in different stages of healing; poor hygiene; child not properly immunized; and venereal disease in a preadolescent child. Emotional and behavioral indicators listed include frozen watchfulness, fear of strangers, indiscriminate attachment to strangers, failure to thrive, growth failure, suicidal ideation or attempts, drug or alcohol abuse, aggressive behavior, and sexual acting out. Case history inconsistencies include no history offered, history vague or inconsistent with injuries, history changes during course of examination, multiple office visits for accidental injuries, increase in severity of injuries, and delay in seeking medical attention.

### Internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm masquerading as a peritonsillar abscess [^112z1VHA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Blunt carotid arterial injuries are uncommon. Motor vehicle crashes are the most frequent cause, but this type of vascular injury can be secondary to any direct blow to the neck, intraoral trauma, or strangulation. Types of vascular injuries include dissection, pseudoaneurysm, thrombosis, rupture, and arteriovenous fistula formation. Patients with pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery will usually present with neurologic complaints, ranging from the minor to complete stroke. On physical examination, neck hematoma, bruits, pulsatile neck mass, or a palpable thrill may be found. However, in 50% of cases, no external signs of neck trauma are observed. Onset of symptoms may occur within a few hours to several months after the initial injury. Angiography is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, but carotid Doppler ultrasound recently has been shown to be very sensitive in detecting these types of injuries. Treatment of pseudoaneurysm is often surgical, with endovascular stenting.

### Management of genitourinary injuries [^116SSvVM]. ACS (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric genital trauma — management of penile tourniquet, zipper, and toilet seat injuries includes targeted evaluation and specific maneuvers: Children presenting with penile swelling and erythema, with or without urinary complaints, need to be evaluated for tourniquet/strangulation injury with a thread, hair, or rubber band, and expedited removal of the item is performed to prevent penile ischemia and necrosis. For penile zipper injuries, administer local versus general anesthesia depending on the severity of penile involvement and patient toleration; following penile anesthetic block, maneuvers to release the zipper include lubrication of the zipper with mineral oil, incising the cloth between zipper teeth, a metal cutting tool to release the median bar, or a screwdriver to release the metal zipper shield. Penile toilet seat crush injuries are typically minor and can be managed with supportive care; more severe injuries, with findings concerning for testicular rupture or urethral injury, are often associated with significant edema, ecchymosis, or gross hematuria and may require evaluation with imaging, with management the same as described for adult genital injuries.

Abusive head trauma remains the major cause of serious head injury in infants and young children. A great deal of research has been undertaken to inform the recognition, evaluation, differential diagnosis, management, and legal interventions when children present with findings suggestive of inflicted injury. This paper reviews the evolution of current practices and controversies, both with respect to medical management and to etiological determination of the variable constellations of signs, symptoms, and radiological findings that characterize young injured children presenting for neurosurgical care.

### The neuropathology of intimate partner violence [^111c5Mqh]. Acta Neuropathologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Lifelong brain health consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) include the risk of neurodegenerative disease. Up to one-third of women experience intimate partner violence (IPV) in their lifetime, often with TBI, yet remarkably little is known about the range of autopsy neuropathologies encountered in IPV. We report a prospectively accrued case series from a single institution, the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, evaluated in partnership with the Brain Injury Research Center of Mount Sinai, using a multimodal protocol comprising clinical history review, ex vivo imaging in a small subset, and comprehensive neuropathological assessment by established consensus protocols. Fourteen brains were obtained over 2 years from women with documented IPV (aged 3rd-8th decade; median, 4th) and complex histories including prior TBI in 6, nonfatal strangulation in 4, cerebrovascular, neurological, and/or psychiatric conditions in 13, and epilepsy in 7. At autopsy, all had TBI stigmata (old and/or recent). In addition, white matter regions vulnerable to diffuse axonal injury showed perivascular and parenchymal iron deposition and microgliosis in some subjects. Six cases had evidence of cerebrovascular disease (lacunes and/or chronic infarcts). Regarding neurodegenerative disease pathologies, Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change was present in a single case (8th decade), with no chronic traumatic encephalopathy neuropathologic change (CTE-NC) identified in any. Findings from this initial series then prompted similar exploration in an expanded case series of 70 archival IPV cases (aged 2nd-9th decade; median, 4th) accrued from multiple international institutions. In this secondary case series, we again found evidence of vascular and white matter pathologies. However, only limited neurodegenerative proteinopathies were encountered in the oldest subjects, none meeting consensus criteria for CTE-NC. These observations from this descriptive exploratory study reinforce a need to consider broad co-morbid and neuropathological substrates contributing to brain health outcomes in the context of IPV, some of which may be potentially modifiable.

### Newborns killed or left to die by a parent: a population-based study [^114yUh1k]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Interest in the discarding or killing of newborns by parents has increased due to wide news coverage and efforts by states to provide Safe Haven legislation to combat the problem.

Objective

To describe the characteristics of these cases in North Carolina.

Design, Setting, and Population

Case series derived from data on all deaths among liveborn infants 0 to 4 days of age reported to the North Carolina medical examiner from 1985 through 2000.

Main Outcome Measures

Incidence of newborns known to have been killed or discarded by a parent; epidemiological characteristics of newborns and parents.

Results

There were 34 newborns known to have been killed or discarded by a parent, comprising 0.002% of all liveborn infants during the 16-year study period, giving a rate of 2.1 per 100 000 per year. A total of 58.8% were male, 41.1% were white, and 52.9% were black. For 29 cases, the perpetrator was determined to be the mother. Among mothers, 50% were single and 20.6% were married (marital status of the remainder was unknown). Thirty-five percent had had other children. Eight mothers (23.5%) were known to have received some prenatal care. The mean age of the mothers was 19.1 years (range, 14–35 years) and more than half were aged 18 years or older. The most common causes of death were asphyxiation/strangulation (41.1%) and drowning (26.5%).

Conclusions

In North Carolina, at least 2.1 per 100 000 newborns are known to be killed or left to die per year, usually by their mothers. It is unknown how many of these deaths might be prevented by Safe Haven laws. Efforts to educate the public about these laws need to target the general public. Where resources are limited, the focus should be on on adolescent pregnancy prevention programs, young adults, prenatal care clinics, and married women.

### Does attribution of blame influence psychological outcomes in facial trauma victims? [^114v9dDV]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The relative importance of different variables and specific post-traumatic psychological reactions after facial injuries is poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between the subjective attribution of blame and anxiety and depression in facial trauma victims.

Materials and Methods

We undertook a comparative cross-sectional study of psychological outcomes in a cohort of adult patients who have sustained a facial injury. The primary predictor variable was the attribution of blame (self-blame vs blame-others). The main outcome variable was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores. We also considered several demographic and other clinical variables to assess their relationship with the nature of blame attribution. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistics were used to assess the relationship between the primary predictor and outcome variables, adjusted for age, gender, and confounding factors.

Results

The sample consisted of 102 facial trauma victims (77 men and 25 women). Of the 77 patients, 63 attributed blame for their injuries to someone else and 39 patients attributed blame to themselves. Psychometric scores suggestive of anxiety and the depressive state were significantly greater in the "blame-others" group than in the "self-blame" group (HADS-Anxiety 22% vs 13%, HADS-Depression 17% vs 8%). The prevalence of psychomorbidity in the blame-others group was approximately twice that found in the self-blame group (odds ratio 2.2). Facial trauma patients who blamed others for their injury were predominantly younger men (P = .01) and typically victims of intentional trauma (P < .001).

Conclusions

The results of the present study suggest that external attribution of blame for facial injury is associated with poor postinjury psychiatric outcomes.

### Imaging of nonaccidental injury and the mimics: issues and controversies in the era of evidence-based medicine [^117EpXG3]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Because of the controversy involving the determination of child abuse, or nonaccidental injury (NAI), radiologists must be familiar with the issues, literature, and principles of evidence-based medicine to understand the role of imaging. Children with suspected NAI must receive protective evaluation along with a timely and complete clinical and imaging work-up. Imaging findings cannot stand alone and must be correlated with clinical findings, laboratory testing, and pathologic and forensic examinations. Only the child protection investigation may provide the basis for inflicted injury in the context of supportive clinical, imaging, biomechanical, or pathology findings.

### Violence-related versus terror-related stabbings: significant differences in injury characteristics [^114Zh3nG]. Annals of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To demonstrate the gap between injury epidemiology of terror-related stabbings (TRS) and non-terror-related intentional stabbings.

Background

Terror attacks with sharp instruments have multiplied recently, with many victims of these incidents presented to hospitals with penetrating injuries. Because most practical experience of surgeons with intentional stabbing injuries comes from treating victims of interpersonal violence, potential gaps in knowledge may exist if injuries from TRS significantly differ from interpersonal stabbings (IPS).

Methods

A retrospective study of 1615 patients from intentional stabbing events recorded in the Israeli National Trauma Registry during the period of "Knife Intifada" (January 2013-March 2016). All stabbings were divided into TRS and IPS. The 2 categories were compared in terms of sustained injuries, utilization of hospital resources, and clinical outcomes.

Results

TRS patients were older, comprised more females and were ethnically homogenous. Most IPS incidents happened on weekdays and at night hours, whereas TRS events peaked midweek during morning and afternoon hours. TRS patients had more injuries of head, face, and neck, and severe head and neck injuries. IPS patients had more abdomen injuries; however, respective injuries in the TRS group were more severe. Greater injury severity of the TRS patients reflected on their higher hospital resources utilization and greater in-hospital mortality.

Conclusions

Victims of terror stabbings are profoundly different in their characteristics, sustain injuries of a different profile and greater severity, require more hospital resources, and have worse off clinical outcomes, emphasizing the need of the healthcare systems to adjust itself appropriately to deal successfully with future terror attacks.

### Radiologic findings in cases of attempted suicide and other self-injurious behavior [^1151mnnt]. Radiographics (2012). Low credibility.

Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in multiple age groups. Therefore, it is important that radiologists be aware of this commonly encountered entity. Attempted suicide may take a variety of forms; those discussed by the authors include sharp force injury, immolation and inhalation, ingestion, hanging, firearm use, jumping from a height, and drowning. Certain radiologic findings are commonly seen in cases of attempted suicide and other self-injurious behaviors. In some cases, especially when the patient is unconscious or is unwilling to provide a history, it may not be apparent that suicide has been attempted until characteristic imaging findings are recognized. Correct identification of suicide attempts on the basis of such findings will ensure that these patients receive appropriate psychiatric treatment. When a suicide attempt is unsuccessful, it is important to be familiar with the complications that may contribute to delayed mortality and morbidity. The radiologist plays an integral role in the acute medical or surgical management of patients who have attempted suicide. In addition, imaging examinations may provide useful forensic information.

VA/DoD self-directed violence (SDV) nomenclature — undetermined self-directed violence is defined as behavior that is self-directed and deliberately results in injury or the potential for injury to oneself in which suicidal intent is unclear based on the available evidence. Examples include when the person is unable to admit positively to the intent to die (e.g., unconsciousness, incapacitation, intoxication, acute psychosis, disorientation, death) or is reluctant to admit positively to the intent to die for other or unknown reasons. Modifiers specify Injury (Without, With, Fatal) and whether the act was Interrupted by Self or Other. Terms include Undetermined SDV, without Injury; Undetermined SDV, without Injury, Interrupted by Self or Other; Undetermined SDV, with Injury; Undetermined SDV, with Injury, Interrupted by Self or Other; and Undetermined SDV, Fatal.

### Lightning strike injuries [^113ecwDW]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Lightning is a common environmental hazard, and is a significant cause of global injury and death. Care and evaluation should follow general trauma guidelines, but several unique aspects of lightning injuries necessitate deviations from standard care that can improve survival and overall outcomes. When evaluating lightning strike patients, some common injury patterns are pathognomonic for lightning strikes and easy to recognize, while others are subtle and require heightened awareness. While most lightning-related injuries resolve spontaneously, some may have significant long-term symptoms. Anticipatory guidance and specialty referral may be needed for appropriate follow-up, evaluation, and treatment.

### Traumatic brain injury: a potential cause of violent crime? [^1117mUyA]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the biggest cause of death and disability in children and young people. TBI compromises important neurological functions for self-regulation and social behaviour and increases risk of behavioural disorder and psychiatric morbidity. Crime in young people is a major social issue. So-called early starters often continue for a lifetime. A substantial majority of young offenders are reconvicted soon after release. Multiple factors play a role in crime. We show how TBI is a risk factor for earlier, more violent, offending. TBI is linked to poor engagement in treatment, in-custody infractions, and reconviction. Schemes to assess and manage TBI are under development. These might improve engagement of offenders in forensic psychotherapeutic rehabilitation and reduce crime.

### Meaning attribution to intimate partner violence by counselors who support women with intimate partner violence experiences in Greece [^111YcCVT]. Journal of Interpersonal Violence (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on intimate partner violence:

- Definition: Intimate partner violence is defined as any form of aggression or harmful behavior within a romantic relationship. This can include physical, sexual, or psychological harm, as well as controlling behaviors by a current or former partner.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of intimate partner violence is complex and multifaceted, involving an interplay of individual, relational, and societal factors. Substance abuse, mental health issues, and societal norms can also contribute to the occurrence of intimate partner violence.
- Epidemiology: Intimate partner violence is a significant global issue and is estimated to affect nearly 1 in 3 women worldwide within their lifetime.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for intimate partner violence include individual factors such as a history of violent behavior, substance misuse, and the presence of specific personality disorders. Relationship-related factors encompass marital discord, dominance and control dynamics within the relationship, and financial stress. Societal factors include societal norms endorsing male authority over female behavior, rigid gender role distinctions, and the existence of community groups that legitimize male violence.
- Disease course: It can manifest in various forms, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Physical abuse often results in injuries, with musculoskeletal injuries being the second most common manifestation. These injuries can range from minor bruises and cuts to severe fractures and burns. It can also lead to sexual violence, which can result in STIs and unintended pregnancies. Emotional abuse, another form of intimate partner violence, can lead to mental health conditions such as depression, PTSD, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and suicidal behavior.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis is often characterized by escalating severity and chronicity. The violence can increase in frequency and severity over time, leading to more serious health consequences for the victim. Victims of intimate partner violence are also at an increased risk of future violence.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^116Hgb7G]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Elder abuse assessment in older adult patients — perform a full head-to-toe examination and make sure to inspect the skin, including fingernails and toenails, as well as an intra-oral exam. The presence of multiple suspicious physical findings is more suggestive of elder mistreatment than an isolated finding. In cases of reported or suspected sexual abuse, similar to younger victims, offer a forensic examination with evidence collection if the patient can consent. Limited research exists to guide trauma providers in differentiating injury patterns in physical elder abuse or assault from non-intentional injuries, such as falls, and preliminary studies suggest that abuse and assault-related injuries occur most frequently on the head, neck, and upper extremities. Bruises in physical assault victims are more often large (larger than 5 cm) and found on the face, lateral arm, or posterior torso, and injuries to the left cheek/zygoma, neck, and ulnar forearm appear to be more common in physical abuse than fall-related injuries.

### Assessment and management of patients at risk for suicide: synopsis of the 2024 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^116zEk77]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD suicide risk guideline — key terms define self-directed violence (SDV) as behavior that is self-directed and deliberately results in injury or the potential for injury to oneself. Suicidal intent requires past or present evidence (implicit or explicit) that an individual wishes to die, means to kill oneself, and understands the probable consequences of his/her/their actions or potential actions, and suicidal intent can be determined retrospectively and in the absence of suicidal behavior. Physical injury is a suspected bodily lesion resulting from acute overexposure to energy (mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical, or radiant) interacting with the body in amounts or rates that exceed the threshold of physiological tolerance; in some cases injury results from an insufficiency of vital elements (such as oxygen); acute poisonings and toxic effects, including overdoses and wrong substances given or taken in error, and adverse effects and complications of therapeutic surgical and medical care are included, while psychological injury is excluded in this context. Interrupted by self or other describes when a person takes steps to injure self but is stopped by self or another person before fatal injury, and the interruption might occur at any point. Suicide attempt is a non-fatal self-inflicted potentially injurious behavior with any intent to die as a result of the behavior, and suicide is death caused by self-inflicted injurious behavior with any intent to die as a result of the behavior.

### How do methods of non-fatal self-harm relate to eventual suicide? [^111WaHiw]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Methods used at an index episode of non-fatal self-harm may predict risk of future suicide. Little is known of suicide risk associated with most recent non-fatal method, and whether or not change in method is important.

Methods

A prospective cohort of 30,202 patients from the Multicentre Study of Self-harm in England presenting to six hospitals with self-harm, 2000–2007, was followed up to 2010 using national death registers. Risks of suicide (by self-poisoning, self-injury, and all methods) associated with recent method(s) of non-fatal self-harm were estimated using Cox models.

Results

Suicide occurred in 378 individuals. Cutting, hanging/asphyxiation, CO/other gas, traffic-related and other self-injury at the last episode of self-harm were associated with 1.8 to 5-fold increased risks (vs. self-poisoning) of subsequent suicide, particularly suicide involving self-injury. All methods of self-harm had similar risks of suicide by self-poisoning. One-third who died by suicide used the same method for their last self-harm and for suicide, including 41% who self-poisoned. No specific sequences of self-poisoning, cutting or other self-injury in the last two non-fatal episodes were associated with suicide in individuals with repeated self-harm.

Limitations

Data were for hospital presentations only, and lacked a suicide intent measure.

Conclusions

Method of self-harm may aid identification of individuals at high risk of suicide. Individuals using more dangerous methods (e.g. hanging, CO/other gas) should receive intensive follow-up. Method changes in repeated self-harm were not associated with suicide. Our findings reinforce national guidance that all patients presenting with self-harm, regardless of method, should receive a psychosocial assessment.

### Intimate partner violence and human trafficking: trauma we may not identify [^113dw4Um]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Intimate partner violence and human trafficking commonly affect patients presenting to the emergency department including the trauma bay. Although these forms of violence and exploitation are not always the underlying cause of that particular emergency department encounter, screening is important regardless of the presenting condition because this presentation may be the only opportunity to receive help and ultimately plants the seed for future access to help regardless of what a patient chooses to do following this first encounter. There are important medical care considerations in these patients beyond trauma bay procedures that can make the difference in saving a life.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) presentation and history — on presentation, a common injury history is either unknown cause or a low-risk mechanism (e.g., fall from 3 feet or less), whereas unintentional injuries are more often associated with a verifiable cause. Children with AHT may present with "occult symptoms" such as emesis, macrocephaly, or a syncopal event, and patients with severe injury due to AHT can present with apnea or seizure.

Lightning strike triage and resuscitation — pathophysiology and priorities state that the mechanism of sudden death is simultaneous cardiac and respiratory arrest, and cardiac automaticity, typically sinus bradycardia, precedes recovery of the respiratory system; as return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) precedes resolution of respiratory arrest, a patient's ventilation should be supported as soon as possible, and in multiple-casualty events we recommend using a reverse triage strategy (Recommendation grade 1C). It is safe to resuscitate lightning victims immediately if the scene is safe, and we recommend following current advanced life support guidelines for lightning victims requiring resuscitation (Recommendation grade: 1B).

### Demographics and fracture patterns of patients presenting to US emergency departments for intimate partner violence [^111QQd5u]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Orthopaedic surgeons are in a position to assist in identifying intimate partner violence (IPV) patients. It was the purpose of this study to analyze the demographics and fracture patterns of IPV patients in the United States.

Methods

Data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System All Injury Program from 2005 through 2013 were used. Injuries due to domestic violence were identified, and statistical analyses accounted for the weighted, stratified nature of the data.

Results

There were 1.65 million emergency department visits over nine years for IPV. The median age was 29.8 years, 83.3% were women, and 55.3% occurred at home. The major diagnoses were contusion/abrasions (43.4%), lacerations (16.9%), strain/sprains (15.6%), internal organ injuries (14.4%), and fractures (9.7%). The most common fracture involved the face (48.3%), followed by the finger (9.9%), upper trunk (9.8%), and hand (6.4%). The highest proportion of lower extremity fractures occurred in men, and upper extremity fractures increased with increasing age. The odds of fracture in an IPV patient were greatest in those sustaining an upper extremity injury (odds ratio [OR] = 6.62), lower extremity injury (OR = 6.51), upper trunk injury (4.28), and head/neck injury (OR = 3.08) compared with a lower trunk injury (referent), and women (OR = 1.80) compared with men (referent). Older patients sustaining IPV had higher odds of a fracture (the few patients 10–14 and > 65 years old were excluded from this analysis).

Conclusions

As this study encompasses the entire United States, these results are germane to all US orthopaedic surgeons. Knowing typical fracture patterns/locations is helpful in identifying IPV patients, although the victim may not fully divulge the history and details of the event. Identification is important for the physical and mental health of the victim, and abuse often continues if intervention does not occur. The odds of a fracture in an IPV patient are greatest when the injury involved the extremities and increased with increasing age of the patient.

Abstract

Pinna bruising can be associated with abuse, but can also be due to accidental injury. We present 3 cases of pinna bruises and discuss features associated with accidental and nonaccidental injury. Attention to the history, the pattern of bruising, and any other findings identified on a careful, thorough examination will help differentiate the two.

Intimate partner violence (IPV) definition and key points describe IPV as physical, emotional, or psychological harm in the form of physical or sexual violence, stalking and/or psychological aggression, note that sexual intimacy is not required to qualify, and specify that it may be perpetrated by a current or former partner or spouse in heterosexual or same-sex couples and can range from an isolated episode to intimate partner homicide. IPV affects all population groups, including men, women, adolescents, and individuals with LGBTQ+ identity, and is a known risk factor for intimate partner homicide, with firearms often the weapon of choice.

Self-directed violence classification system — behavioral categories and modifiers are as follows: Preparatory is defined as acts or preparation toward engaging in SDV before potential for injury has begun, including actions beyond verbalization or thought (e.g., assembling a method or preparing for one's death by suicide), with an example of hoarding medication for the purpose of overdosing; modifiers are "Suicidal Intent" as "Without", "Undetermined", or "With", and terms include "Non-suicidal SDV, Preparatory", "Undetermined SDV, Preparatory", and "Suicidal SDV, Preparatory". Non-suicidal Self-Directed Violence is behavior that is self-directed and deliberately results in injury or potential injury with no evidence of suicidal intent; modifiers include "Injury" as "Without", "With", or "Fatal", and "Interrupted by Self or Other", and terms include "Non-suicidal SDV, without Injury", "Non-suicidal SDV, without Injury, Interrupted by Self or Other", "Non-suicidal SDV, with Injury", "Non-suicidal SDV, with Injury, Interrupted by Self or Other", and "Non-suicidal SDV, Fatal".

Radiographs — radiographs can be useful to identify the course or location of the projectile, but they do not definitively rule out violation of the peritoneum; if more specific information is desired, obtain films in two dimensions, though this is not routinely performed and clinicians should not delay operative or other diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to obtain additional films; abdominal radiograph including the pelvis may be useful to locate foreign bodies, obtain chest radiographs in patients with a cephalad abdominal injury or lower chest injury, and mark surface wounds prior to image acquisition because marking can be helpful when the projectile has exited the patient though less helpful with multiple gunshot injuries.

### Acute sexual assault: a review [^1178aDKa]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Acute sexual assault includes a broad spectrum of nonconsensual sexual activity. Care of victims of acute sexual assault can be challenging, especially given the significant potential psychological and legal ramifications of the event and subsequent medical care and forensic evidence collection. In some emergency department settings, utilization of sexual assault response teams and sexual assault nurse examiners has demonstrated that a systematic approach to these patients improves care. However, given that victims of acute sexual assault are likely to present for care in emergency departments where such teams do not exist, it is critical for the emergency medicine physician, pediatrician, and family physician to have knowledge of key aspects of history taking, the physical examination, evidence collection, and medical record documentation. This review of care of the victim of acute sexual assault will provide practitioners with the tools needed to effectively evaluate these patients.

Abusive head trauma — key points for recognition include that on emergency department (ED) presentation, the history is frequently an unknown mechanism or one not consistent with the degree of observed injury. "Occult symptoms" of abusive head trauma (AHT) include unexplained emesis, macrocephaly, seizure, or loss of consciousness; recognize these as possible sequelae of AHT. Common radiographic findings in patients with AHT include subdural hematoma, hypoxic-ischemic changes, and cerebral edema. Skull fractures can result from either unintentional injury or AHT, and findings more consistent with an unintentional etiology include unilateral, linear skull fracture without associated intracranial injury.

Keraunoparalysis after lightning strike: Signs and symptoms include lack of pulse, pallor or cyanosis, and motor and sensory loss in the affected extremities, and keraunoparalysis typically resolves within several hours; as it may mimic a pulseless victim, be vigilant to check a central pulse before starting cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We recommend hospital observation for keraunoparalysis. This phenomenon typically resolves spontaneously but may indicate more serious underlying trauma. Recommendation grade: 1C. Keraunoparalysis can mimic a spinal injury; thus, spinal precautions should be maintained and diagnostic imaging should be performed to rule out spinal cord injury if neurologic deficits persist despite resolution of pallor or pulselessness. Recommendation grade: 1C.

Orbital and adnexal trauma — Key clinical indicators and management triggers are described. Pain with motility and diplopia can be indicative of orbital trauma. In children, orbital floor fractures are often caused by significant blunt trauma to the face and orbits and, unlike in adults, may present without significant lid edema and ecchymosis. These fractures are often greenstick-type with entrapment of intra-orbital contents leading to restricted vertical ocular movements, and if accompanied by nausea, vomiting, bradycardia and/or syncope (oculocardiac reflex) urgent surgical repair is needed.
