## Question

what is the best exercise for knee pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the best exercise is for knee pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether "knee pain" refers to osteoarthritis or other etiologies like patellofemoral pain. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence comparing exercise modalities. Next, I will appraise effect sizes and certainty of evidence, including dose and delivery considerations. After that, I should consider special populations and safety. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation and note uncertainties and alternatives where appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Most high-quality comparative evidence addresses knee osteoarthritis, so I will anchor on that while noting that patellofemoral pain has somewhat different exercise priorities, particularly emphasizing hip-focused strengthening rather than purely knee-targeted work, which I should keep in mind as I proceed [^115JLcp2] [^112BVHvo].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality comparative evidence. Multiple contemporary network meta-analyses converge on the same conclusion: among exercise modalities for knee osteoarthritis, aerobic exercise has the most consistent and largest benefits across pain, function, gait, and quality of life, with moderate-certainty evidence and high rankings on surface-under-the-curve analyses, whereas strengthening and mixed programs also help but generally show smaller or less consistent effects [^1138RTGK] [^111m8tJ6] [^112BVJYg].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and certainty. In the 2025 BMJ network meta-analysis of 217 RCTs and 15,684 participants, aerobic exercise produced large improvements in pain at short- and mid-term follow-up (standardized mean differences around −1.10 to −1.19), large improvements in function at mid-term, and moderate improvements in gait and quality of life, with moderate-certainty evidence and the highest probability of being the best intervention across outcomes, which supports choosing aerobic exercise as first-line when feasible [^1138RTGK] [^117BC1Y3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dose and delivery. I need to check whether supervised versus unsupervised programs matter and what frequency is reasonable. Guidelines consistently support supervised or structured programs to optimize adherence and outcomes, with typical recommendations of about 2–3 sessions per week for 8–12 weeks initially, while acknowledging that unsupervised or home-based programs can still be beneficial, albeit with potentially smaller effects and more variable adherence [^111uxNPo] [^111Vcyre] [^116pBHL7].

> I should confirm whether higher-intensity aerobic is necessary or if moderate intensity suffices. Evidence comparing high- versus low-intensity exercise in knee OA shows no consistent superiority of high-intensity programs for pain or function, and a large multicenter RCT found no advantage of high-dose over low-dose exercise for most outcomes, suggesting that moderate-intensity, sustainable programs are appropriate and may be safer for many patients [^115ydiJu] [^113RptZQ].

> Let me consider special populations. In people with obesity and medial knee OA, both weight-bearing functional exercise and non–weight-bearing quadriceps strengthening improve pain and function similarly, but weight-bearing exercise may yield fewer adverse events and better quality-of-life gains, so I should tailor mode to joint irritability and comorbidities rather than assume non–weight-bearing is inherently better [^1114QS6N]. For older adults with significant comorbidity or balance risk, aquatic exercise is a reasonable alternative that provides small-to-moderate benefits with favorable safety, though land-based programs remain first-line when tolerated [^111DgYjE] [^111uxNPo].

> I will now examine safety and durability. Long-term observational and trial syntheses indicate that structured, low-impact exercise is safe and does not increase structural progression or need for joint replacement, with benefits on pain and function persisting at least 2–6 months after supervised programs end, reinforcing the value of building adherence and maintenance strategies into care plans [^111YMUrk] [^1169Sfjz].

> But wait, what if the patient has patellofemoral pain rather than osteoarthritis. I should double-check that distinction. For patellofemoral pain, hip-focused strengthening (alone or combined with knee strengthening) tends to outperform knee-only programs for pain and function in the medium term, so I would prioritize hip-abductor and hip-extensor strengthening rather than purely quadriceps-focused work in that scenario [^115JLcp2] [^112BVHvo].

> Next, I should review mechanisms to ensure the recommendation is coherent. Aerobic exercise likely reduces pain via improved cardiovascular fitness, systemic and local anti-inflammatory effects, weight management, and enhanced neuromuscular control, while strengthening improves load distribution and joint stability; importantly, gains in strength or fitness can mediate symptom improvements, which helps explain why both aerobic and strengthening interventions work, even if aerobic programs show larger average effects in OA cohorts [^111etXLP] [^115omBeX].

> Let me synthesize a practical, patient-centered answer. For most adults with knee osteoarthritis, the best-supported first choice is structured, supervised aerobic exercise such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming, performed about 3 times per week for 30–60 minutes at moderate intensity (able to talk but not sing), for at least 8–12 weeks, with progression tailored to tolerance and comorbidities. If land-based aerobic exercise is not feasible, aquatic exercise is a reasonable alternative with smaller but clinically meaningful benefits, and adding strengthening 1–2 times per week can augment function and joint stability without replacing aerobic benefits [^1138RTGK] [^111uxNPo] [^111DgYjE].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not overstating exclusivity. Strengthening and mixed programs are still effective and may be preferred when aerobic exercise is limited by cardiopulmonary disease, severe obesity, or significant joint irritability; in those cases, quadriceps-focused strengthening with progressive loading, and especially hip-plus-knee programs for patellofemoral pain, remain evidence-based alternatives that improve pain and function, albeit with somewhat smaller average effect sizes than aerobic exercise in OA populations [^1138RTGK] [^115JLcp2] [^112BVHvo].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan addresses adherence and long-term maintenance. Education, goal-setting, and behavior-change strategies improve uptake and persistence, and supervised initiation with transition to a structured home or community program helps sustain benefits; given that most trials show modest average effects, individualized dosing, periodic reassessment, and addressing barriers are essential to realize clinically meaningful improvements over time [^116pBHL7] [^11755LSp] [^111Vcyre].

---

The best exercise for knee pain is **aerobic exercise** (such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming) performed for 30–60 minutes, 3–5 times per week at moderate intensity, as it provides the most consistent and clinically meaningful improvements in pain, function, and quality of life for knee osteoarthritis [^1138RTGK] [^111uxNPo]. Strengthening exercises (especially quadriceps and hip muscles) and flexibility training are **important adjuncts** that enhance joint stability and range of motion, but aerobic exercise should be the foundation of treatment [^112BVJYg] [^112CqoLy]. Programs should be individualized, supervised initially, and progressed gradually to maximize adherence and long-term benefits [^116pBHL7] [^111Vcyre].

## Comparative effectiveness of exercise modalities

Recent high-quality network meta-analyses and systematic reviews consistently show that **aerobic exercise** achieves the largest, most reliable improvements in pain, function, and quality of life in knee osteoarthritis, with moderate-certainty evidence and a high probability of ranking as the best modality across outcomes [^1138RTGK] [^117BC1Y3]. Strengthening and flexibility exercises also help, but aerobic exercise provides the most consistent benefits [^112BVJYg].

| **Exercise modality** | **Pain relief** | **Function improvement** | **Quality of life** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Aerobic exercise | Large, consistent benefits | Large, consistent benefits | Moderate benefits |
| Strengthening exercise | Moderate benefits | Moderate benefits | Small benefits |
| Flexibility exercise | Small benefits | Small benefits | Small benefits |
| Mixed exercise | Moderate benefits | Moderate benefits | Small benefits |

---

## Recommended exercise parameters

To optimize outcomes, the following parameters are **recommended**:

- **Frequency**: 3–5 times per week.
- **Duration**: 30–60 minutes per session.
- **Intensity**: Moderate (able to maintain conversation but slightly breathless).
- **Progression**: Gradual increase in duration, frequency, or intensity as tolerated.

---

## Role of strengthening and flexibility exercises

While aerobic exercise is foundational, **strengthening and flexibility exercises are important adjuncts**:

- **Quadriceps strengthening**: Essential for joint stability and load distribution, reducing pain and improving function [^1178Yp6w].
- **Hip muscle strengthening**: Particularly beneficial for patellofemoral pain and improving gait mechanics [^112CqoLy] [^115JLcp2].
- **Flexibility training**: Improves joint range of motion and reduces stiffness, enhancing overall mobility [^117BC1Y3].

---

## Individualization and supervision

Exercise programs should be **individualized** based on patient preferences, comorbidities, and baseline function [^116pBHL7]. Initial supervision by a healthcare professional or physical therapist improves adherence, ensures proper technique, and allows for progression tailored to patient needs [^111Vcyre].

---

## Safety considerations

Exercise is generally safe for patients with knee pain, but the following precautions are **recommended**:

- **Warm-up and cool-down**: Essential to prevent injury.
- **Gradual progression**: Avoid sudden increases in intensity or duration.
- **Pain monitoring**: Exercise should not exacerbate pain significantly; adjust intensity or modality if pain worsens.
- **Comorbidity consideration**: Tailor exercise to individual comorbidities (e.g. cardiovascular disease, obesity) [^116pBHL7].

---

## Long-term adherence and maintenance

Long-term adherence is critical for sustained benefits. Strategies to enhance adherence include **education** about the benefits of exercise, **goal-setting**, and **regular follow-up**. Home-based programs and community resources can support maintenance once supervised therapy ends [^116pBHL7] [^114aWWuo].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Primary exercise**: Aerobic exercise (walking, cycling, swimming) 3–5 times per week, 30–60 minutes, moderate intensity.
- **Adjunct exercises**: Quadriceps and hip strengthening, flexibility training 2–3 times per week.
- **Individualization**: Tailor to patient preferences, comorbidities, and baseline function.
- **Supervision**: Initial supervision by healthcare professional or physical therapist.
- **Progression**: Gradual increase in intensity, duration, or frequency as tolerated.

---

Aerobic exercise is the **most effective** for knee pain, with strengthening and flexibility as important adjuncts. Individualized, supervised programs with gradual progression and adherence strategies yield the best long-term outcomes.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis is a common chronic joint disease that results in considerable pain and disability in the global population, particularly older individuals. Global trends show that population ageing and rise in obesity rates will continue to drive substantial growth in the incidence, prevalence, and attributable disability rate of osteoarthritis for the foreseeable future. The knee is the most common site of osteoarthritis, with nearly 30% of people older than 45 years showing radiological evidence of knee osteoarthritis, half of whom also have severe knee symptoms. The pain caused by knee osteoarthritis can substantially affect an individual's physical function and quality of life, creating a major public health problem worldwide.

Exercise is one of the mainstream treatments for knee osteoarthritis, with potential effects on relieving pain and improving the quality of life. Therapeutic exercise aims to increase lower limb muscle mass, neuromotor control, and joint range of motion. These changes in turn lead to increased lower limb strength, minimising pain, and improving physical function. However, the large volume of data available in the literature makes the optimal type of exercise therapy for knee osteoarthritis difficult to determine.

Although several recent studies have attempted to compare the effects of different exercise modalities on knee osteoarthritis, major limitations remain in the scope, methodology, and integration of evidence. Many earlier studies failed to capture the full range of exercise types, leading to incomplete comparisons and reduced generalisability. Moreover, earlier studies often had methodological limitations: most did not apply the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework to assess certainty of evidence, and used the outdated Risk of Bias 1 (RoB 1) tool rather than the more robust Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) for risk of bias evaluation. Critically, none of the existing network meta-analyses accounted for variation in follow-up duration, because they typically assessed only a single time point. Given the chronic and progressive nature of knee osteoarthritis, it is essential to examine short, medium, and long term outcomes to understand the time dependent effectiveness of exercise interventions. The most recent network meta-analysis in this area was published in 2019, with a literature search ending in 2017. Since then, a growing body of randomised controlled trials on exercise intervention for knee osteoarthritis has emerged. To review these gaps, our study updates and expands on previous work by refining exercise classification, applying updated methodological standards (RoB 2 and GRADE), and evaluating multiple follow-up durations. This approach provides a more comprehensive and clinically meaningful evaluation of the comparative efficacy and safety of exercise interventions for knee osteoarthritis.

Study Question

Which types of exercise intervention are most effective in relieving pain and improving function in people with lower limb osteoarthritis?

Summary Answer

As of 2002 sufficient evidence had accumulated to show significant benefit of exercise over no exercise. An approach combining exercises to increase strength, flexibility, and aerobic capacity is most likely to be effective for relieving pain and improving function.

What Is Known and What This Paper Adds

Current international guidelines recommend therapeutic exercise (land or water based) as "core" and effective management of osteoarthritis. Evidence from this first network meta-analysis, largely based on studies in knee osteoarthritis, indicates that an intervention combining strengthening exercises with flexibility and aerobic exercise is most likely to improve outcomes of pain and function. Further trials of exercise versus no exercise are unlikely to overturn this positive result.

### Exercise for osteoarthritis of the knee [^112AjDBn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major public health issue causing chronic pain, impaired physical function, and reduced quality of life. As there is no cure, self-management of symptoms via exercise is recommended by all current international clinical guidelines. This review updates one published in 2015.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the effects of land-based exercise for people with knee osteoarthritis (OA) by comparing: 1) exercise versus attention control or placebo; 2) exercise versus no treatment, usual care, or limited education; 3) exercise added to another co-intervention versus the co-intervention alone.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), together with reference lists, from the date of the last search (1st May 2013) until 4 January 2024, unrestricted by language.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated exercise for knee OA versus a comparator listed above. Our outcomes of interest were pain severity, physical function, quality of life, participant-reported treatment success, adverse events, and study withdrawals.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane for systematic reviews of interventions.

Main Results

We included 139 trials (12,468 participants): 30 (3065 participants) compared exercise to attention control or placebo; 60 (4834 participants) compared exercise with usual care, no intervention or limited education; and 49 (4569 participants) evaluated exercise added to another intervention (e.g. weight loss diet, physical therapy, detailed education) versus that intervention alone. Interventions varied substantially in duration, ranging from 2 to 104 weeks. Most of the trials were at unclear or high risk of bias, in particular, performance bias (94% of trials), detection bias (94%), selective reporting bias (68%), selection bias (57%), and attrition bias (48%). Exercise versus attention control/placebo Compared with attention control/placebo, low-certainty evidence indicates exercise may result in a slight improvement in pain immediately post-intervention (mean 8.70 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.70 to 11.70; 28 studies, 2873 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence indicates exercise likely results in an improvement in physical function (mean 11.27 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% CI 7.64 to 15.09; 24 studies, 2536 participants), but little to no improvement in quality of life (mean 6.06 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% CI -0.13 to 12.26; 6 studies, 454 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence that exercise likely increases participant-reported treatment success (risk ratio (RR) 1.46, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.92; 2 studies 364 participants), and likely does not increase study withdrawals (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.26; 29 studies, 2907 participants). There was low-certainty evidence that exercise may not increase adverse events (RR 2.02, 95% CI 0.62 to 6.58; 11 studies, 1684 participants). Exercise versus no treatment/usual care/limited education Compared with no treatment/usual care/limited education, low-certainty evidence indicates exercise may result in an improvement in pain immediately post-intervention (mean 13.14 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% CI 10.36 to 15.91; 56 studies, 4184 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence indicates exercise likely results in an improvement in physical function (mean 12.53 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% CI 9.74 to 15.31; 54 studies, 4352 participants) and a slight improvement in quality of life (mean 5.37 points better (on a scale of to 100), 95% CI 3.19 to 7.54; 28 studies, 2328 participants). There was low-certainty evidence that exercise may result in no difference in participant-reported treatment success (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.49; 3 studies, 405 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence that exercise likely results in no difference in study withdrawals (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.20; 53 studies, 4408 participants). There was low-certainty evidence that exercise may increase adverse events (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.17 to 8.57; 18 studies, 1557 participants). Exercise added to another co-intervention versus the co-intervention alone Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that exercise when added to a co-intervention likely results in improvements in pain immediately post-intervention compared to the co-intervention alone (mean 10.43 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% CI 8.06 to 12.79; 47 studies, 4441 participants). It also likely results in a slight improvement in physical function (mean 9.66 points better, 95% CI 7.48 to 11.97 (on a 0 to 100 scale); 44 studies, 4381 participants) and quality of life (mean 4.22 points better (on a 0 to 100 scale), 95% CI 1.36 to 7.07; 12 studies, 1660 participants) immediately post-intervention. There was moderate-certainty evidence that exercise likely increases participant-reported treatment success (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.24; 6 studies, 1139 participants), slightly reduces study withdrawals (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.97; 41 studies, 3502 participants), and slightly increases adverse events (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.76; 19 studies, 2187 participants). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression We did not find any differences in effects between different types of exercise, and we found no relationship between changes in pain or physical function and the total number of exercise sessions prescribed or the ratio (between exercise group and comparator) of real-time consultations with a healthcare provider. Clinical significance of the findings To determine whether the results found would make a clinically meaningful difference to someone with knee OA, we compared our results to established 'minimal important difference' (MID) scores for pain (12 points on a 0 to 100 scale), physical function (13 points), and quality of life (15 points). We found that the confidence intervals of mean differences either did not reach these thresholds or included both a clinically important and clinically unimportant improvement.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low- to moderate-certainty evidence that exercise probably results in an improvement in pain, physical function, and quality of life in the short-term. However, based on the thresholds for minimal important differences that we used, these benefits were of uncertain clinical importance. Participants in most trials were not blinded and were therefore aware of their treatment, and this may have contributed to reported improvements.

### Guidance for implementing best practice therapeutic exercise for patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis: what does the current evidence base tell Us? [^11755LSp]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic exercise is a recommended first-line treatment for patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA); however, there is little specific advice or practical resources to guide clinicians in its implementation. As the first in a series of projects by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International Rehabilitation Discussion Group to address this gap, we aim in this narrative review to synthesize current literature informing the implementation of therapeutic exercise for patients with knee and hip OA, focusing on evidence from systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials. Therapeutic exercise is safe for patients with knee and hip OA. Numerous types of therapeutic exercise (including aerobic, strengthening, neuromuscular, mind-body exercise) may be utilized at varying doses and in different settings to improve pain and function. Benefits from therapeutic exercise appear greater when dosage recommendations from general exercise guidelines for healthy adults are met. However, interim therapeutic exercise goals may also be useful, given that many barriers to achieving these dosages exist among this patient group. Theoretically-informed strategies to improve adherence to therapeutic exercise, such as patient education, goal-setting, monitoring, and feedback, may help maintain participation and optimize clinical benefits over the longer term. Sedentary behavior is also a risk factor for disability and lower quality of life in patients with knee and hip OA, although limited evidence exists regarding how best to reduce this behavior. Current evidence can be used to inform how to implement best practice therapeutic exercise at a sufficient and appropriate dose for patients with knee and hip OA.

### Exercise for osteoarthritis of the knee [^1169Sfjz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major public health issue because it causes chronic pain, reduces physical function and diminishes quality of life. Ageing of the population and increased global prevalence of obesity are anticipated to dramatically increase the prevalence of knee OA and its associated impairments. No cure for knee OA is known, but exercise therapy is among the dominant non-pharmacological interventions recommended by international guidelines.

Objectives

To determine whether land-based therapeutic exercise is beneficial for people with knee OA in terms of reduced joint pain or improved physical function and quality of life.

Search Methods

Five electronic databases were searched, up until May 2013.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assigning individuals and comparing groups treated with some form of land-based therapeutic exercise (as opposed to exercise conducted in the water) with a non-exercise group or a non-treatment control group.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three teams of two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias for each study and assessed the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. We conducted analyses on continuous outcomes (pain, physical function and quality of life) immediately after treatment and on dichotomous outcomes (proportion of study withdrawals) at the end of the study; we also conducted analyses on the sustained effects of exercise on pain and function (two to six months, and longer than six months).

Main Results

In total, we extracted data from 54 studies. Overall, 19 (20%) studies reported adequate random sequence generation and allocation concealment and adequately accounted for incomplete outcome data; we considered these studies to have an overall low risk of bias. Studies were largely free from selection bias, but research results may be vulnerable to performance and detection bias, as only four of the RCTs reported blinding of participants to treatment allocation, and, although most RCTs reported blinded outcome assessment, pain, physical function and quality of life were participant self-reported. High-quality evidence from 44 trials (3537 participants) indicates that exercise reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.39 to -0.59) immediately after treatment. Pain was estimated at 44 points on a 0 to 100-point scale (0 indicated no pain) in the control group; exercise reduced pain by an equivalent of 12 points (95% CI 10 to 15 points). Moderate-quality evidence from 44 trials (3913 participants) showed that exercise improved physical function (SMD -0.52, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.64) immediately after treatment. Physical function was estimated at 38 points on a 0 to 100-point scale (0 indicated no loss of physical function) in the control group; exercise improved physical function by an equivalent of 10 points (95% CI 8 to 13 points). High-quality evidence from 13 studies (1073 participants) revealed that exercise improved quality of life (SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.40) immediately after treatment. Quality of life was estimated at 43 points on a 0 to 100-point scale (100 indicated best quality of life) in the control group; exercise improved quality of life by an equivalent of 4 points (95% CI 2 to 5 points). High-quality evidence from 45 studies (4607 participants) showed a comparable likelihood of withdrawal from exercise allocation (event rate 14%) compared with the control group (event rate 15%), and this difference was not significant: odds ratio (OR) 0.93 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.15). Eight studies reported adverse events, all of which were related to increased knee or low back pain attributed to the exercise intervention provided. No study reported a serious adverse event. In addition, 12 included studies provided two to six-month post-treatment sustainability data on 1468 participants for knee pain and on 1279 (10 studies) participants for physical function. These studies indicated sustainability of treatment effect for pain (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.14), with an equivalent reduction of 6 (3 to 9) points on 0 to 100-point scale, and of physical function (SMD -0.15 95% CI -0.26 to -0.04), with an equivalent improvement of 3 (1 to 5) points on 0 to 100-point scale. Marked variability was noted across included studies among participants recruited, symptom duration, exercise interventions assessed and important aspects of study methodology. Individually delivered programmes tended to result in greater reductions in pain and improvements in physical function, compared to class-based exercise programmes or home-based programmes; however between-study heterogeneity was marked within the individually provided treatment delivery subgroup.

Authors' Conclusions

High-quality evidence indicates that land-based therapeutic exercise provides short-term benefit that is sustained for at least two to six months after cessation of formal treatment in terms of reduced knee pain, and moderate-quality evidence shows improvement in physical function among people with knee OA. The magnitude of the treatment effect would be considered moderate (immediate) to small (two to six months) but comparable with estimates reported for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Confidence intervals around demonstrated pooled results for pain reduction and improvement in physical function do not exclude a minimal clinically important treatment effect. Since the participants in most trials were aware of their treatment, this may have contributed to their improvement. Despite the lack of blinding we did not downgrade the quality of evidence for risk of performance or detection bias. This reflects our belief that further research in this area is unlikely to change the findings of our review.

### High-intensity versus low-intensity physical activity or exercise in people with hip or knee osteoarthritis [^115ydiJu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Exercise or physical activity is recommended for improving pain and functional status in people with knee or hip osteoarthritis. These are complex interventions whose effectiveness depends on one or more components that are often poorly identified. It has been suggested that health benefits may be greater with high-intensity rather than low-intensity exercise or physical activity.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of high- versus low-intensity physical activity or exercise programs in people with hip or knee osteoarthritis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; issue 06, 2014), MEDLINE (194 8 to June 2014), EMBASE (198 0 to June 2014), CINAHL (1982 to June 2014), PEDro (1929 to June 2014), SCOPUS (to June 2014) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Registry Platform (to June 2014) for articles, without a language restriction. We also handsearched relevant conference proceedings, trials, and reference lists and contacted researchers and experts in the ﬁeld to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials of people with knee or hip osteoarthritis that compared high- versus low-intensity physical activity or exercise programs between the experimental and control group. High-intensity physical activity or exercise programs training had to refer to an increase in the overall amount of training time (frequency, duration, number of sessions) or the amount of work (strength, number of repetitions) or effort/energy expenditure (exertion, heart rate, effort).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data on trial details. We contacted authors for additional information if necessary. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for these outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included reports for six studies of 656 participants that compared high- and low-intensity exercise programs; five studies exclusively recruited people with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (620 participants), and one study exclusively recruited people with hip or knee osteoarthritis (36 participants). The majority of the participants were females (70%). No studies evaluated physical activity programs. We found the overall quality of evidence to be low to very low due to concerns about study limitations and imprecision (small number of studies, large confidence intervals) for the major outcomes using the GRADE approach. Most of the studies had an unclear or high risk of bias for several domains, and we judged five of the six studies to be at high risk for performance, detection, and attrition bias. Low-quality evidence indicated reduced pain on a 20-point Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scale (mean difference (MD) -0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.63 to -0.04; 4% absolute reduction, 95% CI -8% to 0%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 11, 95% CI 14 to 22) and improved physical function on the 68-point WOMAC disability subscale (MD -2.65, 95% CI -5.29 to -0.01; 4% absolute reduction; NNTB 10, 95% CI 8 to 13) immediately at the end of the exercise programs (from 8 to 24 weeks). However, these results are unlikely to be of clinical importance. These small improvements did not continue at longer-term follow-up (up to 40 weeks after the end of the intervention). We are uncertain of the effect on quality of life, as only one study reported this outcome (0 to 200 scale; MD 4.3, 95% CI -6.5 to 15.2; 2% absolute reduction; very low level of evidence). Our subgroup analyses provided uncertain evidence as to whether increased exercise time (duration, number of sessions) and level of resistance (strength or effort) have an impact on the exercise program effects. Three studies reported withdrawals due to adverse events. The number of dropouts was small. Only one study systematically monitored adverse effects, but four studies reported some adverse effects related to knee pain associated with an exercise program. We are uncertain as to whether high intensity increases the number of adverse effects (Peto odds ratio 1.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.81; - 2% absolute risk reduction; very low level of evidence). None of the included studies reported serious adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

We found very low-quality to low-quality evidence for no important clinical benefit of high-intensity compared to low-intensity exercise programs in improving pain and physical function in the short term. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of different types of intensity of exercise programs. We are uncertain as to whether higher-intensity exercise programs may induce more harmful effects than those of lower intensity; this must be evaluated by further studies. Withdrawals due to adverse events were poorly monitored and not reported systematically in each group. We downgraded the evidence to low or very low because of the risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. The small number of studies comparing high- and low-intensity exercise programs in osteoarthritis underscores the need for more studies investigating the dose-response relationship in exercise programs. In particular, further studies are needed to establish the minimal intensity of exercise programs needed for clinical effect and the highest intensity patients can tolerate. Larger studies should comply with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist and systematically report harms data to evaluate the potential impact of highest intensities of exercise programs in people with joint damage.

### Effectiveness and clinical applicability of integrated rehabilitation programs for knee osteoarthritis [^112pHivs]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Knee osteoarthritis is a common and increasing cause of pain and disability. Exercise and self-management interventions reduce pain and improve function. These interventions are usually delivered separately but, theoretically, the benefits of the physical approach of exercise and the educational approach of self-management interventions could be additive. If correct, rehabilitation programmes that integrate exercise and self-management components might be more effective. This review summarizes and comments on the clinical effectiveness, practicality, cost and implementation of recent studies of integrated rehabilitation programmes.

Recent Findings

The programmes varied considerably in content and duration, but in general were safe and effective (improving pain, physical function and other relevant variables). The length, complexity and burden of some programmes limit their acceptability, clinical applicability and increase costs. The most recent programmes have addressed these issues producing programmes that are more clinically and cost-effective than usual care. Implementation of these programmes will require considerable effort and commitment.

Summary

Integrated rehabilitation programmes that are acceptable, clinically effective, deliverable and affordable may be the best way of managing the large and increasing number of people suffering chronic knee pain.

### The effects of resistance exercise in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178Yp6w]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the effectiveness of resistance exercise in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis on pain, stiffness, and physical function.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Web of Science, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database were searched from the date of inception to August 2015.

Methods

Trials comparing effects of resistance exercise intervention with either non-intervention or psycho-educational intervention were selected by two reviewers independently. The risk of bias was assessed and studies with similar outcomes were pooled using a fixed or random effects model.

Results

Data from 17 randomized clinical trials including 1705 patients were integrated. The main source of methodological bias in the selected studies was lack of double blinding. The meta-analysis results suggested that resistance exercise training relieved pain (standard mean difference [SMD]: -0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.57 to -0.29; P < 0.001), alleviated stiffness (SMD: -0.31; 95%: CI -0.56 to -0.05; P = 0.02), and improved physical function (SMD -0.53; 95% CI: -0.70 to -0.37; P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Resistance exercise is beneficial in terms of reducing pain, alleviating stiffness, and improving physical function in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

### Osteoarthritis… [^112VeYkc]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis PHYSICAL THERAPY AND WEIGHT LOSS Physical therapy and exercise are the foundation of nonsurgical management of osteoarthritis-associated knee pain. Evidence has shown that active management is more effective in decreasing knee pain and improving function than passive modalities. 36 Patellar taping is a popular adjunct treatment that has been shown to reduce pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis. 2 should be encouraged to lose weight. 7 The addition of a calorie-restricted diet to a combined aerobic/strength-training program improves pain, function, and body composition scores vs. exercise alone. 10 All types of exercise have been shown to improve osteoarthritis pain and physical function scores.

37 Home exercise programs are as effective as a supervised clinical exercise program in improving function and six-minute walk distance in persons with knee osteoarthritis. 9 Twisting and high-impact activities should be avoided. Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome PHYSICAL THERAPY Active treatments, such as strength training and stretching, are the first-line therapies for patellofemoral pain syndrome. Strengthening exercises targeting the quadriceps and hip musculature, combined with stretching of the quadriceps, hamstrings, hip abductors, and iliotibial band complex, are often recommended. 23 A Cochrane review concluded that based on low-quality studies, there is likely some benefit for exercise in patients with PFPS, but researchers could not draw conclusions about the most effective modality. 54 Figures 2 through 5 demonstrate stretching and strengthening exercises that are often used in the treatment of PFPS.

Patellar taping has mixed results in the treatment of PFPS. A Cochrane review showed no significant effect on pain, 55 whereas a recent meta-analysis showed that early taping helped improve pain scores. 24 Evidence to support transcutaneous electrical stimulation, biofeedback, or chiropractic manipulation is limited. 63 Patients with partial anterior cruciate ligament tears may benefit from bracing during the acute injury phase, such as a hinged knee brace coupled with range-of-motion exercises. 35 Patients with full-thickness tears should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon.

### Comparative efficacy of various exercise modalities and doses in reducing pain and improving function in older adults with knee or hip osteoarthritis: a Bayesian network and dose-response meta-analysis [^117MH58t]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of different exercise training modalities and doses on pain and function in older adults with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and/or knee.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus from inception until December 2024.

Study Selection

We included randomised controlled trials (rct) of exercise interventions for patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and knee in older people aged 60 years and over.

Data Extraction

Data extraction was conducted by two authors (S.D.T. and Z.D.L.) Bayesian network analyses and dose-response meta-analyses were performed using random effects models to analyse the effect of exercise on hip and knee OA pain.

Data Synthesis

The study included 84 randomized clinical trials with a total of 6,373 participants, with 16 pain and 13 function trials at high risk of bias. Aerobic exercise was most beneficial for pain (SMD: -1.19; 95% CrI: -1.66, -0.74). Flexibility training was the best for function (SMD: -1.07; 95% CrI: -1.68, -0.47). A 'U-shaped' dose-response relationship was observed between the amount of energy expenditure and both pain and function. The optimal dose for improving pain and function in OA are 580 METs-min/week and 450 METs-min/week. The certainty of the evidence was very low to moderate for all outcomes.

Conclusions

The efficacy of exercise varies according to the type of exercise, exercise dosage, and outcome measures. By identifying the most effective exercise types and optimal doses, healthcare providers can offer personalized treatment plans to improve patient outcomes.

### What type of exercise is most effective for people with knee osteoarthritis and co-morbid obesity? the TARGET randomized controlled trial [^1114QS6N]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Different exercise types may yield different outcomes in osteoarthritis (OA) subgroups. The objective was to directly compare effectiveness of two exercise programs for people with medial knee OA and co-morbid obesity.

Design

We performed a participant- and assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial. 128 people ≥ 50 years with medial knee OA and body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m² were recruited from the community. Interventions were home-based non-weight bearing (NWB) quadriceps strengthening or weight bearing (WB) functional exercise for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were change in overall knee pain (numeric rating scale, range 0–10) and difficulty with physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, 0–68) over 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included other pain measures, physical function, quality-of-life, global changes, physical performance, and lower-limb muscle strength.

Results

123 (96%) participants were retained. There was no evidence of a between-group difference in change in pain (mean difference 0.73 units (95% confidence intervals (0.05,1.50)) or function (2.80 units (-1.17,6.76)), with both groups reporting improvements. For secondary outcomes, the WB group had greater improvement in quality-of-life (-0.043 units (-0.085,-0.001)) and more participants reporting global improvement (overall: relative risk 1.40 (0.98,2.01); pain 1.47 (0.97,2.24); function 1.43 (1.04,1.98). Although adverse events were minor, more NWB group participants reported ≥ 1 adverse event (26/66 (39%) vs 14/62 (23%), p = 0.04).

Conclusions

Both exercise types similarly improved primary outcomes of pain and function and can be recommended for people with knee OA and obesity. WB exercise may be preferred given fewer adverse events and potential additional benefits on some secondary outcomes.

### Efficacy of strengthening or aerobic exercise on pain relief in people with knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114wNzDT]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to investigate the differences in the efficacies between strengthening and aerobic exercises for pain relief in people with knee osteoarthritis.

Data Sources

This search was applied to Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. All literature published from each source's earliest date to March 2013 was included.

Review Methods

Trials comparing the effects of exercise intervention with those of either non-intervention or psycho-educational intervention were collected. Meta-analysis was performed for trials in which therapeutic exercise was carried out with more than three sessions per week up to eight weeks, for pain in people with knee osteoarthritis. All trials were categorised into three subgroups (non-weight-bearing strengthening exercise, weight-bearing strengthening exercise, and aerobic exercise). Subgroup analyses were also performed.

Results

Data from eight studies were integrated. Overall effect of exercise was significant with a large effect size (standardised mean difference (SMD): -0.94; 95% confidence interval -1.31 to -0.57). Subgroup analyses showed a larger SMD for non-weight-bearing strengthening exercise (-1.42 [-2.09 to -0.75]) compared with weight-bearing strengthening exercise (-0.70 [-1.05 to -0.35]), and aerobic exercise (-0.45 [-0.77 to -0.13]).

Conclusion

Muscle strengthening exercises with or without weight-bearing and aerobic exercises are effective for pain relief in people with knee osteoarthritis. In particular, for pain relief by short-term exercise intervention, the most effective exercise among the three types is non-weight-bearing strengthening exercise.

### Consensus guidelines on interventional therapies for knee pain (STEP guidelines) from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^113rNEgG]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA)

Conservative measures for the treatment of OA include physical therapy (PT) with the focus placed on improving aerobic capacity, quadriceps muscle strength and/or lower extremity performance. These treatment modalities have proven to be effective when performed under supervision at least three times per week for 4 weeks. These types of programs yield similar outcomes regardless of patient attributes to include the degree of severity of the OA.

The 2014 meta-regression analysis of RCTs titled "Impact of exercise type and dose on pain and disability in knee osteoarthritis" reviewed 48 RCTs. Over the more than 4000 patients studied, it was determined that therapy programs focusing on one single modality were more efficacious in pain reduction for patient-reported disabilities than those mixing several types of exercise with different goals within the same session.

There is ample evidence to support focusing on one type of exercise when instituting a PT program for OA of the knee. The amount of exercise should be at least three times per week over a 4-week period to relieve pain and reduce disability.

Post-Surgical Knee Pain (PSKP)

Each surgery requires the specific surgeon who performed it to carefully balance the patient's individual risks and benefits throughout the rehabilitation process to secure the best outcome.

This topic is so broad and the post-operative treatment modalities for individual therapy are so unique that this decision should be deferred to the surgeon who performed the procedure to generate a consensus point.

CRPS

Two authors evaluated 18 RCTs with 739 participants to test the efficacy of physiotherapy-based interventions between 1992 and 2015. There are only two studies specifically discussing CRPS Type 1 of the lower extremities (inclusive of the knee). Unfortunately, only one study is available as the other was removed from the site.

While physiotherapy and rehabilitation remain to be first-line treatments for people with CRPS, the review could find no evidence to support or dismiss its efficacy.

There is low-quality evidence due to the fact that most of the included trials were unclear or at high risk for bias. The trials were too broad with regard to interventions and did not allow for ample opportunity to pool data. This led to imprecision and inconsistency in the trials.

### Physical therapy for patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis: supervised, active treatment is current best practice [^111Vcyre]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Most patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) should be treated in primary care by non-surgical treatments. Building on substantial evidence from randomised trials, exercise therapy and education, typically delivered by physical therapists, are core first line treatments universally recommended in treatment guidelines for OA alongside weight loss, if needed. Exercise therapy provides at least as effective pain relief as pharmacological pain medications, without serious adverse effects; furthermore, the treatment effect from exercise therapy is similar, irrespective of baseline pain intensity and radiographic OA severity. Exercise therapy should be individualised to the preferences and needs of the individual patient, but at least 12 supervised sessions, 2 sessions per week, are required initially to obtain sufficient clinical benefit. Structured patient education concerning OA and its treatment options, including self-management, is important to retain motivation and adherence to an exercise programme and thereby maintain the effects over the long-term. If treatment effects from exercise therapy and patient education are insufficient, the physical therapist can deliver supplementary interventions that include knee orthoses and manual treatment.

### Exercise for lower limb osteoarthritis: systematic review incorporating trial sequential analysis and network meta-analysis [^1129uG9d]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude that exercise interventions are more effective than no exercise control and to compare the effectiveness of different exercise interventions in relieving pain and improving function in patients with lower limb osteoarthritis.

Data Sources

Nine electronic databases searched from inception to March 2012.

Study Selection

Randomised controlled trials comparing exercise interventions with each other or with no exercise control for adults with knee or hip osteoarthritis.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers evaluated eligibility and methodological quality. Main outcomes extracted were pain intensity and limitation of function. Trial sequential analysis was used to investigate reliability and conclusiveness of available evidence for exercise interventions. Bayesian network meta-analysis was used to combine both direct (within trial) and indirect (between trial) evidence on treatment effectiveness.

Results

60 trials (44 knee, two hip, 14 mixed) covering 12 exercise interventions and with 8218 patients met inclusion criteria. Sequential analysis showed that as of 2002 sufficient evidence had been accrued to show significant benefit of exercise interventions over no exercise control. For pain relief, strengthening, flexibility plus strengthening, flexibility plus strengthening plus aerobic, aquatic strengthening, and aquatic strengthening plus flexibility, exercises were significantly more effective than no exercise control. A combined intervention of strengthening, flexibility, and aerobic exercise was also significantly more effective than no exercise control for improving limitation in function (standardised mean difference -0.63, 95% credible interval -1.16 to -0.10).

Conclusions

As of 2002 sufficient evidence had accumulated to show significant benefit of exercise over no exercise in patients with osteoarthritis, and further trials are unlikely to overturn this result. An approach combining exercises to increase strength, flexibility, and aerobic capacity is likely to be most effective in the management of lower limb osteoarthritis. The evidence is largely from trials in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

### Impact of exercise type and dose on pain and disability in knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111Ay1qa]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the optimal exercise program, characterized by type and intensity of exercise, length of program, duration of individual supervised sessions, and number of sessions per week, for reducing pain and patient-reported disability in knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials were performed. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were combined using a random-effects model. Study-level covariates were applied in meta-regression analyses in order to reduce between-study heterogeneity.

Results

Forty-eight trials were included. Similar effects in reducing pain were found for aerobic, resistance, and performance exercise (SMD 0.67, 0.62, and 0.48, respectively; P = 0.733). These single-type exercise programs were more efficacious than programs that included different exercise types (SMD 0.61 versus 0.16; P < 0.001). The effect of aerobic exercise on pain relief increased with an increased number of supervised sessions (slope 0.022 [95% confidence interval 0.002, 0.043]). More pain reduction occurred with quadriceps-specific exercise than with lower limb exercise (SMD 0.85 versus 0.39; P = 0.005) and when supervised exercise was performed at least 3 times a week (SMD 0.68 versus 0.41; P = 0.017). No impact of intensity, duration of individual sessions, or patient characteristics was found. Similar results were found for the effect on patient-reported disability.

Conclusion

Optimal exercise programs for knee OA should have one aim and focus on improving aerobic capacity, quadriceps muscle strength, or lower extremity performance. For best results, the program should be supervised and carried out 3 times a week. Such programs have a similar effect regardless of patient characteristics, including radiographic severity and baseline pain.

### The ottawa panel clinical practice guidelines for the management of knee osteoarthritis. part three: aerobic exercise programs [^1133J6EV]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify effective aerobic exercise programs and provide clinicians and patients with updated, high-quality recommendations concerning traditional land-based exercises for knee osteoarthritis.

Methods

A systematic search and adapted selection criteria included comparative controlled trials with strengthening exercise programs for patients with knee osteoarthritis. A panel of experts reached consensus on the recommendations using a Delphi survey. A hierarchical alphabetical grading system (A, B, C+, C, D, D+, or D-) was used, based on statistical significance (P < 0.5) and clinical importance (⩾15% improvement).

Results

The five high-quality studies included demonstrated that various aerobic training exercises are generally effective for improving knee osteoarthritis within a 12-week period. An aerobic exercise program demonstrated significant improvement for pain relief (Grade B), physical function (Grade B) and quality of life (Grade C+). Aerobic exercise in combination with strengthening exercises showed significant improvement for pain relief (3 Grade A) and physical function (2 Grade A, 2 Grade B).

Conclusion

A short-term aerobic exercise program with/without muscle strengthening exercises is promising for reducing pain, improving physical function and quality of life for individuals with knee osteoarthritis.

### Exercise: necessary but not sufficient for improving function and preventing disability? [^111PCepT]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Several recent clinical trials and systematic reviews have examined functional outcomes of exercise programs in two populations: older adults and adults with knee arthritis. We synthesize recent clinical trials and systematic reviews to examine whether the links between exercise and functional outcomes are better understood than they were a decade ago.

Recent Findings

Systematic reviews and current clinical trials reveal a modest beneficial effect of progressive resistance training (strengthening programs) and aerobic programs on strength, pain, and function in both populations. Few randomized controlled trials have investigated disability-level outcomes, and of those that do examine disability outcomes, the majority of studies have not shown a beneficial effect.

Summary

Current and recent evidence shows little to no impact of exercise on the prevention of disability. Exercise programs may need to be changed if the desire is to prevent or minimize disability. Alternatively, different strategies need to be developed to address disability more directly.

### Yoga or strengthening exercise for knee osteoarthritis: a randomized clinical trial [^112eyp2h]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Considering the limited availability of high-quality, conclusive evidence supporting the effectiveness of yoga for OA and the uncertainty about the most effective type of exercise for knee OA, this study aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of yoga vs strengthening exercise over 24 weeks in patients with knee OA. We hypothesized that yoga would demonstrate superior efficacy compared with strengthening exercise in alleviating joint pain and improving functional limitations and QOL among patients with knee OA given the distinct mechanisms of yoga emphasizing mindfulness, flexibility, and holistic well-being, which are known to be independently associated with pain reduction. Additionally, establishing yoga as at least noninferior to strengthening exercise would support offering a patient-centered, holistic option that may enhance adherence and overall outcomes.

### Does higher compliance with American College of Sports Medicine exercise prescription guidelines influence exercise outcomes in knee osteoarthritis? A systematic review with meta-analysis [^111wbyFj]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

We wanted to determine if higher compliance with American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) exercise prescription guidelines influences exercise outcomes in knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

We conducted a systematic review. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase up to January 4, 2024, for randomized controlled trials evaluating resistance and/or aerobic exercise for knee OA. Interventions were classified as higher compliance (meeting ≥ 60% of ACSM guideline recommendations for frequency, intensity, and duration) or lower compliance (meeting < 60% of recommendations). Effects on pain and function were evaluated via meta-analysis, stratified by compliance.

Results

Twenty-five trials (3,290 participants) evaluated combined resistance and aerobic programs, with no differences in outcomes between those with higher and lower compliance (standardized mean difference [SMD] pain: -0.38 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.59 to -0.17] vs -0.31 [95% CI -0.45 to -0.16], respectively; SMD function: -0.43 [95% CI -0.64 to -0.21] vs -0.36 [95% CI -0.58 to -0.14]). Sixty-six trials (5,231 participants) evaluated resistance exercise, with no differences between interventions with higher and lower compliance (SMD pain: -0.60 [95% CI -0.81 to -0.39] vs -0.93 [95% CI -1.27 to -0.59]; SMD function: -0.64 [95% CI -0.83 to -0.44] vs -0.85 [95% CI -1.20 to -0.49]). Twelve trials (958 participants) evaluated aerobic exercise, with no differences between interventions with higher and lower compliance (SMD pain: -0.79 [95% CI -1.20 to -0.38] vs -1.00 [95% CI -2.52 to 0.53]; SMD function: -0.83 [95% CI -1.27 to -0.38] vs -0.76 [95% CI -2.02 to 0.50]).

Conclusion

Higher or lower compliance with ACSM exercise prescription guidelines did not influence exercise outcomes. Given there was substantial heterogeneity and many publications were at risk of bias, our results should be interpreted with caution.

### Recommendations for the delivery of therapeutic exercise for people with knee and / or hip osteoarthritis. An international consensus study from the OARSI rehabilitation discussion group [^116pBHL7]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence-informed recommendations to support the delivery of best practice therapeutic exercise for people with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis (OA).

Design

A multi-stage, evidence-informed, international multi-disciplinary consensus process that included: 1) a narrative literature review to synthesise existing evidence; 2) generation of evidence-informed proposition statements about delivery of exercise for people with knee and/or hip OA by an international multi-disciplinary expert panel, with statements refined and analysed thematically; 3) an e-Delphi survey with the expert panel to gain consensus on the most important statements; 4) a final round of statement refinement and thematic analysis to group remaining statements into domains.

Results

The expert panel included 318 members (academics, health care professionals and exercise providers, patient representatives) from 43 countries. Final recommendations comprised 54 specific proposition statements across 11 broad domains: 1) use an evidence-based approach; 2) consider exercise in the context of living with OA and pain; 3) undertake a comprehensive baseline assessment with follow-up; 4) set goals; 5) consider the type of exercise; 6) consider the dose of exercise; 7) modify and progress exercise; 8) individualise exercise; 9) optimise the delivery of exercise; 10) focus on exercise adherence; and 11) provide education about OA and the role of exercise.

Conclusion

The breadth of issues identified as important by the international diverse expert panel highlights that delivering therapeutic exercise for OA is multi-dimensional and complex.

### Does the combination of platelet-rich plasma and supervised exercise yield better pain relief and enhanced function in knee osteoarthritis? A randomized controlled trial [^113Q6SiK]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Knee osteoarthritis is a leading cause of disability with substantial healthcare costs, and efficient nonsurgical treatment methods are still needed. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections and exercise therapy are used frequently in clinical practice. Whether PRP or PRP combined with exercise is more effective than exercise alone is unclear.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Which treatment relieves knee osteoarthritis pain better: PRP alone, exercise, or PRP combined with exercise? (2) Does PRP alone, exercise, or PRP combined with exercise yield better results in terms of the WOMAC score, performance on the 40-m fast-paced walk test and stair climbing test, and the SF-12 health-related quality of life score?

Methods

In this randomized, controlled, three-arm clinical trial, we recruited patients with mild-to-moderate (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade II or III) knee osteoarthritis with a minimum of 3 points on the 11-point numeric rating scale for pain. During the study period, 157 patients with a diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis were screened and 84 eligible volunteers were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1:1) into either the exercise group (28), PRP group (28), or PRP + exercise group (28). Follow-up proportions were similar between the groups (exercise: 89% [25], PRP: 86% [24], PRP + exercise: 89% [25]; p = 0.79). All patients were analyzed in an intention-to-treat manner. There were no between-group differences in age, gender, arthritis severity, and baseline clinical scores (pain, WOMAC, functional performance tests, and health-related quality of life). The exercise group underwent a 6-week structured program consisting of 12 supervised individual sessions focused on strengthening and functional exercises. Meanwhile, the PRP group received three weekly injections of fresh, leukocyte-poor PRP. The PRP + exercise group received a combined treatment with both interventions. The primary outcome was knee pain over 24 weeks, measured on an 11-point numeric rating scale for pain (ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the worst pain, with a minimum clinically important difference [MCID] of 2). The secondary outcome measures included the WOMAC index (ranging from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating a lower level of disability and an MCID of 12), the durations of the 40-meter fast-paced walk test and stair climbing test, and the SF-12 health-related quality of life score. For the a priori sample size calculation, we used the numeric rating scale score for pain at 24 weeks as the primary outcome variable. The MCID for the numeric rating scale was deemed to be 2 points, with an estimated standard deviation of 2.4. Based on sample size calculations, a sample of 24 patients per group would provide 80% power to detect an effect of this size between the groups at the significance level of p = 0.05.

Results

We found no clinically important differences in improvements in pain-defined as ≥ 2 points of 10-at 24 weeks when comparing exercise alone to PRP alone to PRP + exercise (1.9 ± 0.7 versus 3.8 ± 1.8 versus 1.4 ± 0.6; mean difference between PRP + exercise group and exercise group -0.5 [95% confidence interval -1.2 to 0.4]; p = 0.69). Likewise, we found no differences in WOMAC scores at 24 weeks of follow-up when comparing exercise alone to PRP alone to PRP + exercise (10 ± 9 versus 26 ± 20 versus 7 ± 6; mean difference between PRP + exercise group and exercise group -3 [95% CI -12 to -5]; p = 0.97). There were no differences in any of the other secondary outcome metrics among the PRP + exercise and exercise groups.

Conclusion

PRP did not improve pain at 24 weeks of follow-up in patients with mild-to-moderate knee osteoarthritis compared with exercise alone. Moreover, exercise alone was clinically superior to PRP alone, considering function and the physical component of health-related quality of life. Despite the additional costs and endeavors related to PRP products, the combination of PRP and exercise did not differ from exercise alone. The results of this randomized controlled trial do not support the use of PRP injections in the treatment of patients diagnosed with mild-to-moderate knee osteoarthritis. Consequently, exercise alone is the recommended treatment for reducing pain and enhancing function throughout this timeframe.

Level Of Evidence

Level I, therapeutic study.

All current clinical guidelines recommend education, exercise, and weight loss (if indicated) as first‐line management approaches for knee osteoarthritis (OA). In those individuals who are overweight or obese, there is evidence that combining a weight‐loss diet with exercise is optimal, with benefits of the combination exceeding the effects of either treatment alone. A recent systematic review and meta‐analysis found that diet‐induced weight loss alone did not improve pain for people with knee OA who were overweight or obese, but there were moderate effects from interventions that combined diet and exercise. As such, scalable interventions that combine weight‐loss diet with exercise may help maximize clinical outcomes and reduce the enormous individual and societal burden of the condition.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

Our previous three‐arm randomized controlled trial found that two 6‐month telehealth‐delivered programs, including exercise with and without weight‐loss diet, led to improvements in pain and physical function in people with knee osteoarthritis compared to information‐only control. In this study, we used causal mediation analyses to explore potential mediators of these effects.
Reduced fear of movement and increased arthritis self‐efficacy may mediate the effects of exercise, compared to control, on pain and/or function.
Reduced fear of movement, increased arthritis self‐efficacy, and weight loss may mediate the effects of exercise with weight‐loss diet, compared to control, on pain and/or function.

### Osteoarthritis management: updated guidelines from the American… [^113iRGCQ]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Weight loss, exercise, tai chi, and patient-directed activity programs can improve pain and function in knee and hip OA.
- In knee and hip OA, intra-articular corticosteroid injections and oral and topical NSAIDs improve pain and function only over the short term.
- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, immunomodulators, glucosamine, and biologic injection therapies should be avoided in OA.
- Cognitive behavior therapy and balance training appear to improve pain in OA; acupuncture and thermal interventions slightly improve pain and function. From the AFP Editors Affecting more than 300 million people worldwide, osteoarthritis is common and difficult to manage. Although OA can involve any joint, the knee, hip, and hand are most commonly affected. The 2019 American College of Rheumatology/Arthritis Foundation guidelines reviewed the effectiveness of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for OA in the knee, hip, and hand.

Recommended Treatments NONPHARMACOLOGIC The guideline recommends exercise, tai chi, and self-efficacy or self-management programs as first-line treatments. Exercise and tai chi slightly improve pain and function in knee and hip OA. No particular exercise is superior, although most studies used aerobic exercise. The benefit from tai chi lasts for at least 24 weeks, whereas exercise is beneficial for up to one year. Pain in OA is related to weight, and even a 5% weight loss provides notable improvement in knee and hip pain. Patient-directed activities, such as using activity trackers, online modules, cognitive behavior therapy, and goal setting consistently demonstrate small improvements in function and pain. A few treatments are effective for OA in specific joints. For knee OA, tibiofemoral knee braces reduce pain and improve walking speed. Hand orthoses appear to improve pain and function for OA in the first carpometacarpal joint.

Treatments with Conditional Recommendations CONDITIONALLY RECOMMENDED Acupuncture and thermal interventions should be considered for small improvements in pain and function for up to one year. Balance training with or without strength training reduces pain from lower extremity OA. Cognitive behavior therapy is also beneficial for pain control. In select patients who do not experience adverse effects, prescribing tramadol, acetaminophen, or duloxetine may provide short-term pain relief from OA.

### Acupuncture and other physical treatments for the relief of pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee: network meta-analysis [^111QjjmR]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of acupuncture with other relevant physical treatments for alleviating pain due to knee osteoarthritis.

Design

Systematic review with network meta-analysis, to allow comparison of treatments within a coherent framework. Comprehensive searches were undertaken up to January 2013 to identify randomised controlled trials in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, which reported pain.

Results

Of 156 eligible studies, 114 trials (covering 22 treatments and 9,709 patients) provided data suitable for analysis. Most trials studied short-term effects and many were classed as being of poor quality with high risk of bias, commonly associated with lack of blinding (which was sometimes impossible to achieve). End of treatment results showed that eight interventions: interferential therapy, acupuncture, TENS, pulsed electrical stimulation, balneotherapy, aerobic exercise, sham acupuncture, and muscle-strengthening exercise produced a statistically significant reduction in pain when compared with standard care. In a sensitivity analysis of satisfactory and good quality studies, most studies were of acupuncture (11 trials) or muscle-strengthening exercise (9 trials); both interventions were statistically significantly better than standard care, with acupuncture being statistically significantly better than muscle-strengthening exercise (standardised mean difference: 0.49, 95% credible interval 0.00–0.98).

Conclusions

As a summary of the current available research, the network meta-analysis results indicate that acupuncture can be considered as one of the more effective physical treatments for alleviating osteoarthritis knee pain in the short-term. However, much of the evidence in this area of research is of poor quality, meaning there is uncertainty about the efficacy of many physical treatments.

### Physical therapy interventions for knee pain secondary to osteoarthritis: a systematic review [^115dd58Z]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of disability. Nonsurgical treatment is a key first step.

Purpose

Systematic literature review of physical therapy (PT) interventions for community-dwelling adults with knee osteoarthritis.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database, Scirus, Allied and Complementary Medicine, and the Health and Psychosocial Instruments bibliography database.

Study Selection

193 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) published in English from 1970 to 29 February 2012.

Data Extraction

Means of outcomes, PT interventions, and risk of bias were extracted to pool standardized mean differences. Disagreements between reviewers abstracting and checking data were resolved through discussion.

Data Synthesis

Meta-analyses of 84 RCTs provided evidence for 13 PT interventions on pain (58 RCTs), physical function (36 RCTs), and disability (29 RCTs). Meta-analyses provided low-strength evidence that aerobic (11 RCTs) and aquatic (3 RCTs) exercise improved disability and that aerobic exercise (19 RCTs), strengthening exercise (17 RCTs), and ultrasonography (6 RCTs) reduced pain and improved function. Several individual RCTs demonstrated clinically important improvements in pain and disability with aerobic exercise. Other PT interventions demonstrated no sustained benefit. Individual RCTs showed similar benefits with aerobic, aquatic, and strengthening exercise. Adverse events were uncommon and did not deter participants from continuing treatment.

Limitation

Variability in PT interventions and outcomes measures hampered synthesis of evidence.

Conclusion

Low-strength evidence suggested that only a few PT interventions were effective. Future studies should compare combined PT interventions (which is how PT is generally administered for pain associated with knee osteoarthritis).

### Moderators of the effect of therapeutic exercise for knee and hip osteoarthritis: a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis [^112qdJsu]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Background

Many international clinical guidelines recommend therapeutic exercise as a core treatment for knee and hip osteoarthritis. We aimed to identify individual patient-level moderators of the effect of therapeutic exercise for reducing pain and improving physical function in people with knee osteoarthritis, hip osteoarthritis, or both.

Methods

We did a systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing therapeutic exercise with non-exercise controls in people with knee osteoathritis, hip osteoarthritis, or both. We searched ten databases from March 1, 2012, to Feb 25, 2019, for randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of exercise with non-exercise or other exercise controls on pain and physical function outcomes among people with knee osteoarthritis, hip osteoarthritis, or both. IPD were requested from leads of all eligible randomised controlled trials. 12 potential moderators of interest were explored to ascertain whether they were associated with short-term (12 weeks), medium-term (6 months), and long-term (12 months) effects of exercise on self-reported pain and physical function, in comparison with non-exercise controls. Overall intervention effects were also summarised. This study is prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42017054049).

Findings

Of 91 eligible randomised controlled trials that compared exercise with non-exercise controls, IPD from 31 randomised controlled trials (n = 4241 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. Randomised controlled trials included participants with knee osteoarthritis (18 [58%] of 31 trials), hip osteoarthritis (six [19%]), or both (seven [23%]) and tested heterogeneous exercise interventions versus heterogeneous non-exercise controls, with variable risk of bias. Summary meta-analysis results showed that, on average, compared with non-exercise controls, therapeutic exercise reduced pain on a standardised 0–100 scale (with 100 corresponding to worst pain), with a difference of -6.36 points (95% CI -8.45 to -4.27, borrowing of strength [BoS] 10.3%, between-study variance 21.6) in the short term, -3.77 points (-5.97 to -1.57, BoS 30.0%, τ² 14.4) in the medium term, and -3.43 points (-5.18 to -1.69, BoS 31.7%, τ² 4.5) in the long term. Therapeutic exercise also improved physical function on a standardised 0–100 scale (with 100 corresponding to worst physical function), with a difference of -4.46 points in the short term (95% CI -5.95 to -2.98, BoS 10.5%, τ² 10.1), -2.71 points in the medium term (-4.63 to -0.78, BoS 33.6%, τ² 11.9), and -3.39 points in the long term (-4.97 to -1.81, BoS 34.1%, τ² 6.4). Baseline pain and physical function moderated the effect of exercise on pain and physical function outcomes. Those with higher self-reported pain and physical function scores at baseline (ie, poorer physical function) generally benefited more than those with lower self-reported pain and physical function scores at baseline, with the evidence most certain in the short term (12 weeks).

Interpretation

There was evidence of a small, positive overall effect of therapeutic exercise on pain and physical function compared with non-exercise controls. However, this effect is of questionable clinical importance, particularly in the medium and long term. As individuals with higher pain severity and poorer physical function at baseline benefited more than those with lower pain severity and better physical function at baseline, targeting individuals with higher levels of osteoarthritis-related pain and disability for therapeutic exercise might be of merit.

### Similar effects of exercise therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids for knee osteoarthritis pain: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^111Wi2s7]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and exercise therapy for knee osteoarthritis pain.

Design

Systematic review with network meta-analysis.

Literature Search

We searched the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to April 15, 2021. Web of Science was used for citation tracking.

Study Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing exercise therapy, NSAIDs, and opioids in any combination for knee osteoarthritis pain.

Data Synthesis

Network meta-analysis comparing exercise therapy, NSAIDs, opioids, and placebo/control for knee osteoarthritis pain. Additional trials from previous reviews were included to create the external placebo/control anchor.

Results

We included 13 trials (1398 patients) with direct comparisons, supplemented with data from 101 additional trials. The treatment effect of NSAIDs for knee osteoarthritis pain was similar to that of opioids (standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.14 to 0.18; Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations [GRADE]: low certainty). Exercise therapy had a larger effect than NSAIDs (SMD, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.89; GRADE: very low certainty). No estimate could be made for exercise vs opioids due to the lack of studies. Exercise therapy ranked as the "best" intervention in the network meta-analysis, followed by NSAIDs, opioids, and placebo/control intervention (GRADE: low certainty).

Conclusion

Exercise therapy ranked as the best treatment for knee osteoarthritis pain, followed by NSAIDs and opioids. The difference between treatments was small and likely not clinically relevant, and the overall confidence in the ranking was low. The results highlight the limited evidence for comparative effectiveness between exercise therapy, NSAIDs, and opioids for knee osteoarthritis pain.

### Comparative efficacy of exercise therapy and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and paracetamol for knee or hip osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114PRhF6]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Exercise is effective for pain and function due to knee and hip OA. Its effect is similar to that of oral NSAIDs and paracetamol at short (4 weeks), median (8 weeks) and long-term (24 weeks) follow-up. However, this conclusion is based mainly on indirect comparisons. Further direct evidence for OA outcomes and the long-term benefits of exercise over oral NSAIDs and paracetamol for other outcomes such as comorbidities are still needed.

### Is long-term physical activity safe for older adults with knee pain? a systematic review [^111YMUrk]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether long-term physical activity is safe for older adults with knee pain.

Design

A comprehensive systematic review and narrative synthesis of existing literature was conducted using multiple electronic databases from inception until May 2013. Two reviewers independently screened, checked data extraction and carried out quality assessment. Inclusion criteria for study designs were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies or case control studies, which included adults of mean age over 45 years old with knee pain or osteoarthritis (OA), undertaking physical activity over at least 3 months and which measured a safety related outcome (adverse events, pain, physical functioning, structural OA imaging progression or progression to total knee replacement (TKR)).

Results

Of the 8614 unique references identified, 49 studies were included in the review, comprising 48 RCTs and one case control study. RCTs varied in quality and included an array of low impact therapeutic exercise interventions of varying cardiovascular intensity. There was no evidence of serious adverse events, increases in pain, decreases in physical function, progression of structural OA on imaging or increased TKR at group level. The case control study concluded that increasing levels of regular physical activity was associated with lower risk of progression to TKR.

Conclusions

Long-term therapeutic exercise lasting 3 to 30 months is safe for most older adults with knee pain. This evidence supports current clinical guideline recommendations. However, most studies investigated selected, consenting older adults carrying out low impact therapeutic exercise which may affect result generalizability.

### Aerobic walking or strengthening exercise for osteoarthritis of the knee? A systematic review [^114dYwQL]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of aerobic walking and home based quadriceps strengthening exercises in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

Methods

The Medline, Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PEDro databases and the Cochrane controlled trials register were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of subjects with knee osteoarthritis comparing aerobic walking or home based quadriceps strengthening exercise with a non-exercise control group. Methodological quality of retrieved RCTs was assessed. Outcome data were abstracted for pain and self reported disability and the effect size calculated for each outcome. RCTs were grouped according to exercise mode and the data pooled using both fixed and random effects models.

Results

35 RCTs were identified, 13 of which met inclusion criteria and provided data suitable for further analysis. Pooled effect sizes for pain were 0.52 for aerobic walking and 0.39 for quadriceps strengthening. For self reported disability, pooled effect sizes were 0.46 for aerobic walking and 0.32 for quadriceps strengthening.

Conclusions

Both aerobic walking and home based quadriceps strengthening exercise reduce pain and disability from knee osteoarthritis but no difference between them was found on indirect comparison.

### Are the effects of resistance exercise on pain and function in knee and hip osteoarthritis dependent on exercise volume, duration, and adherence? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ZE1yw]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine dose parameters for resistance exercise associated with improvements in pain and physical function in knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) and whether these improvements were related to adherence.

Methods

We searched six databases, from inception to January 28, 2023, for randomized controlled trials comparing land-based, resistance exercise-only interventions with no intervention, or any other intervention. There were four subgroups of intervention duration: 0 to < 3 months, 3 to 6 months, > 6 to < 12 months, ≥ 12 months. The between-group effect was calculated for immediate postintervention pain and physical function (activities of daily living [ADL] and sports/recreation [SPORT]).

Results

For both knee and hip, data from 280 studies showed moderate benefit for pain, physical function ADL, and physical function SPORT in favor of interventions 3 to 6 months. For the knee, there was also a moderate benefit for physical function ADL in favor of interventions > 6 to < 12 months. From 151 knee and hip studies that provided total exercise volume data (frequency, time, duration), there was no association between volume with the effect size for pain and physical function. A total of 74 studies (69 knee, 5 hip) reported usable adherence data. There was no association between adherence with the effect size for pain and physical function.

Conclusion

In knee and hip OA, resistance exercise interventions 3 to 6 months (and for the knee > 6 to < 12 months) duration improve pain and physical function. Improvements do not depend on exercise volume or adherence, suggesting exercise does not require rigid adherence to a specific dose.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of exercise modalities in knee osteoarthritis: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117BC1Y3]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of various exercise modalities as therapeutic interventions for managing knee osteoarthritis.

Design

Systematic review with network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, AMED, PEDro, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and ClinicalTrialsRegister.eu from database inception to August 2024.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials comparing different exercise modalities, including aerobic exercise, flexibility exercise, mind-body exercise, neuromotor exercise, strengthening exercise, mixed exercise, and control group for patients with knee osteoarthritis.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcomes included pain, function, gait performance, and quality of life, assessed at short term (four weeks), mid-term (12 weeks), and long term (24 weeks) follow-up. When exact time points were unavailable, data from adjacent time windows were used.

Results

217 randomised controlled trials involving 15684 participants were included. Moderate certainty evidence showed that, compared with the control group, aerobic exercise probably results in large improvements in pain at short term (standardised mean difference -1.10, 95% confidence interval -1.68 to -0.52) and mid-term follow-up (-1.19, -1.59 to -0.79), function at mid-term (1.78, 1.05 to 2.51), gait performance at mid-term (0.85, 0.55 to 1.14), and quality of life at short term (1.53, 0.47 to 2.59). Mind-body exercise probably results in a large increase in function at short term follow-up (0.88, 0.03 to 1.73; moderate certainty), while neuromotor exercise probably results in a large increase in gait performance at short term follow-up (1.04, 0.51 to 1.57; moderate certainty). Strengthening (0.86, 0.53 to 1.18) and mixed exercise (1.07, 0.68 to 1.46) probably result in a large increase in function at mid-term follow-up, all with moderate certainty evidence. Regarding long term follow-up, flexibility exercise may result in a large reduction in pain (-0.99, -1.63 to -0.36; low certainty); aerobic exercise may result in a large increase in function (0.87, 0.02 to 1.72, low certainty); and mixed exercise may increase function (0.56, 0.26 to 0.86; low certainty) and probably increases gait performance (0.57, 0.21 to 0.92, moderate certainty). Overall, aerobic exercise consistently showed the highest probability of being the best treatment, as reflected by surface under the cumulative ranking curve values (mean 0.72) across outcomes. The safety outcome was reported in a small proportion of studies (40 studies, 18%), and no clear differences were observed between exercise interventions and control.

Conclusions

In patients with knee osteoarthritis, aerobic exercise is likely the most beneficial exercise modality for improving pain, function, gait performance, and quality of life, with moderate certainty.

### Effectiveness and safety of strengthening, aerobic, and coordination exercises for patients with osteoarthritis [^113QmAh5]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Exercise has generated interest as an important nonpharmacological treatment for symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and knee. Effect sizes in exercise interventions are small to moderate for pain and functional improvements and are similar to those observed for improvement in pain for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). However, in contrast to NSAIDS, exercise interventions are safe and improve function through a direct effect on muscle strength and function. Both aerobic and strengthening exercises seem to be equally effective in regard to pain and function in patients with OA. In obese patients with OA, a combination of diet and exercise may be advantageous for optimal benefits in health-related quality-of-life and physical function. This article will focus on recent (September 2001-August 2002) randomized controlled trials with exercise as an intervention in patients with OA.

Limitations

Some limitations of this systematic review should be noted. Firstly, we only included randomised controlled trials where the participants had knee osteoarthritis. The conclusions drawn from this study may not therefore apply to other types of osteoarthritis. Secondly, this study lacked evidence resulting from direct comparisons between some of the included types of exercise, which may have influenced our findings. Most studies made direct comparisons between exercise intervention and the control group, but in this study, we lacked head-to-head comparisons between different exercise types. Many network results could only be determined through indirect comparisons, and the results should be interpreted with caution.

Thirdly, while most of Egger's tests were statistically non-significant, indicating a low risk of publication bias overall, significant asymmetry was observed in four comparisons, specifically for outcomes relating to pain and quality of life at early time points. This asymmetry suggests potential small study effects that warrant cautious interpretation of results. Finally, poor and inconsistent reporting of data on socioeconomic characteristics hindered the investigation of these factors as potential effect modifiers.

Implications for clinical practice

Both the Osteoarthritis Research Society International and the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases advocate for education, structured exercise, and weight loss as primary treatments for osteoarthritis. However, current guidelines on the relative usefulness and therapeutic efficacy of different exercise therapies that should be prescribed to patients with osteoarthritis are ambiguous. Limited data are available to assist health professionals and patients in determining which exercise interventions should be prioritised. For example, current guidelines prioritise aerobic, strengthening, and mind-body exercises and temporarily omit aquatic sports from the core set of exercises. Our review contributes additional evidence supporting the effectiveness of aerobic exercises as treatments for knee osteoarthritis. We found that aerobic exercise offered superior combined therapeutic benefits. Given these findings, we provide the following recommendations for clinical practice.

We recommend aerobic exercise as a first line intervention for knee osteoarthritis management, particularly when the aim is to improve functional capacity and reduce pain. While other exercises may offer complementary benefits to patients, they should not replace aerobic exercise as the primary strategy. Exercise prescriptions should be tailored based on patient preferences, comorbidities, and mobility levels to maximise adherence to the programme and long term benefits to patients.

Patients should engage regularly in structured aerobic activities, such as walking, cycling, or swimming, to optimise symptom management. If aerobic exercise is not possible owing to individual limitations, alternative forms of structured physical activity may still be beneficial. Patients should consult healthcare professionals to develop an individualised exercise plan that aligns with their physical capabilities and treatment goals.

### Patellofemoral pain [^117Wzw29]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Patellofemoral pain — high versus low volume knee-targeted exercise therapy while avoiding pain: a single moderate-quality RCT reported greater short- and medium-to-long-term reductions in pain and improvements in function with a high-volume program (3 sets of 30 or more repetitions, 3 times per week for 12 weeks) coupled with 30 minutes of aerobic cycling, compared with a low-volume program (3 sets of 10 repetitions, 3 times per week for 12 weeks) with 10 minutes of aerobic cycling, with both programs avoiding pain exacerbation. The cited evidence was from a single cohort and lacked a wait-and-see control, and additional research is needed for a definitive recommendation.

Abstract

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of various exercise modalities as therapeutic interventions for managing knee osteoarthritis.

Design

Systematic review with network meta-analysis.

Data sources

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, AMED, PEDro, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and ClinicalTrialsRegister.eu from database inception to August 2024.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Randomised controlled trials comparing different exercise modalities, including aerobic exercise, flexibility exercise, mind-body exercise, neuromotor exercise, strengthening exercise, mixed exercise, and control group for patients with knee osteoarthritis.

Main outcome measures

Primary outcomes included pain, function, gait performance, and quality of life, assessed at short term (four weeks), mid-term (12 weeks), and long term (24 weeks) follow-up. When exact time points were unavailable, data from adjacent time windows were used.

Results

217 randomised controlled trials involving 15 684 participants were included. Moderate certainty evidence showed that, compared with the control group, aerobic exercise probably results in large improvements in pain at short term (standardised mean difference −1.10, 95% confidence interval −1.68 to −0.52) and mid-term follow-up (−1.19, −1.59 to −0.79), function at mid-term (1.78, 1.05 to 2.51), gait performance at mid-term (0.85, 0.55 to 1.14), and quality of life at short term (1.53, 0.47 to 2.59). Mind-body exercise probably results in a large increase in function at short term follow-up (0.88, 0.03 to 1.73; moderate certainty), while neuromotor exercise probably results in a large increase in gait performance at short term follow-up (1.04, 0.51 to 1.57; moderate certainty). Strengthening (0.86, 0.53 to 1.18) and mixed exercise (1.07, 0.68 to 1.46) probably result in a large increase in function at mid-term follow-up, all with moderate certainty evidence. Regarding long term follow-up, flexibility exercise may result in a large reduction in pain (−0.99, −1.63 to −0.36; low certainty); aerobic exercise may result in a large increase in function (0.87, 0.02 to 1.72, low certainty); and mixed exercise may increase function (0.56, 0.26 to 0.86; low certainty) and probably increases gait performance (0.57, 0.21 to 0.92, moderate certainty). Overall, aerobic exercise consistently showed the highest probability of being the best treatment, as reflected by surface under the cumulative ranking curve values (mean 0.72) across outcomes. The safety outcome was reported in a small proportion of studies (40 studies, 18%), and no clear differences were observed between exercise interventions and control.

Conclusions

In patients with knee osteoarthritis, aerobic exercise is likely the most beneficial exercise modality for improving pain, function, gait performance, and quality of life, with moderate certainty.

### Recommendations from others… [^116T4Jse]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What role does exercise play in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Evidence-Based Answer Regular exercise reduces osteoarthritic knee pain and improves functioning. Aerobic and strength-training exercises, including land-and water-based exercises, are effective for treating knee osteoarthritis. Evidence Summary A Cochrane review of 32 RCTs involving nearly 3, 800 men and women found improvement in self-reported knee pain and function when patients participated in land-based exercises. These effects were comparable to those of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy alone and were directly related to the number of supervised exercise sessions. A systematic review examined 18 studies of 2, 832 total patients with knee osteoarthritis, all of whom were community-dwelling, middle-aged or older adults.

The authors concluded that resistance training resulted in statistically significant improvements in objective muscle strength in 64 percent of the studies, patient-reported pain in 56 percent of the studies, and function in 79 percent of the studies. 3 A four-group RCT of 132 patients ranging in age from 45 to 77 years examined the effects of isokinetic, isotonic, and isometric muscle-strengthening exercises on knee osteoarthritis. Each type of training resulted in improvements at one year after the initial intervention. There was a 45 percent improvement in pain, as measured by the visual analog scale; a 43 percent improvement in disability, as measured by the Lequesne index; and a 27 percent improvement in walking speed. These results were statistically significant compared with results from the control group. 4 Aerobic conditioning is comparable with strength training for treating knee osteoarthritis.

A systematic review of 13 RCTs investigated the effects of aerobic walking and quadriceps-strengthening exercises on self-reported pain and disability. The average intervention length was eight weeks to two years. Pain was significantly reduced with aerobic activity in 449 participants and with home-based quadriceps strengthening in 2, 004 participants.

### Chronic pain management in the obese patient: a focused review of key challenges and potential exercise solutions [^112cSUMf]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Exercise interventions for chronic knee pain

Approximately 60 million Americans have knee OA, and about 10%–30% of these individuals have such severe pain that their functional ability is restricted leading to disability. The addition of a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² increases the risk of developing knee OA fourfold compared to healthy weight individuals. Chronic knee pain perpetuates activity avoidance and additional weight gain. Hence, preventing and/or restoring functional capacity while mitigating pain in obese patients is critical for prolonged adherence to exercise programs.

Both AXand RX–programs of varying duration from 2 months to 24 months can significantly reduce knee pain. AX-based interventions used walkingor aquatic running– cycling exerciseas the primary stimulus. Aquatic exercise appears to confer rapid knee pain relief within 2 months compared to walking over a 12-month duration. RX-based programs have used low resistance weights, therapy bands, or pneumatic machines to induce pain relief. While AX activates muscles about the knee in a linear anteroposterior direction, RX activates multiple muscle groups about the knee and in joints above and below the knee to improve strength across different planes of motion. RX may act by correcting muscle strength deficits and knee instability, thereby allowing the affected individual to engage in more activity with less pain. One report showed that pain relief may be greater in people who have neutral knee alignment compared to varus alignment, suggesting that other treatments such as bracing may increase effectiveness of RX on pain relief. Supervised and home-based programs are effective in increasing quadriceps strength and reducing pain over the long term.

Multimodal exercise programs have been used alone or combined with other treatments such as dietary modification, weight loss, or pain-coping skills training to treat knee pain. Both AX and RX activities are combined together during single-exercise sessions in alternating or sequential fashion. Exercise is important for long-term maintenance of mobility and walking endurance. Pain severity, inflammatory cytokine levels such as IL-6, and body weight are lowered more with exercise and dietary modification compared to either treatment alone. One study examined the independent and combined effects of multimodal exercise and pain-coping skill training on pain and functional outcomes in obese people with knee OA over 6 months. The combined treatments were superior with respect to producing greater reductions in self-reported pain, physical function, joint stiffness, pain catastrophizing, and greater improvements in self-efficacy and psychological outlook than each treatment alone. The use of multimodal exercise for pain relief is effective for knee pain in obese people, but exercise benefits may be enhanced with the addition of dietary restriction or pain-coping skills.

### The ottawa panel clinical practice guidelines for the management of knee osteoarthritis. part two: strengthening exercise programs [^112yJkkM]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify effective strengthening exercise programs and provide rehabilitation teams and patients with updated, high-quality recommendations concerning traditional land-based exercises for knee osteoarthritis.

Methods

A systematic search and adapted selection criteria included comparative controlled trials with strengthening exercise programs for patients with knee osteoarthritis. A panel of experts reached consensus on the recommendations using a Delphi survey. A hierarchical alphabetical grading system (A, B, C+, C, D, D+ or D-) was based on statistical significance (p < 0.5) and clinical importance (⩾15% improvement).

Results

The 26 high-quality studies identified demonstrated that various strengthening exercise programs with/without other types of therapeutic exercises are generally effective for improving knee osteoarthritis management within a six-month period. Strengthening exercise programs demonstrated a significant improvement for pain relief (four Grade A, ten Grade B, two Grade C+), physical function (four Grade A, eight Grade B) and quality of life (three Grade B). Strengthening in combination with other types of exercises (coordination, balance, functional) showed a significant improvement in pain relief (three Grade A, 11 Grade B, eight Grade C+), physical function (two Grade A, four Grade B, three Grade C+) and quality of life (one Grade A, one Grade C+).

Conclusion

There are a variety of choices for strengthening exercise programs with positive recommendations for healthcare professionals and knee osteoarthritis patients. There is a need to develop combined behavioral and muscle-strengthening strategies to improve long-term maintenance of regular strengthening exercise programs.

### High-versus low-dose exercise therapy for knee osteoarthritis: a randomized controlled multicenter trial [^113RptZQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The benefits of exercise in patients with knee osteoarthritis are well documented, but the optimal exercise dose remains unknown.

Objective

To compare high-dose versus low-dose exercise therapy with regard to knee function, pain, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with long-term symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.

Design

A Swedish and Norwegian multicenter randomized controlled superiority trial with multiple follow-ups up to 12 months after the intervention. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02024126).

Setting

Primary health care facilities.

Patients

189 patients with diagnosed knee osteoarthritis and a history of pain and decreased knee function were assigned to high-dose therapy (n = 98; 11 exercises; 70 to 90 minutes) or low-dose therapy (n = 91; 5 exercises; 20 to 30 minutes).

Intervention

Patient-tailored exercise programs according to the principles of medical exercise therapy. Global (aerobic), semiglobal (multisegmental), and local (joint-specific) exercises were performed 3 times a week for 12 weeks under supervision of a physiotherapist.

Measurements

The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was measured biweekly during the 3-month intervention period and at 6 and 12 months after the intervention. The primary end point was the mean difference in KOOS scores between groups at the end of the intervention (3 months). Secondary outcomes included pain intensity and QoL. The proportion of patients with minimal clinically important changes in primary and secondary outcomes was compared between groups.

Results

Both groups improved over time, but there were no benefits of high-dose therapy in most comparisons. One exception was the KOOS score for function in sports and recreation, where high-dose therapy was superior at the end of treatment and at 6-month follow-up. A small benefit in QoL at 6 and 12 months was also observed.

Limitation

There was no control group that did not exercise.

Conclusion

The results do not support the superiority of high-dose exercise over low-dose exercise for most outcomes. However, small benefits with high-dose exercise were found for knee function in sports and recreation and for QoL.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of exercise modalities in knee osteoarthritis: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111AHzJL]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design

This systematic review with meta-analysis was designed and performed following the PRISMA-NMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Network Meta-Analyses) guidelines; appendix 1) and was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42023469762). Changes made to the protocol during the project are presented in appendix 2. Appendix 3 presents the logic model for exercise intervention in knee osteoarthritis. Along with appendices 4 and 5, this model outlines the key components of study investigation, including population, inputs, outcomes, and assessment, which systematically illustrate the mechanism of exercise intervention.

Literature review

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, AMED, PEDro, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and ClinicalTrialsRegister.eu were searched from database inception to August 2024 to identify studies on exercise therapy for knee osteoarthritis.

The detailed search strategy is shown in appendix 6. We assessed all relevant reviews retrieved from the searches to identify potentially eligible studies. Articles were imported into Endnote X9 and duplicates were removed, after which two investigators (DL and XLi) independently screened the titles and abstracts of the studies to identify those eligible for inclusion. We then evaluated the full texts of potentially eligible studies according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Another investigator (LY) was consulted to resolve any discrepancies.

Eligibility criteria

Randomised controlled trials that enrolled participants with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis according to findings on clinical, radiological, or magnetic resonance imaging examination were eligible for inclusion. Eligible trials compared exercise therapy with either a control group or alternative forms of exercise therapy (appendix 4). No restrictions were imposed on the dose, duration, or intensity of the exercise interventions. The reported outcomes had to include at least one of the following areas: function, pain, quality of life, gait performance, and adverse events. Trials were excluded if they included patients who had a history of knee surgery or who had knee osteoarthritis and hip osteoarthritis at the same time.

### Mechanisms of action of therapeutic exercise for knee and hip OA remain a black box phenomenon: an individual patient data mediation study with the OA trial bank [^115omBeX]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, over 250 million people (5%) suffer from symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the hips and knees. Estimated annual total medical costs per patient are approximately $8500 to $10 000 in the US and €1000 to €2000 in Europe. Due to the ageing population and increase in obesity, OA has had one of the largest increases in years lived with disability at the global population level over the past three decades.

Currently, there is no cure for OA. Treatment is focused on improving physical function and managing pain. In this context, therapeutic exercise (ie, participation in physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive and purposeful for the improvement or maintenance of OA symptoms, including general aerobic exercise, strengthening, flexibility, balance or body–region-specific exercises) is recommended in all international guidelines. However, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating therapeutic exercise have demonstrated that effect sizes for improvements in pain and physical function are on average small-to-moderate can decline over time, and approximately only 50% of participants with knee OA and 30% of people with hip OA achieve a clinically important treatment response.

Knowledge about which mechanisms explain the effect of therapeutic exercise on pain and physical function in OA could help to better target future exercise programmes and potentially lead to improvements in patient outcomes. A systematic review of possible biomechanical and physiological mechanisms suggested increased muscle strength could be a potential mediator of the treatment effect (ie, pathway through which the treatment affects the outcome) of therapeutic exercise for people with knee OA and hip OA, while improved proprioception and reduction of knee joint extension deficits were suggested as potential mechanisms of therapeutic exercise only for knee OA. Unfortunately, all available studies used simple, unadjusted correlation analyses, inadequate for the investigation of presumed causal pathways. Additionally, meta-analyses at the study level (using aggregated study results) have been prone to aggregation (ecological) bias and study-level confounding, potentially providing misleading estimates of individual-level effects.

### The influence of exercise dosing on outcomes in patients with knee disorders: a systematic review [^114PCj9p]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Study Design Systematic review. Background Therapeutic exercise is commonly used to treat individuals with knee disorders, but dosing parameters for optimal outcomes are unclear. Large variations exist in exercise prescription, and research related to specific dosing variables for knee osteoarthritis, patellar tendinopathy, and patellofemoral pain is sparse. Objectives To identify specific doses of exercise related to improved outcomes of pain and function in individuals with common knee disorders, categorized by effect size. Methods Five electronic databases were searched for studies related to exercise and the 3 diagnoses. Means and standard deviations were used to calculate effect sizes for the exercise groups. The overall quality of evidence was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Results Five hundred eighty-three studies were found after the initial search, and 45 were included for analysis after screening. Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale scores were "fair" quality and ranged from 3 to 8. For knee osteoarthritis, 24 total therapeutic exercise sessions and 8- and 12-week durations of exercise were parameters most often associated with large effects. An exercise frequency of once per week was associated with no effect. No trends were seen with exercise dosing for patellar tendinopathy and patellofemoral pain. Conclusion This review suggests that there are clinically relevant exercise dosing variables that result in improved pain and function for patients with knee osteoarthritis, but optimal dosing is still unclear for patellar tendinopathy and patellofemoral pain. Prospective studies investigating dosing parameters are needed to confirm the results from this systematic review. Level of Evidence Therapy, level 1a. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2018;48(3):146–161.

### Structured home-based exercise programme and concentric versus eccentric-based stair training programme for pain and function in knee osteoarthritis: a two-phase, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial protocol [^1166qGr8]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This study will be the first two-phase randomised controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of a structured HEP and CSTP versus ESTP on pain and function in knee OA. We went through or overviewed many studies where various researchers investigated the effectiveness of HEP and concentric versus eccentric exercise programmes. Still, no study determined the effectiveness of CSTP and ESTP when integrated with a structural HEP for knee OA. That is why this study is going to have a great impact on the management of knee OA.

According to recent studies, the exercise programme is the most effective non-pharmacological treatment option, and it is a safe, low-cost method for treating knee OA that delays disease progression, relieves pain and improves functional ability. Exercise may include aerobic, strengthening, proprioceptive, range of motion and relevant traditional exercise. Exercise can be performed in hospitals or outside hospitals. Recently, one study reported that 44.2% of patients with knee OA decline to participate further in hospital-set exercise programmes. Therefore, researchers investigated the effectiveness of various HEPs for knee OA. The aim of hospital and HEPs is to improve patients with knee OA's overall functional ability. The main differences are that home-based exercise is easier to learn, accessible, time-efficient and cost-effective. Numerous researchers established various efficient HEP. However, the postintervention effectiveness of these exercises on pain and physical function in patients with knee OA decreases over time. So, incorporating additional exercise programmes after the initial intervention may enhance the long-term effectiveness. Besides, effective and efficient strengthening exercises should also integrate with HEPs for long-term effectiveness. Therefore, an evidence-based well-structured simple, cost-effective strengthening exercise integrated HEP is needed for optimal functional outcomes in knee OA. This study will mitigate these limitations by investigating a well-structured cost-effective, sustainable, safe and efficient exercise programme for knee OA. Integrating concentric or eccentric-based strengthening exercises into an HEP may significantly enhance the functional ability of patients with knee OA. This study aims to establish a simple, accessible and effective concentric and eccentric exercise method for knee OA. In previous studies, CSTP and ESTP, particularly through ascending and descending stairs, have shown distinct benefits in older people that may also play a significant role in managing knee OA. Previously, researchers focused on the supervised concentric and eccentric-based exercise for knee OA. However, their implementation as a self-management strategy remains challenging. Besides, no previous study explored this CSTP and ESTP for knee OA. The impact of a systematic stair training programme integrated with an HEP is yet critically unknown for knee OA management. To bridge this gap, this study has been meticulously developed to ensure an adequate sample size that eliminates biases and may determine the substantial effects of a well-structured strengthening exercise integrated HEP. This study investigates the programme's resilience and long-term effectiveness to minimise potential adverse effects and support using evidence-based, cost-effective, strengthening integrated HEPs for knee OA management.

### Does adding hip exercises to quadriceps exercises result in superior outcomes in pain, function and quality of life for people with knee osteoarthritis? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112CqoLy]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine, in people with knee osteoarthritis (KOA): i) the effectiveness of adding hip strengthening exercises to quadriceps exercises and ii) the type of hip strengthening exercise with the greatest evidence for improving pain, function and quality of life.

Design

Systematic review with meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL and SportDiscus databases were searched from inception to January 2018.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials investigating the effect of adding hip exercises to quadriceps exercises in people with KOA on pain, function and/or quality of life were included. Three subgroups of hip exercises were included: resistance, functional neuromuscular or multimodal exercise.

Results

Eight studies were included. Pooled data provide evidence that combined hip and quadriceps exercise is significantly more effective than quadriceps exercise alone for improving walking function (standardised mean difference -1.06, 95% CI -2.01 to -0.12), but not for outcomes of pain (-0.09, 95% CI -0.96 to 0.79), patient-reported function (-0.74, 95% CI -1.56 to 0.08) or stair function (-0.7, 95% CI -1.67 to 0.26). Subgroup analyses reveal that hip resistance exercises are more effective than functional neuromuscular exercises for improving pain (p < 0.0001) and patient-reported function (p < 0.0001). Multimodal exercise is no more effective than quadriceps strengthening alone for pain (0.13, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.56), patient-reported function (-0.15, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.29) or stair function (0.13, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.57).

Conclusion

Walking improved after the addition of hip strengthening to quadriceps strengthening in people with KOA. The addition of resistance hip exercises to quadriceps resulted in greater improvements in patient-reported pain and function.

### Yoga or strengthening exercise for knee osteoarthritis: a randomized clinical trial [^114rsAT5]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder that affects more than 595 million people worldwide, including about 51.8 million adults in the US and 3.2 million people in Australia. Knee OA is characterized by joint pain and dysfunction and is associated with impaired quality of life (QOL). Exercise therapy is recommended by all international guidelines as a first-line treatment for knee OA to improve pain and function. Both aerobic and strengthening exercises are effective, but there is limited evidence on the comparative effectiveness of different exercise modalities, such as yoga and strengthening exercises. To date, there is also uncertainty about the effect that mind-body exercise, such as yoga, has on knee OA.

Yoga and strengthening exercises are 2 distinct interventions with potentially different mechanisms for relieving pain and improving physical function in knee OA. Strengthening exercises are primarily designed to improve muscle strength around the knee joint, enhancing joint stability and reducing pain caused by mechanical stress. In contrast, yoga incorporates physical postures, mindfulness, and breathing techniques, which may reduce pain through a combination of improved flexibility, stress reduction, and mind-body awareness.

A systematic review pointed to the potential efficacy of yoga in improving pain, function, and stiffness in knee OA. However, the study highlighted the lack of methodologic quality and potential sources of bias within the original studies. A comprehensive network meta-analysis aimed at evaluating nonpharmacological interventions for pain relief in patients with OA highlighted that yoga was effective, especially among female participants, and yoga programs had high adherence.

Many clinical guidelines recommend yoga for knee OA; however, these recommendations remain conditional due to very low quality of evidence, often limited by small sample sizes, lack of prospective trial registration, high risk of bias, nonstandardized diagnostic criteria, and short follow-up durations. Most of the clinical trials compared yoga with usual care, while only a small number of trials directly compared yoga with another active intervention. Multiple international clinical practice guidelines recommend strengthening exercise for the management of knee and hip OA; however, to our knowledge, no studies have directly compared yoga with an evidence-based strengthening exercise program.

### Poor replicability of recommended exercise interventions for knee osteoarthritis: a descriptive analysis of evidence informing current guidelines and recommendations [^115Cfpst]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the reporting completeness of exercise-based interventions for knee osteoarthritis (OA) in studies that form the basis of current clinical guidelines, and examine if the clinical benefit (pain and disability) from exercise is associated with the intervention reporting completeness.

Design

Review of clinical OA guidelines METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for guidelines published between 2006 and 2016 including recommendations about exercise for knee OA. The studies used to inform a recommendation were reviewed for exercise reporting completeness. Reporting completeness was evaluated using a 12-item checklist; a combination of the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) and Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template (CERT). Each item was scored 'YES' or 'NO' and summarized as a proportion of interventions with complete descriptions and each intervention's completeness was summarized as the percentage of completely described items. The association between intervention description completeness score and clinical benefits was analyzed with a multilevel meta-regression.

Results

From 10 clinical guidelines, we identified 103 original studies of which 100 were retrievable (including 133 interventions with 6,926 patients). No interventions were completely described on all 12 items (median 33% of items complete; range 17–75%). The meta-regression analysis indicated that poorer reporting was associated with greater effects on pain and no association with effects on disability.

Conclusion

The inadequate description of recommended interventions for knee OA is a serious problem that precludes replication of effective interventions in clinical practice. By consequence, the relevance and usability of clinical guideline documents and original study reports are diminished.

### Patellofemoral pain [^115JLcp2]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Hip- versus knee-targeted exercise therapy — short- and medium-term outcomes indicate that in a moderate-quality trial, "6 weeks of hip-targeted exercises or knee-targeted exercises" reduced pain and improved function with "no differences between the groups", while across three randomized controlled trials hip-targeted exercise therapy produced "superior outcomes for pain reduction and improved function" compared with knee-targeted exercise therapy; a systematic review based on two high-quality randomized controlled trials found medium effects favoring hip-targeted exercise for pain (standardized mean difference [SMD], 1.07; 95% CI: 0.55, 1.59) and patient-reported outcomes (SMD, 0.87; 95% CI: 0.36, 1.37) in the medium term, but "long-term outcomes are currently unknown".

### Acupuncture and other physical treatments for the relief of pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee: network meta-analysis [^114XyKsY]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The comprehensive network meta-analysis reported here, in which physical treatments for osteoarthritis of the knee were compared with each other within a coherent framework, provides the first estimate of the relative effect of these treatments, which is essential for decision makers. A network meta-analysis provides a basis of synthesising all the available evidence in a consistent framework, obviating the need to make decisions by subjective inferences from disparate data. Numerous systematic reviews, some summarised in a review of reviews, have evaluated the interventions (or classes of interventions) included in this review. However, our analysis represents the use of the most practical methods currently available to compare a large number of different types of treatment, i.e. enabling us to compare the physical treatments (including acupuncture) with each other.

Of the 22 interventions evaluated, eight – interferential therapy, acupuncture, TENS, pulsed electrical stimulation, balneotherapy, aerobic exercise, sham acupuncture, and muscle-strengthening exercise – produced a statistically significant reduction in pain, compared with standard care. Of these, only acupuncture and muscle-strengthening exercise were represented by more than three trials in the sensitivity analysis of better-quality studies, with acupuncture (11 trials) being statistically significantly better than muscle-strengthening exercise (9 trials). Acupuncture, and balneotherapy (1 trial) were the interventions with the highest rank, although there is some uncertainty around these. For the better-quality placebo-controlled studies, interferential therapy (1 trial) showed a strong effect when compared to placebo.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of exercise modalities in knee osteoarthritis: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112bj74w]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Data analysis and synthesis

For outcomes related to pain, function, gait performance, and quality of life, when studies assessed the same outcome using different instruments, we used the standardised mean difference to transform the outcomes to a uniform scale. Risk ratios were used for adverse events. Magnitudes of effect were categorised as follows: trivial (standardised mean difference < 0.20), small (≥ 0.20 to < 0.50), moderate (≥ 0.50 to < 0.80), and large (≥ 0.80). We followed the wording recommendations from GRADE Guidelines 26 to standardise the interpretation and reporting of effect estimates. To ensure a conservative and clinically meaningful interpretation of effectiveness, we used a standardised mean difference of 0.50 as the threshold for the minimal important difference. For pain, higher scores indicate greater pain levels. Conversely, for outcomes such as function, gait performance, and quality of life, higher scores signify better outcomes. In the main text, we present standardised mean differences as the intervention group minus the control group. Therefore, a negative standardised mean difference means that the results favour the intervention for pain, and a positive standardised mean difference indicates that the result favours the intervention for function, gait performance, and quality of life. We calculated standard deviations (SDs) from standard errors, P values, confidence intervals, or plots when SDs were lacking. If none of these methods could be used, we obtained SDs from additional papers included in our network meta-analysis using established inference techniques (appendix 8.1).

R version 4.1.2 and the package netmeta (version 2.1–0) (R Project for Statistical Computing) were used for network meta-analysis, using the frequentist model with a graph theoretical technique. We used the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse method, which was based on weighted least square regression, in the estimator, and the DerSimonian-Laird random effects modelling to perform a pairwise meta-analysis to assess the variation in study heterogeneity and gather concrete evidence. Because results suggested aerobic exercise might have a larger effect than other exercises, we conducted a post hoc analysis using each type of aerobic exercise as a separate node in the analysis. We used league tables of the respective treatment effect sizes as a visual aid to compare network estimations, and we determined significance for all comparisons using a two tailed threshold of P < 0.05. In addition, we used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve to rank the intervention hierarchy in the network meta-analysis.

### Exercise interventions and patient beliefs for people with hip, knee or hip and knee osteoarthritis: a mixed methods review [^1135ALUp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic peripheral joint pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) is extremely prevalent and a major cause of physical dysfunction and psychosocial distress. Exercise is recommended to reduce joint pain and improve physical function, but the effect of exercise on psychosocial function (health beliefs, depression, anxiety and quality of life) in this population is unknown.

Objectives

To improve our understanding of the complex inter-relationship between pain, psychosocial effects, physical function and exercise.

Search Methods

Review authors searched 23 clinical, public health, psychology and social care databases and 25 other relevant resources including trials registers up to March 2016. We checked reference lists of included studies for relevant studies. We contacted key experts about unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

To be included in the quantitative synthesis, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of land- or water-based exercise programmes compared with a control group consisting of no treatment or non-exercise intervention (such as medication, patient education) that measured either pain or function and at least one psychosocial outcome (self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, quality of life). Participants had to be aged 45 years or older, with a clinical diagnosis of OA (as defined by the study) or self-reported chronic hip or knee (or both) pain (defined as more than six months' duration). To be included in the qualitative synthesis, studies had to have reported people's opinions and experiences of exercise-based programmes (e.g. their views, understanding, experiences and beliefs about the utility of exercise in the management of chronic pain/OA).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodology recommended by Cochrane for the quantitative analysis. For the qualitative analysis, we extracted verbatim quotes from study participants and synthesised studies of patients' views using framework synthesis. We then conducted an integrative review, synthesising the quantitative and qualitative data together.

Main Results

Twenty-one trials (2372 participants) met the inclusion criteria for quantitative synthesis. There were large variations in the exercise programme's content, mode of delivery, frequency and duration, participant's symptoms, duration of symptoms, outcomes measured, methodological quality and reporting. Comparator groups were varied and included normal care; education; and attention controls such as home visits, sham gel and wait list controls. Risk of bias was high in one and unclear risk in five studies regarding the randomisation process, high for 11 studies regarding allocation concealment, high for all 21 studies regarding blinding, and high for three studies and unclear for five studies regarding attrition. Studies did not provide information on adverse effects. There was moderate quality evidence that exercise reduced pain by an absolute percent reduction of 6% (95% confidence interval (CI) -9% to -4%, (9 studies, 1058 participants), equivalent to reducing (improving) pain by 1.25 points from 6.5 to 5.3 on a 0 to 20 scale and moderate quality evidence that exercise improved physical function by an absolute percent of 5.6% (95% CI -7.6% to 2.0%; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.27, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.17, equivalent to reducing (improving) WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) function on a 0 to 100 scale from 49.9 to 44.3) (13 studies, 1599 participants)). Self-efficacy was increased by an absolute percent of 1.66% (95% CI 1.08% to 2.20%), although evidence was low quality (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.58, equivalent to improving the ExBeliefs score on a 17 to 85 scale from 64.3 to 65.4), with small benefits for depression from moderate quality evidence indicating an absolute percent reduction of 2.4% (95% CI -0.47% to 0.5%) (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.02, equivalent to improving depression measured using HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) on a 0 to 21 scale from 3.5 to 3.0) but no clinically or statistically significant effect on anxiety (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.05, 2% absolute improvement, 95% CI -5% to 1% equivalent to improving HADS anxiety on a 0 to 21 scale from 5.8 to 5.4; moderate quality evidence). Five studies measured the effect of exercise on health-related quality of life using the 36-item Short Form (SF-36) with statistically significant benefits for social function, increasing it by an absolute percent of 7.9% (95% CI 4.1% to 11.6%), equivalent to increasing SF-36 social function on a 0 to 100 scale from 73.6 to 81.5, although the evidence was low quality. Evidence was downgraded due to heterogeneity of measures, limitations with blinding and lack of detail regarding interventions. For 20/21 studies, there was a high risk of bias with blinding as participants self-reported and were not blinded to their participation in an exercise intervention. Twelve studies (with 6 to 29 participants) met inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis. Their methodological rigour and quality was generally good. From the patients' perspectives, ways to improve the delivery of exercise interventions included: provide better information and advice about the safety and value of exercise; provide exercise tailored to individual's preferences, abilities and needs; challenge inappropriate health beliefs and provide better support. An integrative review, which compared the findings from quantitative trials with low risk of bias and the implications derived from the high-quality studies in the qualitative synthesis, confirmed the importance of these implications.

Authors' Conclusions

Chronic hip and knee pain affects all domains of people's lives. People's beliefs about chronic pain shape their attitudes and behaviours about how to manage their pain. People are confused about the cause of their pain, and bewildered by its variability and randomness. Without adequate information and advice from healthcare professionals, people do not know what they should and should not do, and, as a consequence, avoid activity for fear of causing harm. Participation in exercise programmes may slightly improve physical function, depression and pain. It may slightly improve self-efficacy and social function, although there is probably little or no difference in anxiety. Providing reassurance and clear advice about the value of exercise in controlling symptoms, and opportunities to participate in exercise programmes that people regard as enjoyable and relevant, may encourage greater exercise participation, which brings a range of health benefits to a large population of people.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of exercise modalities in knee osteoarthritis: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114J3J8G]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Implications for research

Our study highlights several critical limitations in current trials on exercise interventions for knee osteoarthritis, emphasising the need for higher quality clinical research in the future. One major issue is the high variability in study quality, with small sample sizes in some trials. Additionally, incomplete reporting of exercise parameters, such as intensity, frequency, and duration of exercise, makes it difficult to establish a clear link between exercise interventions and treatment outcomes. Given that knee osteoarthritis is a chronic and progressive condition, studying long term outcomes is particularly important for evaluating the sustained benefits of exercise. However, only a few studies (n = 12, 5.5%) have reported follow-up data beyond one year. Therefore, future research should prioritise well designed, adequately powered trials with longer follow-up durations to better assess the durability of exercise effects over time. Finally, Kellgre-Lawrence grading was recorded to classify the severity of knee osteoarthritis in the included studies. However, nearly all studies included participants with different Kellgre-Lawrence grades, making it difficult to distinguish the therapeutic effects of exercise intervention on patients with different degrees of knee osteoarthritis. Future research focusing on disease severity could help clinicians make more informed choices regarding exercise therapy for patients with knee osteoarthritis.

Conclusions

Exercise treatment offers obvious benefits for individuals with knee osteoarthritis. With moderate certainty quality evidence, aerobic exercise might be the best exercise modality for improvements in pain, function, gait performance, and quality of life. This study presents a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of the effects of exercise intervention as a treatment strategy for knee osteoarthritis, which could assist clinicians in prescribing therapy to improve treatment outcomes for patients.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of exercise modalities in knee osteoarthritis: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115f6RMs]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

The outcomes of therapeutic exercise in patients with knee osteoarthritis can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as adherence to the programme and inherent characteristics of the outcome measures. Evidence suggests that greater adherence is associated with larger improvements in pain and function. However, adherence was not consistently reported across the included trials in our study, which limits further analysis. Additionally, commonly used outcome measures, such as Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index or Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, may lack the required sensitivity to detect early neuromuscular or psychosocial improvements induced by exercise.

While our primary analysis used a conservative minimal important difference threshold of 0.5 to reflect clearly meaningful clinical effects, we also considered how the interpretation might change if a more permissive threshold of 0.2 was used, which is often cited as the lower bound for minimal important difference. Given the nature of knee osteoarthritis as a chronic condition, long term outcomes are of particular interest. In our primary analysis, which used a minimal important difference of 0.5, none of the exercise interventions showed clinically meaningful differences compared with the control group at the 24 week follow-up. However, when the minimal important difference was lowered to 0.2, both flexibility and mixed exercise showed clinically relevant improvements in certain long term outcomes. Specifically, flexibility exercise showed clinically relevant improvements in pain, while mixed exercise also exceeded the minimal important difference threshold for improvements in pain, function, and gait performance. The appearance of these long term effects underscores the potential value of sustained engagement in certain types of exercise, particularly those with flexibility based or multimodal components. Our use of the 0.5 minimal important difference thus reflects a conservative approach in our data interpretation, while acknowledging that different thresholds for minimal important difference may reveal a broader scope of benefit.

### Exercise for osteoarthritis of the knee: a cochrane systematic review [^1116Ltxn]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether land-based therapeutic exercise is beneficial for people with knee osteoarthritis (OA) in terms of reduced joint pain or improved physical function and quality of life.

Methods

Five electronic databases were searched, up until May 2013. Randomised clinical trials comparing some form of land-based therapeutic exercise with a non-exercise control were selected. Three teams of two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for each study. Standardised mean differences immediately after treatment and 2–6 months after cessation of formal treatment were separately pooled using a random effects model.

Results

In total, 54 studies were identified. Overall, 19 (35%) studies reported adequate random sequence generation, allocation concealment and adequately accounted for incomplete outcome data. However, research results may be vulnerable to selection, attrition and detection bias. Pooled results from 44 trials indicated that exercise significantly reduced pain (12 points/100; 95% CI 10 to 15) and improved physical function (10 points/100; 95% CI 8 to 13) to a moderate degree immediately after treatment, while evidence from 13 studies revealed that exercise significantly improved quality of life immediately after treatment with small effect (4 points/100; 95% CI 2 to 5). In addition, 12 studies provided 2-month to 6-month post-treatment sustainability data which showed significantly reduced knee pain (6 points/100; 95% CI 3 to 9) and 10 studies which showed improved physical function (3 points/100; 95% CI 1 to 5).

Conclusions

Among people with knee osteoarthritis, land-based therapeutic exercise provides short-term benefit that is sustained for at least 2–6 months after cessation of formal treatment.

### Trunk, hip and knee exercise programs for pain relief, functional performance and muscle strength in patellofemoral pain: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ADCNK]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Positive effects of hip exercise programs in patients with PFP have been reported numerous times. In the present study, we included randomized controlled trials evaluating exercise programs only with at least one intervention and control group with or without intervention. Hip-only exercise programs seemed to be superior to knee-only exercise programs in terms of pain relief, and functional improvement. Our review confirmed that hip exercise programs lead to greater pain relief and functional improvement than knee exercise programs. In a single study, a decrease in pain levels did not reach statistical significance. However, although both Knee-only and Hip-only exercise programs proved to be equally effective in relieving pain, the latter programs appear to result in faster pain relief and a higher overall increase in muscle strength. In addition, studies support the use of hip muscle strengthening in the early stages of PFP rehabilitation when excessive knee involvement provokes further pain. Overall, the use of hip-only exercise programs over knee-only exercise programs may be recommended in early rehabilitation, but the importance of knee muscle strengthening on PFP cannot be completely eliminated.

### How does exercise, with and without diet, improve pain and function in knee osteoarthritis? A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial exploring potential mediators of effects [^115wvZRj]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This is a secondary analysis of data from an RCT comparing the effects of exercise, with and without a weight‐loss diet, to an information‐only control group in people with knee OA (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12618000930280). All participants provided written informed consent and The University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee approved the study.

Participants

Participants were recruited from members of Australia's largest private health insurer, Medibank Private. Medibank sent targeted invitations, predominantly via email, to members. Eligible participants including the those who: 1) held private health insurance with Medibank at a level that included cover for arthroplasty surgery; 2) met the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence OA clinical criteria (ages ≥ 45 years, activity‐related joint pain, morning stiffness ≤ 30 minutes); 3) had average knee pain ≥ 4 on 11‐point numerical rating scale (NRS) in the past week (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain possible); 4) had a history of knee pain on most days for at least 3 months; 5) were ages < 81 years; and 6) had a body mass index ≥ 28 kg/m² and < 41 kg/m². Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria for the RCT are published.

Control group

Participants in the Control group were given access to a bespoke website that contained information about OA, treatment options, exercise and physical activity, weight loss, managing pain, sleep, and "success stories". The website also provided links to external websites for further information.

Interventions

The intervention protocol was previously published. All project clinicians underwent training prior to the start of the trial, including in best‐practice management of OA, motivational interviewing skills, specifics of the weight‐loss diet, and study‐specific protocols.

Exercise program

Participants in the Exercise group had 6 individual videoconferencing consultations (Zoom Video Communications Inc.) with a physical therapist over 6 months where they were prescribed a strengthening exercise and physical activity program. Initial consultations lasted ~45 minutes, with follow‐up consultations lasting ~20 minutes. Physical therapists also provided individualized advice about treatment options and used motivational interviewing principles to support behavior change. Participants received hard copy information booklets (information about OA, exercise instructions, log book), exercise bands, and a Fitbit (Flex 2 model) to monitor physical activity.

### OARSI year in review 2023: rehabilitation and outcomes [^113rX4VU]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

We systematically reviewed the literature to identify comparative studies of core treatments (exercise, education, or weight management), adjunct treatments (e.g. electrotherapeutical modalities, bracing), or multimodal treatments (core plus other treatments), for treating osteoarthritis (OA) complaints, published between 1 March 2022 and 1 March 2023.

Design

We searched three electronic databases for peer-reviewed comparative studies evaluating core treatments, adjunct treatments, or multimodal treatments for OA affecting any joint, in comparison to other OA treatments. Two authors independently screened records. Methodological quality was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. A narrative synthesis focusing on pain and function outcomes was performed in studies with a mean sample size of at least 46 participants per treatment arm.

Results

33 publications (28 studies), 82% with PEDro ratings of good or excellent, were eligible for narrative synthesis: 23 studies evaluated knee OA; one knee OA or chronic low back pain; two knee or hip OA; one hip OA only; and one thumb OA. No studies identified a dose, duration or type of exercise that resulted in better pain or function outcomes. Core treatments generally showed modest benefits compared to no or minimal intervention controls.

Conclusions

Rehabilitation research continues to be focused on the knee. Most studies are not adequately powered to assess pain efficacy. Further work is needed to better account for contextual effects, identify treatment responder characteristics, understand treatment mechanisms, and implement guideline care.

### Are adjunct treatments effective in improving pain and function when added to exercise therapy in people with patellofemoral pain? A systematic review with meta-analysis and appraisal of the quality of interventions [^1135wDB2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of adjunct treatments combined with exercise to exercise alone in people with patellofemoral pain (PFP) and explore the quality of intervention descriptions in randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

Seven databases were searched in November 2023.

Eligibility

RCTs that evaluated the effectiveness of any adjunct treatment combined with exercise to exercise alone on self-reported pain and function in people with PFP.

Results

We included 45 RCTs (2023 participants), with 25 RCTs (1050 participants) contributing to meta-analyses. Pooled analysis indicated very low-certainty evidence that neuromuscular electrical stimulation or monopolar dielectric diathermy combined with exercise leads to small and large improvements in self-reported pain when compared with exercise alone (standardised mean difference (95% CI) = -0.27 (-0.53 to -0.02) and -2.58 (-4.59 to -0.57), respectively) in the short-term. For self-reported pain and function, very low-certainty evidence indicates that knee taping, whole-body vibration, electromyographic biofeedback and knee brace combined with exercise do not differ from exercise alone. Interventions are poorly described in most RCTs, adjunct treatments scored on average 14/24 and exercise therapy 12/24 in the Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist.

Conclusion

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation and monopolar dielectric diathermy combined with exercise seem to improve self-reported pain in people with PFP compared with exercise alone. Knee taping, whole-body vibration, electromyographic biofeedback and knee brace do not offer additional benefits to exercise alone. Most interventions are poorly described, which is detrimental to translating research knowledge into clinical practice.

### Trunk, hip and knee exercise programs for pain relief, functional performance and muscle strength in patellofemoral pain: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117YGU1H]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Given the aforementioned factors regarding the reduced strength of hip muscles, it is not surprising that many exercise programs focus on improving the maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the trunk, hip or knee muscles. Positive effects of the exercise programs targeting muscle groups adjacent to the knee have been reported by several authors, although not all have shown to be effective. More importantly, even with numerous studies conducted with the aim of comparing different exercise program for patients with PFP, it is still not clear which approach is the most effective. Such ambiguity can result in a more time-consuming clinical practice, as clinicians often prescribe traditional, knee-only exercise programs regardless of their actual effectiveness. It is believed that the main reason for this uncertainty is in strengthening both hip and knee muscle groups in the same exercise program. As a result, difficulties are arising in determining the actual effects of isolated hip or knee muscle strengthening on PFP. A review concerning the rehabilitation of patients with PFP focusing on resistance exercise of hip versus knee muscles concluded that hip muscle strengthening is effective in reducing pain and improving function. However, high variability in the protocol type, used methods and outcome measures limited the pooling of data. Therefore, it is necessary to update the clinical guidelines for reducing pain and improving function in patients with PFP. Moreover, several new studies investigating the effects of strengthening the hip muscle on PFP were published since the latest systematic review.

Our systematic review with meta-analysis aims to assess the effects of exercise programs focusing on training of muscle groups proximal to the knee in patients with PFP. Hip&Knee exercise programs were defined as progressive exercise directed to the hip and knee muscle groups, while Hip-only or Knee-only exercise programs were defined as progressive exercise directed only to the hip or knee muscle groups. We hypothesized that such exercise programs are effective in reducing pain levels, enhancing functional improvements and proximal muscle strength improvements in patients with PFP.

### Effectiveness of exercise on pain intensity and physical function in patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis: an umbrella and mapping review with meta-meta-analysis [^116hBXmT]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this review was to provide a qualitative and quantitative overview of the effects of exercise on pain, physical function, and quality of life for patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis.

Materials and Methods

This study was an umbrella and mapping review with meta-meta-analysis. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials were included. The methodological quality and risk of bias were evaluated using the Modified Quality Assessment Scale for Systematic Reviews and the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews tool. The quality of evidence was evaluated using the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Grading Criteria.

Results

41 meta-analyses were included, 43.9% of the studies had adequate methodological quality, and 56.1% of the studies had a low risk of bias. Moderate evidence was found that exercise decreases pain intensity (33 meta-analyses; SMD = -0.49; 95% CI -0.56 to -0.42), improves function (19 meta-analyses; SMD = -0.50; 95% CI -0.58 to -0.41), strength (6 meta-analyses; SMD = -0.57; 95% CI -0.70 to -0.44) and quality of life (SMD = -0.36; 95% CI -0.46 to -0.27) for patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis.

Conclusion

Exercise is an effective intervention to decrease pain intensity and improve function in patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis.(PROSPERO, CRD42020221987).

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty), third edition [^116VyvaC]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Supervised exercise for knee osteoarthritis — supervised exercise, unsupervised exercise, and/or aquatic exercise are recommended over no exercise to improve pain and function for treatment of knee osteoarthritis, with Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Patients from both groups received benefit from the interventions but there were mixed results as to whether supervised exercise was superior to the non‑supervised exercise programs, and it appears that both supervised or non‑supervised exercise programs can result in improved pain and function in people with knee osteoarthritis. Regarding aquatic exercise, although there may be some benefit from aquatic exercise, inconsistent results do not allow us to recommend aquatic exercise over land‑based exercise at this time, and it appears that exercise is beneficial, but the mode of exercise may not matter as much as engaging in any exercise program. Most patients can expect an improvement in pain and function with exercise, and patients may experience a temporary increase in knee pain or muscle soreness when engaging in an exercise program.

### Exercise for osteoarthritis of the knee [^111uzyqr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Biomechanical factors, such as reduced muscle strength and joint malalignment, have an important role in the initiation and progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Currently, there is no known cure for OA; however, disease-related factors, such as impaired muscle function and reduced fitness, are potentially amenable to therapeutic exercise.

Objectives

To determine whether land-based therapeutic exercise is beneficial for people with knee OA in terms of reduced joint pain or improved physical function.

Search Strategy

Five electronic databases were searched, up until December 2007.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials randomising individuals and comparing some form of land-based therapeutic exercise (as opposed to exercises conducted in the water) with a non-exercise group.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. All analyses were conducted on continuous outcomes.

Main Results

The 32 included studies provided data on 3616 participants for knee pain and 3719 participants for self-reported physical function. Meta-analysis revealed a beneficial treatment effect with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 0.50) for pain; and SMD 0.37 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.49) for physical function. There was marked variability across the included studies in participants recruited, symptom duration, exercise interventions assessed and important aspects of study methodology. The results were sensitive to the number of direct supervision occasions provided and various aspects of study methodology. While the pooled beneficial effects of exercise programs providing less than 12 direct supervision occasions or studies utilising more rigorous methodologies remained significant and clinically relevant, between study heterogeneity remained marked and the magnitude of the treatment effect of these studies would be considered small.

Authors' Conclusions

There is platinum level evidence that land-based therapeutic exercise has at least short term benefit in terms of reduced knee pain and improved physical function for people with knee OA. The magnitude of the treatment effect would be considered small, but comparable to estimates reported for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Interventions for improving adherence to exercise-based treatments in people with knee osteoarthritis [^114aWWuo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

The impact of successful strategies to help people adhere to medical treatments may exceed the effects of the treatments themselves on people's health. Furthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has affirmed that interventions to improve adherence may have a far greater impact on health than any improvements to medical treatment. There is currently no Cochrane review or protocol that has assessed the effectiveness of interventions to improve adherence to any medical treatment in people with KOA. Considering that clinical practice guidelines for KOA emphasise the importance of exercise as a fundamental management strategy, the findings of this systematic review may contribute to future recommendations of those guidelines. Furthermore, this review will aid researchers and clinicians in developing and modifying therapies aimed at enhancing adherence to exercise‐based treatments, as well as to other medical treatments, in people with KOA.

### Patellofemoral pain [^114xv3Bx]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Patellofemoral pain — gaps in knowledge on exercise therapy dosage: Although exercise therapy is recommended for PFP to reduce pain in the short, medium, and long term, and to improve function in the medium and long term, optimal dosage is currently unclear, in part due to inadequate exercise reporting in the literature. Further research is needed to understand which dosage parameters (eg, session duration and frequency, exercise intensity, etc) are associated with better pain, function, and quality-of-life outcomes.

### OARSI recommendations for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis, part II: OARSI evidence-based, expert consensus guidelines [^113QJjWY]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To develop concise, patient-focussed, up to date, evidence-based, expert consensus recommendations for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA), which are adaptable and designed to assist physicians and allied health care professionals in general and specialist practise throughout the world.

Methods

Sixteen experts from four medical disciplines (primary care, rheumatology, orthopaedics and evidence-based medicine), two continents and six countries (USA, UK, France, Netherlands, Sweden and Canada) formed the guidelines development team. A systematic review of existing guidelines for the management of hip and knee OA published between 1945 and January 2006 was undertaken using the validated appraisal of guidelines research and evaluation (AGREE) instrument. A core set of management modalities was generated based on the agreement between guidelines. Evidence before 2002 was based on a systematic review conducted by European League Against Rheumatism and evidence after 2002 was updated using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, the Cochrane Library and HTA reports. The quality of evidence was evaluated, and where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk or odds ratio and cost per quality-adjusted life years gained were estimated. Consensus recommendations were produced following a Delphi exercise and the strength of recommendation (SOR) for propositions relating to each modality was determined using a visual analogue scale.

Results

Twenty-three treatment guidelines for the management of hip and knee OA were identified from the literature search, including six opinion-based, five evidence-based and 12 based on both expert opinion and research evidence. Twenty out of 51 treatment modalities addressed by these guidelines were universally recommended. ES for pain relief varied from treatment to treatment. Overall there was no statistically significant difference between non-pharmacological therapies [0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16, 0.34] and pharmacological therapies (ES = 0.39, 95% CI 0.31, 0.47). Following feedback from Osteoarthritis Research International members on the draft guidelines and six Delphi rounds consensus was reached on 25 carefully worded recommendations. Optimal management of patients with OA hip or knee requires a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological modalities of therapy. Recommendations cover the use of 12 non-pharmacological modalities: education and self-management, regular telephone contact, referral to a physical therapist, aerobic, muscle strengthening and water-based exercises, weight reduction, walking aids, knee braces, footwear and insoles, thermal modalities, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and acupuncture. Eight recommendations cover pharmacological modalities of treatment including acetaminophen, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) non-selective and selective oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), topical NSAIDs and capsaicin, intra-articular injections of corticosteroids and hyaluronates, glucosamine and/or chondroitin sulphate for symptom relief; glucosamine sulphate, chondroitin sulphate and diacerein for possible structure-modifying effects and the use of opioid analgesics for the treatment of refractory pain. There are recommendations covering five surgical modalities: total joint replacements, unicompartmental knee replacement, osteotomy and joint preserving surgical procedures; joint lavage and arthroscopic debridement in knee OA, and joint fusion as a salvage procedure when joint replacement had failed. Strengths of recommendation and 95% CIs are provided.

Conclusion

Twenty-five carefully worded recommendations have been generated based on a critical appraisal of existing guidelines, a systematic review of research evidence and the consensus opinions of an international, multidisciplinary group of experts. The recommendations may be adapted for use in different countries or regions according to the availability of treatment modalities and SOR for each modality of therapy. These recommendations will be revised regularly following systematic review of new research evidence as this becomes available.

### Does neuromuscular electrical stimulation enhance the effectiveness of an exercise programme in subjects with knee osteoarthritis? A randomized controlled trial [^111xnmC2]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether neuromuscular electrical stimulation applied to the quadriceps femoris muscle will enhance the effectiveness of an exercise programme in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

Design

A randomized trial with parallel intervention treatment groups.

Setting

Outpatient physical therapy clinic.

Subjects

Fifty participants (mean age (SD) 68.9 (7.7) years) with symptomatic idiopathic knee osteoarthritis and radiographic evidence (grade ≥ II Kelgren's classification).

Interventions

Participants were randomized into one of two groups receiving 12 biweekly treatments: An exercise-only group or an exercise combined with neuromuscular electrical stimulation group (biphasic pulses, at 75 Hz and 250 µs phase duration).

Main Measures

Knee pain intensity; maximal voluntary isometric contraction and voluntary activation of the quadriceps femoris muscle; measures of functional performance.

Results

A significant interaction effect (P = 0.01) indicated greater improvement in pain for the electrical stimulation group. The mean (SD) change in pain intensity was from 7.5 ± 2 to 5 ± 2.2 and from 7.4 ± 1.9 to 3.3 ± 2.4 in the exercise and electrical stimulation groups, respectively. A significant treatment effect was also noted for the voluntary activation of the quadriceps femoris, which increased by 22.2% in the electrical stimulation group and by 9.6% in the exercise group (P = 0.045). Significant improvements were observed in both groups in all remaining measures, with no differences between groups.

Conclusions

Electrical stimulation treatment to the quadriceps femoris enhanced the effectiveness of an exercise programme in alleviating pain and improving voluntary activation in patients with knee osteoarthritis, but did not enhance its effect on muscle strength or functional performance.

### How Do nonsurgical interventions improve pain and physical function in people with osteoarthritis? A scoping review of mediation analysis studies [^111etXLP]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

There was no evidence to suggest that changes in dietary intake, pain belief, or physical activity mediated pain relief with diet and physical activity support. Although changes in physical activity may not be sufficient to improve cardiovascular fitness, there is some evidence to suggest that targeting cardiovascular fitness may improve OA outcomes. Specifically, improved cardiovascular fitness mediated improvement in the WOMAC summary score in individuals with knee pain and diabetes mellitus undergoing dietary and exercise intervention. However, as the overall WOMAC summary score accounts pain, physical function, and stiffness, it is unclear whether improved cardiovascular fitness mediates pain, physical function, or stiffness, or indeed all 3 constructs. Cardiovascular fitness as a mediator of symptoms warrants further attention.

Despite a plethora of possible mechanisms explaining the beneficial effects of exercise for knee OA symptoms, few have been evaluated as mediators. Measures of knee flexor muscle perfusion were found to partially mediate pain relief through exercise. Although increased muscle perfusion has been associated with less pain, the effects of exercise were mediated by a constant rather than increased level of muscle perfusion in the knee flexors. Gains in knee extensor strength were found to partially mediate pain relief and improved physical function through strengthening exercise. The dose–response relationship between gains in muscle strength and OA symptom improvement is an area of interest. A clinical trial in knee OA comparing high‐intensity training to low‐intensity training found no difference in knee muscle strength gains or knee pain relief, but observed greater improvement in physical function with low‐intensity training. These observations highlight the potential role of exercise intensity when considering mechanisms of symptom relief. Inflammatory processes likely underlie many of the muscular adaptations in response to exercise. For example, various inflammatory cytokines are reduced systemically and at the local tissue (e.g. muscle, synovial fluid) level with aerobic exercise regimes, and these changes can be accompanied with less pain. Notably, physical inactivity leads to weight gain and visceral adipose accumulation, which is a potent source of inflammatory factors. A reduction in adipose tissue and, consequently, adiposity‐related inflammation is another likely avenue via which exercise mediates improved symptoms. Finally, reduced knee pain and increased self‐efficacy (stair climb) was shown to mediate stair climbing performance (i.e. improved time to climb a set of stairs) in a multimediator model that compared groups receiving aerobic and resistance exercise to controls. Taken together, the mechanisms explaining the effects of exercise and prescription (intensity, type, frequency) on knee OA symptoms remain unclear.

### Land-based exercise for osteoarthritis of the knee: a metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials [^116RrhWJ]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if clinical guidelines recommending therapeutic exercise for people with knee osteoarthritis (OA) are supported by rigorous scientific evidence. To explore whether the magnitude of treatment benefit reported in randomized controlled trials (RCT) is associated with exercise dosage or study methodology.

Methods

We conducted a metaanalysis of RCT comparing some form of land-based therapeutic exercise with a nonexercise group using pain and self-reported physical function outcomes.

Results

The 32 included studies provided data on almost 3800 participants. Metaanalysis revealed a beneficial treatment effect: standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.40 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 0.50] for knee pain; SMD 0.37 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.49) for physical function. While the pooled beneficial effects of the 9 RCT evaluating exercise programs providing fewer than 12 direct supervision occasions or the 9 RCT judged to have a low risk of bias remained significant and clinically relevant, the magnitude of treatment benefit pooled from these RCT was significantly smaller than the comparator group (12 or more supervision occasions, moderate to high risk of bias, respectively). The mode of treatment delivery (individual treatments, exercise classes, home program) was not significantly associated with the magnitude of treatment benefit.

Conclusion

There is evidence that land-based therapeutic exercise has at least short-term benefit in terms of reduced knee pain and physical disability for people with knee OA. The magnitude of the treatment effect was significantly associated with the number of direct supervision occasions provided and study methodology (assessor blinding, adequate allocation concealment).

### Exercise for lower limb osteoarthritis: systematic review incorporating trial sequential analysis and network meta-analysis [^115MYgyW]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

When we applied trial sequential analysis to determine the reliability and conclusiveness of evidence for the effectiveness of exercise interventions over no exercise control, it is clear that as of the year 2002 there was firm evidence of the effectiveness of exercise interventions for pain relief and improvement in function in patients with lower limb osteoarthritis. The totality of evidence, although largely based on trials in knee osteoarthritis shows that further trials of exercise versus no exercise are unlikely to overturn this positive result.

Furthermore, the network meta-analysis showed that there is no significant difference in effect estimates between different types of exercise interventions, which could be partly explained by the small number of studies for several pairwise comparisons. However, our data support better results for some exercise interventions. Based on relative effect estimates and cumulative ranking, interventions combining strengthening with flexibility and aerobic exercise (either land or water based) seemed to be the most effective intervention when we considered measures of both pain and function in lower limb osteoarthritis and was the only exercise intervention significantly more effective than no exercise control for both pain and function. The cumulative ranking obtained by the network meta-analysis cannot be considered as conclusive because it was impaired by the lack of significant differences among the exercise interventions. For example, aquatic flexibility plus strengthening exercises occupy the first rank position (81%) for pain but did not show superiority over any of the other exercise interventions. The lack of significant differences between different types of exercise interventions, however, might be because of the small number of studies contributing evidence to several comparisons in the network.

Study strengths and limitations

Our study has several strengths and limitations. We performed a comprehensive search of several databases and sources to identify eligible trials, with no language restriction. We reduced potential bias in the conduct of this review by having pairs of reviewers independently scan through the search output, extract data, classify interventions, and assess the methodological quality of each trial. Though our review uniquely aimed to determine if and when sufficient evidence for exercise interventions had been accrued, repeated meta-analysis with accumulating trial data can lead to false positive findings (random errors) if multiple testing is not accounted for. To minimise random error, we calculated an information size (that is, required meta-analysis sample size) as large as that of an adequately powered trial and applied trial sequential analysis to the meta-analysis. The results of trial sequential analysis can therefore also support decisions regarding the need for and feasibility of future trials.

### Structured home-based exercise programme and concentric versus eccentric-based stair training programme for pain and function in knee osteoarthritis: a two-phase, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial protocol [^111VFaux]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Treatment options for knee OA include surgical, pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods. Surgical procedures are inherently risky, and long-term medication raises the possibility of side effects. One important non-pharmacological strategy that the Osteoarthritis Research Society International recommends is an exercise programme that is crucial and frequently effective in enhancing the overall functional ability of knee OA individuals, aiming to manage symptoms by improving knee range of motion, muscle strength, functional mobility and balance. As seen during the COVID-19 epidemic, there may be restrictions on clinic-based exercise. However, home-based exercise programmes (HEP) are a more affordable option that also improves accessibility and decreases clinic visits. In previous studies, HEP is designed to include stretching, strengthening, aerobics and various traditional exercises. But postintervention effectiveness of exercise on pain and physical function in patients with knee OA decreases over time. However, incorporating additional exercise programmes after the initial intervention may enhance the long-term effectiveness. The most recent international guidelines recommend muscle-strengthening exercises, which should be included in managing knee OA because of evidence from research demonstrating its long-term efficacy. Numerous studies have shown that strengthening exercise improves psychological health, reduces pain and maintains cartilage integrity. Furthermore, it could enhance the lower limb muscles' ability to absorb shock during walking, enhancing functional performance. Besides, various strengthening exercises, such as isometric, concentric and eccentric, are commonly applied therapeutic interventions for managing people with knee OA. Numerous research studies focus on the effectiveness of concentric and eccentric exercises in increasing muscle strength. However, there is still an ongoing debate on the comparative effectiveness of concentric and eccentric exercise and which kind of exercise is more beneficial for improving functional performance significantly. Although the use of eccentric contractions in muscle-strengthening exercises has gained prominence over the past few years, there is not enough data to prove that this method is better than the others in the research. Considering these limitations, to ensure the long-term effectiveness of knee OA treatments, we developed an efficient and simple-to-implement HEP. We executed a comparative study of two evidence-based strengthening exercise programmes. If successful, the unique concentric and eccentric exercise regimen reported in this research may be easily incorporated into other home-based rehabilitation techniques. No study has examined the effects of concentric and eccentric workouts in this manner for individuals with knee OA. Intending to bridge this gap, this study aims to develop an exercise programme for stair training that combines HEP with both concentric and eccentric aspects. Concentric-based stair training programme (CSTP) and eccentric-based stair training programme (ESTP), particularly through ascending and descending stair training, have shown distinct benefits for muscle function and strength in older people, which may also play a significant role in managing other chronic conditions like knee OA. This finding on stair training methods in older people has motivated our approach to establishing a long-term physical wellness programme for knee OA management that is more accessible, sustainable and efficient.

### Exercise for osteoarthritis of the hip or knee [^115vTttB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Biomechanical factors, such as reduced muscle strength and joint mal-alignment, have an important role in the initiation and progression of osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee. Currently, there is no known cure for OA, however, disease-related factors, such as impaired muscle function and reduced fitness, are potentially amenable to therapeutic exercise.

Objectives

To determine whether land-based therapeutic exercise is beneficial for people with OA of the hip or knee in terms of reduced joint pain, improved physical function and/or the patient's global assessment of therapeutic effectiveness.

Search Strategy

Five databases (the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group Trials Register, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PEDro) were searched up until November 2002.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials comparing some form of land-based therapeutic exercise (as opposed to exercises conducted in the water) with a non-exercise group.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. All analyses were conducted on continuous outcomes.

Main Results

Only 2 studies totaling about 100 participants, could potentially provide data on people with OA of the hip. However, for OA of the knee, 17 included studies provided data on 2562 participants. For pain, combining the results revealed a beneficial treatment effect (standardised mean difference) of.39 (95% confidence interval (CI).30 -.47) while for self-reported physical function a beneficial treatment effect of.31 (95% CI.23 -.39). Group format programs appeared to be as effective as treatments provided on a one-to-one basis. The results were sensitive to various aspects of study design methodology.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Land-based therapeutic exercise was shown to reduce pain and improve physical function for people with OA of the knee. There were insufficient data to provide useful guidelines on optimal exercise type or dosage. Supervised exercise classes appeared to be as beneficial as treatments provided on a one-to-one basis.

### Lifestyle interventions for knee pain in overweight and obese adults aged ≥ 45: economic evaluation of randomised controlled trial [^115k113b]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Nearly half of people aged > 50 report having knee pain at some point in the past year, and, of these, a third report consulting their general practitioner with regard to their knee pain. Previous economic evaluations for people with knee pain have estimated only the cost effectiveness of different exercise programmes and have not focused on those who are overweight. The importance of such an evaluation was highlighted by a recent study that found that there was an early reliance on pharmacological treatments at the expense of non-pharmacological treatments such as weight loss, exercise, and the provision of written advice. This occurred despite the fact that these three treatments have been recommended as first line treatments for people with knee pain.

A previous study evaluated a weight reduction programmeas weight loss has been shown to be associated with an improvement in the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis, of which pain is the principal feature. Indeed, it has been estimated that between a quarter and a half of all knee osteoarthritis might be prevented by eliminating obesity. The value of a quadriceps strengthening exercise programme has also been estimated as there is evidence that quadriceps weakness is associated with disability and pain in patients with knee osteoarthritisand that a home based exercise programme can help improve self reported knee pain and function.

We investigated the cost effectiveness of four interventions designed to alleviate knee pain in overweight and obese adults.

### Consensus guidelines on interventional therapies for knee pain (STEP guidelines) from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^116Ve6rv]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Knee pain is second only to the back as the most commonly reported area of pain in the human body. With an overall prevalence of 46.2%, its impact on disability, lost productivity, and cost on healthcare cannot be overlooked. Due to the pervasiveness of knee pain in the general population, there are no shortages of treatment options available for addressing the symptoms. Ranging from physical therapy and pharmacologic agents to interventional pain procedures to surgical options, practitioners have a wide array of options to choose from - unfortunately, there is no consensus on which treatments are "better" and when they should be offered in comparison to others. While it is generally accepted that less invasive treatments should be offered before more invasive ones, there is a lack of agreement on the order in which the less invasive are to be presented. In an effort to standardize the treatment of this extremely prevalent pathology, the authors present an all-encompassing set of guidelines on the treatment of knee pain based on an extensive literature search and data grading for each of the available alternative that will allow practitioners the ability to compare and contrast each option.

### Aquatic exercise for the treatment of knee and hip osteoarthritis [^111DgYjE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease characterized by joint pain, tenderness, and limitation of movement. At present, no cure is available. Thus only treatment of the person's symptoms and treatment to prevent further development of the disease are possible. Clinical trials indicate that aquatic exercise may have advantages for people with osteoarthritis. This is an update of a published Cochrane review.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of aquatic exercise for people with knee or hip osteoarthritis, or both, compared to no intervention.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 28 April 2015: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2014), MEDLINE (from 1949), EMBASE (from 1980), CINAHL (from 1982), PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database), and Web of Science (from 1945). There was no language restriction.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled clinical trials of aquatic exercise compared to a control group (e.g. usual care, education, social attention, telephone call, waiting list for surgery) of participants with knee or hip osteoarthritis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included trials. We analysed the pooled results using standardized mean difference (SMD) values.

Main Results

Nine new trials met the inclusion criteria and we excluded two earlier included trials. Thus the number of participants increased from 800 to 1190 and the number of included trials increased from six to 13. Most participants were female (75%), with an average age of 68 years and a body mass index (BMI) of 29.4. Osteoarthritis duration was 6.7 years, with a great variation of the included participants. The mean aquatic exercise duration was 12 weeks. We found 12 trials at low to unclear risk of bias for all domains except blinding of participants and personnel. They showed that aquatic exercise caused a small short term improvement compared to control in pain (SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.15; 12 trials, 1076 participants) and disability (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.17; 12 trials, 1059 participants). Ten trials showed a small effect on quality of life (QoL) (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.01; 10 trials, 971 participants). These effects on pain and disability correspond to a five point lower (95% CI three to eight points lower) score on mean pain and mean disability compared to the control group (scale 0 to 100), and a seven point higher (95% CI 0 to 13 points higher) score on mean QoL compared with control group (scale 0 to 100). No included trials performed a radiographic evaluation. No serious adverse events were reported in the included trials with relation to aquatic exercise.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate quality evidence that aquatic exercise may have small, short-term, and clinically relevant effects on patient-reported pain, disability, and QoL in people with knee and hip OA. The conclusions of this review update does not change those of the previous published version of this Cochrane review.

### Consensus guidelines on interventional therapies for knee pain (STEP guidelines) from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^115nQ3mU]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Knee pain is second only to the back as the most commonly reported area of pain in the human body. With an overall prevalence of 46.2%, its impact on disability, lost productivity, and cost on healthcare cannot be overlooked. Due to the pervasiveness of knee pain in the general population, there are no shortages of treatment options available for addressing the symptoms. Ranging from physical therapy and pharmacologic agents to interventional pain procedures to surgical options, practitioners have a wide array of options to choose from – unfortunately, there is no consensus on which treatments are "better" and when they should be offered in comparison to others. While it is generally accepted that less invasive treatments should be offered before more invasive ones, there is a lack of agreement on the order in which the less invasive are to be presented. In an effort to standardize the treatment of this extremely prevalent pathology, the authors present an all-encompassing set of guidelines on the treatment of knee pain based on an extensive literature search and data grading for each of the available alternative that will allow practitioners the ability to compare and contrast each option.

### Trunk, hip and knee exercise programs for pain relief, functional performance and muscle strength in patellofemoral pain: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112BVHvo]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Previous research suggests that muscle strength exercise is the most effective rehabilitation methods in patients with patellofemoral pain (PFP). This systematic review with meta-analysis compared the effects of Hip&Knee, Hip-only and Knee-only exercise programs on pain relief, muscle strength, and functional performance in patients with PFP.

Methods

Literature searches of PubMed, PEDro and CINAHL databases revealed twenty-one studies included in the final descriptive review, thirteen of which were included in the meta-analysis. Data extraction included baseline and post-intervention means and standard deviations of all eligible outcome measures both for the intervention and control groups, participants baseline demographics and intervention characteristics.

Results

The results showed that Hip&Knee and Hip-only exercise programs were comparatively effective, while the Knee-only exercise programs proved to be inferior to the above-mentioned approaches. The Hip&Knee exercise programs showed the greatest pain relief (mean difference = -1.71 (-3.11, -0.30); p = 0.02; I² = 96%) and functional improvement (standardized mean difference = 1.28 (0.45, 2.12); p = 0.003; I² = 84%), although the subgroup analysis did not show any significant difference compared to Hip-only exercise programs (p > 0.05).

Conclusion

Overall, Hip&Knee exercise programs appear to reduce pain and improve function more than other exercise programs and could be used as a primary rehabilitation approach in patients with PFP. However, the difference between the subgroups in most outcome measures suggests that Hip&Knee exercise programs are no more effective than Hip-only exercise programs.

### Exercise for treating patellofemoral pain syndrome [^114tZnEF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a common knee problem, which particularly affects adolescents and young adults. PFPS, which is characterised by retropatellar (behind the kneecap) or peripatellar (around the kneecap) pain, is often referred to as anterior knee pain. The pain mostly occurs when load is put on the knee extensor mechanism when climbing stairs, squatting, running, cycling or sitting with flexed knees. Exercise therapy is often prescribed for this condition.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of exercise therapy aimed at reducing knee pain and improving knee function for people with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (May 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2014, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 2014 Week 20), PEDro (to June 2014), CINAHL (1982 to May 2014) and AMED (1985 to May 2014), trial registers (to June 2014) and conference abstracts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effect of exercise therapy on pain, function and recovery in adolescents and adults with patellofemoral pain syndrome. We included comparisons of exercise therapy versus control (e.g. no treatment) or versus another non-surgical therapy; or of different exercises or exercise programmes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials based on pre-defined inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Where appropriate, we pooled data using either fixed-effect or random-effects methods. We selected the following seven outcomes for summarising the available evidence: pain during activity (short-term: ≤ 3 months); usual pain (short-term); pain during activity (long-term: > 3 months); usual pain (long-term); functional ability (short-term); functional ability (long-term); and recovery (long-term).

Main Results

In total, 31 heterogeneous trials including 1690 participants with patellofemoral pain are included in this review. There was considerable between-study variation in patient characteristics (e.g. activity level) and diagnostic criteria for study inclusion (e.g. minimum duration of symptoms) and exercise therapy. Eight trials, six of which were quasi-randomised, were at high risk of selection bias. We assessed most trials as being at high risk of performance bias and detection bias, which resulted from lack of blinding. The included studies, some of which contributed to more than one comparison, provided evidence for the following comparisons: exercise therapy versus control (10 trials); exercise therapy versus other conservative interventions (e.g. taping; eight trials evaluating different interventions); and different exercises or exercise programmes. The latter group comprised: supervised versus home exercises (two trials); closed kinetic chain (KC) versus open KC exercises (four trials); variants of closed KC exercises (two trials making different comparisons); other comparisons of other types of KC or miscellaneous exercises (five trials evaluating different interventions); hip and knee versus knee exercises (seven trials); hip versus knee exercises (two studies); and high- versus low-intensity exercises (one study). There were no trials testing exercise medium (land versus water) or duration of exercises. Where available, the evidence for each of seven main outcomes for all comparisons was of very low quality, generally due to serious flaws in design and small numbers of participants. This means that we are very unsure about the estimates. The evidence for the two largest comparisons is summarised here. Exercise versus control. Pooled data from five studies (375 participants) for pain during activity (short-term) favoured exercise therapy: mean difference (MD) -1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.39 to -0.54. The CI included the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 1.3 (scale 0 to 10), indicating the possibility of a clinically important reduction in pain. The same finding applied for usual pain (short-term; two studies, 41 participants), pain during activity (long-term; two studies, 180 participants) and usual pain (long-term; one study, 94 participants). Pooled data from seven studies (483 participants) for functional ability (short-term) also favoured exercise therapy; standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.10, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.63. Re-expressed in terms of the Anterior Knee Pain Score (AKPS; 0 to 100), this result (estimated MD 12.21 higher, 95% CI 6.44 to 18.09 higher) included the MCID of 10.0, indicating the possibility of a clinically important improvement in function. The same finding applied for functional ability (long-term; three studies, 274 participants). Pooled data (two studies, 166 participants) indicated that, based on the 'recovery' of 250 per 1000 in the control group, 88 more (95% CI 2 fewer to 210 more) participants per 1000 recovered in the long term (12 months) as a result of exercise therapy. Hip plus knee versus knee exercises. Pooled data from three studies (104 participants) for pain during activity (short-term) favoured hip and knee exercise: MD -2.20, 95% CI -3.80 to -0.60; the CI included a clinically important effect. The same applied for usual pain (short-term; two studies, 46 participants). One study (49 participants) found a clinically important reduction in pain during activity (long-term) for hip and knee exercise. Although tending to favour hip and knee exercises, the evidence for functional ability (short-term; four studies, 174 participants; and long-term; two studies, 78 participants) and recovery (one study, 29 participants) did not show that either approach was superior.

Authors' Conclusions

This review has found very low quality but consistent evidence that exercise therapy for PFPS may result in clinically important reduction in pain and improvement in functional ability, as well as enhancing long-term recovery. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine the best form of exercise therapy and it is unknown whether this result would apply to all people with PFPS. There is some very low quality evidence that hip plus knee exercises may be more effective in reducing pain than knee exercise alone. Further randomised trials are warranted but in order to optimise research effort and engender the large multicentre randomised trials that are required to inform practice, these should be preceded by research that aims to identify priority questions and attain agreement and, where practical, standardisation regarding diagnostic criteria and measurement of outcome.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of exercise modalities in knee osteoarthritis: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111m8tJ6]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Comparisons with previous studies

Previously, Uthman et alused network meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of various exercise therapies on osteoarthritis. Following this, Goh et alstandardised and broadened the exercises examined in their study and added new outcome measures (performance and quality of life). We compared our findings with the most recent review of exercise interventions for osteoarthritis, conducted by Goh et al in 2019. The review by Goh and colleagues comprised 103 randomised controlled trials that assessed five exercise intervention regimens for osteoarthritis. Their findings suggested that aerobic exercise was the most beneficial for pain and performance, which is consistent with our conclusion. The review also found that strengthening and flexibility exercises had a moderate effect on various outcomes, while mixed exercise was least effective for all outcomes.

Our approach differs substantially to that of Goh and colleagues, allowing a more in-depth analysis of the results. Firstly, Goh et al combined outcome indicators taken at various time points and used these together to reflect on the therapeutic impact of exercise. A potential problem with this approach is that the follow-up time varied greatly among the included studies, but the review used the latest available data point for analysis regardless of the duration of follow-up. In contrast, we stratified the results into three time periods, representing the short term, mid-term, and long term outcomes at approximately four, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment, respectively.

Secondly, we used the most recent version of the risk of bias tool (RoB 2), where the evaluation indicators were more precise and unambiguous than the earlier version (RoB 1). The use of RoB 2 yielded more objective evaluations, owing to the standardised questions and response options of RoB 2. Additionally, we used the GRADE system for a rigorous assessment of certainty of evidence, including direct and indirect evidence, and final network evidence. Thus, we may be more confident in the dependability of our data and reliability of our final assessment.

Substantial evidence has accrued since Goh et al's review in 2019. Our analysis included studies published between 2019 and 2024, almost doubling the number of randomised controlled trials included in this research. We did not find any high quality network meta-analyses comparing different exercise programmes for knee osteoarthritis published since 2019; therefore, to the best of our understanding, the present analysis is the most comprehensive and up to date.

### EULAR recommendations for the non-pharmacological core management of hip and knee osteoarthritis: 2023 update [^116rufGU]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for knee osteoarthritis, more specifically with respect to physical therapy, EULAR 2024 guidelines recommend to offer an exercise program (such as strength, aerobic, flexibility, or neuromotor) of adequate dosage in all patients with knee OA, with progression tailored to the patient's physical function, preferences, and available services.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the role of exercise in the management of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee – the MOVE consensus [^115VpHy1]. Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Exercise is an effective and commonly prescribed intervention for lower limb osteoarthritis (OA). Many unanswered questions remain, however, concerning the practical delivery of exercise therapy. We have produced evidence-based recommendations to guide health-care practitioners.

Methods

A multidisciplinary guideline development group was formed from representatives of professional bodies to which OA is of relevance and other interested parties. Each participant contributed up to 10 propositions describing key clinical points regarding exercise therapy for OA of the hip or knee. Ten final recommendations were agreed by the Delphi technique. The research evidence for each was determined. A literature search was undertaken in the Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, PEDro, CINAHL and Cochrane databases. The methodological quality of each retrieved publication was assessed. Outcome data were abstracted and effect sizes calculated. The evidence for each recommendation was assessed and expert consensus highlighted by the allocation of two categories: (1) strength of evidence and (2) strength of recommendation.

Results

The first round of the Delphi process produced 123 propositions. This was reduced to 10 after four rounds. These related to aerobic and strengthening exercise, group versus home exercise, adherence, contraindications and predictors of response. The literature search identified 910 articles; 57 intervention trials relating to knee OA, 9 to hip OA and 73 to adherence. The evidence to support each proposition is presented.

Conclusion

These are the first recommendations for exercise in hip and knee OA to clearly differentiate research evidence and expert opinion. Gaps in the literature are identified and issues requiring further study highlighted.

### Comparative effectiveness of tai chi versus physical therapy for knee osteoarthritis: a randomized trial [^113Muyxs]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Few remedies effectively treat long-term pain and disability from knee osteoarthritis. Studies suggest that Tai Chi alleviates symptoms, but no trials have directly compared Tai Chi with standard therapies for osteoarthritis.

Objective

To compare Tai Chi with standard physical therapy for patients with knee osteoarthritis.

Design

Randomized, 52-week, single-blind comparative effectiveness trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01258985).

Setting

An urban tertiary care academic hospital.

Patients

204 participants with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (mean age, 60 years; 70% women; 53% white).

Intervention

Tai Chi (2 times per week for 12 weeks) or standard physical therapy (2 times per week for 6 weeks, followed by 6 weeks of monitored home exercise).

Measurements

The primary outcome was Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included physical function, depression, medication use, and quality of life.

Results

At 12 weeks, the WOMAC score was substantially reduced in both groups (Tai Chi, 167 points [95% CI, 145 to 190 points]; physical therapy, 143 points [CI, 119 to 167 points]). The between-group difference was not significant (24 points [CI, -10 to 58 points]). Both groups also showed similar clinically significant improvement in most secondary outcomes, and the benefits were maintained up to 52 weeks. Of note, the Tai Chi group had significantly greater improvements in depression and the physical component of quality of life. The benefit of Tai Chi was consistent across instructors. No serious adverse events occurred.

Limitation

Patients were aware of their treatment group assignment, and the generalizability of the findings to other settings remains undetermined.

Conclusion

Tai Chi produced beneficial effects similar to those of a standard course of physical therapy in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis.

### Core training for pain management and functional improvement in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116ze8L8]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of core strengthening exercises on pain, mobility, and lower limb muscle strength in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

Design

Six databases were searched from inception until August 11, 2023. Pain, function, and muscle strength-related outcomes were extracted and the quality of the studies was assessed using the PEDro scale and the level of evidence was assessed using the GRADE.

Results

Nineteen studies involving 1138 patients were included. Very low-grade evidence supported the short-term pain-relieving effect of core training (standardized mean difference = −0.60, 95% confidence interval [−0.95, −0.25]), high-grade evidence supported the short-term functional improvement effects of core training (weighted mean difference = 3.61, 95% confidence interval [1.44, 5.78]), which was similarly significant within 3–12 mos of follow-up. The results of the subgroup analyses suggested that hip-knee training was most advantageous in relieving pain and enhancing motor function.

Conclusions

Although training that includes trunk core is clearly superior to knee strengthening alone, the effectiveness of hip-knee training, which is also a core training program for pain and function, is more pronounced. The available evidence supports that hip-knee training is the most valuable treatment option for patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

### Yoga or strengthening exercise for knee osteoarthritis: a randomized clinical trial [^1123rVC6]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

There is limited evidence on the comparative effectiveness of different exercise modalities, such as yoga and strengthening exercises, for managing knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of yoga vs strengthening exercise for reducing knee pain over 12 weeks in patients with knee OA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This single-center, assessor-blinded (for nonpatient-reported outcomes), parallel-arm, active-controlled, superiority randomized clinical trial included adults aged 40 years or older with knee OA and knee pain levels of 40 or higher on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) in Southern Tasmania, Australia. Participants were recruited from April 2021 to June 2022, and follow-up was completed in December 2022. Data were analyzed from May 2023 to July 2024.

Interventions

Participants were randomized 1:1 to the yoga and strengthening exercise groups. Both groups attended 2 supervised and 1 home-based session per week for 12 weeks followed by 3 unsupervised home-based sessions per week for weeks 13 to 24.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the between-group difference in VAS score over 12 weeks assessed using a range of 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst possible pain) with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 10 mm. Secondary outcomes included knee pain over 24 weeks; Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) knee pain, function, and stiffness; patient global assessment; Osteoarthritis Research Society International-Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials response; physical performance measures; leg muscle strength; health-related quality of life assessed via the Assessment of Quality of Life-8 Dimensions (AQol-8D) utility score; depression assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9; and neuropathic pain assessment over 12 and 24 weeks. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle.

Results

In total, 117 participants were randomized to the yoga (n = 58) or strengthening exercise (n = 59) program. Baseline characteristics of the participants were similar, with a mean (SD) age of 62.5 (8.3) years, and 85 participants (72.6%) were female. The mean (SD) baseline VAS knee pain score of 53.8 (16.0) indicated moderate knee pain. Over 12 weeks, the between-group mean difference in VAS knee pain change was -1.1 mm (95% CI, -7.8 to 5.7 mm), which was not statistically significant but remained within the prespecified noninferiority margin. Of 27 secondary outcomes assessed over 12 and 24 weeks, 7 were statistically significant in favor of yoga. The yoga group showed modestly greater improvements than the strengthening exercise group (between-group differences) over 24 weeks for WOMAC pain (-44.5 mm [95% CI, -70.7 to -18.3 mm]), WOMAC function (-139 mm [95% CI, -228.3 to -49.7 mm]), WOMAC stiffness (-17.6 mm [95% CI, -30.9 to -4.3 mm]), patient global assessment (-7.6 mm [95% CI, -15.1 to -0.2 mm]), and 40-m fast-paced walk test (1.8 [95% CI, 0.4–3.2]). In addition, the yoga group had a modestly greater improvement than the strengthening exercise for depression at 12 weeks (between-group difference in PHQ-9 score, -1.1 [95% CI, -1.9 to -0.2]) and quality of life at 24 weeks (between-group difference in AQoL-8D score, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.0 to 0.07]). Adverse events were similar in both groups and mild.

Conclusion and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, yoga did not significantly reduce knee pain compared with strengthening exercises. However, yoga was found to be noninferior to strengthening exercises, suggesting that integrating yoga as an alternative or complementary exercise option in clinical practice may help in managing knee OA.

### Exercise in knee osteoarthritis: do treatment outcomes relate to bone marrow lesions? A randomized trial [^117Qne5R]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Exercise is effective for reducing knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain but effect sizes vary widely. Moreover, not all knee OA patients perceive beneficial effects. Tailoring specific exercises to subgroups of knee OA patients may increase effectivity. Bone marrow lesions (BMLs) have been suggested as a criterion to define such subgroups. This study aimed to investigate whether BMLs' presence/absence is related to treatment outcomes in a group of knee OA patients who exercised for 18 weeks.

Methods

Subjects with symptomatic knee OA started a strength or walking exercise program. BMLs' presence at baseline was assessed. Pain was assessed before and after the intervention with the intermittent and constant osteoarthritis pain (ICOAP) questionnaire. Also the global perceived effect (GPE) on the patient's complaints was rated.

Results

Thirty-five patients (strength (N = 17) and walking (N = 18)) were analyzed for BMLs. BMLs were present in 25 (71%) knees. Five (14%) patients dropped out and 19 (54%) improved (GPE ≥ 5). All dropouts had BMLs, but no difference was seen between dropouts and retainers (p > 0.05). Pain scores did not differ between intervention groups (p > 0.05) or between patients with BMLs and without BMLs (p > 0.05).

Conclusions

Pain scores and GPE was not different between knee OA patients with and without baseline BMLs in this sample. Implications for Rehabilitation Both walking and strengthening exercises are effective means of improving pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis. In a relatively small sample, this study shows that the presence or absence of subchondral bone marrow lesions, as seen on magnetic resonance images, is not related to treatment outcomes.

### Trunk, hip and knee exercise programs for pain relief, functional performance and muscle strength in patellofemoral pain: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116NHqvR]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of exercise programs for trunk, hip or knee muscles on pain relief, functional improvements and muscle strength in patients with PFP. The meta-analysis included studies with at least one exercise program and a control group with or without exercise interventions. Following the search strategy and according to the inclusion criteria, we included twenty-one studies in the systematic review. After further assessment, we included thirteen studies in the meta-analysis. Eight studies were not included in the meta-analysis due an absence of comparative groups or specific comparative groups. Regardless, they were included in the systematic review. The search strategy did not result in studies specifically investigating trunk muscle exercise programs in patients with PFP, although two studies investigated the addition of trunk exercises on Hip&Knee exercise programs. Previous reviews have addressed the question of the effectiveness of exercise programs that focus on muscle groups proximal to the knee in terms of pain, function or strength in patients with PFP. However, these reviews either included passive interventions or showed a high heterogeneity in the protocol type, used methods and outcome measures.

The main findings of this systematic review with meta-analysis are: 1) Hip only or Hip&Knee exercise programs contribute to pain relief more than Knee only exercise programs, 2) Hip only or Hip&Knee exercise programs improve function more than Knee only exercise program, 3) there is no statistically significant difference between Hip&Knee and Hip only exercise programs in any of the outcome measures, 4) our search strategy did not discover studies investigating foot and ankle muscle exercise programs without additional taping or bracing on patients with PFP. Overall, hip exercise with or without accompanying knee exercise seemed to be the most effective approach for pain relief, function gains and hip muscle strength. The small number of comparable studies are an important limitation of this review, particularly regarding the exercise program design and strength outcome measures. Comparisons between different exercise programs were limited and, for some outcome measures, not possible due to high heterogeneity in terms of the studied muscle groups and different intervention groups.

### Does land-based exercise-therapy improve physical activity in people with knee osteoarthritis? A systematic review with meta-analyses [^117AcNhM]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary Objective

Investigate the effects of land-based exercise-therapy on physical activity in people with knee osteoarthritis (KOA).

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised or quasi-randomised trials investigating land-based exercise-therapy on physical activity, fitness, and general health in people with KOA. We updated a 2013 Cochrane review search on exercise-therapy for KOA in April 2021 and applied the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool 1.0 to included articles. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. GRADE was used to assess certainty of the evidence.

Results

Twenty-eight randomised controlled trials (2,789 participants) evaluating the effects of resistance-training (n = 10), walking (n = 6) and mixed-exercise programs (n = 7) were identified. Low to moderate certainty evidence indicated small increases in physical activity for exercise-therapy compared to non-exercise interventions in the short-term (SMD, 95% CI = 0.29, 0.09 to 0.50), but not the medium- (0.03, -0.11 to 0.18) or long-term (-0.06, -0.34 to 0.22). Low certainty evidence indicated large increases in physical activity for walking programs (0.53, 0.11 to 0.95) and mixed-exercise programs (0.67, 0.37 to 0.97) compared to non-exercise interventions in the short-term. Low certainty evidence indicated moderate and small increases in physical activity for resistance-training combined with education focused on pain coping skills and self-efficacy compared to education alone at medium-term follow-up (0.45, 0.19 to 0.71).

Conclusion

Walking and mixed-exercise, but not resistance-training, may improve physical activity in people with KOA in the short-term. Combining resistance-training with education may increase physical activity in the medium-, but not the long-term, highlighting the potential importance of developing more effective longer-term interventions for people with KOA. Future studies evaluating land-based exercise-therapy are encouraged to include physical activity outcomes and longer-term follow-up to increase the certainty of evidence.

### Hip and knee strengthening is more effective than knee strengthening alone for reducing pain and improving activity in individuals with patellofemoral pain: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^115J2Cky]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Study Design Systematic review with meta-analysis. Background The addition of hip strengthening to knee strengthening for persons with patellofemoral pain has the potential to optimize treatment effects. There is a need to systematically review and pool the current evidence in this area. Objective To examine the efficacy of hip strengthening, associated or not with knee strengthening, to increase strength, reduce pain, and improve activity in individuals with patellofemoral pain. Methods A systematic review of randomized and/or controlled trials was performed. Participants in the reviewed studies were individuals with patellofemoral pain, and the experimental intervention was hip and knee strengthening. Outcome data related to muscle strength, pain, and activity were extracted from the eligible trials and combined in a meta-analysis. Results The review included 14 trials involving 673 participants. Random-effects meta-analyses revealed that hip and knee strengthening decreased pain (mean difference, -3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.6, -1.1) and improved activity (standardized mean difference, 1.4; 95% CI: 0.03, 2.8) compared to no training/placebo. In addition, hip and knee strengthening was superior to knee strengthening alone for decreasing pain (mean difference, -1.5; 95% CI: -2.3, -0.8) and improving activity (standardized mean difference, 0.7; 95% CI: 0.2, 1.3). Results were maintained beyond the intervention period. Meta-analyses showed no significant changes in strength for any of the interventions. Conclusion Hip and knee strengthening is effective and superior to knee strengthening alone for decreasing pain and improving activity in persons with patellofemoral pain; however, these outcomes were achieved without a concurrent change in strength. Level of Evidence Therapy, level 1a-. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2018;48(1):19–31. Epub 15 Oct 2017. doi:10.2519/jospt.2018.7365.

### The ottawa panel clinical practice guidelines for the management of knee osteoarthritis. part one: introduction, and mind-body exercise programs [^114AYSh3]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify effective mind-body exercise programs and provide clinicians and patients with updated, high-quality recommendations concerning non-traditional land-based exercises for knee osteoarthritis.

Methods

A systematic search and adapted selection criteria included comparative controlled trials with mind-body exercise programs for patients with knee osteoarthritis. A panel of experts reached consensus on the recommendations using a Delphi survey. A hierarchical alphabetical grading system (A, B, C+, C, D, D+, D-) was used, based on statistical significance (P < 0.5) and clinical importance (⩾15% improvement).

Results

The four high-quality studies identified demonstrated that various mind-body exercise programs are promising for improving the management of knee osteoarthritis. Hatha Yoga demonstrated significant improvement for pain relief (Grade B) and physical function (Grade C+). Tai Chi Qigong demonstrated significant improvement for quality of life (Grade B), pain relief (Grade C+) and physical function (Grade C+). Sun style Tai Chi gave significant improvement for pain relief (Grade B) and physical function (Grade B).

Conclusion

Mind-body exercises are promising approaches to reduce pain, as well as to improve physical function and quality of life for individuals with knee osteoarthritis.

### Patellofemoral pain [^117Wq3st]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) — limitations and future directions note research gaps and offer practice guidance. The guideline states, "More research is needed to determine whether any long-term differences in pain or PROMs occur in patients with PFP who receive either hip- or knee-targeted exercise therapy", and also that "a standardized approach is needed for future research when delineating either knee- or hip-targeted exercise". In current practice, "clinicians treating PFP are encouraged to use accepted exercise prescription principles, as recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine, to guide exercise prescription targeting the hip and knee, based on individual deficits identified in each patient", and "the treating clinician should assess, consider, and address appropriate neuromotor control, along with muscular endurance, strength, and power". Although "there is little evidence for a validated approach", "the physical therapist is encouraged to use clinical reasoning to target interventions toward individuals when possible, and to use a shared decision-making process during plan-of-care development".

### How Do nonsurgical interventions improve pain and physical function in people with osteoarthritis? A scoping review of mediation analysis studies [^113ymrvU]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Nonsurgical interventions are recommended for osteoarthritis (OA). However, how interventions change pain and physical function is unclear. Therefore, the objectives of this scoping review were to 1) identify what potential mediators of nonsurgical interventions on pain and physical function have been evaluated and 2) summarize the findings according to intervention, joint, and outcome.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus databases. Studies were included if they conducted a mediation analysis on a randomized controlled trial evaluating a nonsurgical intervention on OA of any joint. Outcomes were pain and physical function.

Results

Nine knee OA studies, evaluating diet plus exercise, exercise, unloading shoes, high-expectation communication during acupuncture, and telephone-based weight loss plus exercise were identified. Except for weight loss and self-efficacy, putative mediators (knee muscle perfusion/extensor strength/adduction moment, systemic inflammatory biomarkers, physical activity, dietary intake, and pain beliefs) were evaluated by single studies. Ten mediators partially mediated intervention (diet plus exercise, exercise, high-expectation communication) effects on pain and physical function. Eight mediators were common to pain and function (reduced weight, increased knee extensor strength, and increased self-efficacy). Constant knee flexor muscle perfusion partially mediated exercise effects on pain, and knee pain relief partially mediated exercise effects on function.

Conclusion

In knee OA, some evidence suggests that the benefits of 1) diet and exercise are mediated through changes in body weight, systemic inflammation, and self-efficacy; 2) exercise is mediated through changes in knee muscle strength and self-efficacy; and 3) high-expectation communication style is mediated through changes in self-efficacy.
