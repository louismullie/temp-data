## Question

What is the diagnostic workup for hemochromatosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the diagnostic workup is for hemochromatosis [^111gbAqE] [^112JzsjK] [^1154TQN8] [^116VTxiw]. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about who should be tested and which initial laboratory markers are most informative. Then, I should verify when and how to proceed to HFE genetic testing. Next, I will assess how to confirm iron overload non-invasively versus when to biopsy and how to stage fibrosis. After that, I must evaluate extrahepatic manifestations and decide on HCC surveillance. Finally, I will consider cascade family screening and when to investigate non-HFE forms, while double-checking pitfalls such as secondary hyperferritinemia [^111gbAqE] [^112JzsjK] [^1154TQN8] [^116VTxiw].

> Let me first confirm who warrants evaluation and which initial tests anchor screening; high-risk groups include first-degree relatives of confirmed cases, patients with suggestive symptoms or organ-based clues, and individuals with incidental hyperferritinemia or elevated transferrin saturation, for whom fasting transferrin saturation and serum ferritin should be obtained, with a practical threshold of transferrin saturation ≥ 45% prompting further evaluation and noting ferritin's limited specificity as an acute-phase reactant [^116M9E43] [^112JzsjK] [^112KTP8q] [^112XhX4U].

> Wait, let me verify how to handle the initial abnormalities; if either fasting transferrin saturation is ≥ 45% or ferritin is above the age/sex-adjusted upper limit, I should proceed to HFE genotyping, and although some laboratories do not insist on fasting, I should confirm an elevated transferrin saturation with a repeat fasting sample to minimize false positives before genotyping [^116M9E43] [^112JzsjK] [^115kQREL].

> I need to check the genetic testing strategy and its interpretation; testing should at minimum include p.C282Y and, as a complementary assay, p.H63D, but routine p.S65C is not recommended, and although I might be tempted to say that C282Y homozygosity confirms hemochromatosis, hold on, I should verify that genotype alone is insufficient and must be correlated with biochemical or quantitative evidence of iron overload to make a definitive diagnosis, while recognizing that C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity and H63D homozygosity rarely cause progressive iron overload without cofactors [^113JRzAH] [^112ughp1] [^112JzsjK] [^114hUSfP].

> Next, I should review how to confirm and quantify iron overload; non-contrast MRI with validated T2✱/R2✱ methods is preferred as first-line to estimate hepatic iron concentration and to characterize the distribution pattern of iron (parenchymal liver deposition with relative splenic sparing is typical of hemochromatosis), which reduces the need for liver biopsy in most patients [^111gbAqE] [^1154TQN8] [^116Myf58].

> Hold on, I should verify when liver biopsy still matters; I should consider biopsy when serum ferritin exceeds 1,000 µg/L, when aminotransferases are elevated, when non-invasive assessment is inconclusive, or when there is a need to stage fibrosis or evaluate alternative or coexisting liver diseases, using transient elastography to triage who truly needs a biopsy, with a liver stiffness ≤ 6.4 kPa arguing against advanced fibrosis [^114WENZT] [^1176YutC] [^111YgvZs].

> I will now examine fibrosis staging and cancer surveillance; if advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis is identified by biopsy or elastography, I should initiate hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance every six months with ultrasound, or MRI/CT when ultrasound is technically suboptimal, and I should remember that this surveillance continues regardless of iron depletion status [^112undXG] [^115cci2v] [^113FckxC].

> Let me consider extrahepatic involvement systematically to avoid missing morbidity; I should actively screen for musculoskeletal manifestations such as arthropathy and osteoporosis, endocrine complications such as diabetes and hypogonadism, and cardiac disease including cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias, supported by targeted laboratory and clinical assessments before and during treatment [^111ce1wo] [^113ezoTm].

> I should confirm the approach to family screening since it is pivotal; first-degree relatives of a confirmed proband should undergo both HFE genotyping and iron studies in a single visit, testing the other parent first when assessing children of a proband so that obligate heterozygosity can obviate further testing, and adults with C282Y homozygosity or compound heterozygosity plus elevated ferritin should move to therapy, whereas those with normal ferritin should be monitored annually [^114hUSfP] [^112JzsjK].

> But wait, what if HFE testing is negative or does not explain the phenotype; in young patients with severe iron overload and organ involvement or in non-C282Y cases with confirmed iron loading by MRI or biopsy, I should pursue non-HFE genetic testing for genes such as HJV, HAMP, TFR2, and SLC40A1 via referral pathways and, while results may take time, treatment should not be delayed in a compelling phenotype [^112SQPtX] [^114KaSko] [^112Y6HRo] [^114P7Lc5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions when ferritin is elevated; I need to ensure that common secondary causes such as NAFLD, alcoholic liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis, systemic inflammation, or malignancy are considered and excluded when appropriate, particularly in non-C282Y genotypes where hyperferritinemia is more likely to be multifactorial [^117GZvjU] [^113GN9XZ] [^112KTP8q].

> Let me reconsider the core diagnostic anchors before concluding; a careful stepwise approach that starts with fasting transferrin saturation and ferritin, proceeds to HFE genotyping when either is abnormal, quantifies hepatic iron with MRI as first-line, reserves biopsy for staging or uncertainty, evaluates for organ involvement and institutes HCC surveillance when cirrhosis is present, and extends to cascade family screening and selective non-HFE testing, ensures that we diagnose true hemochromatosis based on phenotype plus genotype rather than genotype alone [^111gbAqE] [^116M9E43] [^1154TQN8] [^112undXG].

---

The hemochromatosis workup begins with **transferrin saturation (TS) and serum ferritin** as initial tests [^112XhX4U], followed by **HFE genetic testing** if TS is elevated or ferritin exceeds the upper limit of normal [^116VTxiw]. If HFE testing is negative but iron overload is confirmed [^112Y6HRo], test for **rare hemochromatosis genes** (HJV, HAMP, TFR2, SLC40A1) [^112SQPtX]. Use **MRI** to quantify hepatic iron and assess fibrosis noninvasively; reserve liver biopsy for cases with ferritin > 1,000 ng/mL, elevated transaminases, or when alternative liver diseases are suspected [^114WENZT]. Evaluate for extrahepatic complications (diabetes, cardiomyopathy, hypogonadism, arthropathy) [^111ce1wo] and screen **first-degree relatives** with iron studies and HFE genotyping [^112JzsjK]. Management includes therapeutic phlebotomy [^111gbAqE], dietary counseling, and HCC surveillance if cirrhosis is present [^112undXG].

---

## Initial clinical assessment

Assess history and perform a physical examination for **fatigue, arthralgia, skin hyperpigmentation, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, hypogonadism**, and **family history of iron overload** [^111ce1wo]. Obtain **fasting morning transferrin saturation** [^116VTxiw] and **serum ferritin** as initial screening laboratory tests [^112XhX4U].

---

## Biochemical criteria for diagnosis

Transferrin saturation (TS) ≥ 45% [^116VTxiw] is highly suggestive of **iron overload** and warrants further evaluation [^112XhX4U]. Elevated **serum ferritin (> 300 ng/mL in men, > 200 ng/mL in women)** [^116VTxiw] indicates increased iron stores [^112XhX4U] but may also rise with inflammation, liver disease, or malignancy [^113GN9XZ].

---

## Genetic testing

Perform **HFE gene testing** for C282Y and H63D mutations [^112XhX4U]. C282Y homozygosity confirms hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) when accompanied by elevated TS and ferritin [^116VTxiw] [^112ughp1]. If HFE testing is negative but iron overload is confirmed, test for **rare hemochromatosis genes (HJV, HAMP, TFR2, SLC40A1)** [^112Y6HRo].

---

## Imaging studies

Use **MRI** to noninvasively quantify hepatic iron concentration (HIC) and assess liver fibrosis. MRI is preferred over liver biopsy for iron quantification. Transient elastography provides noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis, with **liver stiffness ≤ 6.4 kPa** effectively ruling out advanced fibrosis [^111YgvZs].

---

## Indications for liver biopsy

Perform **liver biopsy** when serum ferritin exceeds 1,000 ng/mL [^114WENZT], transaminases are elevated, or alternative liver diseases are suspected [^1176YutC]. Biopsy assesses **hepatic iron concentration [^1176YutC] and fibrosis stage** [^114WENZT].

---

## Evaluation of extrahepatic complications

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Fasting glucose, HbA1c [^111ce1wo].

- **Cardiomyopathy**: ECG, echocardiography, cardiac MRI if indicated [^113ezoTm].

- **Hypogonadism**: Testosterone, LH, FSH [^113ezoTm].

- **Arthropathy**: Clinical assessment, joint imaging if indicated [^111ce1wo].

---

## Family screening

Screen **first-degree relatives** with transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, and HFE genetic testing [^112JzsjK]. This screening targets at-risk relatives [^112JzsjK] [^114hUSfP].

---

## Management and follow-up

- **Therapeutic phlebotomy**: First-line treatment to reduce iron stores [^111gbAqE] [^115VhMbq].

- **Dietary counseling**: Limit alcohol, avoid iron supplements, limit red meat [^114hkGpu] [^11443eCu].

- **HCC surveillance**: Ultrasound every 6 months in patients with cirrhosis [^112undXG] [^115cci2v].

---

The hemochromatosis workup encompasses clinical assessment, biochemical testing, genetic testing, imaging, and evaluation of complications, with management focused on **phlebotomy, diet, and surveillance**.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116VTxiw]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on documentation of increased iron stores, demonstrated by elevated serum ferritin levels, which reflect an increase in hepatic iron content. Hemochromatosis can be further defined genotypically by the familial occurrence of iron overload associated with C282Y homozygosity or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity. Serologic iron markers, such as transferrin saturation (TS) and ferritin, are widely available, leading to the identification of the majority of patients with hemochromatosis while still asymptomatic and without evidence of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis.

There are certain high-risk groups that should be targeted for evaluation. These include individuals with a family history of hemochromatosis, those with suspected organ involvement, and those with incidental detection of biochemical and/or radiological abnormalities suggestive of iron overload. It is generally recommended that all patients with abnormal liver function undergo iron studies as part of their evaluation.

- **Testing and treatment**:
	The initial approach to diagnosis uses indirect markers of iron stores, namely transferrin saturation or unsaturated iron-binding capacity, and serum ferritin. Transferrin saturation is calculated from the ratio of serum iron to total iron-binding capacity. An algorithm can provide further direction regarding testing and treatment for hemochromatosis; it is modified from the version used in the previous AASLD guidelines.

It should be noted that the algorithm outlined in Figure 3 is part of the guidelines but is not included in this text.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemochromatosis, specifically with respect to MRI, the ACG 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining a non-contrast-enhanced MRI in conjunction with software used for estimating hepatic iron concentration. This approach is suggested to noninvasively measure hepatic iron concentration in non-C282Y homozygote individuals with suspected hereditary hemochromatosis.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112BCrPS]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of treatment for HH. One unit of blood contains approximately 200–250 mg of iron, depending on the hemoglobin concentration, and should be removed once or twice per week as tolerated. In patients with HH who may have total body iron stores greater than 30 g, therapeutic phlebotomy may take up to 2–3 years to adequately reduce iron stores. Each phlebotomy should be preceded by the measurement of hematocrit or hemoglobin to avoid reducing the hematocrit/hemoglobin to less than 80% of the starting value.

Transferrin saturation (TS) usually remains elevated until iron stores are depleted, whereas ferritin, which may initially fluctuate, eventually begins to fall progressively with iron mobilization and reflects the depletion of iron stores. Serum ferritin analysis should be performed after every 10–12 phlebotomies (approximately every 3 months) in the initial stages of treatment. It can be confidently assumed that excess iron stores have been mobilized when the serum ferritin drops to between 50 and 100 μg/L. As the target range of 50–100 μg/L is approached, testing may be repeated more frequently to preempt the development of overt iron deficiency. It is not necessary for patients to achieve iron deficiency; in fact, this should be avoided.

Phlebotomy can be stopped at the point at which iron stores are depleted, and the patient should be assessed to determine whether they require maintenance phlebotomy. For reasons that are unclear, not all patients with HH reaccumulate iron, and, accordingly, they may not need maintenance phlebotomy.

### Recognition and management of hereditary hemochromatosis [^116j2dEx]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common inherited single-gene disorder among people of northern European descent. It is characterized by increased intestinal absorption of iron, which leads to deposition of iron in multiple organs. Previously, the classic presentation included combined diabetes mellitus, cutaneous hyperpigmentation, and cirrhosis. However, hereditary hemochromatosis is increasingly diagnosed at an earlier, less symptomatic stage. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, laboratory, and pathological findings, including elevated serum transferrin saturation. Life expectancy is usually normal if phlebotomy is initiated before the development of cirrhosis or diabetes mellitus. Hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with mutations in the HFE gene. Between 60 and 93 percent of patients with the disorder are homozygous for a mutation designated C282Y. The HFE gene test is useful in confirming the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis, screening adult family members of patients with HFE mutations, and resolving ambiguities concerning iron overload.

### Strategies for early diagnosis of haemochromatosis [^1146pthS]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Genetic haemochromatosis is one of the most frequent inborn errors of metabolism. Only patients with early non-cirrhotic haemochromatosis treated by phlebotomies have a normal life expectancy. The present review analyzes strategies for early diagnosis of haemochromatosis using the Medline database and data from a large cohort of patients with haemochromatosis.

The still widely used approach to identify haemochromatosis through clinical complications such as liver disease will detect haemochromatosis in a considerable percentage of patients with Celtic origin. However, up to one half of these patients will already have an irreversible complication, such as liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, or cardiomyopathy. In contrast, screening approaches of non-selected asymptomatic subjects using either determination of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin (phenotypic screening) or genetic testing will detect haemochromatosis in most subjects in a pre-cirrhotic stage without irreversible complications.

Both phenotypic and genetic screenings are highly cost-effective for detecting iron-loaded individuals in the general population. The clinical approach to seek haemochromatosis in the presence of clinical disease is unacceptable. Only a more general type of screening in asymptomatic subjects, including genetic testing, will increase the rate of early diagnosis and further improve the clinical outcome.

### ACG clinical guideline: Hereditary hemochromatosis [^117GZvjU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is one of the most common genetic disorders among persons of northern European descent. Recent advances have been made in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of HH. Molecular diagnostic testing for HH has enabled the confirmation of the diagnosis for most patients. Several genotype-phenotype correlation studies have clarified the differences in clinical features between patients with the C282Y homozygous genotypes and other HFE mutation patterns.

The increasing use of noninvasive tests such as MRI T2✱ has facilitated the quantification of hepatic iron deposition and eliminated the need for liver biopsy in most patients. Serum ferritin levels of < 1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis are crucial for identifying patients with a low risk of advanced hepatic fibrosis and should be routinely used as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation. Genetic testing for other types of HH is available but is expensive and generally not useful in most clinical settings.

Serum ferritin may be elevated among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and those with alcoholic liver disease. These conditions are more common than HH among patients with elevated serum ferritin who are not C282Y homozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes. A secondary cause for liver disease should be excluded in patients with suspected iron overload who are not C282Y homozygotes. Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of therapy, although emerging novel therapies such as new chelating agents may have a role for selected patients.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116Mkxkv]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The classification of iron overload syndromes divides patients into three groups: those with inherited causes of iron overload, those with various causes of secondary iron overload, and a small miscellaneous group. Approximately 85%-90% of patients with inherited forms of iron overload are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in HFE, while a small minority are compound heterozygotes, having one allele with the C282Y mutation and one allele with the H63D or S65C mutation. The remaining 10%-15% of patients with inherited forms of iron overload likely have mutations in other genes involved in iron homeostasis.

Causes of secondary iron overload are categorized as those related to iron loading anemias, chronic liver disease, transfusional iron overload, and miscellaneous causes. Oral iron ingestion does not lead to iron overload except in genetically predisposed individuals or those with ineffective erythropoiesis.

### Hemochromatosis classification: Update and recommendations by the BIOIRON Society [^116Myf58]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Hemochromatosis (HC) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder in which uncontrolled intestinal iron absorption may lead to progressive iron overload (IO), responsible for disabling and life-threatening complications such as arthritis, diabetes, heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The recent advances in the knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular basis of iron metabolism have highlighted that HC is caused by mutations in at least five genes, resulting in insufficient hepcidin production or, rarely, resistance to hepcidin action.

This has led to an HC classification based on different molecular subtypes, mainly reflecting successive gene discovery. This scheme was difficult to adopt in clinical practice and therefore needs revision. Here, we present recommendations for unambiguous HC classification, developed by a working group of the International Society for the Study of Iron in Biology and Medicine (BIOIRON Society), including both clinicians and basic scientists during a meeting in Heidelberg, Germany.

We propose to deemphasize the use of the molecular subtype criteria in favor of a classification addressing both clinical issues and molecular complexity. Ferroportin disease (former type 4a) has been excluded because of its distinct phenotype. The novel classification aims to be of practical help whenever a detailed molecular characterization of HC is not readily available.

### Pathophysiological consequences and benefits of mutations: 20 years of research [^116v8oRR]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Mutations in the HFE (hemochromatosis) gene cause hereditary hemochromatosis, an iron overload disorder that is marked by excessive accumulation of iron in parenchymal organs. The HFE mutation p. Cys282Tyr is pathologically most relevant and occurs in the Caucasian population with a carrier frequency of up to 1 in 8 in specific European regions. Despite this high prevalence, the mutation causes a clinically relevant phenotype only in a minority of cases.

In this review, we summarize historical facts and recent research findings about hereditary hemochromatosis and outline the pathological consequences of the associated gene defects. In addition, we discuss potential advantages of HFE mutations in asymptomatic carriers.

### Haemochromatosis [^115rxbuv]. Lancet (2007). High credibility.

Since the discovery of the haemochromatosis gene (HFE; chromosome 6p21.3) associated with haemochromatosis in 1996, many studies about diverse aspects of this common genetic disorder have been conducted. Some patients present with cirrhosis and exhibit high mortality, whereas many asymptomatic homozygotes for the C282Y mutation in the haemochromatosis gene identified in population screening studies do not develop iron overload despite many years of follow-up. Studies have described the usefulness of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin tests, as well as the acceptability of genetic testing for haemochromatosis. Phlebotomy therapy has been shown to improve hepatic fibrosis. Here, we summarize some new findings in haemochromatosis, a disorder first described in 1865.

### Hereditary hemochromatosis in the post-HFE era [^116X1sMw]. Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Following the discovery of the HFE gene in 1996 and its linkage to the iron overload disorder hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), there have been profound developments in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the biochemical and clinical manifestations of a number of iron overload disorders. This article provides an update on recent developments and key issues relating to iron homeostasis and inherited disorders of iron overload, with an emphasis on HFE-related HH. It is based on the content of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Single-Topic Conference entitled "Hemochromatosis: What has Happened After HFE?" which was held at the Emory Convention Center in Atlanta, September 7–9, 2007.

### Natural history of the C282Y homozygote for the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) with a normal serum ferritin level [^117TxPTb]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

The discovery of a genetic test for hereditary hemochromatosis has identified many individuals who are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene with normal transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels. The long-term prognosis, rate of iron accumulation, and surveillance guidelines for these individuals are unknown.

- **Methods**: To determine the degree of iron accumulation over time, an updated serum ferritin level was obtained in patients initially identified as homozygous for the C282Y mutation with a normal serum ferritin level.

- **Results**: Twenty-two asymptomatic untreated C282Y homozygotes with a normal serum ferritin level were identified: 10 through population screening, 9 through pedigree analysis, and 3 through a general medical work-up. There were 18 women (4 postmenopausal) and 4 men with a median age of 46 years (range 28–76 years). The median follow-up interval was 4 years (range 2–23 years). The serum ferritin levels of 20 of 22 patients remained below the upper limit of normal during the follow-up period. A decline in serum ferritin level was observed in 13 of 22 patients. Three patients had an increase in serum ferritin level of greater than 50%, with only 1 male patient exceeding the upper limit of normal by having a serum ferritin level increase from 295 to 344 µg/L during a 3-year period.

- **Conclusions**: In C282Y homozygotes with a normal ferritin level at the time of diagnosis, 20 of 22 patients failed to show any significant increase in serum ferritin level during a median follow-up of 4 years. This has clinical and economic implications.

### Haemochromatosis: Find them or forget about them [^1135XDxL]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Haemochromatosis continues to be considered an uncommon disease, despite large-scale population screening studies demonstrating a high prevalence of C282Y homozygotes of approximately 1 in 200. Since many of the C282Y homozygotes discovered through screening are asymptomatic or have non-specific symptoms commonly found in the aging population, attributing any symptoms to haemochromatosis has become increasingly difficult. The demonstration of significant liver disease in family members is a strong reminder of the vital importance of pedigree studies when a typical haemochromatosis patient is identified.

### Hemochromatosis classification: Update and recommendations by the BIOIRON Society [^113LLKuB]. Blood (2022). Low credibility.

Nomenclature and the case definition of hemochromatosis (HC) have long been recognized as potential sources of confusion, especially when dealing with the report of genetic tests. Among experts, there was a common feeling that the HC classification needs to be revised in view of the increasing awareness and knowledge of iron overload (IO) disorders. To this end, the BIOIRON Society promoted a two-step process. The starting point was the preparation of a survey that was sent to working group participants, including both expert clinicians and basic scientists actively involved in the iron metabolism field, consisting of nearly all who discovered the hemochromatosis genes and hepcidin. The survey questions and the summary of responses are available in the supplemental material on the Blood website.

This was followed by a critical collegial discussion during a specific session of the most recent biennial meeting of the BIOIRON Society in Heidelberg. The recommendations reported here are the result of such discussion, where the panelists eventually agreed on the novel classification. As an integral part of the process, the panelists agreed on a robust definition of HC, based on clinical presentation and widely available tools, as a prerequisite for genetic testing. The main clinical, biochemical, and imaging studies for the suspicion of HC are reported in Table 1.

Rigorously speaking, the term "hemochromatosis" should be reserved for a unique genetic clinical-pathological condition characterized by increased transferrin saturation (TSAT), IO in the liver (but not in the spleen), and prevalent involv…

### When diagnostic testing leads to harm: a new outcomes-based approach for laboratory medicine [^111x3Ww5]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Low credibility.

The role of laboratory testing in establishing diagnoses

Diagnoses typically result from the patient history and physical examination. However, diagnostic testing is often used to confirm initial impressions or rule out alternatives, and at least 10% of all diagnoses are not considered final until clinical laboratory testing is complete. This number most likely underestimates the actual impact of testing on diagnosis. In the emergency room, clinical laboratory testing is ordered in more than 41% of all visits. Family physicians order tests in 29% of all patient visits, and general internists in 38% of visits. These percentages would be even higher if the calculations were based only on the 33.9% of primary care visits that involve a new complaint.

Advances in technology have also contributed to the increased importance of laboratory tests. In the past, laboratory tests were used to identify organ and system dysfunctions or diseases. While this is still true, testing nowadays is used to diagnose disease subtypes, as occurs when pathology reports of cancer are accompanied by tumor-specific and patient-specific molecular analyses, data which help physicians determine optimum therapies and a patient's likely response to treatment. Laboratory testing is also increasingly being used to diagnose treatment failures associated with newer measures of effective care, such as reduced hospital readmissions. The clinical laboratory's growing significance may also reflect physicians' increasing reliance on objective data from diagnostic testing to partially compensate for reduced patient history and physical examination.

Primary iron overload encompasses a variety of genetic iron overload syndromes, dominated in frequency by HFE-related, or Type 1 hemochromatosis, for which French diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines have been recently proposed. The differential diagnosis of Type 1 hemochromatosis can be made from both clinical data and genetic studies. Venesection therapy and family screening remain the basis for the curative and preventive management of most genetic iron overload diseases.

Surveillance for hepatocellular cancer

In patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) who present with cirrhosis, the recent AASLD guidelines for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance should be followed. These recommendations should be extended to patients with HH who have cirrhosis, whether they have undergone phlebotomy to restore normal iron levels. The relative risk for HCC is approximately 20, with an annual incidence of 3%-4%. Patients with HH, with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, should be screened regularly for HCC as per AASLD guidelines.

Strategies for enhanced case detection

Because of the unspecific nature of the reported signs or symptoms, effective case detection in hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is largely dependent on a strong clinical awareness and motivation to request the appropriate biochemical tests and subsequent genetic testing in suspected cases.

The initial approach to diagnosis in any suspected case is the determination of transferrin saturation (TS). Although not absolutely necessary, it is advisable to confirm elevated TS with a second determination on a fasting specimen. It should be noted that, in spite of being the most widely accepted screening test for systemic iron overload and a very well-standardized laboratory parameter, there is no universally defined TS cutoff value to identify patients eligible for further testing, and a variety of cutoff values have been used in different studies (reviewed in the European Association for the Study of the Liver).

- **Predictive value of TS**: A review of studies in several populations using cutoffs of TS ranging from 45% to 60% was presented in Table 5 of the 2010 EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines for HFE Hemochromatosis, and the positive predictive value of elevated TS for the detection of p.C282Y homozygotes was estimated to vary from 4.3% to 21.7%.

Besides TS, serum ferritin (SF) is a surrogate of iron stores, and hyperferritinemia is an indicator of iron overload when inflammatory/malignant conditions are excluded. Although SF is a well-standardized laboratory parameter, there is also no universally accepted reference range. A review of studies in several populations using cutoffs of SF ranging from 250 to 428 μg/L in males and from 130 to 302 μg/L in females highlights this variability.

### Hemochromatosis classification: Update and recommendations by the BIOIRON Society [^112KTP8q]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Unlike in the past, fully expressed and potentially lethal hemochromatosis (HC) with manifestations such as liver cirrhosis, diabetes, endocrine dysfunction, and heart failure is now rarely seen in clinical practice. This rarity can be attributed to increased awareness of the disease and, more importantly, the routine assessment of iron biomarkers, particularly serum ferritin. Unfortunately, this progress is counterbalanced by an increased diagnostic challenge for non-experts in the iron field, primarily due to the lack of specificity of ferritin.

Ferritin is an essentially intracellular protein that serves to store iron safely. It is also present at very low concentrations (micrograms per liter) in serum, likely through secretion by macrophages. Normal values usually range from 30 to 200 µg/L in females and up to 300 µg/L in males. The function of secreted extracellular ferritin remains largely unknown. Several common conditions can lead to increased serum ferritin levels, including virtually all inflammatory disorders, hepatic cytolysis (e.g. during acute or chronic liver disease), or metabolic syndrome. This leads to a significant number of consultations, overuse of the "first-level" genetic test looking for the presence of common variants in the HFE gene, and even misdiagnosis due to incorrect interpretation of the results.

The glycoprotein transferrin is the extracellular carrier of iron detectable at high concentrations in blood (grams per liter), being the third most abundant protein after albumin. Transferrin saturation (TSAT) is calculated as the ratio between serum iron and transferrin.

These recommendations provide a data-supported approach to establishing guidelines. They are based on the following:

1. A formal review and analysis of the recently published world literature on the topic.
2. The American College of Physicians Manual for Assessing Health Practices and Designing Practice Guidelines.
3. Guideline policies including the AASLD Policy on the Development and Use of Practice Guidelines and the American Gastroenterological Association's Policy Statement on the Use of Medical Practice Guidelines.
4. The experience of the authors in regard to hemochromatosis.

To more fully characterize the available evidence supporting the recommendations, the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee has adopted the classification used by the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) workgroup, with minor modifications. The strength of recommendations in the GRADE system is classified as strong (class 1) or weak (class 2). The quality of evidence supporting strong or weak recommendations is designated by one of three levels: high (level A), moderate (level B), or low-quality (level C).

Intended for use by physicians, these recommendations suggest preferred approaches to the diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive aspects of care. They are intended to be flexible in contrast to standards of care, which are inflexible policies to be followed in every case. Specific recommendations are based on relevant published information.

### Hemochromatosis: diagnosis and management [^113AQKTQ]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Hemochromatosis (HH) should be distinguished from other syndromes of iron overload. Many patients with HH exhibit abnormal serum iron values before significant symptoms or clinical findings develop, making liver biopsy less critical in diagnosis. HFE mutation analysis enhances our ability to diagnose HH accurately and is beneficial in family studies. HFE mutations may contribute to conditions such as porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Generalized population screening for HH may eventually become a reality, allowing for the identification and treatment of more patients before tissue damage or increased morbidity occur. With the identification of the HFE gene, we are beginning to understand the complexities of both normal iron absorption and the disorder of iron metabolism found in patients with HH.

### Hemochromatosis classification: Update and recommendations by the BIOIRON Society [^114P7Lc5]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Clinical elements that should raise a definite suspicion of HC are crucial to consider. In Whites with a negative first-level HFE test (i.e. p. Cys282Tyr homozygosity is not detected) and in non-Whites, a second-level genetic test should be considered to identify rarer variants in the HFE or in other genes linked to hepcidin control. These types of HC are generally less influenced by cofactors and are characterized by a more severe and homogeneous clinical picture appearing at a younger age. Their molecular diagnosis is often complex because variants in HC genes other than HFE are typically private (i.e. restricted to members of only one or a few families).

Modern approaches based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) have greatly expanded the diagnostic possibilities in rarer HC and, at the same time, introduced significant challenges in interpreting the results. NGS is generally available only at referral centers and requires specific expertise to avoid misdiagnosis, often resulting in a long wait time for results. However, treatment of patients with a defined HC phenotype should not be delayed pending the result of the genetic test. Recently, NGS methods have enabled the estimation of the global prevalence of HFE and non-HFE HC in different populations, enhancing understanding and informed by data from projects such as the 1000 Genomes Project, Exome Sequencing Project, and Exome Aggregation Consortium.

- **Main clinical, biochemical, and imaging elements for the suspicion of HC**: These elements are essential in flagging potential HC cases.
- **Combined pathogenic allele frequency for HC genes**: This data is drawn from significant genomic projects, providing insights into the distribution and frequency of HC-related alleles across various populations.

### Proposed dietary recommendations for iron overload: A guide for physician practice [^113xM6Y2]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Iron overload disorders such as hemochromatosis involve unregulated absorption of dietary iron, leading to excessive iron accumulation in multiple organs. Phlebotomy is the standard of care for the removal of excess iron, but dietary modification is not standardized in practice. The purpose of this article is to help standardize hemochromatosis diet counseling based on commonly asked patient questions.

The clinical benefit of dietary modification in iron overload patients is limited due to a lack of large clinical trials, but preliminary results are promising. Recent studies suggest that diet modification could reduce iron burden in hemochromatosis patients, resulting in less annual phlebotomy, as supported by small patient studies, concepts of physiology, and animal studies.

This article serves as a guide for physicians to counsel hemochromatosis patients based on commonly asked questions, such as foods to avoid, foods to consume, use of alcohol, and use of supplements. The goal of this guide is to help standardize hemochromatosis diet counseling to reduce the amount of phlebotomy in patients. Standardization of diet counseling could help facilitate future patient studies to analyze the clinical significance.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113GN9XZ]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Serum ferritin has less biological variability than TS, but it has a significant false positive rate because of elevations related to inflammation. Ferritin can be elevated in the absence of increased iron stores in patients with necroinflammatory liver disease (e.g. alcoholic liver disease [ALD], chronic hepatitis B and C, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]), in lymphomas, and in patients with other non-hepatic chronic inflammatory conditions. In fact, in the general population, iron overload is not the most common cause of an elevated ferritin level. Nonetheless, in the absence of other inflammatory processes, several studies of families with hemochromatosis (HH) have demonstrated that the serum ferritin concentration provides a valuable correlation with the degree of body iron stores.

- **Serum ferritin as an indicator**:
	- Serum ferritin provides additional confirmation of the significance of an elevated TS in C282Y homozygotes. In most circumstances, serum ferritin serves as a supportive indicator for assessing iron overload in these individuals.

- **Significance of serum ferritin levels**:
	- In a study, serum ferritin levels of > 250 μg/L in men and > 200 μg/L in women were positive in 77% and 56%, respectively, of C282Y homozygotes. Similarly, the HEIRS (HEmochromatosis and IRon Overload Screening) study, which screened 99,711 North American participants, reported elevated serum ferritin levels (> 300 μg/L in men, > 200 μg/L in women) in 57% of female and 88% of male C282Y homozygotes.

### Iron metabolism and iron disorders revisited in the hepcidin era [^115SYtUx]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

The improved understanding of iron physiology has profoundly changed the modern approach to iron disorders. Historically known for centuries as iron deficiency (chlorosis) in young females and hemochromatosis (bronze diabetes) in middle-aged males, we now suspect hemochromatosis based on iron parameters and confirm the diagnosis by genetic testing well before the development of iron overload and organ damage. We are aware that anemia is a complication of iron deficiency, though not the only one, since other tissues and organs may be iron-depleted before anemia develops, as occurs in chronic heart failure.

Hepcidin is tightly controlled to maintain body iron balance. Loss of this control leads to opposite genetic or acquired disorders.

### Haemochromatosis [^114gVau8]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

Haemochromatosis is now recognized as an iron-storage disease characterized by genetic heterogeneity, ultimately leading to the reduced production of the hormone hepcidin. This deficiency results in increased intestinal absorption and deposition of excessive iron in parenchymal cells, eventually causing tissue damage and organ failure.

A perplexing aspect is the variable clinical expression, with some individuals showing hepatic cirrhosis at a young age while others remain almost asymptomatic throughout their lives. Research is unraveling this puzzle by identifying environmental factors, particularly alcohol consumption, and associated modifying genes that influence phenotypic expression.

A high level of suspicion is essential for early diagnosis, which can enable presymptomatic therapy and a normal life expectancy. Venesection (phlebotomy) remains the primary treatment, though alternative therapies are currently being explored in research.

### Hemochromatosis classification: Update and recommendations by the BIOIRON Society [^1177h3xr]. Blood (2022). Low credibility.

It is commonly accepted that the term "hemochromatosis" was coined by the German pathologist von Recklinghausen in 1889. Notably, this occurred during the Versammlung Deutscher Naturforscher (meeting of German scientists) held in Heidelberg, similar to the BIOIRON Society (formerly IBIS) meeting in 2019, which led to the report. Following the description of patients with "bronze diabetes and cirrhosis" by French physicians led by Armand Trousseau in the mid-1800s, von Recklinghausen hypothesized that something circulating in the blood ("hemo-") was responsible for skin and organ damage and pigmentation ("-chromatosis") (HC). Recognizing excess iron as the etiology of organ toxicity took several decades and was attributed to Joseph Sheldon in 1935. Sheldon was the first to suggest the genetic origin of the metabolic defect. Overall, the works of these pioneers clearly defined a clinical-pathological entity caused by progressive iron accumulation and characterized by multiorgan damage (mainly in the liver, pancreas, joints, heart, and endocrine glands), without signs of anemia; on the contrary, some patients show mildly increased Hb levels.

In the 1950s, ferrokinetic studies revealed abnormally increased intestinal iron absorption as the key pathophysiological feature of HC. Repeated and frequent phlebotomies were established as the primary treatment. In 1977, the seminal work by Marcel Simon and colleagues reported the tight linkage between the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and the putative hemochromatosis gene on chromosome 6p, definitively demonstrating this connection.

### Screening for hereditary haemochromatosis within families and beyond [^112SPoS2]. Lancet (2003). Low credibility.

Screening programs for haemochromatosis that include follow-up identification of relatives are claimed to be cost-effective. We assessed the uptake of screening by first-degree relatives of two groups of index cases: individuals homozygous for the C282Y mutation, ascertained by genetic screening of blood donors, and patients presenting clinically with haemochromatosis. Only 40 (24%) of 165 relatives of blood donors had been tested. In contrast, testing uptake in 121 relatives of patients diagnosed clinically was more than double that (53%), despite the unstructured provision of genetic information. A substantial number of untested relatives had undiagnosed iron overload. These observations undermine the overall efficacy of population screening for haemochromatosis.

### Emqn best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^116uCQke]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The EMQN external quality assessment (EQA) scheme for HFE continues to detect both genotyping errors and variable quality of interpretive comments. This indicates the continued importance of quality assurance and improvement. It is recommended that testing laboratories are accredited to international standards (ISO 15189 or equivalent). The techniques used should be validated in-house with appropriate sample types and numbers. If CE-marked IVD kits are used, in-house verification should be performed. Laboratories reporting HFE testing results should participate annually in EQA. EQA provides a long-term, retrospective assessment of laboratory performance, allowing laboratories to demonstrate consensus with their peers and providing information on inter-method comparability. Unless dictated by legislation, the choice of EQA provider lies with the laboratory, but the use of an EQA programme that assesses reporting as well as genotyping and that is accredited to ISO 17043 is recommended, wherever possible.

- **Recommendations for HFE testing strategies**: Laboratories providing testing for HFE-associated HH should test for p.C282Y (1A). According to local practice, p.H63D can be considered an optional complementary test that can be offered sequentially or simultaneously to p.C282Y testing (2C). Testing for p.S65C should not be offered; if detected as an incidental finding, it should not be reported (1B). It is recommended that testing laboratories are accredited according to international standards (ISO 15189 or equivalent).

### Emqn best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^113JRzAH]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Molecular genetic testing for hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is recognized as a reference test to confirm the diagnosis of suspected HH or to predict its risk. The vast majority (typically > 90%) of patients with clinically characterized HH are homozygous for the p.C282Y variant in the HFE gene, referred to as HFE-related HH. Since 1996, HFE genotyping has been implemented in diagnostic algorithms for suspected HH, allowing its early diagnosis and prevention. However, the penetrance of the disease in p.C282Y homozygotes is incomplete; hence, homozygosity for p.C282Y is not sufficient to diagnose HH. Neither is p.C282Y homozygosity required for diagnosis, as other rare forms of HH exist, generally referred to as non-HFE-related HH. These forms pose significant challenges in defining criteria for referral, testing protocols, interpretation of test results, and reporting practices.

We present best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of HH, where recommendations are classified, as far as possible, according to the level and strength of evidence. For clarification, the guidelines' recommendations are preceded by a detailed description of the methodology and results obtained through a series of actions to achieve a wide expert consensus. Namely:

- **Survey on laboratory practices**: Practices followed by laboratories offering molecular diagnosis of HH.
- **Systematic literature search**: Focused on some identified controversial topics.
- **Expert best practice workshop**: Convened to achieve consensus on the practical recommendations included in the guidelines.

### Current approaches to the management of hemochromatosis [^112vMwGF]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

The term hemochromatosis encompasses at least four types of genetic iron overload conditions, most of them recently distinguished from one another as a result of the identification of a series of genes related to iron metabolism. At least three of these entities (HFE hemochromatosis, juvenile hemochromatosis, and transferrin receptor 2 hemochromatosis) involve systemic hepcidin deficiency as a key pathogenetic factor. Major advances in the management of hemochromatosis influence the diagnostic approach to the disease, with the development of an overall non-invasive strategy, mainly based on clinical, biological (iron parameters and genetic testing), and imaging (especially magnetic resonance imaging) data.

Therapeutic management remains, on the curative side, dominated by phlebotomy (venesection), practical aspects of which have been recently revisited by the Guidelines Department of the French "Haute Autorité de Santé". However, innovative treatment approaches, based on the improved pathophysiological understanding of these diseases and the progress in iron chelation therapy, are emerging. Preventive therapy, focused on family screening, remains a key part of the management of hemochromatosis.

Questions regarding nomenclature and case definition

It became apparent during the BPM that questions regarding the nomenclature and case definition of HH are among the major causes of confusion when dealing with the interpretation of test results and reporting practices. Some participants pointed to the fact that, in the face of the increasing awareness and knowledge of the pathogenesis of iron overload disorders, some concepts relating to HH definition should be revised.

The term hemochromatosis was first coined by von Recklinghausen in 1889 following the description of its iron-related pathology. The clinical characteristics of the disease were later described by John Sheldon in 1934 following a systematic review of autopsy cases, and the autosomal recessive mode of transmission was demonstrated by Simon and co-workers in 1977 following the discovery of its association with HLA.

Since that time, a typical phenotypic characterization of patients was necessary to define HH, including the demonstration of severe liver iron overload. The selection of HH patients based on a strict phenotypic case definition was fundamental to permit the positional cloning of the HH-associated gene. After the discovery in 1996 of the genetic defect in HFE, which explained over 80% of previously phenotypically characterized cases, a genetic definition of HH became available, and a pre-symptomatic diagnosis in subjects with less severe forms of iron overload became feasible.

These advances, however, also brought some confusion among clinicians about what constitutes the case definition of HH.

### How I treat hemochromatosis [^112S6Yv4]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Hemochromatosis is a common genetic disorder in which iron may progressively accumulate in the liver, heart, and other organs. The primary goal of therapy is iron depletion to normalize body iron stores and to prevent or decrease organ dysfunction. The primary therapy to normalize iron stores is phlebotomy. In this opinion article, we discuss the indications for and monitoring of phlebotomy therapy to achieve iron depletion, maintenance therapy, dietary and pharmacologic maneuvers that could reduce iron absorption, and the role of voluntary blood donation.

### Genetics, genetic testing, and management of hemochromatosis: 15 years since hepcidin [^114iYQ1K]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The discovery of hepcidin in 2000 and the subsequent unprecedented explosion of research and discoveries in the iron field have dramatically changed our understanding of human disorders of iron metabolism. Today, hereditary hemochromatosis, the paradigmatic iron-loading disorder, is recognized as an endocrine disease due to the genetic loss of hepcidin, the iron hormone produced by the liver. This syndrome is due to unchecked transfer of iron into the bloodstream in the absence of increased erythropoietic needs and its toxic effects on parenchymatous organs.

It is caused by mutations that affect any of the proteins that help hepcidin to monitor serum iron, including HFE and, in rarer instances, transferrin-receptor 2 and hemojuvelin, or make its receptor ferroportin resistant to the hormone. In Caucasians, C282Y HFE homozygotes are numerous, but they are only predisposed to hemochromatosis; complete organ disease develops in a minority due to alcohol abuse or genetic modifiers that are now being identified. HFE gene testing can be used to diagnose hemochromatosis in symptomatic patients, but analyses of liver histology and full gene sequencing are required to identify patients with rare, non-HFE forms of the disease. Due to the central pathogenic role of hepcidin, it is anticipated that nongenetic causes of hepcidin loss (e.g. end-stage liver disease) can cause acquired forms of hemochromatosis.

The mainstay of hemochromatosis management is still the removal of iron by phlebotomy, first introduced in the 1950s, but the identification of hepcidin has not only shed new light…

### Diagnosis and treatment of hemochromatosis [^1146DJTB]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Hemochromatosis is not a new disease, and genetic variants for hemochromatosis have been identified in human fossils that are over 4000 years old in Northwestern Europe. These variants were postulated to promote iron absorption as a survival benefit. In contrast, excess iron absorption can lead to serious complications, including arthritis, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, primary liver cancer, and diabetes.

In this review, the emphasis is on recent developments in the diagnosis and treatment of hemochromatosis, focusing on those homozygous for the C282Y variant in the HFE gene. In this condition, there is a clear need for earlier diagnosis, leading to earlier treatment, to prevent morbidity and mortality from iron overload.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder of iron metabolism. Diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis is usually based on a combination of various genetic or phenotypic criteria. Decisions regarding screening are difficult because of the variable penetrance of mutations of the HFE gene and the absence of any definitive trials addressing the benefits and risks of therapeutic phlebotomy in asymptomatic patients or those with only laboratory abnormalities.

The purpose of this guideline is to increase physician awareness of hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly the variable penetrance of genetic mutations; aid in case finding; and explain the role of genetic testing. This guideline provides recommendations based on a review of evidence in the accompanying background paper by Schmitt and colleagues. The target audience for this guideline is internists and other primary care physicians, and the target patient population is all persons who have a probability or susceptibility of developing hereditary hemochromatosis, including the relatives of individuals who already have the disease.

### Hemochromatosis classification: Update and recommendations by the BIOIRON Society [^116Yxvdt]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Hemochromatosis (HC) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder in which uncontrolled intestinal iron absorption may lead to progressive iron overload (IO) responsible for disabling and life-threatening complications such as arthritis, diabetes, heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Recent advances in the knowledge of pathophysiology and the molecular basis of iron metabolism have highlighted that HC is caused by mutations in at least five genes, resulting in insufficient hepcidin production or, rarely, resistance to hepcidin action. This has led to an HC classification based on different molecular subtypes, mainly reflecting successive gene discovery. This scheme was difficult to adopt in clinical practice and therefore needs revision. Here, we present recommendations for unambiguous HC classification developed by a working group of the International Society for the Study of Iron in Biology and Medicine (BIOIRON Society), including both clinicians and basic scientists during a meeting in Heidelberg, Germany. We propose to deemphasize the use of the molecular subtype criteria in favor of a classification addressing both clinical issues and molecular complexity. Ferroportin disease (former type 4a) has been excluded because of its distinct phenotype. The novel classification aims to be of practical help whenever a detailed molecular characterization of HC is not readily available.

### Emqn best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^112VoiMx]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016).

Controversy remains regarding the definition of HH associated with HFE variants other than p.C282Y, and no established consensus has been published before. The most frequently found HFE variant in all populations is p.H63D, originally described by Feder and co-workers as a common variant associated with iron overload in patients who were p.C282Y heterozygotes. It should be noted that the two variants are always inherited in trans (on separate alleles) because they arose as independent founder alleles. After this original report, it became common practice to classify individuals with the p.C282Y and p.H63D variants inherited in compound heterozygosity as an HH-associated genotype.

This practice, however, was later challenged by growing evidence that p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygous subjects have a distinct iron overload phenotype (mild to moderate) normally associated with the presence of other comorbidity factors, namely alcohol abuse or dysmetabolic iron overload syndrome. Therefore, notwithstanding a role of p.H63D as a susceptibility factor for increased iron overload, for practical clinical purposes, p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygotes and p.H63D homozygotes are not classified as HFE-associated HH (following the most recent EASL guidelines). It is recommended that in patients with these genotypes and iron overload, other genetic or environmental risk factors should be examined. Another variant, p.S65C, reported as a normal variant in the European population, has also been described as a susceptibility allele in patients with iron overload.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1157HAfx]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The term "non-HFE -related HH" refers to several genetically distinct forms of inherited iron overload affecting individuals without HFE mutations. Several of the genes involved are hemojuvelin (HJV), ferroportin (SLC40A1), transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2), and hepcidin (HAMP). The non-HFE forms of inherited iron overload are rare, accounting for less than 5% of cases encountered, and genetic testing is largely unavailable except in research laboratories. Screening for non-HFE-related HH is not recommended.

### Iron overload in the liver diagnostic and quantification [^117GAFM3]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is the most prevalent form of iron overload. Since 1996, genetic tests have significantly facilitated the non-invasive diagnosis of the disease. However, there are many cases with negative genetic tests that require confirmation by hepatic iron quantification, traditionally performed by hepatic biopsy. Numerous studies have demonstrated the possibility of performing hepatic iron quantification through magnetic resonance. Nevertheless, a consensus has not yet been reached regarding the technique or the ability to reproduce the same calculus method across different machines. This article reviews the current state of this issue and delineates potential future directions to standardize this non-invasive method of hepatic iron quantification.

### Impact of gene patents and licensing practices on access to genetic testing for hereditary hemochromatosis [^111cPTYA]. Genetics in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an iron metabolism disorder that leads to excess iron buildup, especially in the heart, liver, and pancreas. Mutations in the HFE gene are the single most common cause of hereditary hemochromatosis, which can be treated effectively if diagnosed early. Patents cover the HFE gene, related proteins, screening methods, and testing kits. Most initial testing for hereditary hemochromatosis is biochemical, but HFE deoxyribonucleic acid testing or genotyping is used to confirm a diagnosis of inherited hemochromatosis.

Concerns over patents covering HFE testing emerged in 2002 when scholars argued that exclusive licensing and the patent-enabled sole provider model then in place led to high prices and limited access. Critics of the sole provider model noted that the test was available at multiple laboratories before the enforcement of patents. By 2007, however, Bio-Rad Limited acquired the key intellectual property and sublicensed it widely. In part because of broad, nonexclusive licensing, there are now multiple providers and testing technologies, and research continues.

This case study illustrates how both changes in intellectual property ownership and the evolving clinical utility of HFE genetic testing in the last decade have affected the licensing of patents and the availability of genetic testing.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116M9E43]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Serum ferritin levels have an additional value as a predictor of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in confirmed HH. Several studies have demonstrated that a level of serum ferritin at 1000 μg/L, along with an elevated aminotransferase level (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) and a platelet count < 200 × 10^9/L, predicted the presence of cirrhosis in 80% of C282Y homozygotes.

- **Recommendations**:
	- In a patient with suggestive symptoms, physical findings, or family history, a combination of TS and ferritin should be obtained rather than relying on a single test. If either is abnormal (TS ≥ 45% or ferritin above the upper limit of normal), then HFE mutation analysis should be performed.
	- Diagnostic strategies using serum iron markers should target high-risk groups such as those with a family history of HH or those with suspected organ involvement.

### Iron overload: What is the role of public health [^113c4YGZ]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis type 1, also known as hereditary hemochromatosis classical (HHC), is an iron overload disorder associated, in most cases, with mutations of the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene. Although suggested algorithms for diagnosing iron overload are available, there are still questions about options for genetic and biochemical screening for hemochromatosis and the duration of treatment.

This article provides a summary of an expert workgroup meeting convened on September 24–25, 2009, entitled "Iron Overload: What is the Role of Public Health?" The purpose of the meeting was to enable subject matter experts to share their most recent clinical and scientific iron overload information and to facilitate the discussion of future endeavors, with special emphasis on the role of public health in this field.

- **Research priorities**: The two main topics were the research priorities of the field, including clinical, genetic, and public health issues, and the concerns about the validity of screening recommendations for the condition.

Once a patient with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) has been identified (proband), family screening should be recommended for all first-degree relatives. For ease of testing, both genotype (HFE mutation analysis) and phenotype (ferritin and transferrin saturation or TS) should be performed simultaneously at a single visit.

For the children of an identified proband, HFE testing of the other parent is generally recommended. If the results are normal, the child is an obligate heterozygote and need not undergo further testing, as there is no increased risk of iron loading. If C282Y homozygosity or compound heterozygosity is found in adult relatives of a proband, and serum ferritin levels are increased, then therapeutic phlebotomy can be initiated. If ferritin level is normal in these patients, then yearly follow-up with iron studies is indicated.

Identified C282Y heterozygotes and H63D heterozygotes can be reassured that they are not at risk for developing progressive or symptomatic iron overload. Occasional H63D homozygotes can develop mild iron overload. However, it should be recognized that any of these genotypes can be a cofactor for the development of liver disease when they occur in conjunction with other liver diseases such as porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), hepatitis C infection, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Relatives identified as H63D heterozygotes or H63D homozygotes can be reassured that they are generally not at risk of progressive iron overload, although they may have minor abnormalities in serum iron measurements such as TS or ferritin.

Family studies have concluded that many homozygous relatives of probands demonstrate.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hereditary hemochromatosis, more specifically with respect to dietary modifications, the EASL 2022 guidelines recommend restricting alcohol intake during the iron depletion phase of treatment. Patients with iron overload and/or liver abnormalities are advised to avoid or consume very little alcohol. Patients with cirrhosis should abstain from alcohol consumption.

### Genetic modifiers of penetrance to liver endpoints in HFE hemochromatosis: Associations in a large community cohort [^117EKygT]. Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Preventative treatment such as phlebotomy is safe and effective; therefore, efforts to diagnose the high‐risk p.C282Y homozygote group earlier are needed to reduce morbidity. In the UK Biobank (UKB), only 33% of male and 21% of female p.C282Y homozygotes were diagnosed with hemochromatosis by the end of the available medical record data (mean age 69 and 70 years, respectively). A higher polygenic score for serum iron was associated with an increased likelihood of both excess morbidity and hemochromatosis diagnosis in p.C282Y homozygotes.

In study participants with the other HFE variants studied (including p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygotes, p.C282Y heterozygotes, and p.H63D genotypes separately), the iron polygenic risk score was not associated with excess morbidity. This is consistent with the lack of statistical evidence for overall excess morbidity in these latter genotype groups. Genotypes other than p.C282Y homozygotes have no apparent clinical consequences, even in those with higher iron polygenic scores for the studied outcomes. Therefore, recent guidelines indicate that diagnosis of hemochromatosis is not needed in the absence of additional factors. Nevertheless, the iron polygenic score was associated with being diagnosed as having hemochromatosis in non‐p.C282Y homozygotes. This may be due to clinicians mistaking higher iron blood measures as a need for a hemochromatosis diagnosis, although more work is needed to confirm this apparent misdiagnosis.

### Emqn best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^1135rYa9]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

An agreed set of best practice guidelines has now been updated for diagnostic, predictive, and carrier testing for HFE-related HH and for reporting the results of such testing. In addition, some basic guidelines have been developed for testing and reporting rarer forms of non-HFE-related HH. Consensus and consultation processes for this document occurred within the framework of a best practice meeting where, following prior dissemination of related literature, relevant topics were discussed by a group of experts. The resulting recommendations are based on the available published evidence, and the GRADE system for scoring the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations was applied. This process has been translated into guidance when reporting variants associated with iron overload disorders.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^115H6LmF]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The French Reference Centre for Rare Iron Overload Diseases of Genetic Origin was established in 2007 as part of the first French National Plan for Rare Diseases, which began in 2005. Located at the University Hospital Pontchaillou in Rennes, and benefiting from a specific budget, it works in close collaboration with nine centers of competence spread across the country.

The goal of this network of expertise is to contribute to the equity of medical care and research activities within the broad spectrum of rare diseases. The specific diseases involved correspond essentially to non-HFE-related genetic iron overload diseases (types 2, 3, or 4 hemochromatosis) and to other entities such as hereditary aceruloplasminemia and atransferrinemia. It also includes exceptional forms of HFE-related hemochromatosis involving rare variants. From the diagnostic viewpoint, the reference center analyzes all referred cases of unexplained iron excess using a multidisciplinary approach to select those who warrant targeted genetic exploration.

The center leads in proposing diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations to be disseminated to the medical community. Concerning basic and clinical research, the center proposes and coordinates various themes covering epidemiological, diagnostic, and therapeutic aspects in association with the recognized centers of competence. One of the hot topics today, considering increasingly efficient techniques in molecular genetics, is to develop functional tests to aid in the prediction of deleterious variants.

### Hemochromatosis classification: update and recommendations by the BIOIRON Society [^111LWDRs]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

- **Iron homeostasis in normal conditions (Figure 3)**: Iron homeostasis involves mechanisms leading to iron accumulation in hemochromatosis (HC) conditions, as well as in iron-loading anemias, both nontransfusion-dependent and transfusion-dependent.

- **Hemochromatosis (HC) mechanisms**: In HC, iron hyperabsorption through the portal vein leads to iron accumulation in liver parenchymal cells, initially exhibiting a typical portal-central gradient, sparing macrophages such as Kupffer cells.

- **Nontransfusion-dependent anemias**: In these anemias, which are characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, hepcidin insufficiency plays a central role in the pathogenesis of iron overload (IO). This is due to suppression by soluble factors, such as erythroferrone (ERFE), which are produced by ineffective or expanded erythroblasts rather than a genetic defect in the pathways regulating hepcidin synthesis.

- **Transfusion-dependent anemias**: Regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are the major contributing factor to IO in transfusion-dependent anemias. In these conditions, hepcidin is relatively upregulated by iron but fluctuates in response to intermittent erythropoiesis suppression by transfusions.
