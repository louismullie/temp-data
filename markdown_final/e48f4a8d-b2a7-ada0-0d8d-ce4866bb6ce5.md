## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option is an element of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the firm's auditing practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory framework that governs audit firm quality control. Then, I should verify which of the answer choices maps to a required element within that framework. Next, I will consider whether the alternatives are merely desirable practices, behavioral expectations, or operational matters rather than mandated QC elements. Finally, I will confirm the correct choice and briefly justify it against the standard.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory anchor. Audit firm quality control in the U.S. is governed by Statements on Quality Control Standards (SQCS), which require firms to establish and maintain a system of quality control covering specified elements; one of those elements is policies and procedures for accepting and continuing client relationships and engagements, which directly addresses client acceptance and retention decisions [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the options against that framework. Option A, acceptance of a client relationship, aligns precisely with the SQCS element on client acceptance and continuance, which mandates that firms evaluate prospective clients and engagements for integrity, competence, and risk before acceptance and periodically reassess continuance thereafter [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the other choices. Professional skepticism is a fundamental auditor mindset and a requirement of auditing standards, but it is not itself a documented quality control policy or procedure; it is a behavioral expectation embedded in audit performance rather than a standalone QC element, so B is not the best answer here [^notfound].

> I need to check C and D carefully. Computer information processing relates to IT systems and controls, which may support audit execution but are not a named element of the QC system under SQCS; similarly, efficiency of organizational structures is a management or operational consideration, not a required QC element, so neither C nor D matches a mandated QC component [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider to ensure I'm not missing a nuance. The SQCS elements are explicit about client acceptance and continuance, engagement performance, human resources, monitoring, and leadership responsibilities; none of those categories reduce to "professional skepticism", "computer processing", or "organizational efficiency" as standalone QC elements, reinforcing that A is the correct choice [^notfound].

> Conclusion: The element of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to auditing practice, among the choices provided, is acceptance of a client relationship, which corresponds to the SQCS requirement for client acceptance and continuance policies and procedures [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **A. Acceptance of a client relationship**. Client acceptance and continuance policies are a **required element** of a CPA firm's quality control system under auditing standards, ensuring that firms only accept clients they can serve competently and ethically. The other options — professional skepticism, computer information processing, and organizational efficiency — are important audit concepts but are not themselves elements of the firm's quality control policies and procedures.

---

## Analysis of answer choices

### A. Acceptance of a client relationship

Client acceptance and continuance policies are a **required element** of a CPA firm's quality control system under auditing standards. These policies ensure that firms only accept clients they can serve competently and ethically, and that they periodically reassess ongoing client relationships. This element directly addresses risk assessment, ethical considerations, and professional competence, which are fundamental to audit quality.

---

### B. Professional skepticism of management

Professional skepticism is a **mindset auditors must maintain** during engagements, but it is not a documented policy or procedure within the firm's quality control system. It is an attitude of questioning and critical assessment applied during audit execution, rather than a formalized quality control element.

---

### C. Computer information processing

Computer information processing relates to the **technological tools and systems** used in audit engagements. While important for efficiency and accuracy, it is not a specific element of quality control policies and procedures. Quality control may address IT governance and data integrity, but "computer information processing" itself is not a defined quality control element.

---

### D. Efficiency of organizational structures

Organizational efficiency is a **broader management concept** that influences firm operations but is not a specific element of quality control policies and procedures. Quality control focuses on ensuring compliance with professional standards, ethical requirements, and audit quality, rather than general organizational efficiency.

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **A. Acceptance of a client relationship**, as it is a required element of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures under auditing standards. The other options, while relevant to audit practice, are not specific elements of the quality control system.

### Do hospitalist physicians improve the quality of inpatient care delivery? A systematic review of process, efficiency and outcome measures [^7a1b6cc3]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

In this systematic review, we propose a modified version of Donabedian's framework as a simple conceptual map for understanding and synthesizing hospitalist performance, recognizing that an organization's structures, processes, and outcomes are interrelated and influence one another. By organizing these relationships into categories, researchers can logically predict and test relationships between constructs of interest and, in doing so, facilitate progression in the field of hospital medicine and quality initiatives. Structural differences between physician models should correlate with changes in the processes of care delivery, which in turn help drive improvements in operating efficiency and clinical outcomes. The results summarized in this review are important, as they suggest that the identification, labelling, and comparing of physicians as either 'hospitalists', 'traditional academic attending physicians', or 'community-based' providers is not sensitive enough to adequately differentiate the key structural characteristics which define hospitalists as distinct from other inpatient physicians and subsequently drive improvements in patient-level outcomes. The list of structural characteristics included in our conceptual model (Figure 1) quickly makes it apparent that inpatient physicians have access to many of the same resources and supports, regardless of job title, training, or time spent on service. By restricting all organizational aspects of a practice model to a single explanatory dummy variable as the vast majority of hospitalist evaluations have done, we do see evidence of improved performance in operating efficiency; however, we do not have a clear picture of where or how these efficiency gains occur and why we do not see similar improvement in related areas of quality (mainly processes and outcome measures).

### Implementing an effective organization and governance structure for a radiology practice [^65207bde]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Radiology practices that are well organized and effectively governed have a competitive advantage. Decisions are made rapidly, actions are taken decisively and in accordance with established policy, and each group member has a responsibility for practice building. Such groups are perceived by their peers, hospital administration, and community business leaders to be both formidable and effective. This paper details the mechanisms that facilitate planning for and implementing an efficient practice organization and governance structure. The tasks of group leaders are defined, as are the committees necessary for appropriate action. The integral roles of a mission statement and a business plan are discussed. Practices adopting the suggested organizational structure will be best positioned to survive in both good times and bad.

### SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance for public health action [^e63c9bf6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Early in the pandemic, in many municipalities, no organizational structure or identified agency existed to facilitate wastewater surveillance implementation. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of wastewater surveillance, multiple partners have a critical role. However, active working relationships across wastewater and public health agencies rarely exist. Although municipal wastewater agencies are actively engaged in public health disease prevention by treating wastewater, they often are not engaged in infectious disease response efforts. Central to our discussions with public health and wastewater practitioners was an overwhelming desire for an improved organizational structure between the various stakeholders needed to conduct a wastewater surveillance program. In particular, new organizational leadership is needed to improve the efficiency of wastewater surveillance program implementation.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers partnered with wastewater and public health agencies to launch current wastewater surveillance efforts. Because of the many stakeholders involved in these efforts, co-development of programs and methods across various experts and agencies is needed to ensure efficient and successful development. Furthermore, as research continues to advance, sharing of methods and experiences between researchers and new partners in infectious disease response can identify needs, enable knowledge transfer, and build longer term relationships to promote partner-driven research. Investments in physical laboratory capacity, personnel, and interagency collaboration frameworks to build this new institutional knowledge into public health surveillance frameworks for future epidemics can ensure that these partnerships are valuable in the long term. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is taking a leadership role by forming the NWSS and developing national data reporting standards and analytics systems, as well as supporting state, local, and territorial capacity building necessary to ensure a sustainable and efficient public health surveillance system (Appendix).

### A new era in quality measurement: the development and application of quality measures [^891a5c6c]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Types of quality measures — categorization and definitions — state that although many quality measures are available, most are categorized into 1 of 3 measure types: structure, process, or outcomes. Structural measures assess "sufficiency of resources and proper system design," including organizational characteristics and the use of specific systems for improving care. Process measures assess the interaction between the patient (and/or his or her family) and the practitioner and the way in which care and services are provided, including assessment, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment. Outcome measures assess the effect of care delivered on the patient's (and family's) health and function. The Institute of Medicine specified 6 key domains or targets for improving health care quality: safety, timeliness, effectiveness, efficiency, equity, and patient/ family centeredness.

### The professional and organizational future of imaging [^b155d06a]. Insights Into Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

Possible solutions

"If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change."

–Giuseppe di Lampedusa, The Leopard

The solutions imply that there is wide agreement on a number of starting principles concerning the integrity of radiology as a specialty and particularly the organizational integrity of all imaging services within the enterprise (hospital, multispecialty practice). As always and as previously stated in this paper, historically grown as well as efficiency-driven exceptions have to be part of the general agreement. Moreover, the presented solutions underscore clearly that diagnostic imaging and image-guided interventions are the domain of radiology and nuclear medicine, while collaboration with clinical specialties is frequently beneficial and needed. However, the integrity of the organizational structure of the "discipline of imaging" within the enterprise bears numerous benefits for cost-containment, quality standards, and efficiency.

### PIPELINEs: creating comparable clinical knowledge efficiently by linking trial platforms [^a09a1878]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Extensions

While initially inspired by US oncology adaptive clinical trial platforms, PIPELINEs could extend globally and arise in many therapeutic areas including antiinfective, inflammatory, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and perhaps psychiatric disorders.

Limitations and areas for future work and monitoring

To succeed, PIPELINEs must overcome multiple challenges and continue to advance operational, statistical, and organizational innovations. This article has only been able to address the major concepts and has drawn upon only a few of the largest emergent examples. Continued biostatistical advances are required, particularly in multiphase adaptive designs with therapeutic graduations and "information borrowing." Operational scale efficiencies are not guaranteed. Further work will be required on patient screening and recruitment, rapid site start‐up, and information infrastructures. Operational efficiencies also will require disciplined PIPELINE governance in areas such as: setting appropriate standards based on well‐understood data handling rules; limiting core trial element complexity; focusing individual study customization on the most critical elements; and inducing high site performance through both rewards and penalties. PIPELINE organizational structures will require further elucidation to ensure adequate control while maintaining appropriate community participation and diversity of ideas, to fairly balance and adjudicate stakeholder interests, and to confirm sustainable financial models.

We believe PIPELINE organizational structures that engage patients as full research partners and formally include payer interests and concerns will prove critical to success. Drug development is a global activity and PIPELINEs too will need to include international sites and perspectives, which will add scale and scope, and will create challenges from the operational to the legal, cultural, and ethical. Allying with existing adaptive platforms such as I‐SPY and EPAD could prove productive first steps.

Developments in allied fields continue advancing rapidly. PIPELINEs must monitor and incorporate the best innovations while not becoming distracted. Areas of particular interest include: big data designs, methods and tools; patient reported outcomes; social media networks; remote patient monitoring; and precision medicine breakthroughs.

### Relationships between volume, efficiency, and quality in surgery – a delicate balance from managerial perspectives [^955ff86c]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Volume, efficiency, and quality in hospital care are often mixed in debate. We analyze how these dimensions are interrelated in surgical hospital management, with particular focus on volume effects: under financial constraints, efficiency is the best form of cost control. External perception of quality is important to attract patients and gain volumes. There are numerous explicit and implicit notions of surgical quality. The relevance of implicit criteria (functionality, reliability, consistency, customaziability, convenience) can change in the time course of hospital competition. Outcome data theoretically are optimal measures of quality, but surgical quality is multifactorially influenced by case mix, surgical technique, indication, process designs, organizational structures, and volume. As quality of surgery is hard to grade, implicit criteria such as customizability currently often overrule functionality (outcome) as the dominant market driver. Activities and volumes are inputs to produce quality. Capability does not translate to ability in a linear function. Adequate process design is important to realize efficiency and quality. Volumes of activities, degree of standardization, specialization, and customer involvement are relevant estimates for process design in services. Flow-orientated management focuses primarily on resource utilization and efficiency, not on surgical quality. The relationship between volume and outcome in surgery is imperfectly understood. Factors involve learning effects both on process efficiency and quality, increased standardization and task specialization, process flow homogeneity, and potential for process integration. Volume is a structural component to develop efficiency and quality. The specific capabilities and process characteristics that contribute to surgical outcome improvement should be defined and exported. Adequate focus should allow even small institutions to benefit from volume-associated effects. All volumes-based learning within standardized processes will finally lead to a plateauing of quality. Only innovations will then further improve quality. Possessing volume can set the optimal ground for continuous process research, subsequent change, innovation, and optimization, while volume itself appears not to be a quality prerequisite.

### 2023 HRS / EHRA / APHRS / LAHRS expert consensus statement on practical management of the remote device clinic [^53460b2c]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Remote monitoring workload and organizational models — supportive evidence: The continued uptake of RM has led to a deluge of data from scheduled and unscheduled RM transmissions, and some institutions report receiving > 100,000 transmissions annually. Although RM transmission volume can be extremely high, RM transmission review can be highly efficient, as long as staff, workflow, and decision trees are in place. A structured organizational model (Italian HomeGuideRegistry) of a primary nurse and physician team to review RM transmissions and manage RM patients was found to be highly effective, safe, and efficient, and subsequent observational studies corroborated structured organizational models with dedicated staff, workflows, and decision trees, showing improvements in patient management, timely detection of actionable events, and gains in clinic efficiencies. Structured workflow with dedicated RM staff may have contributed to improved outcomes in patients on RM in the implant-based multiparameter telemonitoring of patients with HF randomized controlled trial (IN-TIME).

### Inferring neural signalling directionality from undirected structural connectomes [^574df41e]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Neural information flow is inherently directional. To date, investigation of directional communication in the human structural connectome has been precluded by the inability of non-invasive neuroimaging methods to resolve axonal directionality. Here, we demonstrate that decentralized measures of network communication, applied to the undirected topology and geometry of brain networks, can infer putative directions of large-scale neural signalling. We propose the concept of send-receive communication asymmetry to characterize cortical regions as senders, receivers or neutral, based on differences between their incoming and outgoing communication efficiencies. Our results reveal a send-receive cortical hierarchy that recapitulates established organizational gradients differentiating sensory-motor and multimodal areas. We find that send-receive asymmetries are significantly associated with the directionality of effective connectivity derived from spectral dynamic causal modeling. Finally, using fruit fly, mouse and macaque connectomes, we provide further evidence suggesting that directionality of neural signalling is significantly encoded in the undirected architecture of nervous systems.

### Neural network correlates of high-altitude adaptive genetic variants in tibetans: a pilot, exploratory study [^3f60756a]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

2.7.1 Global whole‐brain organization

At the global level, we calculated five metrics for each network, including the clustering coefficient (C p), characteristic path length (L p), local efficiency (E loc), global efficiency (E glob), and modularity (Q). The clustering coefficient quantifies local interconnectivity or cliquishness of a network, the characteristic path length measures the mean distance or routing efficiency between any pair of nodes in a network, the local efficiency reflects the extent to which a network is fault tolerant, the global efficiency indicates how efficiently information can be exchanged in parallel over a network, and the modularity is an indicator of the extent to which nodes can be divided into several subsets with dense edges within but sparse edges between them.

2.7.2 Intermediate modular composition

Modular structure is an important organizational principle for human brain networks (Sporns & Betzel, 2016). To determine the modular compositions of structural and functional brain networks in this study, we first generated a group‐level matrix for each modality by counting the frequency of occurrence for each connection over all participants. Then, a backbone network that captured the multiscale structures of the group‐level matrix was extracted (Foti, Hughes, & Rockmore, 2011) and used to detect the modular architecture based on a spectral optimization algorithm (Newman, 2006). With the resultant group‐level modular composition as a representative reference, we further calculated the intramodule integration score (mean connectivity strength within a module), intermodule communication score (mean connectivity strength between two modules), and nodal participant coefficient (an index reflecting the ability of a node to maintain communication between its own module and other modules) for each participant.

### Structurational divergence: a contributing factor to moral injury among health care workers [^77e5be40]. Family Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

To provide quality patient care, health professionals must be able to effectively communicate interpersonally and in team environments. While a lack of communication and conflict negotiation skills certainly can create obstacles to patient care, the organizational structures in which health professionals do their work also can obstruct communication or make it more difficult. Structurational divergence theory helps identify and explain the negative communication cycles that result when individuals must fulfill obligations from multiple competing systems, each with its own social rules. The structure of health care delivery systems also can result in structurational divergence, as health care workers must often navigate the space between their clinician priorities of improved patient health and the corporate priorities of greater efficiency and profit. This divergence creates tension for the clinician that can lead to burnout and moral injury, especially when the clinician feels forced to act outside the patient's best interests. Individual efforts to address moral injury are less likely to be successful than collective group action. However, medical education can take steps to prepare students with the knowledge and tools necessary to navigate competing role demands, systemic obstacles, and ethical dilemmas to ensure quality patient care.

### Reviewing the 95 sociotechnical barriers to the decarbonization of buildings [^068c8d33]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Treasure instruments in the form of financial "carrots," incentivize efficiency, electrification, and renewable infrastructure through tax credits, subsidies, rebates, or penalties. Financial incentives support both supply-side solutions (e.g. solar panel subsidies, heat pump subsidies, grid infrastructure improvements) and demand-side actions (e.g. rebates for efficient appliances, windows, or energy retrofits). These instruments are especially important when new technologies face high upfront costs compared to incumbent technology.

To realize both regulation and its financial support apparatus, organizational instruments are needed in the form of on-the-ground initiatives supported through private-public partnerships. Direct government provision of energy services affords government more control over the entire policy process, from design to implementation. In practice, financial instruments are often integrated with organizational instruments. For example, Mass Save, in Boston, is a utility-funded, state energy efficiency program that includes workforce training, building performance assessments, heat pump rebates, and other services for improving energy efficiency performance of new and existing buildings. Funded by fees from customer gas and electricity bills, Mass Save installed 40,000 heat pumps and weatherized 55,000 homes in Massachusetts in 2024. This organizational instrument, while costly (~$ 1.3 billion a year), provides the incentive structure to support broader regulatory compliance and economic feasibility.

### Rationale, considerations, and goals for atrial fibrillation centers of excellence: a Heart Rhythm Society perspective [^87ab0609]. Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation centers of excellence (AF CoE) — goals and benefits focus on standardizing care and supporting implementation. There is no accepted definition or consensus-based standard to define an AF CoE. The goal of establishing a health care CoE is to standardize the care of patients with a certain condition(s), based on guideline-directed care, in order to achieve the best outcomes. Stated benefits of creating AF CoEs are to establish a pragmatic organizational framework for AF centers, to implement the framework, and to provide a structure for both maintenance and evolution of AF care. The rationale for establishing AF CoEs includes providing the same high-quality patient experience across health care practices, streamlining health care operations and promoting more efficient utilization of resources, and improving quality and outcomes.

### The time is now: formation of true transplant centers [^7727a086]. American Journal of Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

With the advances in the complexity of medical care there is a need to change the way we are organized in order to deliver that care in the most patient-friendly, efficient manner. This need is perhaps most compellingly manifest in the field of whole organ transplantation. Yet we are trying to deliver medical care with an organizational structure that was developed over 100 years ago when medical practice was considerably different. We argue for the development of a vertically integrated organizational structure in academic health centers for certain disciplines like transplantation. While this new arrangement for medical practice could be applied to many areas of medicine, transplantation is one of the best fields to begin making these changes. True transplant centers would bring avoid fragmentation of care and resources, thus bringing together the medical school and hospital into an integrated organization that would be responsible for all aspects of transplantation such as patient care, research, education and fiscal issues.

### The business of emergency medicine: a model for success [^a5b6b93f]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Today's EPOs and their physicians face an array of daunting challenges. Falling reimbursement, rising malpractice costs. ED and hospital crowding, and demands for improving ED efficiency and patient satisfaction all contribute to the challenging and sometimes threatening environment of EM practice. The EP involved in a busy and often hectic ED shift may feel unduly and unnecessarily distracted when required to continuously acknowledge and address the business aspect of the practice. Nevertheless, regardless of the size and structure, fiscal viability ultimately determines the EPO's ability to continue to offer access to care. This article contends that a comprehensive business strategy drives superior financial performance and supports the organization's mission. The business strategy must identify financial and non-financial determinants of the EPO's success and provide a mechanism for understanding how the organization's resources are converted to value for customers. The section offers a framework for developing this strategy, for identifying possible gaps or deficiencies, and for measuring and monitoring progress in achieving strategic objectives and ultimately, the EPO's mission. The importance of the mission and the dynamic EM environment require that the strategy development process be more than an annual exercise for the leadership of the organization. Though key leaders in any size EPO — set the course for the organization, the entire organization must be aware and understand the strategy before they commit themselves and adopt actions and behaviors that promote it. The model presented here provides a graphic display that lends itself well to consistent communication of a comprehensive strategy in a concise way throughout the organization. Furthermore, the balance of the model, across four perspectives, recognizes the value of balanced organizational objectives and lends itself well to the creation of a measurement system that supports cause and effect relation-ships through leading and lagging indicators. This can prevent the imposition of unproven, arbitrary metrics and expectations.EPOs that expend the time and resources required to develop and implement a comprehensive, well balanced strategy make a long-term investment in their patients and themselves. EPOs that go on to develop credible, efficient measurement systems are not only able to drive more commitment and accountability in the organization, they also have a competitive advantage. They can demonstrate performance history and targeted future performance to differentiate themselves from competitors and to stem efforts to impose unbalanced metrics that do not serve well the hospital, the EPO, and ultimately, patients. The power of such measurement systems, internal and external to the organization, strongly point to the need for consistently defined measures across the industry. Ultimately when faced with changes in the environment, the entire industry will be better equipped to respond in specific ways and to communicate its progress to communities or government authorities.

### Sustaining improvement gains [^55a6dcf8]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2025). Medium credibility.

A "system" as described by W. Edwards Deming, the father of the quality movement, is a set of interdependent components - structures, people, and processes - working together towards a common purpose. 1 Within health systems, the primary intent and common purpose is to promote, restore, and maintain health by focusing on safety, effectiveness, and efficiency. For these reasons, many organizations devote substantial time and resources to build their improvement capability, but these hard-earned improvements fade as the focus changes to other priorities and workers revert to the old system of doing things. To counter this, many health systems are incorporating methods that ensure initiatives continue to help patients in the short term but also become embedded in the system to help future patients. The Institute for Healthcare (IHI) in their 2016 White Paper suggests that the key to sustaining improvements in systems is to "focus on the daily work of frontline managers, supported by a high-performance management system (HPMS) that prescribes standard tasks and responsibilities for these managers at all levels of the organization". 2 Both these factors are interconnected. An HPMS can be categorized into several areas; quality management, quality control, quality improvement, and a culture of high performance. As a practical example, this paper describes how the IHI framework can be employed to achieve sustainability for quality improvements, using an example of improving problem list utilization at discharge for patients.

### Creating a high-value delivery system for health care [^7c4986f9]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Health care reform that focuses on improving value enhances both the well-being of patients and the professional satisfaction of physicians. Value in health care is the improvement in health outcomes achieved for patients relative to the money spent. Dramatic and ongoing improvement in the value of health care delivered will require fundamental restructuring of the system. Current efforts to improve safety and reduce waste are truly important but not sufficient. The following three structural changes will drive simultaneous improvement in outcomes and efficiency: (1) reorganizing care delivery into clinically integrated teams defined by patient needs over the full cycle of care; (2) measuring and reporting patient outcomes by clinical teams, across the cycle of care and for identified clusters of medical circumstances; and (3) enabling reimbursement tied to value rather than to quantity of services. Many of these changes require physician leadership. We discuss steps on the journey to value-based care delivery.

### The department of medicine in 2030: a look ahead [^1546f056]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The authors described the features of a hypothetical academic Department of Medicine in 2030 that would be most effective in improving the public health. Future departments of medicine will be compelled to respond to a projected shortage of physicians through augmented training strategies. The clinical programs will be more decentralized and responsive to patient preferences while demonstrating greater value. Departments will create adaptable, accountable structures in which clinicians working in interdisciplinary teams continuously improve processes and outcomes of care, and clinician and patient satisfaction. The restructuring of health care will afford exciting opportunities to align clinical and scholarly activities. The growing ability to link biological and clinical phenotypic information will lead to more effective and efficient clinical care. In view of the funding constraints and the remarkable opportunities for high-impact research, departmental research programs will become increasingly disciplined. Successful research programs will require durable investments in faculty career development, enabling infrastructure, interdisciplinary research teams, and diverse funding sources. The educational programs will demonstrate proficiency of trainees in the 6 current core competencies, as well as in additional areas critical to health care transformation. To improve organizational effectiveness, departments will create more nimble organizational structures led by individuals with diverse backgrounds. Chairs of departments of medicine will be expected to continuously expand their capacity to meet the evolving needs of their departments and institutions. Members of departments of medicine will be continuously fortified by the privilege and obligations of our profession while embracing the risks necessary to meet the extraordinary opportunities in 2030.

### Relationship of processes and structures of care in general surgery to postoperative outcomes: a descriptive analysis [^3a74e18a]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The systematic collection of quantitative data on structures and processes from surgical services participating in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) has not been a focus to date. Efficient collection of useful measures of structures and processes may improve understanding of surgical outcomes and strategies for improving the quality of surgical care, as NSQIP continues to expand. The purpose of this article was to describe results of a quantitative survey designed to measure surgical care structures and processes within NSQIP sites.

Study Design

A cross-sectional survey was mailed to 123 Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) and 14 private sector sites participating in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-funded Patient Safety in Surgery (PSS) Study. The survey included questions about organizational structures and processes of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative general surgical care services. For this study, we included only data from 90 VA sites that returned a survey (73% response rate). We used descriptive statistics and examined the bivariate association of structures and processes items or scales with risk-adjusted observed-to-expected (O/E) ratios of surgical morbidity and mortality.

Results

Examination of frequency or means and standard deviations of items and scales revealed substantial variation in the structures and processes of surgical care services in participating VA sites, with correlation analyses demonstrating that, of 35 process and structure variables, there was a statistically significant relationship with the hospital's observed-to-expected ratio for 14 variables for morbidity, but only 4 variables for mortality.

Conclusions

This descriptive analysis provides support for the potential importance of measuring organizational structures and processes of care in addition to risk-adjusted morbidity and mortality.

### Organizational characteristics, outcomes, and resource use in 78 Brazilian intensive care units: the ORCHESTRA study [^2828456d]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Detailed information on organization and process of care in intensive care units (ICU) in emerging countries is scarce. Here, we investigated the impact of organizational factors on the outcomes and resource use in a large sample of Brazilian ICUs.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of 59,693 patients (medical admissions, 67%) admitted to 78 ICUs during 2013. We retrieved patients' data from an ICU quality registry and surveyed ICUs regarding structure, organization, staffing patterns, and process of care. We used multilevel logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with hospital mortality. Efficient resource use was assessed by estimating standardized resource use and mortality rates adjusted for the SAPS 3 score.

Results

ICUs were mostly medical-surgical (79%) and located at private hospitals (86%). Median nurse to bed ratio was 0.20 (IQR, 0.15–0.28) and board-certified intensivists were present 24/7 in 16 (21%) of ICUs. Multidisciplinary rounds occurred in 67 (86%) and daily checklists were used in 36 (46%) ICUs. Most frequent protocols focused on sepsis management and prevention of healthcare-associated infections. Hospital mortality was 14.4%. In multivariable analysis, the number of protocols was the only organizational characteristic associated with mortality [odds ratio = 0.944 (95% CI 0.904–0.987)]. The effects of protocols were consistent across subgroups including surgical and medical patients as well as the SAPS 3 tertiles. We also observed a significant trend toward efficient resource use as the number of protocols increased.

Conclusions

In emerging countries such as Brazil, organizational factors, including the implementation of protocols, are potential targets to improve patient outcomes and resource use in ICUs.

### Quality in orthopaedic surgery – an international perspective: AOA critical issues [^426a6f15]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2013). Low credibility.

Quality is a hallmark of health care, although it is difficult to come to a consensus on who gets to define what "quality health care" is. Most health-care workers enter this field with the goal of improving the health of their patients (and the community), and while everyone tries to do the best job possible, we must continuously seek better methods and techniques for achieving better outcomes. The passion for continuous improvement is fundamental, but passion is not sufficient by itself. There is substantial opportunity to improve quality and reduce cost in health care. Multidisciplinary teams that include physicians, nurses, and other ancillary care providers have led to decreased waiting times to see specialists and have also led to better management of chronic disease. By including ancillary care, providers can increase cancer-screening rates and have the potential to decrease readmissions. Moreover, the addition of hospitalists and physician assistants can produce quality and efficiency outcomes that are commensurate with those enjoyed by traditional house staff. However, truly improving performance is difficult due to questions about how we define "quality", design care processes, measure inputs and outputs, develop multi-stakeholder collaborations, and develop incentive programs for delivering "good" care. There is a definite need for more thorough and robust studies of the impact of pay-for-performance programs, with the inclusion of ancillary care providers. Current research has not shown that there is not enough evidence to be able to determine what incentive structure might "work" in a particular health-care system. Payment systems will continue to evolve to incentivize greater collaboration among providers to yield higher-quality, lower-cost care. Future efforts will necessitate the need for strong physician leadership in helping to develop an optimal care team that is as patient-centered as possible. Technology adds dimensions of capability to making improvement real and systematic, as well as providing safer care with fewer errors and better adherence to proven best practices. The drive for quality with technology produces better clinical outcomes and maximizes efficiencies and financial metrics of organizational performance. Technology also adds capabilities for capturing key metrics and reporting them back to clinicians and others. Improved data transparency informs those who can actually do things differently to produce better results and outcomes. While health-care entities strive to focus on quality of care, measuring and reporting such care in a meaningful way are difficult. The best chance of improving overall care for patients is through the adoption of systems that improve coordination and continuity, not by health-care staff working harder. Only through collaboration and integration can health care incorporate a culture for improving quality and patient safety.

### Development and application of' systems thinking' principles for quality improvement [^078ff65a]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Adopting a 'systems thinking' approach to improvement in healthcare has been recommended as it may improve the ability to understand current work processes, predict system behaviour and design modifications to improve related functioning'.ystems thinking' involves exploring the characteristics of components within a system (eg, work tasks and technology) and how they interconnect to improve understanding of how outcomes emerge from these interactions. It has been proposed that this approach is necessary when investigating incidents where harm has, or could have, occurred and when designing improvement interventions. While acknowledged as necessary, 'systems thinking' is often misunderstood and there does not appear to be a shared understanding and application of related principles and approaches. There is a need, therefore, for an accessible exposition of systems thinking.

Systems in healthcare are described as complex. In such systems it can be difficult to fully understand how safety is created and maintained. Complex systems consist of many dynamic interactions between people, tasks, technology, environments (physical, social and cultural), organisational structures and external factors. Care system components can be closely 'coupled' to other system elements and so change in one area can have unpredicted effects elsewhere with non-linear, cause–effect relations. The nature of interactions results in unpredictable changes in system conditions (such as patient demand, staff capacity, available resources and organisational constraints) and goal conflicts (such as the frequent pressure to be efficient and thorough). To achieve success, people frequently adapt to these system conditions and goal conflicts. But rather than being planned in advance, these adaptations are often approximate responses to the situations faced at the time. Therefore, to understand safety (and other emergent outcomes such as workforce well-being) we need to look beyond the individual components of care systems to consider how outcomes (wanted and unwanted) emerge from interactions in, and adaptations to, everyday working conditions.

### Translating knowledge into policy: organizational model and minimum requirements for the implementation of a regional pancreas unit network [^a993dba9]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic and periampullary cancers pose significant challenges in oncological care due to their complexity and diagnostic difficulties. Global experiences underscore the crucial role of multidisciplinary collaboration and centralized care in improving patient outcomes in this context. Recognizing these challenges, Lombardy, Italy's most populous region, embarked on establishing pancreas units across its territory to enhance clinical outcomes and organizational efficiency. This initiative, driven by a multistakeholder approach involving the Lombardy Welfare Directorate, clinicians, and a patient association, emphasizes the centralization of complex care in high-volume hospitals, adopting a hub-and-spoke model and a multidisciplinary approach. This article outlines the process and criteria set forth for pancreas unit implementation, aiming to provide a structured framework for enhancing pancreatic cancer care. Central to this initiative is the establishment of structured criteria and minimal requirements, not only for surgery but also for other essential components of care, ensuring a comprehensive approach to pancreatic cancer management. The Lombardy model offers a structured framework for enhancing pancreatic cancer care, with potential applicability to other regions and countries seeking to improve their cancer care infrastructure.

### Accounting for healthcare structures when measuring variation in care [^7b1459c3]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Health services research frequently focuses on variation in the structure, process, and outcomes of clinical care. Robust approaches for detection and attribution of variation are foundational to both quality improvement and outcomes research. Describing care in structured healthcare systems across hospitals in which clinicians work to provide care for patients as a multileveled structure allows the impact of organization on practice and outcome to be ascertained. Mixed-effect statistical models can describe both the partitioning of variation among levels of these structures and by inclusion of explanatory variables the valid estimation of the features of health systems, clinicians, or patients, with observed differences in processes or patient outcomes. In this Readers' Toolbox, the authors describe the rationale for considering healthcare structures when assessing clinical practice, outcomes, and sources of variation. They describe statistical considerations and methods for the estimation of analysis of structured data and assessment of variance.

### "The balancing act" – licensed practical nurse experiences of falls and fall prevention: a qualitative study [^c34a3a5d]. BMC Geriatrics (2012). Low credibility.

In order for learning to be effective, there must be different opportunities for learning within the healthcare organization. Examples include good communication, opportunities for the staff to participate in decision making, and clear organizational goals. To create a safety culture in a nursing home setting, factors as stress level, work climate, efficient work process, and clear organizational goals have been identified. The wards in our study differed in structure. The rehabilitation ward had a clear goal concerning falls and fall prevention whereas the acute ward had many other goals. Studies in primary care settings have shown that learning structures must be designed and implemented at the workplace, otherwise daily clinical routines becomes the priority. The patient safety culture is significantly associated with management commitment to the issue and steps toward implementation have to come from the organizational level.

### ASPEN safe practices for enteral nutrition therapy [formula: see text] [^99671c74]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

ASPEN safe practices — organizational systems and administrative structures to support a safe enteral nutrition (EN) process: Practice recommendations are to provide leadership and oversight at the healthcare organizational level by competent clinicians knowledgeable in the EN process; develop and implement policies and evidence-based practice guidelines to support the individuals involved in the EN process; develop and implement policies and guidelines collaboratively among all disciplines involved in the EN process, and align policies and procedures from various disciplines, departments, and settings within the organization; and create a formal committee or structure that includes expert clinicians from all disciplines to provide oversight of the EN process. The rationale states that documentation needs to be supported by a strong infrastructure of organizational systems and administrative oversight, that the EN process involves many disciplines and departments, that minimizing risks requires interdisciplinary collaboration, standardization through guidelines, and practice alignment among professions, departments, and settings, and that evidence-based practice guidelines targeted at clinical, departmental, and organizational levels support a safe EN process with aligned and complementary policies to avoid inconsistencies.

### Improving and maintaining radiologic technologist skill using a medical director partnership and technologist coaching model [^bcd1af8d]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Consistent excellence in radiologic technologist performance, including ensuring high technical image quality, patient safety and comfort, and efficient workflow, largely depends on individual technologist skill. However, sustained growth in the size and complexity of health care organizations has increased the difficulty in developing and maintaining technologist expertise. In this article, we explore underlying organizational structures that contribute to this problem and propose organizational models to promote continued excellence in technologist skill.

Conclusion

We have found that a relatively modest investment in medical directorship combined with a coaching model can bring about a significant level of improvement in skilled clinical performance. We believe that widespread implementation of similar programs could contribute to substantial improvements in quality in radiology and other health care settings.

### PICS / AEPC / APPCS / CSANZ / SCAI / SOLACI: expert consensus statement on cardiac Catheterization for pediatric patients and adults with congenital heart Disease [^6f862f17]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). High credibility.

Facility requirements — general considerations state that cardiac catheterization, whether diagnostic or interventional, is an important service in any larger facility providing comprehensive care for pediatric patients and adults with CHD, and while the pediatric and congenital cardiac cath lab is at the center of this service line, it cannot function in isolation and requires a variety of additional care and ancillary services, support structures, organizational arrangements, and administrative support to provide efficient and high-quality care for this patient population. The text emphasizes that there is no single care model that is by default superior to all others and that if facilities recognize potential shortcomings and make appropriate arrangements to address those challenges, then care can successfully be provided in a wide range of different facility models. It further notes that recommendations are influenced by local, regional, and national regulations that often have additional facility requirements, and that those additional requirements need to be accommodated in order to perform cardiac catheterization procedures in pediatric patients and adults with CHD.

### From silos to synergy: integrating academic health informatics with operational IT for healthcare transformation [^2398537c]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Generative AI (GenAI) exemplifies the fundamental advantages of this organizational approach. This disruptive technology has broad applications within an academic medical center, including in research, education, and clinical care delivery. It is also complex and rapidly evolving, requiring significant expertise, oversight, and resources to implement effectively and safely. Furthermore, due to its very nature, GenAI becomes a more powerful tool when it is integrated with data and additional applications. In a traditional structure, innovations using GenAI would be siloed between the various health system functions, with separate efforts occurring for academic investigations, clinical operations improvement projects, and explorations of its value in medical education.

The DHI leveraged its role as an organizational hub to rapidly establish the first patient health information (PHI) safe OpenAI GPT-4 environment for organizational experimentation, host the first healthcare "prompt-a-thon", rapidly implement strategically aligned pilots in all of its missions and deploy a unified oversight of GenAI applications. Moreover, the integrated structure facilitates remarkable transparency and transferability of ideas and expertise across domains. This allows IT resources to be more efficiently deployed in support of experimenting with how this important new technology can help drive forward all the academic health system's missions. Thus, while the creation of a new structure within MCIT has taken significant vision and labor to implement, in the long-term, the effective reorganization and incorporation of health informatics and IT is ultimately reducing the costs associated with implementing these novel and broadly reaching technologies.

### A qualitative study exploring the needs related to the health system in women with experience of pregnancy termination due to fetal anomalies in iran [^b99d28a1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

After analyzing the data, 42 codes, nine sub-categories and three main categories were obtained. Three main categories include: efficient treatment team, optimal organizational structure in providing services and financial support for families (Table 2).

Table 2
Codes, sub-categories and main categories extracted from the data analysis

Efficient treatment team

According to the participants, in order to meet the needs of women with experience of pregnancy termination due to fetal anomalies, it is necessary to provide them with comprehensive care by efficient treatment team. This main category includes two sub- categories.

Understanding the women's condition by the treatment team

According to the participating women, one of their most important needs during and after pregnancy termination is the need for understanding their condition by the members of the treatment team. They asked for behavior with empathy and kindness, hopeful expression, and attention to their concerns about the pregnancy termination procedure.

"Healthcare providers are very frustrated in some shifts; they don't care about our situation at all. When I walked down the hall, they said: 'why are you walking? The ward is crowded, go into the room'. (A woman)

Professional competence of the treatment team in providing care

A number of participating women complained about the lack of necessary skills in the members of the treatment team and their uncertainty of receiving effective treatment. They believed that healthcare providers should have the necessary abilities for their services and provide cares within the professional standards. According to the participating women, healthcare providers should have up-to-date knowledge and spend sufficient time to educate and answer women's questions.

"… They (healthcare providers) carry out the doctor's instructions without explaining. They don't say what they are doing at all! Their behavior is not right at all! They don't respect anyone".(A woman)

Optimal organizational structure in providing services

The statements of the participants included cases that resolving them required the creation of favorable organizational structure to provide high-quality services, including: existence of the necessary and sufficient human resources; favorable physical environment in the maternity ward; accumulation of services in one place; existence of appropriate welfare facilities for women and their companions; and existence of organized counseling and supportive services in health centers. This main category includes five sub- categories.

The Journal of Pain (2016). Medium credibility.

Organizational structure, policies, and procedures — the panel recommends that facilities in which surgery is performed have an organizational structure in place to develop and refine policies and processes for safe and effective delivery of postoperative pain control (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Facilities in which surgery is performed should have an organizational structure to oversee the development, implementation, and evaluation of policies and practices to assure safe, evidence-based, and effective postoperative pain control, and measurement-driven models of care through outcomes assessment might be useful to guide quality improvement efforts in postoperative pain control.

### Using a network organisational architecture to support the development of learning healthcare systems [^0372a532]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2018). Medium credibility.

The organisational architecture of Learning Networks

While their size, scope and clinical focus differ (table 1), all Learning Networks use an 'actor-oriented'network organisational architecture. 'Organizational architecture' refers to the way that an organisation arranges itself to coordinate and control activities and to make decisions about distribution of resources and effort. 'Actors' are people, organisations, databases and registries that are part of the network. The actor-oriented organisational architecture differs from hierarchical or matrix organisations. It is more flexible and adaptable, allowing more distributed decision-making to enable large groups of people (patients, families, clinicians, researchers, health system leaders) to self-organise to solve problems in the healthcare system that are important to them.

Table 1
Network-based Learning Health Systems

The actor-oriented network organisational form has three components: (1) aligning participants around a common goal; (2) standards, processes, policies and infrastructure to enable multiactor collaboration; and (3) a commons where information, knowledge, resources and know-howto achieve that goal are created and shared. The model recognises that humans are predisposed to be cooperative and prosocial, and that an appropriately designed organisation can facilitate these predispositions, thereby facilitating cooperation and coproduction, at scale, to improve health, care and outcomes. These three elements are further described below using our four most mature networks as examples.

### The management of transitional care of patients affected by phenylketonuria in Italy: review and expert opinion [^eac5fc8c]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic inherited disorder in which transition from infancy to adult care is particularly difficult and not sufficiently regulated. According to the scientific literature, only few medical centers offer healthcare assistance for adult patients with PKU that are therefore still treated in pediatric settings. This generates psychological, emotional, and organizational discomfort among patients, leading them to discontinue the follow-up. European guidelines and national consensus documents underline this unmet need and the lack of practical recommendations for a structured transitional pathway in PKU. The aim of this review and expert opinion is to propose good practices for managing the transition period of PKU patients, based on the literature and the experience of a panel of Italian experts in PKU. The consensus of the experts was obtained through the administration of three rounds of surveys and one structured interview. The result is the first proposal of a pathway for an efficient transition of PKU patients. Key steps of the proposed pathway are the "a priori" planning involving the pediatric and adult teams, the acceptance of the patient and his/her family to the process, the preliminary definition of appropriate spaces in the structure, the organization of meetings with the joint team, and the appointment of a transition coordinator. For the first time, the involvement of decision makers and patient associations is proposed.

### The impact of a prospective survey-based workplace intervention program on employee health, biologic stress markers, and organizational productivity [^22cb989f]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To study whether knowledge about psychosocial work indicators and a structured method to implement changes based on such knowledge comprise an effective management tool for enhancing organizational as well as employee health and well-being.

Methods

White- collar employees representing 22 different work units were assessed before and after a 1-year intervention program. Subjective ratings on health and work environment, biologic markers, absenteeism, and productivity were measured.

Results

Significant improvements in performance feedback, participatory management, employeeship, skills development, efficiency, leadership, employee well-being, and work-related exhaustion were identified. The restorative hormone testosterone increased during the intervention and changes correlated with increased overall organizational well-being. Absenteeism decreased and productivity improved.

Conclusions

Fact-based psychosocial workplace interventions are suggested to be an important process for enhancing employee well-being as well as organizational performance.

### How I approach: defining the scope of psychosocial care across disciplines in pediatric hematology-oncology [^d131d0dc]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

To provide the standard of psychosocial care for children with cancer and hematological disorders and their families, multidisciplinary teams must clearly define their scope and collaborate in ways that optimize the quality and efficiency of care. A new organizational structure was leveraged to delineate roles and scope for each psychosocial discipline at our institution. We developed a document, the scope of psychosocial care (SPC), that serves as a platform for making patient care decisions and provides opportunities for the reevaluation of programming. Herein, we present the process and outcome of the SPC and make recommendations for identifying roles in pediatric psychosocial hematology-oncology.

### An active inference strategy for prompting reliable responses from large language models in medical practice [^137b109f]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Text chunking is a crucial aspect of retrieval in natural language processing, dictating how information is organized and stored for efficient retrieval. The choice of chunk size presents a challenge, with no one-size-fits-all solution. However, various methods exist to enhance retrieval, including improved chunking strategies.

Fixed Size Chunking represents a widely adopted method in text segmentation, where the chunk size is predetermined based on the number of tokens. Optionally, some overlap between chunks is maintained to preserve semantic coherence. This approach is often preferred due to its computational efficiency and simplicity, and it does not rely on specialized Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries.

Recursive Chunking, on the other hand, employs an iterative hierarchical process to divide text into smaller segments using designated separators. If the initial splitting fails to produce chunks of the desired size or structure, the method iteratively refines the process until the desired outcome is achieved. While chunks may not be uniform in size, this method retains the essence of fixed size chunking while accommodating more flexible variations.

Document Specific Chunking takes into account the inherent structure of the document, aligning chunk boundaries with logical sections such as paragraphs or subsections. This preserves the author's organizational framework, enhancing coherence and relevance in retrieved information, especially in structured documents like Markdown or HTML formats.

Semantic Chunking focuses on the semantic relationships within the text, dividing it into semantically meaningful segments. Although slower than other methods, semantic chunking ensures information integrity during retrieval, resulting in more accurate and contextually appropriate outcomes.

Both Document Specific Chunking and Semantic Chunking approaches are proving to be particularly promising approaches for improving the domain-specific knowledge base pipeline.

Step 3 is an enhanced search and retrieval. Effective search and retrieval are vital for managing extensive medical databases. By aligning document ingestion with metadata and vector embedding generation, the search mechanism can retrieve relevant text blocks and their contextual metadata. This enhances the accuracy of responses from Domain AI applications, providing precise information retrieval in medical service and device management.

### Multisociety guidance for sterilization and high-level disinfection [^7c5734fe]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). High credibility.

Processing structure for sterilization and high-level disinfection (HLD) — centralized versus decentralized: No recommendation can be made for processing structure; however, facilities should assess the role of centralized or decentralized processing structures in minimizing the risk of processing failures, patient risk, and risk to HCP. The structure of processing may be described as centralized or decentralized, some facilities employ a hybrid approach with a portion maintained centrally and a portion decentralized, and the organizational structure chosen can impact risk of processing failures and risks to patients and HCP. Centralized processing conducts all processing in one location or utilizes a common oversight structure (eg, shared leadership, competencies) when processing is done in more than one.

### Consensus statement on advancing research in emergency department operations and its impact on patient care [^c4e5b049]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The consensus conference on "Advancing Research in Emergency Department (ED) Operations and Its Impact on Patient Care", hosted by The ED Operations Study Group (EDOSG), convened to craft a framework for future investigations in this important but understudied area. The EDOSG is a research consortium dedicated to promoting evidence-based clinical practice in emergency medicine. The consensus process format was a modified version of the NIH Model for Consensus Conference Development. Recommendations provide an action plan for how to improve ED operations study design, create a facilitating research environment, identify data measures of value for process and outcomes research, and disseminate new knowledge in this area. Specifically, we call for eight key initiatives: 1) the development of universal measures for ED patient care processes; 2) attention to patient outcomes, in addition to process efficiency and best practice compliance; 3) the promotion of multisite clinical operations studies to create more generalizable knowledge; 4) encouraging the use of mixed methods to understand the social community and human behavior factors that influence ED operations; 5) the creation of robust ED operations research registries to drive stronger evidence-based research; 6) prioritizing key clinical questions with the input of patients, clinicians, medical leadership, emergency medicine organizations, payers, and other government stakeholders; 7) more consistently defining the functional components of the ED care system, including observation units, fast tracks, waiting rooms, laboratories, and radiology subunits; and 8) maximizing multidisciplinary knowledge dissemination via emergency medicine, public health, general medicine, operations research, and nontraditional publications.

### Clinical practice guideline development manual: a quality-driven approach for translating evidence into action [^47860569]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines translate best evidence into best practice. A well-crafted guideline promotes quality by reducing health-care variations, improving diagnostic accuracy, promoting effective therapy, and discouraging ineffective-or potentially harmful-interventions. Despite a plethora of published guidelines, methodology is often poorly defined and varies greatly within and among organizations.

Purpose

This manual describes the principles and practices used successfully by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery to produce quality-driven, evidence-based guidelines using efficient and transparent methodology for action-ready recommendations with multidisciplinary applicability. The development process, which allows moving from conception to completion in 12 months, emphasizes a logical sequence of key action statements supported by amplifying text, evidence profiles, and recommendation grades that link action to evidence.

Conclusions

As clinical practice guidelines become more prominent as a key metric of quality health care, organizations must develop efficient production strategies that balance rigor and pragmatism. Equally important, clinicians must become savvy in understanding what guidelines are-and are not-and how they are best utilized to improve care. The information in this manual should help clinicians and organizations achieve these goals.

It is important to have a clear and defined organisational structure as this provides the basis for a quality programme and ensures the structure reflects the needs of the registry, its affiliations, and customers. The general information includes the DR's organisational structure and the basis of its operation. Cooperating affiliates such as DCs, testing laboratories, (CC) etc. are functionally part of the DR's performance and are required to comply with WMDA Standards.

There needs to be a sufficient number of trained personnel to carry out DC operations, and assurance that staff are qualified for the tasks they perform. Qualifications are identified based on job responsibility as well as assigned tasks. Staff members must be made aware of the sensitive nature of their job, and the importance of confidentiality must be defined in policies and procedures, as per national regulatory and applicable standard requirements. It is important to ensure that staff are trained to maintain anonymity of the potential donors and transplant — patients and rules of disclosure must be established.

There are many medical issues that can arise during the day-to-day activities within a DC, including donor health/eligibility issues, unusual (TC) requests or complications during the stem cell collection process. There should be at least one designated physician to review these issues to provide guidance and direction regarding each case. These physicians should be experts in the field of stem cell transplantation and histocompatibility and should have a broad familiarity with general medicine, in accordance with national regulations and registry specific requirements.

Management of key DC processes is achieved through process control methods such as standard operating procedures (SOPs). Specific performance goals should also be identified and reviewed, and the DC should be able to demonstrate that enough people are working in each area to meet these goals. Mechanisms should also be in place to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), as this is important for identifying any changes that may be required in staffing or processes.

Selecting dependable, quality suppliers who provide services to support DC functions is essential. A system of review and monitoring is important to assess and ensure conformance to the standards, regulations, policies, and procedures. Monitoring and review methods are determined between the DR and DC and should include practices such as internal/external audits, laboratory proficiency testing, outcomes data collection, review of quality indicators and feedback from customers and other stakeholders.

### Health-care organization characteristics in cancer care delivery: an integrated conceptual framework with content validation [^2338519b]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2024). Medium credibility.

Context can influence cancer-related outcomes. For example, health-care organization characteristics, including ownership, leadership, and culture, can affect care access, communication, and patient outcomes. Health-care organization characteristics and other contextual factors can also influence whether and how clinical discoveries reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality. Importantly, policy, market, and technology changes are transforming health-care organization design, culture, and operations across the cancer continuum. Consequently, research is essential to examine when, for whom, and how organizational characteristics influence person-level, organization-level, and population-level cancer outcomes. Understanding organizational characteristics-the structures, processes, and other features of entities involved in health care delivery-and their dynamics is an important yet understudied area of care delivery research across the cancer continuum. Research incorporating organizational characteristics is critical to address health inequities, test care delivery models, adapt interventions, and strengthen implementation. The field lacks conceptual grounding, however, to help researchers identify germane organizational characteristics. We propose a framework identifying organizational characteristics relevant for cancer care delivery research based on conceptual work in health services, organizational behavior, and management science and refined using a systematic review and key informant input. The proposed framework is a tool for organizing existing research and enhancing future cancer care delivery research. Following a 2012 Journal of the National Cancer Institute monograph, this work complements National Cancer Institute efforts to stimulate research addressing the relationship between cancer outcomes and contextual factors at the patient, provider, team, delivery organization, community, and health policy levels.

### Understanding health care organization needs and context. beyond performance gaps [^f04341fd]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Significant efforts have been invested in improving our understanding of how to accelerate and magnify the impact of research on clinical practice. While approaches to fostering translation of research into practice are numerous, none appears to be superior and the evidence for their effectiveness is mixed. Lessons learned from formative evaluation have given us a greater appreciation of the contribution of context to successful implementation of quality improvement interventions. While formative evaluation is a powerful tool for addressing context effects during implementation, lessons learned from the social sciences (including management and operations research, sociology, and public health) show us that there are also powerful preimplementation tools available to us. This paper discusses how we might integrate these tools into implementation research. We provide a theoretical framework for our need to understand organizational contexts and how organizational characteristics can alert us to situations where preimplementation tools will prove most valuable.

### Improving the quality and efficiency of conventional in-center hemodialysis [^02af6810]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

There is substantial variability at international, national, and regional levels in how effective dialysis providers are in the implementation of well-accepted interventions to deliver better health outcomes at reduced costs to payers. The growing number of dialysis patients within a finite pool of resources has led to searches for more efficient methods to provide patient care without compromising or diminishing quality. We review here some contemporary concepts surrounding quality improvement and operations research that may provide clinician administrators to both improve efficiency and quality in facility based hemodialysis units. The creation of balanced scorecards, utilization of process mapping techniques, and the application of LEAN principles may readily improve how hemodialysis care is delivered in an environment of increasing patient volumes and reduced operating resources.

### A NICE perspective on computable biomedical knowledge [^9ad568c4]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2020). High credibility.

Issues of risk and responsibility become still more complex when third party developers of decision support systems are involved in the dissemination of guidance. In simple terms there is agreement from most parties that there are issues of safety and issues of inefficiency in sharing guidelines or recommendations from guideline producer to decision support providers. There is also agreement and much research that demonstrates increased structure and coding are a fundamental part of the solution to these issues. There is, however, little clarity currently for NICE or others across the system on what levels of structure and coding are actually needed, who would apply this structure, and what certainty there is across the system that this would actually improve uptake of guidance and improve patient outcomes. In short, the business case for NICE and others across the system to invest in fully computable guidelines remains unclear. This makes it very difficult for anyone to move forwards — this stalemate therefore needs to be addressed as a priority. This challenge is not new, but opportunities provided by novel technologies, alignment across the system regarding approach and the growing need for action present new opportunities to tackle the problem. NICE is keen to help in this regard as part of its 'NICE Connect' programme.

NICE Connect is a multiyear project underway at NICE, to transform how we produce and present our guidance. Launched in response to user feedback and an increasingly large and complex portfolio of guidance and other products, NICE Connect outlines a vision for the future that builds on NICE's place as an international leader in evidence synthesis, guidance development and technology evaluation. NICE's offer to the heath and care system will be developed and improved, with advice integrated along care pathways, accessible to users wherever and whenever they need it, and always up to date.

In the future, recommendations will be short, focused and framed within questions that are important to practitioners and the public. Further detail will be accessible through layers of information, including evidence summaries where needed to support shared decision making. The changes will be carefully balanced with the needs and constraints set out by the scientific methods used to analyse and summarise evidence and develop recommendations.

### Utilization review in workers' compensation: review of current status and recommendations for future improvement [^e3c05ec2]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Outcomes and metrics — The UR process requires continuous or periodic assessment to determine if program goals are being achieved, with desirable goals including contributing to patient recovery and return to work, promoting reasonable and necessary care delivered in a timely manner, avoiding ineffective or unnecessary and potentially harmful treatments, promoting high versus low value care (ie, cost-effective care), and maintaining stakeholder satisfaction. This assessment of system efficacy, impact, or harm requires development of meaningful and measurable outcomes metrics, and stakeholder quality performance has to be measured and tracked on a continuous or sufficiently frequent periodic basis (eg, quarterly) to ensure maintenance of quality and/or opportunity for timely quality improvement. Results need to be carefully analyzed to determine if meaningful quality metrics are being achieved; if not, adopted metrics should be subject to root cause analysis, and used to provide useful feedback to system participants as part of the process of developing action plans to address quality deficiencies (including education, policy, procedural change, and monitoring to prevent recurrence). The analytic process evaluating metrics should determine if there is a need to periodically revise quality targets to further improve performance and outcomes, to assess if there is a need to adopt new metrics or if some measures no longer require tracking due to the effectiveness of designed and implemented system policies and procedures. Redundancy, duplication, and excessive paperwork can be a significant barrier to efficient UR, and an effort should be made to facilitate efficient review of the relevant clinical information wherever possible to help reduce the burden on requesting providers by repeatedly submit the same documentation. "Outcomes based networks" or "Preferred provider status" may allow exemption from or reduction of UR requirements for certain practitioners who comply with network policies and procedures, use evidence-based practice, and have demonstrated better outcomes, and preferred providers can reduce administrative burdens and potential delays of care, improve efficiency, and satisfaction.

Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Limitations, challenges, and arguments against incorporating resource and value considerations — barriers and gaps are described, including variability in value across settings, integration of long-term costs, and lack of national consensus, while noting hopes for routine cost-effectiveness assessment and acknowledging system-level changes are not addressed. Barriers include "widespread unwillingness to acknowledge that resources are limited, distrust of government and other policy decision makers, and lack of confidence in the science of value determination (cost-effectiveness)." Value "is not constant; it may vary over time and from one location to another," and integrating "long-term costs" like infrastructure into per-treatment costs is challenging. "In the United States, no national consensus has emerged regarding the role of cost-effectiveness considerations in healthcare decision making," but "the writing committee… will encourage routine assessment of cost-effectiveness," and it "recognizes" that a focus on individual procedures "does not address system changes that may improve efficiency of cardiovascular care."

### Clinical practice guideline development manual, third edition: a quality-driven approach for translating evidence into action [^2f113ef9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines translate best evidence into best practice. A well-crafted guideline promotes quality by reducing health care variations, improving diagnostic accuracy, promoting effective therapy, and discouraging ineffective-or potentially harmful-interventions. Despite a plethora of published guidelines, methodology is often poorly defined and varies greatly within and among organizations.

Purpose

The third edition of this manual describes the principles and practices used successfully by the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation to produce quality-driven, evidence-based guidelines using efficient and transparent methodology for actionable recommendations with multidisciplinary applicability. The development process emphasizes a logical sequence of key action statements supported by amplifying text, action statement profiles, and recommendation grades linking action to evidence. New material in this edition includes standards for trustworthy guidelines, updated classification of evidence levels, increased patient and public involvement, assessing confidence in the evidence, documenting differences of opinion, expanded discussion of conflict of interest, and use of computerized decision support for crafting actionable recommendations.

Conclusion

As clinical practice guidelines become more prominent as a key metric of quality health care, organizations must develop efficient production strategies that balance rigor and pragmatism. Equally important, clinicians must become savvy in understanding what guidelines are — and are not — and how they are best used to improve care. The information in this manual should help clinicians and organizations achieve these goals.

### SQUIRE 2.0 (standards for QUality improvement reporting excellence): revised publication guidelines from a detailed consensus process [^45237ea8]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2016). Medium credibility.

Initiative

A broad term that can refer to organisation-wide programmes, narrowly focused projects or the details of specific interventions (eg, planning, execution and assessment).

Internal validity

Demonstrable, credible evidence for efficacy (meaningful impact or change) resulting from introduction of a specific intervention into a particular healthcare system.

Intervention(s)

The specific activities and tools introduced into a healthcare system with the aim of changing its performance for the better. Complete description of an intervention includes its inputs, internal activities and outputs (eg, in the form of a logic model) and the mechanism(s) by which these components are expected to produce changes in a system's performance.

Opportunity costs

Loss of the ability to perform other tasks or meet other responsibilities resulting from the diversion of resources needed to introduce, test or sustain a particular improvement initiative.

Problem

Meaningful disruption, failure, inadequacy, distress, confusion or other dysfunction in a healthcare service delivery system that adversely affects patients, staff or the system as a whole, or that prevents care from reaching its full potential.

Process

The routines and other activities through which healthcare services are delivered.

Rationale

Explanation of why particular intervention(s) were chosen, and why it was expected to work, be sustainable and be replicable elsewhere.

Systems

The interrelated structures, people, processes and activities that together create healthcare services for and with individual patients and populations. For example, systems exist from the personal self-care system of a patient to the individual provider–patient dyad system, to the microsystem, to the macrosystem and all the way to the market/social/insurance system. These levels are nested within each other.

Theory or theories

Any 'reason-giving' account that asserts causal relationships between variables (causal theory) or that makes sense of an otherwise obscure process or situation (explanatory theory). Theories come in many forms, and serve different purposes in the phases of improvement work. It is important to be explicit and well founded about any informal and formal theory (or theories) that are used.

### Interventions to improve the use of systematic reviews in decision-making by health system managers, policy makers and clinicians [^5554fef4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Systematic reviews provide a transparent and robust summary of existing research. However, health system managers, national and local policy makers and healthcare professionals can face several obstacles when attempting to utilise this evidence. These include constraints operating within the health system, dealing with a large volume of research evidence and difficulties in adapting evidence from systematic reviews so that it is locally relevant. In an attempt to increase the use of systematic review evidence in decision-making a number of interventions have been developed. These include summaries of systematic review evidence that are designed to improve the accessibility of the findings of systematic reviews (often referred to as information products) and changes to organisational structures, such as employing specialist groups to synthesise the evidence to inform local decision-making.

Objectives

To identify and assess the effects of information products based on the findings of systematic review evidence and organisational supports and processes designed to support the uptake of systematic review evidence by health system managers, policy makers and healthcare professionals.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Health Economic Evaluations Database. We also handsearched two journals (Implementation Science and Evidence and Policy), Cochrane Colloquium abstracts, websites of key organisations and reference lists of studies considered for inclusion. Searches were run from 1992 to March 2011 on all databases, an update search to March 2012 was run on MEDLINE only.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), interrupted time-series (ITS) and controlled before-after studies (CBA) of interventions designed to aid the use of systematic reviews in healthcare decision-making were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed the study quality. We extracted the median value across similar outcomes for each study and reported the range of values for each median value. We calculated the median of the two middlemost values if an even number of outcomes were reported.

Main Results

We included eight studies evaluating the effectiveness of different interventions designed to support the uptake of systematic review evidence. The overall quality of the evidence was very low to moderate. Two cluster RCTs evaluated the effectiveness of multifaceted interventions, which contained access to systematic reviews relevant to reproductive health, to change obstetric care; the high baseline performance in some of the key clinical indicators limited the findings of these studies. There were no statistically significant effects on clinical practice for all but one of the clinical indicators in selected obstetric units in Thailand (median effect size 4.2%, range -11.2% to 18.2%) and none in Mexico (median effect size 3.5%, range 0.1% to 19.0%). In the second cluster RCT there were no statistically significant differences in selected obstetric units in the UK (median effect RR 0.92; range RR 0.57 to RR 1.10). One RCT evaluated the perceived understanding and ease of use of summary of findings tables in Cochrane Reviews. The median effect of the differences in responses for the acceptability of including summary of findings tables in Cochrane Reviews versus not including them was 16%, range 1% to 28%. One RCT evaluated the effect of an analgesic league table, derived from systematic review evidence, and there was no statistically significant effect on self-reported pain. Only one RCT evaluated an organisational intervention (which included a knowledge broker, access to a repository of systematic reviews and provision of tailored messages), and reported no statistically significant difference in evidence informed programme planning. Three interrupted time series studies evaluated the dissemination of printed bulletins based on evidence from systematic reviews. A statistically significant reduction in the rates of surgery for glue ear in children under 10 years (mean annual decline of -10.1%; 95% CI -7.9 to -12.3) and in children under 15 years (quarterly reduction -0.044; 95% CI -0.080 to -0.011) was reported. The distribution to general practitioners of a bulletin on the treatment of depression was associated with a statistically significant lower prescribing rate each quarter than that predicted by the rates of prescribing observed before the distribution of the bulletin (8.2%; P = 0.005).

Authors' Conclusions

Mass mailing a printed bulletin which summarises systematic review evidence may improve evidence-based practice when there is a single clear message, if the change is relatively simple to accomplish, and there is a growing awareness by users of the evidence that a change in practice is required. If the intention is to develop awareness and knowledge of systematic review evidence, and the skills for implementing this evidence, a multifaceted intervention that addresses each of these aims may be required, though there is insufficient evidence to support this approach.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^85ee0ebd]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Incident Command System (ICS) (Section 3.10) describes ICS as an integral part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's National Incident Management System (NIMS), a widely applicable management system that integrates facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and communications within a common organizational structure; notes that the ICS organizational structure is scalable and modular; states that some agencies use an ICS structure and others do not; advises agencies to decide in advance whether and how to apply an ICS and, if applicable, to incorporate it into response planning and training; and specifies that if someone claims food tampering or intentional contamination is suspected, law enforcement officials should be notified, the threat's credibility assessed, and if credible the outbreak will move into a law enforcement realm with activation of the ICS.

### Clinical practice guidelines: towards better quality guidelines and increased international collaboration [^7be9a3a1]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GUIDELINE DEVELOPERS

To ensure that guidelines are of high quality, they should be preferably developed within a structured and coordinated guidelines programme (Table 2

Table 2
Key criteria for good clinical guideline programmes). A recent French 'before–after' controlled study confirmed the positive impact of the newly established SOR guidelines programme on medical practice for cancer management. Sufficient budget and resources are also needed. However, substantial savings could be made by active cooperation between national and international guideline organisations. This could include the exchange of existing cancer guidelines and evidence reports, collaboration for literature searches for revision of those guidelines, and organising joint peer review of draft guidelines. However, effective and efficient collaboration requires that the methodological principles are common. The development of the AGREE instrument, which involved the participation of leaders from various guideline development organizations, revealed an increased international consensus and willingness to work together. Recent programmes may benefit from the methodology created by more established programmes. However, it must also be kept in mind that each country has its own norms and values that influence the content and presentation of guidelines. Therefore, the aim should not be to develop international guidelines, but to reach international agreement about the requirements for methodology and reporting of guidelines. The AGREE instrument is an excellent aid for improving the reporting of guidelines. For instance, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) provides a guide with examples derived from SIGN guidelines, adjacent to each item, on how information can be made available. Uniform reporting gives a certain guarantee of quality. Moreover, it simplifies the comparison of guidelines for the same clinical conditions. For the development (or revision) of guidelines, the use of existing high-quality guidelines (for instance, guidelines included in the US National Guideline Clearing house) can save a lot of time and effort. For example, the literature search and review could be used when similar questions are being examined. Above all, it is useful to see how other guideline development groups have collected and interpreted the evidence and how they have translated the evidence into recommendations. After publication, guidelines must be disseminated and implemented effectively. Guideline developers should be aware of the potential facilitators for and barriers to implementation when they are formulating the recommendations. If substantial changes in practice are necessary to apply the recommendations, additional information should be added with practical suggestions, for example, about improved organisation of the care processes. They should also pay particular attention to the format and presentation of the guideline, for example, by providing short summaries that can be easily used during contacts with patients. Furthermore, application tools should be developed, such as indicators for performance assessment, teaching materials, patient information pamphlets, or computer decision-aids. It is important to involve the end users in the development process to ensure local acceptance and relevance to local practice.

### Guideline adaptation: an approach to enhance efficiency in guideline development and improve utilisation [^bca641a2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2011). Medium credibility.

Background

Developing and updating high-quality guidelines requires substantial time and resources. To reduce duplication of effort and enhance efficiency, we developed a process for guideline adaptation and assessed initial perceptions of its feasibility and usefulness.

Methods

Based on preliminary developments and empirical studies, a series of meetings with guideline experts were organised to define a process for guideline adaptation (ADAPTE) and to develop a manual and a toolkit made available on a website (http://www.adapte.org). Potential users, guideline developers and implementers, were invited to register and to complete a questionnaire evaluating their perception about the proposed process.

Results

The ADAPTE process consists of three phases (set-up, adaptation, finalisation), 9 modules and 24 steps. The adaptation phase involves identifying specific clinical questions, searching for, retrieving and assessing available guidelines, and preparing the draft adapted guideline. Among 330 registered individuals (46 countries), 144 completed the questionnaire. A majority found the ADAPTE process clear (78%), comprehensive (69%) and feasible (60%), and the manual useful (79%). However, 21% found the ADAPTE process complex. 44% feared that they will not find appropriate and high-quality source guidelines.

Discussion

A comprehensive framework for guideline adaptation has been developed to meet the challenges of timely guideline development and implementation. The ADAPTE process generated important interest among guideline developers and implementers. The majority perceived the ADAPTE process to be feasible, useful and leading to improved methodological rigour and guideline quality. However, some de novo development might be needed if no high quality guideline exists for a given topic.

### Health policy and systems research: towards a better understanding and review of ethical issues [^db9dabc7]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The WHO identified the need to develop a framework outlining ethical considerations relating to health policy and systems research. The need for capacity building in local research ethics committees to improve quality and efficiency of review of global health research is also highlighted in the literature. Appropriate ethical conduct and review of health policy and systems research requires a broad understanding of the practicalities of health policy and systems research, how it differs from clinical and other health research, which ethical principles apply and how they may be upheld despite different applications.

Health policy and systems research aims to promote generation, dissemination and use of knowledge relating to all aspects of the health system. Its major goals include understanding existing health system functioning, how system components interact, how health policy is generated and implemented and how to improve efficiency and performance of health systems. Health policy and systems research differs from clinical research where often a single disease is studied; usually under controlled conditions, interventions are implemented at an individual subject level and outcomes are measured in the same subject. Health policy and systems research is often conducted in 'real-world' contexts, embedded within existing policies and practices which may have inherent risks. The line between research and practice may therefore be blurred. Many circumstances in contexts where health policy and systems research is conducted are beyond the researchers' control, raising questions regarding the accountability of researchers regarding the research activities. The benefits of health policy and systems research are realised through impact on communities, institutions and systems functioning rather than changes in an individual's health. The main users of health policy and systems research are policy makers and managers who focus on system-wide health issues, in contrast to clinicians in clinical research.

### Enhancing capability for continuous organisational improvement and learning in healthcare organisations: a systematic review of the literature 2013–2022 [^a8198fe7]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Engaged managers with a strategic approach

How managers acted was described to some extent in most of the studies. In interventions where COIL capability increased, managers acted strategically by choosing objectives that aligned with overarching organisational goalsand were perceived as meaningful for the employees. Interventions were prepared and planned, based on an understanding of the situation, and sometimes also planned to start small and then expand. Managers allocated resources, mainly in the form of time for staff to train and participate in the intervention work, and the approach could be explicitly adapted to be time-effective and cost-effective. Key stakeholders were involved, at least to some degree, for example, cliniciansand patients. In some of the studies with a larger scope, managers also considered multiple levels of the organisation or process, with a systems view.

An overwhelming amount of the factors that were described as hindering the interventions was related to the lack of management support and strategy, and not having enough resources, as well as the lack of clear goals and expectations, and lack of prioritisation between projects. The involvement of different stakeholdersand a systems viewwere among the most often described facilitating factors. Engaged and strategic managers were also commonly mentionedas well as the planning of the intervention with a shared understanding and shared objectives.

External training and guidance to develop internal knowledge, skills and confidence

One common attribute of interventions that increased COIL capability was the use of external support in the form of coaching, facilitation, training or other expert knowledge. Coaching and facilitation in particular were mentioned in several studies, with three of the studies focusing on different aspects of facilitation and coaching. Important attributes of an effective coach/facilitator were to provide guidance through the change process, to address resistance, and being aware of their own process and how it affects the individuals/teams they work with. Tailoring the approach was important for coaching, facilitation and training, and for the methods and tools that were used.

In many of the studies, some of these expert skills were developed internally in the organisation, with employees acting as coaches, trainers or mentors either from the beginning of the interventionor after some time and training had passed. Internal champions could also emerge from the groups of employees without external guidance, to lead the projects within the groups.

The skills related to coaching and facilitation were among the most often described facilitating factors. The lack of these skills, or not using the available expertise, were also commonly described as hindering factors.

### Prioritising quality improvement [^488f3886]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Where to start?

With so many possible areas where improvements might be made, it can feel like an impossible task to choose which should take priority. Improvement often needs several iterative cycles before solutions that work emerge. Sustained improvement takes time and effort, and it is easy to get demoralised if practices or individuals take on too many projects and can't follow them through. It is tempting to prioritise the areas that affect practice income or please regulators rather than projects that matter more to patients and staff.

High quality care develops when an organisational culture promotes curiosity, experimentation, and continuous small cycles of change, particularly when changes are designed and driven by the people delivering care, in full collaboration with patients. Quality improvement is a team sport and is played best when owned by those making the improvements. Projects work best when priorities are set locally unless external benchmarking data show problems with patient safety or quality of care or practice viability is being affected by poor performance in financially driven targets.

Primary care doctors have an important role in quality improvement. They need to be aware of practice performance data and find ways to present it to the practice team and patients in a meaningful way — for example, by taking into account variations in practice demographics and list turnover.

The increase in primary care workload without a matched increase in funding limits the time available for practice development and improvement. Although there has been some attempt to rectify this, until the effects are felt at the frontline, practices must prioritise improvements that focus on working more effectively and efficiently. This is in line with the NHS sustainable improvement programme Time for Care. Feedback from participants of the programme indicates that it has improved job satisfaction and teamwork and embedded basic quality improvement methods that practices can apply to other aspects of care such as patient outcomes and access.

Improvement won't happen unless people take action. The importance of "starting with why" has been recognised in many workplace environments, and healthcare delivery and improvement is no different. If people working in a practice have a strong sense of purpose and know why they do what they do, they will notice when current performance isn't delivering their aspirations. This can generate improvement priorities that resonate with the values, vision, and purpose of the team and the organisation. Using these priorities to create broad themes over time creates a coherent and meaningful improvement plan that everyone understands and can work towards.

### Reinvigorating stagnant science: implementation laboratories and a meta-laboratory to efficiently advance the science of audit and feedback [^6e683ef9]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Why stop there? Let's build the meta-laboratory

Individual implementation laboratories cannot adequately address the remaining uncertainties around A&F for a number of reasons. First, an individual laboratory will only be able to evaluate a limited number of A&F variants. Second, implementation science is interested in the generalisability of findings from individual laboratories suggesting the need for replication across other settings. Finally, while inner context variables are likely to vary within an individual laboratory, the outer context variables (eg, governance, accountability and reimbursement arrangements)are likely to be common across healthcare organisations and/or professionals receiving A&F. As such, individual laboratories cannot inform us about the likely impact of these outer context variables on the effectiveness of A&F.

Fully addressing the remaining uncertainties around A&F may require a 'meta-laboratory' approach: a coordinated set of implementation laboratories, in which findings from interventions tested in one context could inform decisions for another context, to facilitate a cumulative science in the field. This approach would allow for shared expertise, opportunities for planned replication to explore replicability and outer context issues and would build an international community of healthcare system partners with shared interests. The meta-laboratory would contribute to the reduction of research waste through this shared expertise and planned replication as study results and insights from one implementation laboratory can be used to inform study design and conduct for another implementation laboratory.

A meta-laboratory could form a collaborative space encouraging linkages between researchers undertaking innovative theoreticalor developmental workwith researchers in implementation laboratories to ensure the timely translation of promising innovations into large-scale evaluations within implementation laboratories. Meta-laboratories could provide state-of-the-art, regularly updated resources for both healthcare systems planning A&F activities and researchers planning future research studies (including promoting full and transparent reporting of laboratories activities).

Announcing the Audit and Feedback MetaLab

There are an increasing number of A&F laboratories globally (see table 1). We have established the Audit and Feedback MetaLab involving researchers and laboratories from five countries (Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA). To date, the Audit and Feedback MetaLab has held annual international symposia (Ottawa 2016, Leeds 2017, Toronto 2018 and another planned in Amsterdam 2019) each involving a scientific meeting and an open meeting with training activities for healthcare systems and organisations delivering A&F programmes. We have established a website providing a 'one-stop shop' of resources about designing and evaluating A&F.

### HRS expert consensus statement on remote interrogation and monitoring for cardiovascular implantable electronic devices [^b557651a]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Medium credibility.

Remote interrogation (RI) and remote monitoring (RM) for cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) follow-up were developed as complementary tools to replace some routine follow-up appointments during the long-term phase while maintaining an in-person evaluation (IPE) schedule of at least 6–12 months. Since 2008, randomized controlled trials comparing IPE and remote management strategies have collectively shown the superiority of RI and RM for achieving the follow-up goals of patient adherence to structured follow-up protocols and improvement in device clinic workflow efficiency, and the advent of automatic wireless RM has been critical to these results. Implementation focuses on organizational changes ranging from the occasional replacement of routine appointments to a system of nearly continuous monitoring, with most IPEs initiated in response to alert notifications communicated by RM. The terms RI and RM are often used interchangeably, with RM being the colloquially accepted term for both.

### ACCF / ACR / AHA / ASE / ASNC / HRS / NASCI / RSNA / SAIP / SCAI / SCCT / SCMR 2008 health policy statement on structured reporting in cardiovascular imaging [^4e14029d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular imaging structured reporting — introduction, definitions, benefits, and policy stance are outlined as follows: The final report is an essential component of any cardiovascular imaging test, is often the only communication from the interpreting physician to the caregiver, may be used for billing, quality improvement (QI), teaching, and informing patients and their families, may become legal evidence, and producing the highest quality report is an important goal for both optimal outcomes and cost efficiency. In a narrow sense, structured reporting refers to the displayed clinical report of a CV imaging procedure using standardized content and definitions in a coherent, clinically relevant, and predictable format; in a broader sense, it is the process of organizing data by abstracting and integrating all evidence collected to create an integrated and comprehensive clinical report, and for this document the term refers to both the underlying coded structured data and the displayed clinical report. Rationale and benefits include that imaging quality may be improved and QI activities facilitated through consistency, key report components and data elements will not be omitted when elements are listed systematically within a standard template, common lexicons standardize descriptors, redundant testing may be reduced with potential sparing of unnecessary exposures, comparisons between studies facilitated, interoperability with electronic medical record systems is supported, and cost savings may be achieved by added efficiency for imagers, referring physicians, hospital systems, and purchasers of health care. The principles discussed apply broadly to all forms of cardiovascular imaging, though application in vascular imaging and congenital heart disease may require additional consideration. Structured reporting can be seen not only as a quality improvement vital to "best practices" in imaging laboratories, but also as critical to patient care and safety, and the organizations involved call for its use as essential to quality cardiovascular imaging practice, including that imaging laboratories collect data in structured format, physicians practice structured reporting procedures, imaging and information systems support structured data archiving and reporting formats, and reporting software implements structured composition and other required features for interoperability; adherence to structured reporting principles is necessary to societal and professional efforts to measure, report, and improve quality.

### Critical care delivery: the importance of process of care and ICU structure to improved outcomes: an update from the American college of critical care medicine task force on models of critical care [^56da116a]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In 2001, the Society of Critical Care Medicine published practice model guidelines that focused on the delivery of critical care and the roles of different ICU team members. An exhaustive review of the additional literature published since the last guideline has demonstrated that both the structure and process of care in the ICU are important for achieving optimal patient outcomes. Since the publication of the original guideline, several authorities have recognized that improvements in the processes of care, ICU structure, and the use of quality improvement science methodologies can beneficially impact patient outcomes and reduce costs. Herein, we summarize findings of the American College of Critical Care Medicine Task Force on Models of Critical Care: 1) An intensivist-led, high-performing, multidisciplinary team dedicated to the ICU is an integral part of effective care delivery; 2) Process improvement is the backbone of achieving high-quality ICU outcomes; 3) Standardized protocols including care bundles and order sets to facilitate measurable processes and outcomes should be used and further developed in the ICU setting; and 4) Institutional support for comprehensive quality improvement programs as well as tele-ICU programs should be provided.

### Quality of care and abortion: beyond safety [^bb4adf23]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2018). Medium credibility.

In the quality of care literature, quality is further categorised as interpersonal quality, or the healthcare interaction, and technical quality, whether providers meet normative standards for appropriate care or evidence-based criteria. Patient or client experience can assess both interpersonal and technical quality, measures the client-centeredness of care, and "includes any process observable by patients, including subjective experiences (eg, pain was controlled), objective experiences (eg, waited more than 15 minutes past appointment time), and observations of physician, nurse, or staff behaviour (eg, doctor provided all relevant information)". It is important to note that client experience reports are distinct from 'satisfaction' ratings in that they reflect specific components of the care experience in contrast to a global rating.

Patient or client experience has been shown to be linked with other elements of quality of in-hospital care, including clinical processes and structures, effectiveness, efficiency and safety. Client experience also impacts behaviours such as adherence, follow-up decisions and behaviour change. Most literature that seeks to describe the relationship between experience of care, domains of quality of care, and health or behavioural outcomes comes from other fields; it is not known whether these relationships hold in abortion care.

Evidence exists to guide clinical practice in abortion. However, assessment of clinical practice remains unstandardised, and very little evidence exists documenting client perceptions of both technical or interpersonal quality, especially from low- and middle-income country settings. Women who receive needed abortion services are nearly universally satisfied, but this may be due to having received a needed service and tells us little about where quality can be improved. The limited evidence available suggests that similar elements of care are as important to abortion clients as to patients seeking other types of healthcare: wait times, pain management and experience of pain, and treatment by staff and providers. More work is needed to advance a set of evidence-based, validated quality metrics that help us identify which aspects of the client experience – both technical and interpersonal – are most important to women seeking care and most likely to impact other domains of quality such as effectiveness and safety.

### From measures to action: can integrating quality measures provide system-wide insights for quality improvement decision making? [^fb1dd5b5]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2023). High credibility.

General systems theory describes that for systems, such as healthcare systems, with interconnected components, emergent behaviours arise from the system that does not appear in any individual components. For cancer care delivery, and in the typical case of a patient receiving care from multiple specialties across several settings, a change in a healthcare provider's decisions and actions can change the context for other healthcare providers. This phenomenon of complex systems explains why an examination of the parts, such as through quality measures, gives us no information about the coordination of parts and processes. In other words, it is in the coordination and interconnection of information between the parts or processes that higher-level behaviours emerge. It is those behaviours that need to be understood to develop quality improvement interventions that can target them. While very few examples exist of using system-based methodologies such as discrete-event simulation, agent-based modelling and others to develop an understanding of the behaviour of a system from administrative claims data, it is fundamentally in the aggregation of the sequence of delivered care (patient healthcare trajectory) where patterns of systemic interconnection can emerge. Consequently, a systems approach to quality measurement — with the creation of systemic mathematical constructs — is very likely required to make system-level improvement decisions that take into consideration upstream and downstream effects to minimise unintended consequences.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1b0a2530]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Appropriate scope and caveats for cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs): The intention of CEAs is not to directly influence patient-level decision-making; instead, systematically applying CEAs at the health system level can promote efficient resource use and improve population health outcomes and would ideally be performed across the entire set of options rather than evaluating each intervention in a silo. CEAs can inform the prices of new health technologies entering the market, improving the affordability of and access to novel diagnostic and treatment strategies. Resource allocation is a complex process that, beyond efficiency, depends on political priorities, scalability and affordability of the proposed intervention, and its impact on health equity; this is particularly important in cardiovascular disease given that 1 in 3 US adults received care for a cardiovascular risk factor or condition in 2020. To improve health care efficiency, CEAs have to be updated over the intervention's life cycle and policymakers have to be willing to defund less-efficient programs; adding programs that are "cost-effective" without removing those that are no longer cost-effective continues to drive up health care spending without optimizing efficiency. This statement uses the term CEA for analytic frameworks with effectiveness outcomes that reflect patient or community preferences over health states (eg, quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]).

### A scoping review of evidence-based guidance and guidelines published by general practice professional organizations [^f175fc88]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical and policy implications

This review shows that international GP organizations, despite working in different healthcare systems, with different governance structures, produce guidelines with similar topics, methods, and dissemination strategies for use by their members. The standard transparent approach to production methods can facilitate a standardization across GP organizations thus promoting sharing of resources, but this needs to be balanced with the need for local relevance to improve the success of guideline implementation. Emerging evidence on the effectiveness of guideline implementation in terms of improving patient outcomes, may influence policy around the use of alternative strategies to support the use of guidelines in practice.

### Pursuing excellence: the power of selection science to provide meaningful data and enhance efficiency in selecting surgical trainees [^793f5f73]. Annals of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As current screening methods for selecting surgical trainees are receiving increasing scrutiny, development of a more efficient and effective selection system is needed. We describe the process of creating an evidence-based selection system and examine its impact on screening efficiency, faculty perceptions, and improving representation of underrepresented minorities.

Methods

The program partnered with an expert in organizational science to identify fellowship position requirements and associated competencies. Situational judgment tests, personality profiles, structured interviews, and technical skills assessments were used to measure these competencies. The situational judgment test and personality profiles were administered online and used to identify candidates to invite for on-site structured interviews and skills testing. A final rank list was created based on all data points and their respective importance. All faculty completed follow-up surveys regarding their perceptions of the process. Candidate demographic and experience data were pulled from the application website.

Results

Fifty-five of 72 applicants met eligibility requirements and were invited to take the online assessment, with 50 (91%) completing it. Average time to complete was 42 ± 12 minutes. Eighteen applicants (35%) were invited for on-site structured interviews and skills testing-a greater than 50% reduction in number of invites compared to prior years. Time estimates reveal that the process will result in a time savings of 68% for future iterations, compared to traditional methodologies. Fellowship faculty (N = 5) agreed on the value and efficiency of the process. Underrepresented minority candidates increased from an initial 70% to 92% being invited for an interview and ranked using the new screening tools.

Discussion

Applying selection science to the process of choosing surgical trainees is feasible, efficient, and well-received by faculty for making selection decisions.

### Critical care staffing in pandemics and disasters: a consensus report from a subcommittee of the task force for mass critical care-systems strategies to sustain the health care workforce [^dcd0b88b]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Critical care workforce resilience — leadership, communication, and long-term support are emphasized. The document states, "System resilience is also strengthened by the inclusion of HCWs in executive and institutional decisions," and that "Regular training for disaster response, readily available psychological support, and a culture of safety in which staff can communicate concerns without fear of retribution can enhance baseline resilience." It adds, "This decentralization of decision-making can encourage transparency and fairness in policy development." Communication guidance specifies, "Effective communication within an organization is crucial to the resilience of a health care workforce," and that "Information deficits pertaining to PPE availability, rationales for visitation policies, medication and equipment scarcity, and staffing shortages were identified as stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic." Leadership "need to articulate the challenges at hand and the proposed solutions in a transparent and timely manner," and "Any proposed strategies from leadership need to be informed by clinicians' experiences and recommendations," while "communication is most effective when it is multidirectional, fostering vertical communication within the organizational structure as well as horizontal communication within clinical teams." Implementation will require resources: "None of these changes are easy, and many will require financial support from outside of the health systems," and "Long-term resiliency of health systems will require both private and government support and culture shifts." Workforce development is prioritized: "Training pipelines for the next generation of acute care professionals must be supported, with options to include loan repayment programs, tax benefits, and grant funding to increase the pool of clinical educators."

### Explaining organisational responses to a board-level quality improvement intervention: findings from an evaluation in six providers in the english national health service [^b7589679]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, healthcare systems are concerned with strengthening board-level governance of quality. In England, national healthcare regulators are developing approaches, resources and interventions aimed at supporting senior hospital leaders in their role in the governance of quality. There is increasing recognition of the value of organisational theory for understanding the implementation of quality improvement (QI) interventions. In this study, we apply organisational theoryto describe and explain the response of healthcare provider organisations to a board-level QI intervention aimed at supporting senior hospital leaders to develop an organisation-wide QI strategy. We adopt a contingent approachconcerned with identifying the critical variables that influence an organisation's response to a QI intervention.

Organisational responses to QI interventions

We are not aware of any previous studies of board-level interventions in the public healthcare sector. Looking at the effectiveness of improvement interventions more generally, a number of studies have explored how the cultural, structural and political characteristics of the adopting organisation shape its response. These contextual factors may create difficulties in embedding and sustaining changes to practices, and produce unintended consequences.

In their study of the introduction and impact of management interventions in publicly funded healthcare organisations in Canada, Lozeau, Langley and Denisargue that as interventions introduced into public sector hospitals are often borrowed from the private sector, there is a 'compatibility gap' between the assumptions underlying the design of the intervention and the characteristics of the adopting organisation. For example, the adoption of 'strategic planning' by an organisation assumes that senior leaders have the autonomy to make and implement decisions. This assumption may be incompatible with public sector hospitals, where leadership is fragmented, power diffuse and where there are multiple goals (eg, patient care and cost control). The compatibility gap produces a mismatch between the intended and actual use of the intervention. From their findings, Lozeau et al developed a typology of possible organisational responses (table 1).

### Recognizing that evidence is made, not born [^05d47a9e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Seppe compared with the existing paradigm

Beyond therapeutic product manufacturing Quality by Design, various instruments, and/or approaches striving for quality currently exist in R&D and evaluation, such as: Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 66, 67; Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 68; other International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines 69; regulators' jurisdiction‐specific development regulatory guidances 70, 71, 72; traditional and next generation scientific advice 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78; research site regulatory inspections/audits 79, 80, 81; and structured "benefit‐risk," uncertainty and value assessment and management practices. 82, 83, 84, 85, 86 These underqualify as total quality management, however, because: a) the span of planning, production and evaluation components is covered only intermittently, with limited coordination between them; and b) the scope, codification and/or obligations under each of these, influencing the degree, fidelity and consistency in implementation, are highly variable. Of note, only GCP (in its latest revision) specifically mentions quality management approaches, with this simply as allusions to future implementation.

There is at present no comprehensive, systems‐based ability to nip development problems in the bud: (a) explicit, up‐front hazard identification and avoidance planning is missing altogether; (b) real‐time, iterative, multilateral practices are limited; and (c) evaluations regarding product and evidence performance by regulators, HTAs and/or payers occur mostly only late in the development cycle, in peri‐authorization and postauthorization stages. Current practices and cultures, therefore, reflect, at best, an appreciation for quality management approaches, but are disjointed, differ in how best to achieve quality, and generally fall short in terms of practical execution. In addition, where such features are absent (e.g. during much of actual planning of evidence), siloed, intuitive guesswork and potentially suboptimal practices in decision making and conduct of practices/processes are the only option.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) — scope and caveats emphasize that the intention of CEAs is not to directly influence patient-level decision-making, and systematically applying CEAs at the level of the health system can promote efficient use of resources and improve population health outcomes; they would ideally be performed across the entire set of options available to generate health, rather than evaluating each intervention in a silo, which can be challenging in the United States given the fragmented nature of our health care system. CEAs can inform the prices of new health technologies entering the market, thus improving the affordability of and access to novel diagnostic and treatment strategies, while resource allocation is a complex process based on several considerations in addition to the efficient use of resources, including political priorities, scalability and affordability of the proposed intervention, and its impact on health equity; these considerations are particularly important for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease given the large number of individuals affected — 1 in 3 US adults received care for a cardiovascular risk factor or condition in 2020 — and the substantial economic burden of cardiovascular disease. CEAs have to be updated over the intervention's life cycle as more cost and effectiveness data become available, and policymakers have to be willing to defund less-efficient programs already in place, because adding more programs and interventions that are "cost-effective" without removing interventions that are no longer cost-effective continues to drive up health care spending without optimizing efficiency.

### Sustaining improvement of hospital-wide initiative for patient safety and quality: a systematic scoping review [^4a4e06ce]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Process: local integration

Front-line staff ownership and contextualised integration of the intervention into routine workflow was a key to improvement sustainability. Shared accountabilityand ownershipamong staff and localised sustainability plansstrengthened sustainability, while weaker accountabilitydiminished change momentum. Modifying the intervention to adapt to the local context made it more relevant to the context. In the case of implementing a predeveloped programme, high fidelity demonstrated benefits to sustainability, while low fidelity impaired delivering critical aspects of the programme. A lack of fit or customisation to local contexts hindered coherent understanding of the intervention and the viability of continued improvement. Integrating the intervention into local workflowwas a fundamental facilitator, while routinising it provided 'reliability of occurrence'to involved staff. Sustained improvement also meant that the integration was co-led by stakeholders, informed by data evaluationwith continual revisits to the implementation.

Process: continued effort following the active implementation

The second most emphasised element overall to improvement sustainability was continued activities to reinforce change after the active implementation phase. The activities often took forms of ongoing evaluationand feedbackto all stakeholders from front line to executives. Transparencyand observabilityof progress for involved staff facilitated sustainability. Shared learning, ongoing stakeholder engagementand educationplayed roles in continuing change momentum to support sustainability. Ongoing and regular reinforcement of change, aligned with organisational priorities, functioned as a continuing impetus for sustainability. Habitual and adaptive integrations of the intervention in regular ward functions (eg, handover) kept change-related dialogues alive.

Organisational environment: culture, resources and infrastructure

Perceived openness for and positive attitude to change were conducive to improvement sustainability. Psychological safety shared among staff provided a non-judgemental space for them to speak up about change. Improvement initiatives faded where hospital staff recognised institutional tolerance to substandard care qualityor experienced change-related fatigue and confusion. Negative legacies from failed initiatives and dominant sentiments of helplessness and defeatist attitudes were barriers.

Adequate resources were vital to embed and integrate of the interventionand continue activities to enable sustainability. Secured funding to support ongoing workforce for change activities ensured continuity of intervention and evaluation. Insufficient funding for intervention integrationand discontinued staffing after the active implementationdisabled activities required to sustain improvement.

An established organisation-wide quality management system, comprising a structure and process, equipped for maintaining gained improvement. Incompatible platforms, such as information and technology systemand ward/unit layoutsof the change site, impaired the sustainability of intervention.

### Management controls… [^c9d1e06e]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Prior to the start of the inspection, preferably at the time you make the preannouncement of the inspection, you should ask the firm to send you their overall quality system policies, objectives, and procedures. This should include their management review procedures, quality policy, and quality plan. If not received prior to the start of the inspection, you will need to review these documents at the start of your inspection. A review of employee training records to show they have been trained in the firm's quality policy and objectives can also be done. In particular, this should be done for those employees involved in key operations.
3. Review the firm's established organizational structure to confirm that it includes provisions for responsibilities, authorities and necessary resources. Verify that the management representative is reporting back to the management with executive responsibility on the performance of the quality system.

These reports should either be the subject of the management reviews or at least provide the framework for those reviews.
5. Verify that management reviews, including a review of the suitability and effectiveness of the quality system, are being conducted. Management reviews must measure the firm's quality system against the Quality System Regulation and the firm's own stated quality objectives as defined in their quality policy. Management reviews must be documented. There must be written procedures for conducting management reviews. These procedures can be inspected and the firm must certify in writing, if requested, that the firm has complied with this Quality System Regulation requirement. Review the firm's management review schedule to confirm management reviews are being conducted with sufficient frequency. Management reviews should be frequent enough to keep them informed of ongoing quality issues and problems.

During your review of the CAPA subsystem, if you find that there are quality issues that do not seem to be known to executive-level management, then the reviews may not be occurring with sufficient frequency. Evidence of inadequate auditing may exist without gaining access to the written quality audit reports. This evidence may be obtained by relating the audit program to deficiencies observed in other subsystems. If significant quality system problems have existed both before and after the firm's last self-audit, then you should critically review the written audit procedures. The audit procedures should cover each quality system, and should be specific enough to enable the person conducting the audit to perform an adequate audit. The auditors must be adequately trained. If it is necessary and possible to interview an auditor, ask how the audits are performed; what documents are examined; how long audits take; etc.

### ENIgMA HALFpipe: interactive, reproducible, and efficient analysis for resting-state and task-based fMRI data [^439407f4]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

The implementation of quality metrics for fMRI data has been an incremental process that has moved steadily toward establishing empirically‐informed best practices. Historically, quality criteria have been applied unevenly across research labs. Recent years have witnessed a heightened awareness about the essential role of applying systematic and principled quality metrics to minimize confounds, for example, motion artifacts (Murphy, Birn, & Bandettini; Power et al; Power, Barnes, Snyder, Schlaggar, & Petersen,), and widespread fMRI signal deflections (Aquino et al.). Automated quality control methods are being developed and adopted with increasing interest, such as the MRI Quality Control software MRIQC (Esteban et al.). HALFpipe has adopted parts of the functionality of MRIQC with an enhanced user experience that generates quality reports via a web‐browser‐based interface to facilitate rapid viewing, screening, and selection of individual subject data for inclusion or exclusion. The application of uniform quality assessment procedures is particularly important when mega‐analyzing and even meta‐analyzing multi‐site/scanner data, as is performed in ENIGMA. That is, study variables that segregate by site are more likely to lead to confounds without the uniform implementation of quality assessment across sites (e.g. Wachinger et al.). With its harmonized quality procedures, HALFpipe aims to minimize such effects.

### Towards high-reliability organising in healthcare: a strategy for building organisational capacity [^267d4077]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2017). Medium credibility.

In a high-reliability organisation (HRO), safety and quality (SQ) is an organisational priority, and all workforce members are engaged, continuously learning and improving their work. To build organisational capacity for SQ work, we have developed a role-tailored capacity-building framework that we are currently employing at the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality as part of an organisational strategy towards HRO. This framework considers organisation-wide competencies for SQ that includes all staff and faculty and is integrated into a broader organisation-wide operating management system for improving quality. In this framework, achieving safe, high-quality care is connected to healthcare workforce preparedness. Capacity-building efforts are tailored to the needs of distinct groups within the workforce that fall within three categories: (1) front-line providers and staff, (2) managers and local improvement personnel and (3) SQ leaders and experts. In this paper we describe this framework, our implementation efforts to date, challenges met and lessons learnt.

Protocols — scope and utility in the intensive care unit distinguish protocols from clinical practice guidelines by stating that after initiation "the protocol prescribes a specific series of behaviors… or changes in treatment… without the requirement of further clinician input."

In the ICU, "protocols may help avoid errors of omission, improve unit efficiency, decrease cost, and maintain standard of care," yet "are not always superior to expert clinician-directed care." They are "particularly useful for setting "default" actions in common decisions," and "are likely to be less valuable when applied to highly variable clinical processes, particularly those with multiple and competing endpoints."

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) supports integration of the IEC into an institution's process for establishing and promoting organizational ethics but notes that including organizational ethics in the purview of the IEC raises specific questions about its structure, function, and member qualifications. An IEC whose function includes organizational ethics and policy development should establish standards of membership, process, and self-improvement specific to organizational ethics issues and to the organizational structure of its home institution.

### Health workforce governance for compassionate and respectful care: a framework for research, policy and practice [^15a35f91]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Towards a research, policy and practice agenda

Limitations of the evidence base and research gaps

This paper presents some specific evidence on enablers of CRC. Policy options contributing to CRC were discussed and categorised using a health workforce framework. The evidence of effectiveness of different strategies is, however, of variable depth and maturity. In particular, most of the available literature is descriptive and often originates from retrospective analysis of policy documents; only occasionally are the results of these initiatives reported, and typically these have been confined to process or at best output indicators, rather than outcomes; as a result, most of the studies identified were of low or very low certainty; firm indications of demonstrable and attributable results arising from these initiatives are largely lacking.

More research, ideally mixed-methods studies originating in implementation research contexts, should be conducted to expand the range of policy options to be considered, as well as to assess their relative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and optimal implementation modalities, going beyond process measures and assessing performance of CRC initiatives through output and outcome indicators. The framework that was presented provides a structure to categorise health workforce interventions for which specific metrics should be identified in the monitoring and evaluation of CRC initiatives.

A policy and practice agenda

Notwithstanding the limitations above, the evidence and country examples presented illustrate the range of issues that should inform health workforce policy and management when pursuing CRC as a health system objective.

Translating the limited evidence base and the policy options outlined in this document into a policy agenda requires the identification of context-specific challenges (including which groups are at higher risk in each setting to receive disrespectful and non-responsive care), health system architecture and most appropriate implementation modalities.

An effective strategy to enhance the health workforce role in the provision of CRC should be rooted in the broader context of determinants of health workforce availability, accessibility, acceptability, quality and performance. It should also recognise that upholding health workers' rights has a positive effect on ensuring that they, in turn, adequately fulfil their roles and responsibilities.
