## Question

What pathology can cause sciatic like pain radiating to the foot including fourth and fifth toe?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what pathologies can cause sciatica-like pain radiating to the foot with predominant involvement of the fourth and fifth toes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the neuroanatomy that maps to the lateral foot and fourth/fifth toes. Then, I should verify which nerve root levels and peripheral nerves most plausibly explain this distribution. Next, I will construct a tiered differential diagnosis, starting with common causes and moving to less common mimics. After that, I need to check the key distinguishing clinical features and bedside tests that separate radicular from peripheral entrapment etiologies. Finally, I will review when imaging and electrodiagnostics are indicated and close with a concise synthesis and next steps for evaluation and management.

> Let me first confirm the neuroanatomy. The lateral aspect of the foot and the fourth and fifth toes are supplied primarily by S1 via the sural nerve (sensory) and by the lateral plantar nerve (sensory and motor), with contributions from the medial plantar nerve to the medial aspect of the fourth toe, so symptoms localized to the lateral foot and fourth/fifth digits strongly implicate S1 radiculopathy or distal tibial/sural branch pathology rather than L5, which typically projects to the dorsum of the foot and first three toes [^113WKSAb] [^113MwVy5] [^113C6Kip].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the most likely etiologies. Given that approximately 90% of sciatica is due to lumbar disc herniation compressing a nerve root, an L5–S1 disc herniation with S1 root compression is the leading consideration for pain radiating to the lateral foot and fourth/fifth toes, especially when accompanied by dermatomal sensory changes, cough or Valsalva aggravation, and possible ankle reflex asymmetry or gastrocnemius–soleus weakness on examination [^113KCa4R] [^116ayzsD] [^113WKSAb].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical correlates that strengthen this hypothesis. S1 radiculopathy often features pain in the posterolateral thigh and calf to the lateral heel and foot, sensory loss on the lateral sole and lateral two toes, diminished ankle jerk, and plantarflexion weakness; heel-walking difficulty and toe-walking screening maneuvers can help corroborate S1 involvement, and Lasegue's or crossed straight-leg raise may be positive in the appropriate context, though no single test is definitive in isolation [^113WKSAb] [^114RAua5] [^113pSq1m].

> I will now examine distal entrapment syndromes that can mimic this pattern. Tarsal tunnel syndrome at the medial ankle can compress the tibial nerve and its lateral plantar branch, producing burning plantar foot pain with paresthesias that often include the lateral plantar territory and can radiate to the fourth and fifth toes; provocative testing with Tinel's at the tarsal tunnel, sustained eversion or great toe dorsiflexion, and careful inspection for hindfoot valgus or space-occupying lesions can support this diagnosis, with MRI identifying compressive causes in refractory cases [^116i5fCf] [^114aL2Uo].

> But wait, what if the distribution is purely lateral and superficial. Sural nerve entrapment or injury along the posterolateral calf or behind the lateral malleolus can cause pain, dysesthesias, or numbness on the lateral foot and up to the base of the fifth toe; symptoms may be provoked by inversion and plantarflexion, and MRI or ultrasound can identify ganglia, scar, or other compressive lesions along the nerve's course [^113MwVy5].

> Let me consider a forefoot-specific mimic. Morton's neuroma in the third intermetatarsal space can cause burning forefoot pain radiating to the third and fourth toes, and less commonly the fourth/fifth interspace may be involved; the pain is typically plantar and forefoot-localized, often with a Mulder's click and shoe-related aggravation, which helps distinguish it from proximal radicular pain that projects along the calf to the foot [^113C6Kip] [^1145ouhX] [^116sXxzw].

> Hold on, I should verify less common but important extraspinal causes of sciatica-like pain that can reach the foot. Deep gluteal syndrome from sciatic nerve entrapment in the subgluteal space, including piriformis-related compression, can produce buttock pain radiating down the posterior thigh and calf to the foot with neuropathic features; diagnosis is often one of exclusion after spinal causes are ruled out, with MRI of the pelvis and electrodiagnostics aiding localization when suspicion remains high [^115LxdfY] [^114Pp8ZA].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought L5 radiculopathy could explain fourth/fifth toe symptoms, but I should double-check the classic dermatomal map. L5 typically supplies the dorsum of the foot and the first three toes, so predominant fourth/fifth toe involvement is more consistent with S1 than L5; that said, overlap exists, and combined L5–S1 pathology can blur boundaries, so I need to correlate with reflexes, myotomal strength, and sensory mapping rather than rely on toes alone [^113WKSAb] [^117X8FP5].

> Next, I should review bedside discriminators that separate radicular from peripheral entrapment. Radicular pain is often electric or lancinating, worsened by cough or Valsalva, and may track in a dermatomal band, whereas peripheral entrapments are more focal, activity- or shoe-related, and reproduce with local provocative maneuvers; a careful neurologic exam for ankle reflex asymmetry, gastrocnemius–soleus strength, and dermatomal sensory loss supports S1 radiculopathy, while a positive Tinel's at the tarsal tunnel or Mulder's sign favors distal entrapment [^112P9eXD] [^113WKSAb] [^114aL2Uo].

> I need to ensure I do not overcall imaging. MRI of the lumbar spine is appropriate when symptoms persist beyond 6–8 weeks despite conservative care, when red flags are present, or when procedural or surgical decisions hinge on anatomic confirmation; however, MRI abnormalities are common in asymptomatic individuals, so imaging must be interpreted in clinical context, and a negative spine MRI should prompt evaluation for extraspinal causes such as deep gluteal syndrome or distal entrapments [^113KCa4R] [^113pSq1m] [^111329qD].

> Let me reconsider the role of electrodiagnostics. Nerve conduction studies and electromyography can help distinguish S1 radiculopathy from tibial or sural neuropathies, quantify severity, and guide prognosis, particularly when the clinical picture is ambiguous or when surgery is being considered; they are also useful to exclude mimics such as lumbosacral plexopathy or peripheral neuropathy when the presentation is atypical [^1133C7J4] [^1135Ee6M].

> I should confirm the differential in tiers to keep this clinically actionable. Tier 1: L5–S1 disc herniation with S1 radiculopathy; Tier 2: tarsal tunnel syndrome with lateral plantar branch involvement, sural nerve entrapment, and Morton's neuroma; Tier 3: deep gluteal syndrome, lumbosacral plexopathy, and less common causes such as Tarlov cysts or neoplastic compression; this hierarchy aligns with prevalence and anatomic plausibility for lateral foot and fourth/fifth toe symptoms [^113KCa4R] [^116i5fCf] [^113MwVy5] [^113C6Kip] [^115LxdfY].

> Next, I should review immediate evaluation steps. A focused history documenting pain quality, dermatomal radiation, cough/Valsalva aggravation, footwear and activity triggers, and neurologic symptoms should be followed by a targeted exam including straight-leg raise, reflexes, myotomal strength including gastrocnemius–soleus and toe plantarflexion, sensory mapping, and specific provocation tests such as Tinel's at the tarsal tunnel and Mulder's maneuver; if symptoms persist or deficits progress, obtain lumbar MRI, and if the spine is unrevealing or extraspinal entrapment is suspected, pursue pelvis/hip MRI or targeted ultrasound and consider EMG/NCS [^113WKSAb] [^114aL2Uo] [^113KCa4R] [^111329qD].

> Finally, I need to ensure management implications are aligned with the diagnosis. For S1 radiculopathy from disc herniation, most patients improve with conservative care over 2–4 weeks, with escalation to epidural steroid injection or surgery reserved for persistent, severe, or progressive deficits; for tarsal tunnel syndrome, start with activity modification, footwear changes, and corticosteroid injection, reserving decompression for refractory cases; for Morton's neuroma, orthotics and injection are first-line with neurectomy for failures; for deep gluteal syndrome, targeted physical therapy and image-guided injections are reasonable, with endoscopic decompression if conservative measures fail [^113KCa4R] [^112qTvd9] [^116i5fCf] [^1145ouhX] [^115LxdfY].

---

Sciatica-like pain radiating to the foot with fourth and fifth toe involvement most often reflects **S1 radiculopathy** from L5–S1 disc herniation or foraminal stenosis, given the S1 dermatome distribution [^113WKSAb]. Other causes include **S1 radiculopathy** from L5–S1 disc herniation or foraminal stenosis, **S2 radiculopathy** (less common), and **peripheral mimics** such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, sural neuropathy, or Morton's neuroma [^116i5fCf] [^113MwVy5] [^113C6Kip]. Less frequent etiologies include piriformis syndrome, lumbosacral plexopathy, or distal sciatic neuropathy [^115LxdfY] [^111xa8up] [^114Pp8ZA]. Diagnosis relies on history, exam, and MRI; electrodiagnostics help distinguish radiculopathy from peripheral neuropathies [^113KCa4R] [^1135Ee6M]. Management is conservative first; surgery is reserved for refractory cases or neurologic decline [^112qTvd9].

---

## Anatomical and neurological basis

The sciatic nerve arises from L4–S3 and divides into tibial and common peroneal nerves, which supply the foot and toes [^114Pp8ZA]. The **S1 nerve root** innervates the lateral foot and fourth and fifth toes; thus, S1 pathology typically causes pain, paresthesia, or weakness in these regions [^notfound].

---

## Common pathological causes

### Lumbar disc herniation

- **L5–S1 disc herniation**: The most common cause of S1 radiculopathy, compressing the S1 root and causing pain, paresthesia, or weakness in the lateral foot and fourth/fifth toes [^1136Yx2T] [^114RAua5].

- **Clinical features**: Sharp, burning pain; paresthesia; weakness of plantarflexion; diminished ankle reflex [^113WKSAb].

- **Diagnosis**: MRI is the gold standard to confirm disc herniation and nerve root compression [^notfound].

---

### Lumbar spinal stenosis

Lumbar spinal stenosis narrows the central canal or foramina, compressing S1 and causing **radicular pain** to the lateral foot and fourth/fifth toes [^1174QzuG]. Symptoms include **neurogenic claudication**, pain worsened by walking/standing, and relief with flexion [^1174QzuG]. MRI confirms canal or foraminal narrowing and **nerve compression** [^notfound].

---

### Foraminal stenosis

Foraminal stenosis is a narrowing of the neural foramen that compresses the **S1 root**, causing radicular pain in the S1 distribution [^1174QzuG] [^111YHHm3]. Features include localized back pain, **radicular leg pain**, and neurologic deficits consistent with S1 involvement [^113WKSAb]. MRI identifies foraminal narrowing and **nerve compression** [^114Xftp5].

---

## Less common pathological causes

### Piriformis syndrome

Piriformis syndrome results from **sciatic nerve compression** beneath the piriformis, mimicking **radiculopathy** with pain radiating to the foot and toes [^115LxdfY]. Patients report buttock pain, radicular leg pain, and symptoms worsened by sitting or hip movements [^115LxdfY]. MRI or **electrodiagnostics** help exclude other causes and support the diagnosis [^115LxdfY].

---

### Peripheral nerve entrapment syndromes

- **Tarsal tunnel syndrome**: Entrapment of the tibial nerve or its branches can cause plantar foot pain and paresthesia, including the fourth and fifth toes [^116i5fCf].

- **Sural neuropathy**: Entrapment or injury of the sural nerve causes lateral foot pain and paresthesia, including the fourth and fifth toes [^113MwVy5].

- **Morton's neuroma**: Interdigital nerve entrapment causes forefoot pain radiating to the toes, often mimicking radicular pain [^113C6Kip].

---

### Lumbosacral plexopathy

Lumbosacral plexopathy involves injury or compression of the lumbosacral plexus (e.g. tumor, trauma, radiation) and can produce **radicular pain** to the foot and toes [^112hVqox]. Presentations include leg pain, **weakness, sensory loss**, and reflex changes consistent with plexus involvement [^notfound]. MRI or CT defines plexus pathology and **guides management** [^111xa8up].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic tool** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Clinical history and examination | Identify radicular features, neurologic deficits, and exclude peripheral mimics [^1174QzuG] |
| 2 | MRI of lumbar spine | Confirm disc herniation, stenosis, or foraminal narrowing [^113KCa4R] |
| 3 | Electrodiagnostic studies (EMG, NCS) | Differentiate radiculopathy from peripheral neuropathies [^1135Ee6M] |
| 4 | MRI of pelvis/hip | Evaluate for piriformis syndrome or plexopathy when spine MRI is negative [^111329qD] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Conservative management**: NSAIDs, physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, and activity modification are first-line for radiculopathy and many peripheral entrapments [^116i5fCf] [^112qTvd9].

- **Surgical intervention**: Considered for persistent radicular pain from disc herniation or stenosis, or for refractory peripheral entrapments causing significant neurologic deficits [^111xzvJL] [^116i5fCf].

- **Specific treatments**: Piriformis injections, tarsal tunnel release, or Morton's neuroma excision are options for selected peripheral causes [^115LxdfY] [^116i5fCf] [^1145ouhX].

---

Sciatica-like pain radiating to the foot with fourth and fifth toe involvement most often reflects **S1 radiculopathy** from L5–S1 disc herniation or foraminal stenosis, but peripheral mimics must be considered. A structured diagnostic approach — clinical assessment, MRI, and electrodiagnostics — guides targeted management, with conservative care first and surgery reserved for refractory or progressive cases.

### Sciatica: what the rheumatologist needs to know [^113KCa4R]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Sciatica is a set of symptoms rather than a specific diagnosis, and is caused by a herniated lumbar disc in the vast majority of cases. The most important symptom is lower limb pain radiating below the knee and into the foot and toes. The clinical course of acute sciatica is generally favorable, with most pain and related disability improving within 2–4 weeks with or without treatment. Diagnosis mainly involves history taking and physical examination. Imaging is warranted if there is evidence of an underlying pathology other than disc herniation, such as infection or malignancy, and in patients with severe symptoms that do not improve after 6–8 weeks of conservative treatment. MRI is the preferred imaging modality, as it can visualize soft tissues better than CT and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation. Conservative treatment is generally the first-line option in patients with sciatica; however, the currently available evidence does not show any intervention — including a broad range of conservative and surgical approaches — to have clearly superior outcomes. Thus, patient preference seems to be an important factor in the clinical management of sciatica.

Differential diagnosis

Disc herniation

LBP is very common and the number of cases with additional sciatic pain is low in comparison. The compression of a nerve root is one of the most common causes of sciatica; a herniated disc compresses the root in 90% of cases. Other possible causes of sciatica include lumbar spinal stenosis and, more rarely, tumours or cysts. Typical dermatomal distribution of pain which worsens on coughing, sneezing or straining, increased finger–floor distance and sensory symptoms, such as numbness or paraesthesia, are significant predictors of nerve root compression in patients with low back pain radiating distally into the leg.

Medical history and physical examination are the mainstays of sciatica diagnosis. The straight leg raising test or Lasegue's test is commonly used in patients with suspected sciatica. In addition, changes in the Achilles and patellar tendon reflexes and reduced strength in the big toe, ankle and knee are typical signs in patients with nerve root compression. The distribution of pain radiating in the lower limb, a characteristic and definitive feature of the condition, can sometimes be evaluated using pain drawings. Disc herniation is reported in 20–36% of individuals without symptoms of sciatica or low back pain and, furthermore, many patients with clinical symptoms of sciatica do not display lumbar disc herniation on imaging. Conservative treatment strategies for disc herniation are primarily aimed at pain reduction, either by using analgesics or by the non-surgical reduction of pressure on the nerve root using traction, spinal manipulation or physiotherapy, for example. Conservative treatment regimens are currently the first-line option for patients with sciatica. The adequate management of pain and an active approach, with patients being reassured and advised to continue their daily activities as much as possible, is the preferred treatment strategy.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^116ayzsD]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of sciatic symptoms reported in the literature varies considerably ranging from 1.6% in the general population to 43% in a selected working population. Although the prognosis is good in most patients, a substantial proportion (up to 30%) continues to have pain for 1 year or longer. In approximately 90% of the cases, sciatica is caused by a herniated disc involving nerve root compression. However, lumbar canal stenosis or foraminal stenosis and (less often) tumours or cysts are other possible causes.

The most important symptom of sciatica is lumbosacral radicular leg pain that follows a dermatomal pattern radiating below the knee and into the foot and toes. The pain worsens with coughing; patients may report sensory symptoms, limited forward flexion of the lumbar spine, gait deformity and unilateral spasm of the paraspinal muscles. However, most patients present with a less clear clinical picture. In acute sciatica, diagnostic imaging may only be indicated if there are indications of underlying pathology (e.g. infections, malignancies) other than disc herniation. In patients with persistent and severe symptoms who fail to improve following 6–8 weeks of non-surgical treatment, imaging might be useful to identify the presence or absence of a herniated disc with nerve root compression.

### Foot pressure in patients with chronic lumbar radicular pain (sciatica) caused by lumbar disc herniation: a case-control observational study [^116toaEN]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to determine whether there are differences in plantar pressures during gait between patients with lumbar disc herniation -induced sciatica and healthy individuals.

Methods

This observational case-control study included 41 patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation and 30 healthy controls. Plantar pressures were evaluated using the FootScan ® platform in 10-foot zones during 3 gait phases, defined as rockers. After walking, body advancement with the supporting foot depends on stance-limb mobility, with the supporting foot acting as a pivot system. In a serial fashion, the heel, ankle, and forefoot serve as rockers that allow the body to advance smoothly. Data were also collected on quality of life, low back pain, lower limb pain, foot pain, foot pain-related disability, foot joint range of motion, and foot posture index. All variables were compared between the two groups.

Results

Patients with sciatica had a longer contact time and higher mean and peak pressures in all foot zones, except for the first metatarsal and toes. Pressures were higher in the third to fifth metatarsals, especially during push-off. Patients with sciatic arthritis experience not only low back pain, but also lower limb and foot pain, as well as higher foot pain-related disability. There were no significant differences in foot posture or joint ranges, except for decreased subtalar pronation in patients with sciatica.

Conclusion

Altered plantar pressure distribution in patients with sciatica may be associated with neuromuscular compensation mechanisms.

### Development of an assessment schedule for patients with low back-associated leg pain in primary care: a Delphi consensus study [^111oYjFa]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain (LBP) is defined as pain occurring between the gluteal folds and inferior border of the ribs with or without radiation down the leg. Sciatica, or spinal nerve root pain, represents one distinct presentation of LBP and associated leg pain, and is generally characterised by pain radiating to below the knee and into the foot and toes, with varying neurological findings. Although the prevalence of nerve root pain is less than that of LBP alone, the condition is considered by some authors to be responsible for most of the indirect costs and lost workdays associated with LBP.

The ability of clinicians however, to distinguish between non-specific LBP that simply spreads to the leg (also called referred pain) and true spinal nerve root involvement (sciatica) is often debated as is the definition of sciatica. This is perhaps reflected in the wide variation of sciatica prevalence estimates reported in the literature, which is partly attributed to different definitions of the presentation and different assessment methods.

Compared to non-specific LBP literature investigating prognostic indicators of outcome, there is limited evidence on prognostic factors for LBP-associated leg pain (either referred or due to nerve root involvement). It is unclear whether the prognostic indicators relevant to outcome in patients with nerve root pain (mainly due to disc herniation) are similar to those for LBP alone with published literature providing conflicting views at times as to whether psychosocial or physical factors predominate.

Studies investigating the diagnostic value of history and physical examination factors for categorisation of patients with LBP and nerve root symptoms have been conducted within secondary care cohorts and therefore include patients with more severe symptoms. But even with well documented conditions such as nerve root involvement due to disc prolapse or stenosis, there is significant variation in the number and type of eligibility criteria from trials assessing treatment effectiveness. However, current literature suggests that the clinical evaluation remains the most important aspect of diagnosing spinal nerve root involvement in LBP.

### Facet joint syndrome: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^112T9vTd]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentation

The clinical diagnosis of facetogenic LBP is still debated. Facetogenic LBP is also known as non-specific LBP, the clinical presentation of which is lumbosacral pain with or without sciatica. Synovial and subchondral cysts can extend posteriorly to the LFJ but also anteriorly in the spinal cord or neuroforamen. So, in space-occupying spinal lesions, such as osteophytes or synovial cysts, radiating pain may reach the foot, mimicking sciatic pain. In 1911, Goldthwaite first described that LFJ is a source of LBP. In 1927, Putti proposed that the degeneration and inflammation of the LFJ may cause sciatica through nerve irritation. In 1933, Ghormhley named a symptom originating from the LFJ "facet syndrome", which was lumbosacral pain with or without sciatica. Facet syndrome included local pain and pseudo radicular radiation with variability of the distribution of referral patterns of pain. Facetogenic LBP may be referred distally into the lower limb, thereby mimicking sciatica, and "pseudo-radicular" lumbar pain typically radiates unilateral or bilaterally to the buttock and the trochanteric region (from the L4 and L5 levels), the groin and the thighs (from L2-L5), ending above the knee, without neurological deficits. Campos et althought that patients with facetogenic LBP may have symptoms such as lumbar paraspinal palpation with increased pain; and increased pain during one or more of the following: 1) extension (more than flexion)/rotation, 2) extension/side flexion, and 3) extension/rotation. Gómez et alemphasized its characteristics as follows, 1) improvement with rest, absence of root pattern, may have pseudoradicular pattern, however, the pain is more lumbar than pain in the leg and 3 clinical signs. But this kind of pain does not resemble sciatica as it spreads through dorsal side of the leg and reaches the feet and toes. Laslett et alfound that a cluster of clinical signs ("Revel's criteria"), consisting of 7 clinical signs, may be valuable in predicting the results of an initial screening ZJ block, with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 80%. Although, nowadays pain produced by the LFJ has a few diagnostic scales and even though many scientists have tried to summarize the clinical features of facetogenic LBP, they cannot make a diagnosis based on it. Due to clinical heterogeneity, Maas et aldisapproved the diagnostic accuracy of patient history and/or physical examination to identify facetogenic LBP, which depended on a diagnostic block.

### Agreement of self-reported items and clinically assessed nerve root involvement (or sciatica) in a primary care setting [^111TXmjM]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Low back-related leg pain or sciatica is one of the common variations of low back pain (LBP).

The literature suggests that the presence of sciatica is responsible for a poor prognosis in LBP patients. Although definitions of sciatica used in epidemiological surveys and clinical practice vary, sciatic pain is generally defined as pain radiating to the leg, normally below the knee and into the foot and toes with varying neurological findings.

A recent review of sciatica prevalence studies reported a substantial variation in estimates ranging from 1.6 to 43%. The definition of sciatic symptoms seemed to explain most of the variation. This is the case also for defining back pain prevalence, leading to a recent consensus study towards standardisation of back pain definitions for use in prevalence studies so that heterogeneity in findings is minimised. Dionne et al. reported that in back pain research sciatica prevalence was important and suggested that in self-report studies 'sciatica' should be replaced by 'pain that goes down the leg'. It is also suggested that 'pain below the knee' is a good proxy for clinically diagnosed sciatica and a number of studies using self-reported information have used 'pain below the knee' for defining sciatica, although other studies have employed more stringent self-report definitions such as 'pain radiating to the leg(s) that worsens with coughing or sneezing'. At present, it is not known whether self-reported symptoms of sciatica correlate with the clinical diagnosis or whether 'pain below the knee' or 'pain that goes down the leg' is a reasonable proxy for the presence of sciatic symptoms.

As sciatica is considered a poor prognostic indicator in back pain presentations and may also require a different therapeutic approach to simple back pain, accurate definitions are important for estimates of prevalence and natural history and for evaluating treatment outcome according to presentation in epidemiological studies.

The purpose of this study was twofold: to assess the agreement between self-reported leg pain and clinically defined sciatica (nerve root involvement) and if necessary to identify and assess the accuracy of an optimum cluster of self-report items for the diagnosis of sciatica.

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: current concept [^113mVv47]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this manuscript is to review the current knowledge in terms of retro-trochanteric pain syndrome, make recommendations for diagnosis and differential diagnosis and offer suggestions for treatment options. The terminology in the literature is confusing and these symptoms can be referred to as 'greater trochanteric pain syndrome', 'trochanteric bursitis' and 'trochanteritis', among other denominations. The authors focus on a special type of sciatica, i.e. retro-trochanteric pain radiating down to the lower extremity. The impact of different radiographic assessments is discussed. The authors recommend excluding pathology in the spine and pelvic area before following their suggested treatment algorithm for sciatica-like retro-trochanteric pain. Level of evidence II.

3. **Phase 1**: terminology

3.1. The conundrum of "sciatica": setting the scene

A recent systematic review demonstrated that multiple terms are used to describe spine-related leg pain. The most commonly used term is "sciatica" (Fig. 1). The definition of "sciatica" according to the Concise Oxford Medical Dictionary is "pain radiating from the buttock into the thigh, calf, and occasionally the foot". This definition is immediately followed by the disclaimer "although it is in the distribution of the sciatic nerve, sciatica is rarely due to disease of this nerve". This disclaimer highlights the controversy surrounding the term "sciatica". It has been argued for many years that "sciatica" is an archaic term.

Figure 1.
Terminology used in clinical trials to describe the study population with spine-related leg pain. Adapted from Lin et al.

Historically, the term "sciatica" was likely first introduced by Hippocrates and is derived from the Greek "ischios" for hip. Indeed, this term was originally used to describe pain in the pelvis and leg which was attributed to a diseased or subluxated hip. Since then, its underlying pathology has been assigned to a multitude of aetiologies, including abscesses, gout, and even turgidity of veins. In 1764, Domenico Cotugno of Naples finally distinguished "arthritic sciatica" from "nervous sciatica". In the 19th century, "fractured" (herniated) discs were first described based on autopsiesand mechanosensitivity of the nerve was mentioned in subsequent work by Lasegue and his student JJ Forst. In 1933, Mixter and Barrrelated "sciatica" to a herniated or prolapsed disc "encroaching" on the nerve root, which provided justification for surgical treatments.

### Application of the chronic constriction injury of the partial sciatic nerve model to assess acupuncture analgesia [^1168d8S5]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain, defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as "pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system", is a pain syndrome characterized by spontaneous pain, hyperalgesia, allodynia, and sensory abnormalities. Sciatica, one of the most common sources of clinical neuropathic pain, is generally defined as pain radiating to the leg, normally below the knee and into the foot and toes. The treatment for sciatica remains a current challenge in clinic. Therefore, generating appropriate animal models are critical to developing novel treatment options for neuropathic pain.–

Chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve (CCI) was established in 1988 as a means to produce neuropathic pain in laboratory animal models; the pathological condition of this model is quite similar to human peripheral nerve injury and its consequent behavioral manifestations. Based on the CCI model, a variety of animal models have since been developed for different research purposes, including the partial sciatic nerve ligation (pSNL), the spinal nerve ligation to sciatic nerve (SNL), the sciatic nerve axotomy, the chronic compression of the dorsal root ganglion, and the spared nerve injury (SNI) models.

Although basic and clinical studies have confirmed that acupuncture can effectively alleviate or cure pain syndromes, the mechanisms responsible for acupuncture analgesia remain elusive. This suggests the need for a proper animal model in order to elucidate mechanisms by which acupuncture alleviates neuropathic pain. Behavior test and nociceptive stimulation-induced EMG (C-fiber reflex EMG) are both measures for pain alleviating evaluation. Paw mechanical withdrawal latency and threshold (PMWL and PMWT, respectively) are the tests of mechanical nociception or sensibility based on the rat's sensory–motor reflex. It is withdrawal of the paw with participation of the upper central nervous system and multisynaptic relay. Whereas C-fiber reflex is a neuromuscular reflex with the participation of the spinal level and usually is a three-synapse reflex, which is a more objective and direct criterion in evaluation of pain and acupuncture analgesia.–Given that acupuncture may inhibit the C-fiber reflex EMG, the mechanisms underlying acupuncture analgesia may be explained at both the peripheral nervous system level as well as the spinal central nervous system level.

### Foot drop: where, why and what to do? [^114E7ytq]. Practical Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Foot drop is a common and distressing problem that can lead to falls and injury. Although the most frequent cause is a (common) peroneal neuropathy at the neck of the fibula, other causes include anterior horn cell disease, lumbar plexopathies, L5 radiculopathy and partial sciatic neuropathy. And even when the nerve lesion is clearly at the fibular neck there are a variety of causes that may not be immediately obvious; habitual leg crossing may well be the most frequent cause and most patients improve when they stop this habit. A meticulous neurological evaluation goes a long way to ascertain the site of the lesion. Nerve conduction and electromyographic studies are useful adjuncts in localising the site of injury, establishing the degree of damage and predicting the degree of recovery. Imaging is important in establishing the cause of foot drop be it at the level of the spine, along the course of the sciatic nerve or in the popliteal fossa; ultrasonography, CT and MR imaging are all useful. For patients with a severe foot drop of any cause, an ankle foot orthosis is a helpful device that enables them to walk better and more safely.

### Tactile allodynia in patients with lumbar radicular pain (sciatica) [^115fGFTT]. Pain (2014). Low credibility.

We report a novel symptom in many patients with low back pain (LBP) that sheds new light on the underlying pain mechanism. By means of quantitative sensory testing, we compared patients with radicular LBP (sciatica), axial LBP (LBP without radiation into the leg), and healthy controls, searching for cutaneous allodynia in response to weak tactile and cooling stimuli on the leg and low back. Most patients with radicular pain (~60%) reported static and dynamic tactile allodynia, as well as cooling allodynia, on the leg, often extending into the foot. Some also reported allodynia on the low back. In axial LBP, allodynia was almost exclusively on the back. The degree of dynamic tactile allodynia correlated with the degree of background pain. The presence of allodynia suggests that the peripheral nerve generators of background leg and back pain have also induced central sensitization. The distal (foot) location of the allodynia in patients who have it indicates that the nociceptive drive that maintains the central sensitization arises paraspinally (ectopically) in injured ventral ramus afferents; this is not an instance of somatic referred pain. The presence of central sensitization also provides the first cogent account of shooting pain in sciatica as a wave of activity sweeping vectorially across the width of the sensitized dorsal horn. Finally, the results endorse leg allodynia as a pain biomarker in animal research on LBP, which is commonly used but has not been previously validated. In addition to informing the underlying mechanism of LBP, bedside mapping of allodynia might have practical implications for prognosis and treatment.

Social Media Question

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^114KBNkX]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Pain radiating from the spine into the leg is commonly referred to as "sciatica". "Sciatica" may be associated with significant consequences for the person living with the condition, imposing a reduced quality of lifeand substantial direct and indirect costs (eg, £1.2–10.6 billion annually in the United Kingdom alone, extrapolated from primary care data).

Of note, there is no consensus on the definition and diagnostic criteria for "sciatica". The term "sciatica" has been used to encompass a range of nerve-related conditions originating from the spine such as radicular pain or painful radiculopathy. Despite the linguistic allusion to neural involvement, "sciatica" has in some instances even been used to encompass somatic referred pain.

Although these pain conditions may overlap, they are discrete entities with differing dominant pain characteristics (eg, nociceptive or neuropathic), which may require specific management approaches. Nevertheless, these terms are often used interchangeably, and these heterogeneous conditions are often amalgamated in clinical trials. Whether or not this amalgamation contributes to the modest treatment effects seen for "sciatica" is unclear.

Two of the main challenges associated with a diagnosis of "sciatica" relate to the inconsistent use of terminology for the diagnostic labels, "sciatica" or radicular pain or painful radiculopathy, and the identification of neuropathic pain. These challenges hinder collective clinical and scientific understanding and clarity regarding these conditions, impact effective clinical communication and care planning, prevent clear interpretation of the scientific literature related to the condition, and ultimately may contribute to the limited efficacy of care for people living with "sciatica". Indeed, most trials on conservative management for people with "sciatica" either show no, or at best, modest effects.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^112GJPvP]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Neurologic heel pain — definition, nerve etiologies, and referral: "Neurologic heel pain is defined as pain in the heel as a result of an entrapment or irritation of one or more of the nerves that innervate this region", and "persistent symptoms may yield neurologic-related pathology". Patients "with a history of previous heel surgery or trauma should be highly suspect for neurologic heel pain". Nerves considered include "Posterior tibial (tarsal tunnel syndrome)", "Medial calcaneal (heel neuroma)", "Medial plantar", "Lateral plantar, including branch to abductor digiti minimi", and "Sural, including lateral calcaneal". Proximal processes also apply: heel pain or sensory loss "can also be attributable to more proximal nerve impingement syndromes", and back-to-foot radiation "must be evaluated for radiculopathy secondary to proximal nerve root pathology", with "double-crush syndrome, in which concomitant proximal and distal nerve entrapments may occur simultaneously". When suspected with sensory findings and radiating pain, the text notes "appropriate referral for diagnostic studies and/or assessment by a specialist".

### Anatomical etiology of "pseudo-sciatica" from superior cluneal nerve entrapment: a laboratory investigation [^111ZWypj]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain (LBP) is a common condition with a life-time prevalence affecting up to 84% of the population.–Chronic LBP is less prevalent, occurring in about 23%. Large epidemiological studies have shown that up to 37% of patients with chronic back pain have a neuropathic pain component, mainly presenting as radicular leg pain. 67

There are several anatomical, and clinical–studies describing that entrapment of the superior cluneal nerve (SCN) produces LBP. The SCN is a cutaneous branch of the lumbar dorsal rami that penetrates the psoas major and paraspinal muscles. It traverses through the superficial layer of thoracolumbar fascia before crossing the posterior iliac crest or through the gluteal fascia after crossing the iliac crest and supplies the skin overlying the upper half of the gluteus muscles. When the medial SCN branch penetrates the gluteal fascia, the nerve may become entrapped in the space surrounded by the iliac crest and the fascia attached to the iliac crest, the so called "osteofibrous tunnel".,

Entrapment of the SCN is not rare and may cause LBP, often with referred pain in various areas of the leg. Decades ago, Strong and Davila surgically treated 30 patients by deafferentation of the SCN. Their patients complained of leg symptoms in areas ranging from the groin to the sole of the foot. In a more recent prospective study, Kuniya et al reported that ~50% of SCN disorder patients had such leg symptoms. This proportion was 89% in the 19 cases that required surgery to alleviate severe symptoms. Ten of these surgical patients reported that leg symptoms were more severe than the LBP. Furthermore, eight had a past history of unnecessary lumbar spine surgery, indicating that pain in the lateral calf or foot might contribute to misdiagnosis as a lumbo-sacral disorder. Trescot also mentioned that entrapment of the SCN caused referred pain down the leg, potentially all the way to the foot, and that this pseudo-sciatica clinically mimicked radiculopathy due to lumbar disc herniation or lumbar spinal canal stenosis.

### Piriformis syndrome versus radiculopathy following lumbar artificial disc replacement [^1165htFE]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case series.

Objective

To describe the presentation, diagnostic challenges, and treatment of five patients with piriformis syndrome after lumbar artificial disc replacement.

Summary Of Background Data

Until recently, spinal fusion was considered the standard for surgical treatment of severe lumbar degenerative disc disease. However, artificial disc replacement now offers an alternative solution. Piriformis syndrome results from entrapment of the sciatic nerve at the greater sciatic notch, with symptoms of pain and numbness radiating from the buttock to the foot, mimicking radiculopathy.

Methods

In this case series, we report five patients who developed piriformis at our institution after artificial disc replacement.

Results

Five patients, aged 35 to 46 years, developed some or all of the following symptoms in the affected leg after artificial disc replacement: posterior leg and buttock pain, calf weakness, and toe and ball of foot numbness and tingling. The onset of symptoms ranged from 6 days to 8 months postoperative, and became debilitating over time. Each patient was diagnosed with piriformis syndrome through physical examination. Three of the patients received a piriformis injection and reported 50% to 100% pain relief lasting 1 to 3 weeks. The patients subsequently underwent physical therapy that provided relief of their piriformis syndrome-related pain and enabled them to resume their normal activities.

Conclusion

Piriformis syndrome has not previously been described in the literature as a sequela of lumbar artificial disc replacement. Our case series indicates that this complication may be underdiagnosed. Careful consideration after artificial disc replacement is required if the patient presents with buttock, leg or foot pain, and/or numbness. It is important for physicians to recognize the symptoms of piriformis syndrome and to differentiate piriformis syndrome from nerve root compression and irritation or referred pain from spinal structures. Although controversial, the proper diagnosis of piriformis syndrome may have prevented some of these patients from undergoing unnecessary surgical procedures.

2.5. Questions about pain characteristics

For each of the marked first-tier regions, the respondent was asked to rate pain onset, episode frequency, episode duration (including constant pain without pause), pain intensity, bothering, and depth of pain (superficial, deep, or both). If the respondent had experienced more than one type of pain within a first-tier region, he or she was asked to rate the pain that had bothered him or her the most.

Onset of pain was assessed with the response options less than 4 weeks, 1 to 2, 3 to 5, 6 to 11 months, 1 to 2, 3 to 5 years, and more than 5 years. Participants reporting more than 5 years in pain were asked to report about their age at pain onset. Episode frequency was reported on a 29-point numeric rating scale (NRS; 0–28 days) (Question: During the last 4 weeks: How many days have you had the pain?). Episode duration within the last 4 weeks (Question: About how much of the day have you usually had the pain? [Only count the time when you are awake]) was assessed with the response options less than 1, 1 to 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 10 hours, more than 10 hours, or all the time, without pause. Pain intensity the last 4 weeks was rated on a NRS with the anchors "No pain" (0) and "The strongest imaginable pain" (10) by answering the question "How strong has the pain usually been?" Similarly, bothering the last 4 weeks was rated on a NRS with the anchors "No bother" (0) and "The greatest imaginable bother" (10), in response to the question "How much has the pain usually bothered you?" Depth of pain was assessed by the question "Where is the pain located?" using the response options "Superficially", "Deeply", "Both of the above", or "I don't know". Participants who reported pain in the lower back were also asked about radiating leg pain (yes/no), the distance of the radiation (hip/buttocks; thigh/knee; lower leg/ankle; heel/sole of the foot; instep/toes), and those with pain radiating to the heel, foot sole, or toes where asked about altered sensation in the painful foot (eg, numbness and tingling) (yes/no).

### Facet joint syndrome: from diagnosis to interventional management [^116hsNDS]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation and pain patterns

FJ as a source of LBP was first described by Goldthwaite in 1911, and Ghormhley who used the term "facet syndrome" to describe a symptom originating from the FJ. It was initially described as lumbosacral pain with or without sciatica in 1933. Ten years later, Badgley et al. suggested FJ as the source of up to 80% of back pain. Facet syndrome included local pain and pseudo radicular radiation with variability of the distribution of referral patterns of pain. Most authors tried to classify the distribution of FJ pain provoked by an infiltration or electrical stimulation. The majority of these studies have not found reliable referral patterns of FJ pain. As suggested by Cohen, this may be explained by the fact that stimulation does not reproduce physiological conditions. FJ pain may be referred distally into the lower limb, thereby mimicking sciatica. "Pseudo-radicular" lumbar pain typically radiates uni- or bilaterally to the buttock and the trochanteric region (from the L4 and L5 levels), the groin and the thighs (from L2 to L5), ending above the knee, without neurological deficits (Fig. 5). However, radiating pain may reach the foot, mimicking sciatic pain, especially in cases of osteophytes or synovial cysts. Claudication is possible. Pain is usually worse in the morning, during periods of inactivity, and following stress exercise, lumbar spine extension or rotary trunk motions, is provoked by standing or sitting positions, and may be elicited on FJ palpation. Pain radiation can be subdivided into primary, secondary and least commonly painful areas as previously described by Barlocher et al. Abdominal and pelvic pain have also been described. Differential diagnoses include true sciatica, hip pathology (hip osteoarthritis or greater trochanteric bursitis) or sacroiliac impairment. However, lumbar FJ syndrome seems not to be a reliable clinical diagnosis, and a specific etiology of back pain can be diagnosed in only about 15% of patients with certainty based on clinical examination alone. The results of studies investigating the FJ as the source of a patient's symptoms suggest that the currently available tests have limited or no diagnostic validity. Moreover, history and physical examination may suggest but not confirm FJ as the source of pain.

### Piriformis syndrome: a real pain in the buttock? [^113FeAc4]. Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Herein, we provide an unbiased review of piriformis syndrome (PS), a highly controversial syndrome for which no consensus exists regarding diagnostic criteria or pathophysiology.

Methods

A review of the literature in the English language.

Results

A nonpartisan review of the medical literature pertaining to PS revealed that the existence of this entity remains controversial. There is no definitive proof of its existence despite reported series with large numbers of patients.

Conclusion

PS remains a controversial diagnosis for sciatic pain. The debate regarding the clinical significance of PS remains active. Nonetheless, there may be a subset of patients in whom the piriformis muscle is a source of pain. The syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with unilateral lower extremity pain.

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines — diagnostic features by lumbar level specify characteristic patterns for nerve root involvement. At L3–4 (nerve root L4), pain involves "Low back; hip; anterolateral thigh; medial leg", numbness is "Anteromedial thigh and knee", atrophy involves "Quadriceps", motor weakness is "Extension of quadriceps", screening uses "Squat and rise", and reflexes show "Knee jerk diminished". At L4–5 (nerve root L5), atrophy is "Minor or nonspecific", motor weakness is "Dorsiflexion of great toe and foot", screening is "Heel walking", and reflexes are "None reliable" [pain and numbness cells present in table but not extracted here]. At L5–S1 (nerve root S1), atrophy is "Gastrocnemius and soleus", motor weakness is "Plantar flexion of great toe and foot", screening is "Walking on toes", and reflexes show "Ankle jerk diminished". The page notes that "A neurologic and musculoskeletal examination may assist in the diagnosis of radiculopathy or radicular pain with identification of disc herniation at various levels", and that "Straight leg raising or cross straight leg raising and motor examination may be crucial in the assessment of disc herniation".

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^115NwCLA]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

3.2. Outcomes phase 1a: terminology

The working group agreed that the term "sciatica" is not accurate (ie, the sciatic nerve is typically not affected with spine-related leg pain), is used inconsistently (ie, no agreed definition or clinical criteria), and does not always help to make sense of pain for patients. However, the panel also acknowledged that the term "sciatica" has a historically strong hold in the wider clinical and research communities: It is well established in patient and public language (even if its use is not always in a neural context) and firmly embedded in the scientific literature (eg, it is Medical Subject Headings in leading search databases). For these reasons, and from a pragmatic point of view, the panel recognised that the term "sciatica" is likely to be retained by the wider public and research community.

Nevertheless, the panel recommended discouraging the term "sciatica" for use in clinical practice and research. If used, it should include further specification of what the term means. Clinically, such specification may include a more accurate explanation for patients (ie, that the source is in the back and that there is variability among presentations. For an example see). In a research setting, further specification should include the use of more accurate case definitions (see below for recommended case definitions for specific spine-related leg pain). As a minimum, a description of specific clinical criteria used as case definition for the study population need to be provided.

3.2.1. Recommended case definitions of specific spine-related leg pain

The panel recommended the use of case definitions for specific spine-related leg pain, including the following:
(1) Somatic-referred pain
(2) Radicular pain without or with radiculopathy

The case definitions of somatic-referred pain, radicular pain, and radiculopathy have already been defined and described by Bogdukand have been incorporated into the IASP terminology. The working group in principle agreed with these case definitions and their descriptions. We collated the descriptions of each case definition and added several clarifying adjustments (Table 1, and text in italics below). Of note, the panel emphasised that differentiation of these specific case definitions needs to take place in the context of the broader clinical presentation and, ideally, a detailed clinical examination.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^115P7Z1M]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) etiologic descriptors distinguish nonspecific, specific, radiculopathy, sciatica, and visceral disease–related pain as follows: Nonspecific low back pain is pain in which no specific cause or structure can be identified to account for the patient's perceived symptoms; specific low back pain is pain that can be linked to a disorder, disease, infection, injury, trauma, or structural deformity and a potential causal relationship can be found between the diagnosis and the pain; radiculopathy is dysfunction of a nerve root associated with pain, sensory impairment, weakness, or diminished deep tendon reflexes in a nerve root distribution; sciatica is pain radiating down the leg below the knee in the distribution of the sciatic nerve, suggesting nerve root compromise due to mechanical pressure or inflammation and is the most common symptom of lumbar radiculopathy; and visceral diseases resulting in back pain are pain secondary to diseases of the viscera with examples including endometriosis, prostatitis, and aortic aneurysm.

4. **Phase 2**: identification of neuropathic pain

It is well established that a proportion of patients with spine-related leg pain have neuropathic pain. Prevalence values range from 19% to 80% partly reflecting varying diagnostic criteria to identify neuropathic pain. The controversies surrounding the question whether spine-related leg pain, in particular radicular pain, is neuropathic, is reflected in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 coding system". Sciatica" (ME84.3) and "lumbago with sciatica" (ME84.20) are listed under "symptoms, signs, or clinical findings of the musculoskeletal system". By contrast, "radiculopathy", "radicular pain", and "nerve root and plexus compressions" are listed under "diseases of the nervous system". Of note, the term chronic peripheral neuropathic pain includes "chronic painful radiculopathy". As such, depending on the terminology used to define patients with spine-related leg pain (ie, sciatica or radicular pain or painful radiculopathy), ICD-11 coding could either suggest a nociceptive/musculoskeletal or a neuropathic condition for the same presentation. This highlights potential areas in operationalising the ICD-11 that may need revising or further clarification.

### Anatomical etiology of "pseudo-sciatica" from superior cluneal nerve entrapment: a laboratory investigation [^113T3nrT]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

The sciatic nerve is formed by the fourth and fifth lumbar nerve roots and the first two sacral nerve roots. Sciatic pain usually radiates along a broad line from the middle or lower buttock, proceeding dorsolaterally in the thigh due to compression of the L5 nerve root and posteriorly with compression of a1. With less frequent L4 compression, the pain is anterolateral in the thigh. Earlier anatomical studies, revealed that the medial branch of the SCN is composed of the lateral branch of posterior rami of L1, L2, or L3, thus referred pain would appear in the groin or anterior thigh. Therefore, these previous studies do not explain how SCN entrapment causes pseudo-sciatica. To address this issue, the study presented here focuses on the origin of SCNs passing through the osteofibrous tunnel.

### Anatomical etiology of "pseudo-sciatica" from superior cluneal nerve entrapment: a laboratory investigation [^112xsKXe]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The superior cluneal nerve (SCN) may become entrapped where it pierces the thoracolumbar fascia over the iliac crest; this can cause low back pain (LBP) and referred pain radiating into the posterior thigh, calf, and occasionally the foot, producing the condition known as "pseudo-sciatica". Because the SCN was thought to be a cutaneous branch of the lumbar dorsal rami, originating from the dorsal roots of L1–L3, previous anatomical studies failed to explain why SCN causes "pseudo-sciatica". The purpose of the present anatomical study was to better elucidate the anatomy and improve the understanding of "pseudo-sciatica" from SCN entrapment.

Materials and methods

SCN branches were dissected from their origin to termination in subcutaneous tissue in 16 cadavers (5 male and 11 female) with a mean death age of 88 years (range 81–101 years). Special attention was paid to identify SCNs from their emergence from nerve roots and passage through the fascial attachment to the iliac crest.

Results

Eighty-one SCN branches were identified originating from T12 to L5 nerve roots with 13 branches passing through the osteofibrous tunnel. These 13 branches originated from L3 (two sides), L4 (six sides), and L5 (five sides). Ten of the 13 branches showed macroscopic entrapment in the tunnel.

Conclusion

The majority of SCNs at risk of nerve entrapment originated from the lower lumbar nerve. These anatomical results may explain why patients with SCN entrapment often evince leg pain or tingling that mimics sciatica.

### Computed tomography for the diagnosis of lumbar spinal pathology in adult patients with low back pain or sciatica: a diagnostic systematic review [^111TnhFU]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of CT scans vary considerably across primary diagnostic studies. Potential sources of heterogeneity include: difference in considered pathology, variation in CT protocols, differences in study design, included study populations, or the methodological quality of the studies. Therefore, our aim is to provide evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of CT in patients with LBP or sciatica with symptoms suspected to be caused by specific underlying pathology. Sciatica is here defined as nerve root pain or radiating leg pain. We also aim to assess the potential influence of various sources of heterogeneity on the outcomes.

### Nerve entrapment syndromes of the lower limb: a pictorial review [^113C6Kip]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Digital nerves

The digital nerves of the foot are sensory branches given off by the medial and lateral plantar nerves. The medial plantar nerve terminates with the digital hallux nerve and the common digital nerves for the second, third, and medial fourth digits. The lateral plantar nerve provides the digital nerve for the fifth digit and the common digital nerve for the fourth and fifth digits. The digital nerves travel in narrow fibro-osseous tunnels formed by the metatarsal heads and intermetatarsal ligaments. Entrapment of the digital nerves can occur in the intermetatarsal space between the metatarsal heads, plantar to the intermetatarsal ligaments. The entrapment leads to perineural fibrosis of the digital nerve, a condition known as Morton's neuroma, which is non-neoplastic (Fig. 6). The most common nerves that are affected are the second and third common digital nerves; this is thought to be due to the second and third intermetatarsal spaces being narrower compared to the first and fourth spaces. Additionally, a theory suggests that the third intermetatarsal space is the most affected by Morton's neuroma because the third digital nerve is thicker due to the contribution of both medial and lateral plantar nerves. The presence of hallux valgus deformity, longer second and third metatarsals, equinus contracture, tight calf muscles or wearing high-heeled shoes can shift the body weight to the region of metatarsal heads, predisposing to interdigital neuropathy. More than one lesion may be detected in the same foot, and bilateral involvement can occur. Classically, patients describe localised pain on the plantar surface of the foot, at the level of the metatarsal heads. The pain can radiate to the corresponding digits and there may be associated paraesthesia. On examination, characteristic findings include intermetatarsal space tenderness upon compression and percussion, and a palpable Mulder's click. The differential diagnoses of Morton's neuroma include stress fractures, Freiberg's infraction, synovitis, bursitis, plantar plate tears and pseudoneuroma. On MRI, Morton's neuromas are isointense to skeletal muscle and well-demarcated from the surrounding hyperintense fat tissue on T1-weighted sequences. On T2-weighted sequences, they demonstrate low to intermediate signal. Post-contrast sequences demonstrate solid enhancement.

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: current concept [^111Cxze9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

This kind of retro-trochanteric pain with radiation has been described as the 'piriformis syndrome'. It may be associated with trauma to the pelvis or buttock, anatomical abnormalities like a bipartite piriformis muscle, the piriformis muscle lying anterior to the nerve, or a hypertrophic muscle irritating the sciatic nerve (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4). Several other diagnoses must be considered for patients with retro-trochanteric pain; they include herniated discs, degenerative changes in the lumbosacral spine, spinal stenosis, osteoarthritis (OA) and minor intra-articular pathology in the hip joint, such as labral tears, and femuro-acetabular impingement (FAI). Furthermore, gynaecological conditions, especially when the right side is affected, should be borne in mind.

GTPS, or retro-trochanteric pain, as we would like to call it, frequently radiates with paraesthesia and may often lead to a referral for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to consider disc herniation or other pathology, instead of conducting a structured physical examination of the affected soft tissue in the gluteal and hip region.

The aim of the study is to describe conditions which can present as retro-trochanteric pain and to make suggestions for investigation and treatment options.

3.2.1.3. Radicular pain with radiculopathy

Radicular pain may occur in association with a radiculopathy. Radiculopathy is caused by a lesion or disease of a nerve root or dorsal root ganglion. Radiculopathy is clinically characterised and defined by neurological deficits (eg, dermatomal hypoesthesia or anaesthesia, myotomal weakness, or reduced or absent reflexes) and may or may not coexist with pain. These neurological deficits are caused by neural conduction slowing or block of small or large nerve fibres or actual axotomy. Whereas true neurological deficits are usually stable, fluctuations for instance with positional changes have been described. Such fluctuations may be related to ischaemic rather than demyelinating conduction block.

Although painless radiculopathy certainly exists (eg, pure motor radiculopathy or mixed sensory and motor radiculopathy without pain), radiculopathy may occur in association with radicular pain, also referred to as painful radiculopathy. The similarities between radicular pain with and without radiculopathy are evidenced by largely comparable pain severity and pain characteristics in those presentations. Occasionally, people with radiculopathy may also have somatic referred pain. One example is a person with residual neurological deficits 2 years after acute onset, who now reports somatic referred pain in the buttock area.

3.2.1.4. Recommendation of an umbrella term encompassing these 3 specific case definitions

The panel agreed that it would be useful to have an umbrella term that includes these 3 specific case definitions. This was considered important both for clinical and research purposes to distinguish limb symptoms originating from structures in the back from those originating from nonspinal structures (eg, somatic-referred pain from the hip and vascular leg pain). Unlike sciatica which linguistically alludes to neural problems, this term should encompass all 3 case definitions of somatic-referred pain, radicular pain and painful radiculopathy.

The following 2 terms were proposed by the working group:
(1) Spine-related leg pain
(2) Back-related leg pain

These 2 terms were taken to a wider consultation with the NeuPSIG membership (see 3.3).

### The efficacy of therapeutic selective nerve block in treating lumbar radiculopathy and avoiding surgery [^112qTvd9]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar radiculopathy is defined as pain in the lower back, radiating to the lower limb along the course of a certain lumbar nerve caused by a pathological process such as inflammation or mechanical compression of that nerve root. It can affect the quality of life and limit the activities of affected patients. It is mostly caused by lumbar disc prolapse (LDP) compressing the nerve root or nerve root foraminal stenosis. Sciatica is a pain in the distribution of the sciatic nerve. Radicular pain can be associated with numbness, paresthesia, tingling, muscle weakness, and loss of specific reflexes, but even without the presence of these symptoms, we cannot exclude the diagnosis.

The compression of the nerve root is mostly caused by herniated discs in approximately 90% of cases. Additionally, foraminal stenosis and, less often, tumors, cysts, inflammation, and/or nerve root injury are other possible causes.

Most sciatica cases can be treated conservatively with rest, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physiotherapy. Failure of conservative management is usually considered in the case of continuity of the pain for at least six weeks. On the other hand, the exact timing needed for the patient to stay on the conservative care before switching to another treatment method has not been appropriately evaluated. Meanwhile, an immediate surgical intervention is required in acute settings, especially in those with acute drop foot or bladder incontinence. In the absence of these red flags, there is much disagreement about surgery's effectiveness in chronic sciatica. Moreover, many patients might be reluctant to undergo surgery or may not be fit for general anesthesia, making it crucial to search for alternative management like Selective Nerve Root Block.

Selective nerve root block (SNRB) is a procedure that can be used as a diagnostic and therapeutic method. SNRB can be used in multiple sites, including cervical and lumbar. Steroids are usually injected near the spinal nerve as it exits from the intervertebral foramen. The use of steroids is due to their ability to reduce inflammation and induce numbness to the pain transmission through the nerve. The procedure can be done under fluoroscopy or CT guidance. The use of SNRB in patients with severe pain can reduce their pain and thus reduce their need for surgery. The objective of our study is to investigate the effectiveness of the use of fluoroscopy-guided therapeutic SNRB as a non-surgical option for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation and/or foraminal stenosis.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^111hJa24]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSION

Musculoskeletal disorders are common in patients referred to electrodiagnostic medicine specialists. Not all pain that radiates to the buttock, thigh, leg, or foot arises from compression of one or more lumbosacral spinal nerve root(s). Recognition of musculoskeletal disorders that may mimic radiculopathy is important to avoid unnecessary diagnostic testing, potentially inappropriate invasive procedures, and to improve patient care and satisfaction.

### Sciatica-like symptoms and the sacroiliac joint: clinical features and differential diagnosis [^114Xftp5]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the clinical features of patients with sacroiliac joint (SIJ)-related sciatica-like symptoms to those with sciatica from nerve root compression and to investigate the necessity to perform radiological imaging in patients with sciatica-like symptoms derived from the SIJ.

Methods

Patients with pain radiating below the buttocks with a duration of 4 weeks to 1 year were included. After physical and radiological examinations, a diagnosis of SI joint-related pain, pain due to disk herniation, or a combination of these two causes was made.

Results

Patients with SIJ-related leg pain (n = 77/186) were significantly more often female, had shorter statue, a shorter duration of symptoms, and had more often pain radiating to the groin and a history of a fall on the buttocks. Muscle weakness, corkscrew phenomenon, finger-floor distance ≥ 25 cm, lumbar scoliosis, positive Bragard or Kemp sign, and positive leg raising test were more often present when radiologic nerve root compression was present. Although these investigations may help, MRI of the spine is necessary to discriminate between the groups.

Conclusions

Sciatica-like symptoms derived from the SIJ can clinically mimic a radiculopathy. We suggest to perform a thorough physical examination of the spine, SI joints, and hips with additional radiological tests to exclude other causes.

Sciatic nerve

The sciatic nerve arises from the anterior divisions of the L4 to S3 nerve roots and leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen at the inferior border of the piriformis muscle. It provides motor supply to the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus and the hamstring portion of the adductor magnus. The sciatic nerve divides into the tibial nerve and common peroneal nerve which provide motor and sensory supply to the anterior, lateral and posterior lower leg as well as to the sole of the foot. The proximal sciatic nerve may be compromised by trauma, tumours, haematomas and compression in the subgluteal space is termed deep gluteal syndrome. Causes of this include piriformis syndrome, ischiofemoral impingement and fibrovascular bands. The distal branches can be damaged by fractures, bandages or tumours such as ganglion cysts.

Piriformis syndrome (illustrated in Fig. 1) is a controversial diagnosis, with no consensus about diagnostic criteria. Hence, the diagnosis is typically one of exclusion. In particular, it is important to exclude lumbar spinal pathology before making the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome. The aetiology of this syndrome is nerve compression or irritation in the greater sciatic foramen by disorders related to the piriformis muscle. This can be primary, as a result of intrinsic piriformis muscle pathology such as hypertrophy. More commonly, it is secondary to other pathology at the level of the greater sciatic foramen, for example space-occupying lesions or oedema from sacroiliitis. In a minority of patients, the sciatic nerve passes through the piriformis muscle. Patients suffering from this condition present with neuropathic pain in the sciatic nerve distribution, i.e. the leg and buttock. MRI can demonstrate anatomical variation of the sciatic nerve and hypertrophy of the piriformis muscle. It can also reveal secondary causes such as mass lesions. Electromyography can aid in diagnosis. Treatment for piriformis syndrome includes physical therapy, and a combination of local anaesthetic and corticosteroid injections, which may also have a diagnostic role.

### MRI investigation of radiating pain in the lower limbs: value of an additional sequence dedicated to the lumbosacral plexus and pelvic girdle [^111329qD]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

In some cases, sciatica-like symptoms radiating through the buttock, anterior thigh, or leg result from spinal root compression in an extraspinal location or from injury to the pelvic girdle. It has been suggested that adding a coronal STIR sequence dedicated to the lumbosacral plexus and pelvis to the routine MRI protocol can provide a good depiction of disorders of this type.

Materials and Methods

Two hundred nine patients with sciatica-like symptoms of suspected lumbar origin were included in the study. Disorders responsible for symptoms involving extraspinal compression of the lumbosacral plexus or pelvic girdle were retrospectively noted and correlated with age, sex, location of pain, referring physician, presence of discoradicular impingement liable to explain symptoms, and history of neoplasia.

Results

An extraspinal cause of symptoms was depicted in 12 cases (5.7%), including three cases of extraspinal compression and nine differential diagnoses in the pelvic region. Prevalence of an extraspinal cause of pain was significantly correlated with the absence of discoradicular impingement in the spine (p = 0.046). A higher prevalence of extraspinal compression of the lumbosacral plexus (p = 0.029) was seen in patients 60 years old or older, whereas no other feature was statistically associated with an extraspinal cause of pain.

Conclusion

Because of its short acquisition time and subsequent low cost, the additional coronal STIR sequence should be performed in the routine MRI investigation of sciatica-like symptoms when no discoradicular impingement is seen in the spine to depict an extraspinal cause of symptoms.

### Nerve entrapment syndromes of the lower limb: a pictorial review [^116i5fCf]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Tibial nerve

The tibial nerve arises from the sciatic nerve and descends into the posterior compartment of the lower leg deep to the soleus, plantaris, and gastrocnemius muscles. It then enters the tarsal tunnel, which is formed by the calcaneus, talus, medial malleolus and flexor retinaculum — entrapment is common at this site and is termed "tarsal tunnel syndrome". The tibial nerve is accompanied in the tarsal tunnel by the tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendons, and the posterior tibial vein and artery. The tibial nerve then divides into the medial calcaneal nerve and the lateral and medial plantar nerves at the distal tarsal tunnel. The tibial nerve provides sensory supply to the posterolateral leg and, via the medial and lateral plantar nerves, to the sole of the foot. It provides motor supply to the posterior compartment of the leg and, via the medial and lateral plantar nerves, supplies most intrinsic muscles of the foot.

Common aetiologies of tarsal tunnel syndrome include post-traumatic fibrosis from previous fracture, tenosynovitis, external compression from space-occupying lesions such as ganglion cysts and tumours including schwannoma, dilated tortuous veins and accessory muscles. Figure 2 illustrates the contents of the tarsal tunnel and shows an example of anatomical variation of the flexor hallucis longus muscle which can predispose to tarsal tunnel syndrome. Foot deformities have also been implicated, including hindfoot valgus and less commonly forefoot pronation, pes planus and tarsal coalition. In up to 40% of patients, an underlying cause is not identified. Compression of the proximal tibial nerve, the so-called soleal sling syndrome, is uncommon. It occurs when the proximal tibial nerve travels beneath the tendinous sling at the origin of the soleus muscle. Patients most commonly report burning pain and paraesthesia along the plantar aspect of the foot and digits that worsens with activity. Clinical examination can reveal sensory loss along the plantar aspect of the foot and a positive Tinel's sign at the tarsal tunnel. MRI allows the identification of space-occupying lesions, fibrotic scar tissue, anomalous muscles and hindfoot deformities. Conservative treatment options include analgesia and local corticosteroid injections. Surgical decompression of the nerve is typically performed in cases of failure of conservative treatment.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^114RAua5]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — diagnostic performance of examination findings indicates that sensory abnormalities were found in 54% of patients, with L5 dermatome sensory disturbance yielding PPV 76% and NPV 55% and S1 dermatome PPV 50% and NPV 62%; motor weakness was found in 54%, with dorsiflexion paresis at L4–5 showing PPV 69% and NPV 47% and paresis of the four lateral toes at L5-S1 showing PPV 76% and NPV 51%. Reliability for localizing level included L5 pain projection 79% (rising to 86% with extensor hallucis longus weakness), S1 pain 85%, increased to 80% with a dropped Achilles reflex and to 86% with an added sensory deficit; myelography was accurate in 90.8% with a 3.7% false positive rate and a 5.5% false negative rate, while cough impulse was positive in 74% and Lasegue's sign in 94%. Additional findings noted that projected pain localization was possible in 93% of cases, the patellar reflex had no value in low lumbar lesions, and extensor hallucis longus weakness was due to L4–5 rupture in 70% of cases. In comparative testing, Lasegue's sign had the best sensitivity (0.77–0.83), the crossed test had the best specificity (0.74–0.89), with overall positive predictive value fair (0.55–0.69) and negative predictive values weak to fair (0.45–0.63); this provides Level I diagnostic evidence that hyperextension, Bell, Lasegue's and Crossed Lasegue's tests are useful in diagnosing lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: current concept [^111xzvJL]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

If the patient has not improved after 6–8 weeks of treatment, imaging should be considered to determine whether a herniated disc with nerve root compression is present. Surgery may be needed to relieve the pressure on the nerve root. There are several surgical methods for treating disc herniation; they include discectomy, microdiscectomy, microendoscopic discectomy, transforaminal endoscopic discectomy and chemonucleolysis. The cauda equine syndrome is an absolute indication for immediate surgery, but elective surgery is the treatment of choice for unilateral sciatica.

Niu et al. suggested that several patients had persistent sciatica, despite lumbar decompression surgery for lumbar disc herniation or stenosis, and the 'piriformis syndrome' was subsequently confirmed through a positive response to the injection of a local anaesthetic agent and pain and weakness on forced passive internal rotation of the extended hip (the Freiberg's sign). Eleven of 12 patients in their study were thus successfully treated for the 'piriformis syndrome' with injections and conservative treatment. The overall satisfaction rate was 83% and they therefore suggested excluding the 'piriformis syndrome' before diagnosing lumbar radiculopathy.

The fifth subject (E) had a very muscular thigh, and the insertion needle could not reach the sciatic nerve more cephalad than 12 cm proximal to the popliteal crease. He therefore had the lead inserted within the popliteal fossa and experienced cramping in his foot with high current following surgery. He was discharged with his stimulator set at a current below the threshold associated with the cramping, with excellent analgesia experienced until the lead was removed on POD 16.

The seventh subject had a lead inserted 5 cm proximal to the sciatic bifurcation that was discovered fractured 1.5 cm from the distal tip 1 week later on the day of surgery. It was replaced with a lead immediately cephalad to the sciatic bifurcation with sensory changes in the toes. The subject experienced almost no pain whatsoever without any opioid requirements until her stimulator reported a lead issue on POD 21. She returned to clinic the following day, and during removal, the lead fractured at the skin after approximately 2.5 cm had been extracted.

All lead remnants were left in situ. No lead infections, nerve injuries, or lead fracture remnant sequelae were identified during the final 2 data-collection phone calls on POD 30 or 90.

### Nerve entrapment syndromes of the lower limb: a pictorial review [^113MwVy5]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Sural nerve

The sural nerve is a pure sensory nerve. It is formed by the joining of the medial sural nerve (branch of the tibial nerve) and the lateral sural cutaneous nerve (from the common peroneal nerve) at the level of the mid-leg. The nerve courses downward between the two heads of the gastrocnemius and pierces the deep fascia from within at the upper calf. More distally, it courses along the posterolateral aspect of the leg, behind the lateral malleolus and along the lateral aspect of the foot. The nerve supplies sensation to the lateral aspect of the ankle and foot up to the base of the fifth digit. The causes of entrapment include trauma, such as direct contusion to the nerve from fractures of the distal fibula, talus, calcaneus or base of the fifth metatarsal. Damage can occur during lateral ligamentous or peroneal tendon surgery. Other pathologies include traction injury with secondary fibrosis, tendinosis of the Achilles or peroneal tendons, gastrocnemius tear, and space-occupying lesions (Fig. 9). The sural nerve can also be damaged after small saphenous vein saphenectomy or after percutaneous suturing of the Achilles tendon. The clinical presentation includes paraesthesia and/or pain along the lateral ankle and foot, which is exacerbated by inversion and plantar flexion of the foot, and chronic calf pain exacerbated by physical activity. On clinical examination, symptoms can be provoked by plantar flexion and inversion of the foot. MRI may help identify the site of entrapment and the potential cause. There is no muscular denervation oedema as the nerve is purely sensory.

### Traumatic venous varix causing sciatic neuropathy: case report [^113wBi4P]. Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

Sciatic neuropathy rarely presents in nonpenetrating trauma because of protection of the nerve by the pelvis, the gluteal muscles, and the tissues in the posterior thigh. We present the case of a patient who fell and subsequently developed a traumatic venous varix of the inferior gluteal vein that caused compression sciatic neuropathy.

Clinical Presentation

Seven days after a fall onto her right buttock, the patient developed a painful burning paresthesia in her leg and numbness on the dorsum of her foot. Numerous studies ruled out lumbar spine pathological abnormalities as the cause of the pain. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lesion adjacent to the sciatic nerve. Gradient echo and two-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance imaging sequences confirmed this to be a vascular lesion originating from the inferior gluteal vein and compressing the sciatic nerve.

Intervention

Operative resection obliterated the venous varix, thereby relieving the patient's pain and neurological deficit.

Conclusion

No case of a traumatic venous varix of the inferior gluteal vein compressing the sciatic nerve has been reported to date. Surgical resection was successful in obliterating the lesion and relieving the symptoms.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^115KhRu3]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4.8.2 Mechanical low back pain, lumbar facet syndrome, and interspinous ligament pain

Lumbar facet syndrome, also known as lumbar zygapophyseal joint arthropathy, and degenerative changes to the interspinous ligaments, among other anatomical structures, are common causes of chronic low back pain, often intimately associated with degenerative disc disease and other cumulative, degenerative conditions of the axial spine. As with all of the conditions discussed in this review, the lumbar facet joints and interspinous ligaments can produce referred pain, including to the groin, flank, hip, upper and lower lateral thigh, posterior thigh, lower lateral leg, and foot (Figure 3); Pain is usually insidious in onset without a single clear inciting event. Physical exam maneuvers have low reliability but positive features may include pain worse with forward flexion or lumbar extension and/or extension/rotation maneuvers, and pain on palpation of the paraspinal muscles. Diagnostic clarification and therapeutic benefit may arise from facet joint injections and/or medial branch blocks followed by radiofrequency ablation.,

FIGURE 3
Patterns of referred pain from lumbosacral interspinous ligaments. Referred pain from conditions affecting the low back may be mistaken for radiculopathy. For instance, pain generated by lumbosacral interspinous ligaments frequently presents in the patterns outlined above, and therefore can mimic lumbosacral radiculopathy.

### Common painful foot and ankle conditions: a review [^116sXxzw]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Morton neuroma, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles tendinopathy are foot and ankle conditions that are associated with pain and disability, but they can respond to nonoperative treatment.

Observations

Morton neuroma, consisting of interdigital neuronal thickening and fibrosis, is characterized by burning pain in the ball of the foot and numbness or burning pain that may radiate to the affected toes (commonly the third and fourth toes). First-line nonoperative therapy consists of reducing activities that cause pain, orthotics, and interdigital corticosteroid injection; however, approximately 30% of patients may not respond to conservative treatment. Plantar fasciitis accounts for more than 1 million patient visits per year in the US and typically presents with plantar heel pain. Fifteen years after diagnosis, approximately 44% of patients continue to have pain. First-line nonoperative therapy includes stretching of the plantar fascia and foot orthotics, followed by extracorporeal shockwave therapy, corticosteroid injection, or platelet-rich plasma injection. Midportion Achilles tendinopathy presents with pain approximately 2 to 6 cm proximal to the Achilles insertion on the heel. The primary nonoperative treatment involves eccentric strengthening exercises, but extracorporeal shockwave therapy may be used.

Conclusions and Relevance

Morton neuroma, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles tendinopathy are painful foot and ankle conditions. First-line therapies are activity restriction, orthotics, and corticosteroid injection for Morton neuroma; stretching and foot orthotics for plantar fasciitis; and eccentric strengthening exercises for Achilles tendinopathy.

6.2 Versus Neuropathic Pain Conditions

Neuropathic pain conditions, including radiculopathies and peripheral neuropathies, often mimic MPS due to overlapping symptoms, such as radiating or referred pain patterns. Radiculopathies involve compression or irritation of the nerve roots, resulting in pain, numbness, and weakness along the distribution of the affected nerve root. Similarly, peripheral neuropathies arise from damage to peripheral nerves and typically present with burning, tingling, or electric shock‐like sensations alongside pain.

Despite the similarities, there are distinct differences. Neuropathic pain is characterized by specific neurological signs, including sensory deficits and, when motor nerve fibers are involved, muscle weakness and altered reflexes — features that are absent in MPS. Additionally, while neuropathic pain patterns align with dermatomal distributions corresponding to affected nerve pathways, the referred pain patterns in MPS originate from trigger points in specific muscles and do not follow a dermatomal pattern. A thorough neurological examination is crucial, as it can help identify sensory abnormalities, muscle weakness, and reflex changes that are hallmarks of neuropathic conditions.

Case report

A 29-year-old healthy woman presented with a 9-month history of progressive right lower limb weakness and dysesthesia. Initial presentation was marked by fatigue on walking long distances, followed by persistent paraesthesia in the right leg. She subsequently developed right knee weakness associated with loss of balance and falls. Finally, she developed a right foot drop over a period of 48 hours, resulting in hospital admission. Examination at the time revealed normal cranial nerve, upper limb and left lower limb neurological examinations. Right lower limb tone was normal and motor examination revealed MRC grade 5/5 hip flexion, 4/5 hip extension, 4-/5 knee flexion, 4+/5 knee extension, 4/5 ankle inversion/eversion, 3/5 ankle dorsiflexion and 4-/5 plantar flexion. Right knee and ankle jerks were absent with a down-going plantar response. Sensation to light touch, pain and temperature was diminished below the right mid-shin. She required crutches to mobilise.

### The management of sciatica by acupuncture: an expert consensus using the improved Delphi survey [^116RjcAy]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory, syndrome differentiation including eight principles, Zang-fu, meridians, Qi and Blood, or Triple-Energizer, is one of the basic principles of individual diagnosis and treatment of acupuncture. In TCM, acupoints are a special part of the body's viscera meridians and blood transfusion. The meridian system is the channel through which qi and blood flow. In the practice of acupuncture, the corresponding acupoints should be selected according to the meridian differentiation. In this study, we reached the consensus that acupuncture treatment of sciatica should pay attention to syndrome differentiation and meridian syndrome differentiation, which reflects the uniqueness of TCM theory, and thus guarantees the efficacy of acupuncture treatment.

Although what is the optimal treatment method has always been the focus of acupuncture practitioners, however, due to the lack of sufficient evidence to promote the routine use of acupuncture treatment, there are many debates about acupuncture treatment of sciatica, partly because there is not enough high-quality evidence to fully explore possible dose-related responses. Therefore, after extensively soliciting the suggestions and opinions of multiple clinicians, our study formulated an expert consensus around the clinical-specific problems for acupuncture treatment of sciatica based on systematic review evidence.

### Treatments for Morton's neuroma [^1145ouhX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Morton's neuroma (MN) is a painful neuropathy resulting from a benign enlargement of the common plantar digital nerve that occurs commonly in the third webspace and, less often, in the second webspace of the foot. Symptoms include burning or shooting pain in the webspace that extends to the toes, or the sensation of walking on a pebble. These impact on weight-bearing activities and quality of life.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of interventions for MN.

Search Methods

On 11 July 2022, we searched CENTRAL, CINAHL Plus EBSCOhost, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, Embase Ovid, MEDLINE Ovid, and WHO ICTRP. We checked the bibliographies of identified randomised trials and systematic reviews and contacted trial authors as needed.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised, parallel-group trials (RCTs) of any intervention compared with placebo, control, or another intervention for MN. We included trials where allocation occurred at the level of the individual or the foot (clustered data). We included trials that confirmed MN through symptoms, a clinical test, and an ultrasound scan (USS) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We assessed bias using Cochrane's risk of bias 2 tool (RoB 2) and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE framework.

Main Results

We included six RCTs involving 373 participants with MN. We judged risk of bias as having 'some concerns' across most outcomes. No studies had a low risk of bias across all domains. Post-intervention time points reported were: three months to less than 12 months from baseline (nonsurgical outcomes), and 12 months or longer from baseline (surgical outcomes). The primary outcome was pain, and secondary outcomes were function, satisfaction or health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and adverse events (AE). Nonsurgical treatments Corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injection (CS+LA) versus local anaesthetic injection (LA) Two RCTs compared CS+LA versus LA. At three to six months:

- CS+LA may result in little to no difference in pain (mean difference (MD) -6.31 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -14.23 to 1.61; P = 0.12, I² = 0%; 2 studies, 157 participants; low-certainty evidence). (Assessed via a pain visual analogue scale (VAS; 0 to 100 mm); a lower score indicated less pain.)
- CS+LA may result in little to no difference in function when compared with LA (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.30, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.02; P = 0.06, I² = 0%; 2 studies, 157 participants; low-certainty evidence). (Function was measured using: the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Lesser Toe Metatarsophalangeal-lnterphalangeal Scale (AOFAS; 0 to 100 points) - we transformed the scale so that a lower score indicated improved function - and the Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Schedule (MFPDS; 0 to 100 points), where a lower score indicated improved function.)
- CS+LA probably results in little to no difference in HRQoL when compared to LA (MD 0.07, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.17; P = 0.19; 1 study, 122 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and CS+LA may not increase satisfaction (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.85; P = 0.78; 1 study, 35 participants; low-certainty evidence). (Assessed using the EuroQol five dimension instrument (EQ-5D; 0–1 point); a higher score indicated improved HRQoL.)
- The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of CS+LA on AE when compared with LA (RR 9.84, 95% CI 1.28 to 75.56; P = 0.03, I² = 0%; 2 studies, 157 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events for CS+LA included mild skin atrophy (3.9%), hypopigmentation of the skin (3.9%) and plantar fat pad atrophy (2.6%); no adverse events were observed with LA. Ultrasound-guided (UG) CS+LA versus non-ultrasound-guided (NUG) CS+LA Two RCTs compared UG CS+LA versus NUG CS+LA. At six months:

- UG CS+LA probably reduces pain when compared with NUG CS+LA (MD -15.01 mm, 95% CI -27.88 to -2.14; P = 0.02, I² = 0%; 2 studies, 116 feet; moderate-certainty evidence). (Assessed with a pain VAS.)
- UG CS+LA probably increases function when compared with NUG CS+LA (SMD -0.47, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.10; P = 0.01, I² = 0%; 2 studies, 116 feet; moderate-certainty evidence). We do not know of any established minimum clinical important difference (MCID) for the scales that assessed function, specifically, the MFPDS and the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ; 0 to 100 points; a lower score indicated improved function.)
- UG CS+LA may increase satisfaction compared with NUG CS+LA (risk ratio (RR) 1.71, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.44; P = 0.003, I² = 15%; 2 studies, 114 feet; low-certainty evidence).
- HRQoL was not measured.
- UG CS+LA may result in little to no difference in AE when compared with NUG CS+LA (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.39; P = 0.15, I² = 0%; 2 studies, 116 feet; low-certainty evidence). AE included depigmentation or fat atrophy for UG CS+LA (4.9%) and NUG CS+LA (12.7%). Surgical treatments Plantar incision neurectomy (PN) versus dorsal incision neurectomy (DN) One study compared PN versus DN. At 34 months (mean; range 28 to 42 months), PN may result in little to no difference for satisfaction (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.28; P = 0.58; 1 study, 73 participants; low-certainty evidence), or for AE (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.85; P = 0.93; 1 study, 75 participants; low-certainty evidence) compared with DN. AE for PN included hypertrophic scaring (11.4%), foreign body reaction (2.9%); AE for DN included missed nerve (2.5%), artery resected (2.5%), wound infection (2.5%), postoperative dehiscence (2.5%), deep vein thrombosis (2.5%) and reoperation with plantar incision due to intolerable pain (5%). The data reported for pain and function were not suitable for analysis. HRQoL was not measured.

Authors' Conclusions

Although there are many interventions for MN, few have been assessed in RCTs. There is low-certainty evidence that CS+LA may result in little to no difference in pain or function, and moderate-certainty evidence that UG CS+LA probably reduces pain and increases function for people with MN. Future trials should improve methodology to increase certainty of the evidence, and use optimal sample sizes to decrease imprecision.

### Metatarsalgia [^117AvMUw]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

Metatarsalgia (ie, metatarsal pain) is one of the most common reports in patients with foot problems. This pain is confined to the area across the plantar forefoot, including the second through fourth metatarsal heads. However, it is frequently accompanied by deformity of the first and fifth rays as well as of the toes. There is great variability in possible causative factors, but all of them seem to be related to gait mechanics, foot anatomy, and foot and ankle deformity. An individualized treatment protocol is required. Nonsurgical management is usually sufficient to achieve satisfactory results. Surgical correction must be precise, and all pain-producing deformities must be corrected. Most patients present with abnormalities of the distal metatarsals. Metatarsal osteotomy, long a staple of treatment, always fails in the long term. Improved equipment and internal fixation methods may lead to better long-term outcomes.

### Mimickers of lumbar radiculopathy [^113PT2TN]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Orthopaedic surgeons frequently treat patients who report pain that radiates from the back into the lower extremity. Although the most common etiology is either a herniated disk or spinal stenosis, a myriad of pathologies can mimic the symptoms of radiculopathy, resulting in differences in the clinical presentation and the workup. Therefore, the clinician must be able to distinguish the signs and symptoms of lumbar radiculopathy from pathologies that may have a similar presentation. Being cognizant of these other possible conditions enables the physician to consider a breadth of alternative diagnoses when a patient presents with radiating lower extremity pain.

### Deep gluteal syndrome as a cause of posterior hip pain and sciatica-like pain [^115LxdfY]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Deep gluteal syndrome is an increasingly recognized disease entity, caused by compression of the sciatic or pudendal nerve due to non-discogenic pelvic lesions. It includes the piriformis syndrome, the gemelli-obturator internus syndrome, the ischiofemoral impingement syndrome, and the proximal hamstring syndrome. The concept of the deep gluteal syndrome extends our understanding of posterior hip pain due to nerve entrapment beyond the traditional model of the piriformis syndrome. Nevertheless, there has been terminological confusion and the deep gluteal syndrome has often been undiagnosed or mistaken for other conditions. Careful history-taking, a physical examination including provocation tests, an electrodiagnostic study, and imaging are necessary for an accurate diagnosis. After excluding spinal lesions, MRI scans of the pelvis are helpful in diagnosing deep gluteal syndrome and identifying pathological conditions entrapping the nerves. It can be conservatively treated with multidisciplinary treatment including rest, the avoidance of provoking activities, medication, injections, and physiotherapy. Endoscopic or open surgical decompression is recommended in patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms after conservative treatment or in those who may have masses compressing the sciatic nerve. Many physicians remain unfamiliar with this syndrome and there is a lack of relevant literature. This comprehensive review aims to provide the latest information about the epidemiology, aetiology, pathology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Nerve entrapment syndromes of the lower limb: a pictorial review [^111QAvBe]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

The deep peroneal nerve provides motor function to the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg, including the tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, peroneus tertius and extensor hallucis longus, and its lateral terminal branch innervates two of the intrinsic muscles of the foot, the extensor digitorum brevis and extensor hallucis brevis.

In terms of sensory innervation, the deep peroneal nerve, during its course in the anterior compartment of the leg, provides branches to innervate the ankle joint, its medial terminal branch gives a sensory branch to the first metatarsophalangeal joint and provides cutaneous innervation to the adjacent sides and the webbing between the first two toes, and its lateral terminal branch gives sensory innervation to the tarsal joint as well as the middle three metatarsophalangeal joints.

Entrapment of the deep peroneal nerve can occur as it passes through the anterior tarsal tunnel, known as anterior tarsal tunnel syndrome (Fig. 8). This can be caused by extrinsic impingement by tight shoes, high heels or trauma and intrinsic impingement through dorsal osteophytes over the tibiotalar and talonavicular joints, other bony deformities or ganglion cysts. This can cause symptoms and signs including dysesthesia and paraesthesia on the dorsum of the foot, weakness or atrophy of the extensor digitorum brevis, positive Tinel sign over the course of the deep peroneal nerve and pain. The diagnosis can be supported by imaging features, such as increased nerve calibre and hypoechogenic appearance on ultrasound. MRI is particularly helpful for identifying the underlying compressive cause.

### Sciatica of nondisc origin: hydatid cyst of the sciatic nerve. case report [^114UzZse]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2008). Low credibility.

The authors report on an 81-year-old woman with a primary hydatid cyst located in the posteromedial aspect of the thigh. She presented with sciatica, and the cyst was also associated with neurological dysfunction because of its intra-neural location. Diagnosis of a cyst in a nerve body is very rare, and the one reported here might be the first such case. So far, in all the previously reported cases in which there were also neurological findings, the cysts in the vertebral column were compressing the spinal cord or there was an intrapelvic mass compressing the sciatic nerve. Hydatid cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sciatica, especially when treating patients who live in or have emigrated from areas of the world where Echinococcus granulosus is prevalent.

Common Causes for LBP

Common causes for LBP include muscle spasm, disc pathology, nerve root impingement (resulting in radiculopathy), spinal stenosis (with or without neurogenic claudication), and joint issues involving the intraarticular facet or sacroiliac joints. More advanced pathological causes of acute and chronic LBP include vertebral fractures, axial spondyloarthropathies, cancer metastases, and spinal infections. However, most people suffer with CLBP that has no recognized specific cause. The cervical and lumbar paravertebral region contain many muscle groups, which control nearly all spinal motions and posture. Physical and mental stressors contribute to spasm of these muscles, with resulting postural changes and non-specific pain. There are a multitude of treatments available for nonspecific CLBP, some of which will be reviewed below. Chemical radiculitis may be the source of radiating leg pain in patients with discogenic disease without radiographic evidence of disc herniation. Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) frequently document asymptomatic findings, including disc herniations in 20% of patients without LBP less than age 60 years and 36% above age 60. Symptomatic findings on MRI may include disc herniation or high-intensity zone lesions which are often considered as pain generators. While exact mechanisms are poorly understood, evidence indicates that multiple pathophysiological pathways are associated with non-specific LBP. For example, gluteal muscle spasm can lead to symptoms suggestive of radicular pain, or "pseudo-sciatica" symptoms often referred to as piriformis syndrome. Another challenging fact is that discogenic pain may only be axial in nature; studies have shown a correlation between vertebral endplate (Modic) changes seen on MRI scans and LBP.

### Main trunk tibial neuropathies [^1135Ee6M]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The authors present a retrospective study of 52 patients with main trunk tibial neuropathy. They found trauma and ischemia to be the most frequent causes, followed by tumors. These etiologic groups are underrepresented in the literature. Electrodiagnostic examination was helpful for localizing the lesion as well as for excluding S1 radiculopathies, with which tibial neuropathies can be confused clinically.

2.2. Phenotypic data of the Morton's neuroma cohort

Age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and duration of Morton's neuroma symptoms (if applicable) were recorded for each participant. The severity of patients' symptoms was evaluated presurgery using a range of clinical questionnaires. The average severity of pain and numbness over the past 24 hours was recorded on separate visual analogue scales (VAS), where 0 indicated no symptoms and 10 indicated the worst symptoms imaginable. The severity and profile of neuropathic pain were evaluated with the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI), which is formed of 10 numerical rating scales from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). These scales are used to rate pain subtypes including burning, deep pressure pain, paraesthesia, paroxysmal symptoms, and evoked pain, as well as a composite score.

To determine the characteristics of the neuropathic pain profile of Morton's neuroma compared with other neuropathies, we compared NPSI data among people with Morton's neuroma (n = 56, of which n = 22 were included in the tissue analysis), spine-related leg pain ("sciatica", n = 134), carpal tunnel syndrome (n = 113), and diabetic neuropathy (n = 628). The data for the latter 3 cohorts were available from our previously published studies (REC Ref 18/SC/0263 and 10/H0706/35).

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^113pSq1m]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Physical examination tests have poor sensitivity and/or specificity for identifying radiculopathy when used in isolation, whether radiculopathy is due to disc herniation or other causes. Nevertheless, recommended physical examination maneuvers for the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy include: manual muscle testing (positive predictive value [PPV] of ankle dorsiflexion weakness 69% and lateral four toe extension weakness 76% for L4/5 radiculopathy), sensory testing (PPV 76% and 50% for sensory abnormalities in the L5 and S1 dermatomes, respectively), supine straight leg raise (sensitivity 0.67, superior to the seated straight leg raise, sensitivity 0.41), supine Lasegue's sign (sensitivity 0.77–0.83), and supine crossed Lasegue's sign (specificity 0.74–0.89).,

Other physical examination maneuvers which may aid in diagnosing lumbosacral radiculopathy include reflexes at the patellar and Achilles tendons. Ipsilateral absent or reduced reflexes at the patellar tendon (sensitivity 0.18–0.67; specificity 0.66–0.90) and Achilles tendon (sensitivity 0.14–0.67; specificity 0.60–0.93) suggest patients may have L4 or L5/S1 radiculopathies, respectively.

Imaging modalities, particularly MRI, are frequently used to investigate low back pain and/or suspected radiculopathy. However, abnormalities on MRI are highly prevalent, even among persons who are asymptomatic. Consequently, resource stewardship organizations such as Choosing Wisely (USA) and Choosing Wisely Canada, as well as numerous specialty societies recommend judicious selection of patients who require imaging as well as appropriate use of imaging modalities. In one systematic review, the sensitivity of MRI for detecting lumbosacral radiculopathy was 0.25 and the specificity was 0.92. Thus MRI may have value in confirming the presence of radiculopathy in patients with symptoms that have not resolved and who are considering surgical intervention.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^1174QzuG]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD low back pain guideline glossary — radicular and related terminology is defined as follows: Radicular LBP is pain in the back and lower limb associated with a disorder of the spinal nerve root and/or its ganglion and may or may not be accompanied by objective evidence of impaired conduction (radiculopathy); non-radicular LBP typically does not radiate past the knee; radiculopathy refers to impaired conduction along a spinal nerve or its roots, may be diagnosed by clinical exam or electrodiagnostic testing, and may or may not be accompanied by radicular pain; sciatica is pain along the path of the sciatic nerve, is a symptom rather than a condition, and is often used interchangeably with radiculopathy; referred pain originates in one location but is perceived in other regions and does not involve stimulation of nerve roots, differentiating it from radicular pain; neurogenic claudication comprises leg pain symptoms while walking or standing relieved by sitting or spinal flexion and is associated with spinal stenosis; spinal stenosis is narrowing of the central spinal canal or neuroforamina usually due to degenerative changes, may also be congenital, and may or may not present with symptoms like neurogenic claudication; a herniated disc is herniation of the nucleus pulposus through its fibrous covering that can compress adjacent nerve roots; and non-specific LBP lacks signs of a serious underlying condition or specific spinal cause, with degenerative imaging changes usually considered nonspecific and often called uncomplicated LBP.

### Dermatomal laser-evoked potentials: a diagnostic approach to the dorsal root. norm data in healthy volunteers and changes in patients with radiculopathy [^111CJcai]. European Spine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

We conducted a cross-sectional study of 40 radiculopathy patients in comparison with norm data from healthy subjects using a new electrophysiological method. Early manifestations of dorsal root impairment escape objective diagnosis by conventional somatosensory-evoked potentials due to the overlapping innervation of the affected dermatome by thickly myelinated mechanoreceptive afferents projecting to adjacent intact roots. Evidence suggested less intersegmental overlap for thermonociceptive afferents rendering laser-evoked potentials (LEP) sensitive to monosegmental dorsal root damage. Therefore we used this new method to study acute manifestations of monosegmental dorsal root pathology. Dorsal root function was tested in 12 healthy subjects and 40 sciatica patients by intraindividual interside comparison. Mechanosensibility and thermosensibility were clinically investigated. LEP were induced by moderately painful laser stimuli. The LEP were evaluated by amplitude and latency of the averaged electroencephalogram. Normal interside differences of LEP for amplitude were ± 22% (lower limb) and ± 35% (upper limb) and ± 15 to ± 16% for latency. Twenty-six patients (65%) showed significant LEP changes, mainly amplitude decreases. Six of these patients exhibited latency prolongations. Clinical testing yielded more frequent pathological results for pain compared to mechanosensibility. The study confirmed our preliminary evidence of LEP sensitivity to objectively document dorsal root impairment in patients suffering from acute monosegmental radiculopathy. This result opens the perspective of electrophysiologically differentiating the presence or absence of dorsal root pathology in patients with similar clinical symptoms but possibly different prognoses, which require different therapies.

7.3 Tibial nerve

The tibial nerve is the largest peripheral nerve below the knee and has extensive sensory and motor innervation in the leg, ankle, and foot. Above the ankle, the tibial nerve can be entrapped at the medial gastrocnemius (often referred to as high tarsal tunnel syndrome), under the fibromuscular arch of the soleus, as a result of popliteus muscle tear, or popliteal artery/vein malformations. At the level of the ankle, the tibial nerve travels within the tarsal tunnel, a fibro‐osseous tunnel formed by the flexor retinaculum, medial calcaneus, posterior talus, distal tibia, and medial malleolus. The tarsal tunnel is depicted in Figure 5.

Tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) is the most common site of tibial nerve entrapment. There is significant anatomical variability of the branching pattern of the tibial nerve within the tarsal tunnel, therefore, a variety of distinct clinical syndromes can develop involving any or all of the nerves from pathology within the tarsal tunnel, mimicking more distal entrapment sites as mentioned prior.TTS classically presents with neuropathic symptoms at the medial ankle, and/or plantar foot. Proximal symptom radiation is common; however, the medial heel is usually spared since the MCN usually originates above the tarsal tunnel. Symptoms are usually exercise‐induced and can be associated with specific footwear.

While the exact cause of TTS is unidentified in 20%–40% of cases, common causes include trauma, compressive lesions (ganglion cysts, tenosynovitis, tumors, and os trigonum), systemic disease causing soft tissue edema (rheumatoid arthritis, lymphedema), and abnormal biomechanics (excessive pronation, joint hypermobility).

On examination, the clinician should inspect for risk factors such as foot deformities like pes planus and calcaneovalgus, and signs of intrinsic foot atrophy. The tarsal tunnel may be tender to palpation with a positive Tinel's sign. Valleix phenomenon, a retrograde radiation of symptoms with Tinel's or tarsal tunnel compression, can be elicited. Provocation can be performed with post‐exercise examination, sustained passive eversion, or great toe dorsiflexion.

### Screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy in resource-limited settings [^111ARaoz]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

An unknown disease that caused excessive production of sweet urine was first described in historical records from Ancient Egypt, India, and China. Clinical experiences of numerous physicians and scientists including the Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia (second century AD), the English anatomist and physician Thomas Willis (seventeenth century AD), and the English physician and physiologist Matthew Dobson (eighteenth century AD) subsequently contributed to widespread recognition of the disease, which is today known as diabetes mellitus (DM).

DM has three microvascular complications: neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy. Neuropathy can occur in patients with type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 DM (T2DM). The estimated prevalence of diabetic neuropathy among youth and adults is 2.4–75.1% according to data from cohort studies. Diabetic neuropathy represents a clinically heterogeneous group of neurological disorders characterized by dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system attributed to DM after excluding other causes. According to the pattern of neurological deficits, diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be painful or non-painful and is classified into four types: diffuse neuropathy, mononeuropathy, radiculopathy, and other neuropathies. Diffuse neuropathy is the most commonly encountered type and 75–90% of all diabetic peripheral neuropathy cases present with typical length-dependent sensorimotor symptoms characteristic of distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN). Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a major risk factor for lower-extremity complications such as ulceration, infection, deformity, and amputation. Research on diabetic peripheral neuropathy may help elucidate the complex pathogenetic mechanisms involved, thereby improving diagnosis and management.

### A novel diagnostic test for end-stage sensory failure associated with diabetic foot ulceration: proof-of-principle study [^111Eif1W]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pattern and Procedure of Stimulation

The tip of the glass-fiber was regularly applied and maintained for one to two seconds. The stimulation was repeated twice, with one to two seconds interval. Unlike the previous studies applying unmeasured pinprick stimulation at the eponychium, or the plantar surfaceof the big toe only, in the present study, three sites on the plantar surface were consecutively stimulated (with 5–10 seconds interval): the plantar arch and the skinfolds of the second and third toe innervated by the terminal branches of the tibial nerve. Areas with thickened skin near the metatarsal headswere avoided; hammertoes were gently stretched by the examiner to expose the plantar skinfold for stimulation. Both feet were tested randomly. The study persons were unaware of the numbers of stimulations and sites of the foot to be stimulated. For control purpose, the middle of the palm of a hand was also stimulated consistent with the previous usage. Catch trials (by applying the blunt ending of the holder) were occasionally interspersed to check the truth of the answers. The stimulation course was run top down from hand to feet and was repeated about three minutes later in reversed order. All stimulations were performed by the same examiner (the author).

The study was carried out in accordance with the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki and the Ethics Commission of the Heinrich-Heine University medical faculty (Project no. 3718; "Pain perception in diabetic neuropathy"). Written informed consent was provided by all study participants.

Data Processing and Analysis

Data were assessed per foot (unless stated otherwise), considering potential unilateral foot affections, eg, from radiculopathy due to intervertebral disk herniation, or amputation. Primary outcome was the correct "prick" perception per stimulated site, distinguishing between not diseased and diseased (end-stage sensory failure associated with DFU). Secondary analyses comprised pain scores and withdrawal reactions and statistical evaluation of the test. Likelihood ratios were calculated, adding 0.5 to all cells to avoid problems with "zero" ratios, according to Deeks et al. Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test, and intraclass correlation coefficients were applied, as appropriate. A P < .05 was considered significant. Data are presented as median (range), unless indicated otherwise.

The lumbosacral plexus represents the nerve supply to the lower back, pelvis and legs. This review will focus on diseases and disorders affecting the pathway as demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). We stress the need to review the lumbosacral plexus in patients with non-specific symptoms such as back, hip, pelvic pain, and in those who present with sciatica unaccompanied by demonstrable intervertebral disc prolapse. We illustrate that the imaging appearances may be non-specific and re-inforce the importance of the clinical history and the use of tissue sampling to achieve an accurate diagnosis.

### Piriformis syndrome: anatomic considerations, a new injection technique, and a review of the literature [^116VHjxT]. Anesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Piriformis syndrome can be caused by anatomic abnormalities. The treatments of piriformis syndrome include the injection of steroid into the piriformis muscle and near the area of the sciatic nerve. These techniques use either fluoroscopy and muscle electromyography to identify the piriformis muscle or a nerve stimulator to stimulate the sciatic nerve.

Methods

The authors performed a cadaver study and noted anatomic variations of the piriformis muscle and sciatic nerve. To standardize their technique of injection, they also noted the distance from the lower border of the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) to the sciatic nerve. They retrospectively reviewed the charts of 19 patients who had received piriformis muscle injections, noting the site of needle insertion in terms of the distance from the lower border of the SIJ and the depth of needle insertion at which the motor response of the foot was elicited. The authors tabulated the response of the patients to the injection, any associated diagnoses, and previous treatments that these patients had before the injection. Finally, they reviewed the literature on piriformis syndrome, a rare cause of buttock pain and sciatica.

Results

In the cadavers, the distance from the lower border of the SIJ to the sciatic nerve was 2.9 ± 0.6 (1.8–3.7) cm laterally and 0.7 ± 0.7 (0.0–2.5) cm caudally. In 65 specimens, the sciatic nerve passed anterior and inferior to the piriformis. In one specimen, the muscle was bipartite and the two components of the sciatic nerve were separate, with the tibial nerve passing below the piriformis and the peroneal nerve passing between the two components of the muscle. In the patients who received the injections, the site of needle insertion was 1.5 ± 0.8 (0.4–3.0) cm lateral and 1.2 ± 0.6 (0.5–2.0) cm caudal to the lower border of the SIJ as seen on fluoroscopy. The needle was inserted at a depth of 9.2 ± 1.5 (7.5–13.0) cm to stimulate the sciatic nerve. Patients had comorbid etiologies including herniated disc, failed back surgery syndrome, spinal stenosis, facet syndrome, SIJ dysfunction, and complex regional pain syndrome. Sixteen of the 19 patients responded to the injection, their improvements ranged from a few hours to 3 months.

Conclusions

Anatomic abnormalities causing piriformis syndrome are rare. The technique used in the current study was successful in injecting the medications near the area of the sciatic nerve and into the piriformis muscle.

### Intrapiriformis lipoma: an unusual cause of piriformis syndrome [^114SeGg2]. European Spine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

We report on a patient with an unusual cause of non-discogenic sciatica.

Material and Methods

A 48-year-old woman presented with a 10-day history of gradually worsening left buttock pain radiating to the ipsilateral posterior thigh and calf. She had a similar episode of less intense pain 8 months before which lasted about 2 months. She denied any history of antecedent trauma or back pain. MRI scan revealed a well-defined, fat-containing lesion of the left piriformis muscle similar to a lipoma displacing the sciatic nerve but not invading it. The sciatica was relieved after excision of the lesion. The patient remained asymptomatic after the operation.

Conclusion

The present case suggested that an intrapiriformis lipoma can cause secondary piriformis syndrome and medical practitioners should be aware of this condition and consider lipomas and other occupying lesions of the pelvic muscles as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with radicular pain.

3.2.1.2. Radicular pain without radiculopathy

Radicular pain is likely associated with hyperexcitability and ectopic discharges of dorsal roots or dorsal root ganglia. The hyperexcitability and ectopic discharges may be due to inflammatory irritation, ischaemia, or mechanical deformation of neural structures or a combination of these and their downstream mechanisms (eg, inflammation).

The pain may be described as shocking, lancinating, electric, stabbing, or shooting and is often accompanied by a dull background ache. We have further added sharp and burning as potential pain descriptors as these are frequently reported by patients with lumbar radicular pain. With radicular pain, the pain may be spontaneous or evoked, for instance, by certain movements of the spine or leg. In addition to pain, patients may experience paraesthesia and dysaesthesia such as tingling, a "woolen feeling", or "a block of ice".

The pain can be felt deep or cutaneous and may radiate into the leg in areas reminiscent of, but not necessarily identical to, dermatomes. The working group further agreed to remove the original description of "band-like" location of the pain, which seemed sufficiently covered by "areas reminiscent of, but not necessarily identical to, dermatomes".

3 RELEVANT FEATURES OF RADICULOPATHY

Radiculopathy is a syndrome of neurological impairment of sensory and/or motor function of a spinal nerve root that arises from nerve root injury or compression. Patients' symptoms and signs vary depending on which nerve root is affected, as outlined in Table 1 and Figure 1. Although the precise frequency of lumbosacral radiculopathies is unknown, the vast majority involve the L5 and/or S1 nerve roots, as the L4/L5 and L5/S1 intervertebral discs are the most likely to herniate. Depending on the direction of herniation, either the L5 and/or S1 nerve root can be affected. Like radiculopathy from disc herniation, radiculopathy due to other etiologies, including degenerative spondyloarthropathy, typically resolve spontaneously in weeks to months but may persist in some patients.

TABLE 1
Common features of radiculopathies by level.

Radiculopathy often, but not always, includes radiating pain and/or sensory loss along dermatomal territories, and can be termed "sciatica" by patients and healthcare providers. The character of the pain may be neuropathic — burning, electric — or may be described as dull or aching. Patients may or may not have concurrent low back pain. Factors on history that correlate highly with nerve root impingement on imaging and/or radiculopathy on EDX include pain that radiates within a specific dermatome (odds ratio [OR] 4.1), pain with coughing or sneezing (OR 3.2), subjective muscle weakness (OR 2.2), and subjective sensory loss (OR 2.1).

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^112daxLo]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for low back pain, more specifically with respect to radiofrequency denervation, ACOEM 2021 guidelines recommend to avoid performing radiofrequency lesioning of the dorsal root ganglia for the treatment of chronic sciatica.

### Agreement of self-reported items and clinically assessed nerve root involvement (or sciatica) in a primary care setting [^112YnXrq]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Vroomen et al. previously reported on the contribution of history and examination items to the diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy due to a disc prolapse and suggested that examination items contribute little after the establishment of the history items. History items are mainly self-reported but in the context of the clinical examination clarification can be obtained which most likely improves accuracy of reporting. In addition, this study's population was a highly selected cohort of patients, a factor that is likely to contribute to high diagnostic accuracy as patients tend to be at the worse end of the spectrum.

Our findings suggest that when the objective of a study is to capture the presence of back pain that spreads to the leg(s), as perhaps an index of severity, then proxies such as 'pain down the leg' or 'pain below the knee' may be acceptable but for specific presentations such as sciatica such proxies do not seem sufficiently accurate. Even with a cluster of positive symptoms [Models 1 and 2(iv)] the discrimination although acceptable may still be considered problematic as indicated by the low sensitivity estimates.

A number of points pertaining to strengths and limitations of this study merit some further discussion. Firstly, the self-reported items selected as potential indicators of sciatica. We believe that these are in accordance with current literature as potentially contributing to the clinical diagnosis or impression of the presence or absence of sciatica.

Second point is the acceptance of the clinical judgement by the assessing physiotherapists as the 'reference standard'. The absence of a 'gold reference standard' in sciatica is well documented in the relevant literature and clinical diagnosis does serve as the 'reference standard' in a number of studies. Taking into account that patients with positive imaging findings of nerve root involvement may be asymptomatic and vice versa and that in primary care, at least initially, diagnosis is based on clinical assessment alone, it is reasonable to use clinical diagnosis as the 'reference standard' in primary care as opposed to imaging tests. However, misdiagnosis of cases is possible.

### A review of common painful foot and ankle conditions… [^1127pvm6]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance Morton neuroma, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles tendinopathy are foot and ankle conditions that are associated with pain and disability, but they can respond to nonoperative treatment. Observations. Morton neuroma, consisting of interdigital neuronal thickening and fibrosis, is characterized by burning pain in the ball of the foot and numbness or burning pain that may radiate to the affected toes. First-line nonoperative therapy consists of reducing activities that cause pain, orthotics, and interdigital corticosteroid injection; however, approximately 30% of patients may not respond to conservative treatment. Plantar fasciitis accounts for more than 1 million patient visits per year in the US and typically presents with plantar heel pain. Fifteen years after diagnosis, approximately 44% of patients continue to have pain.

First-line nonoperative therapy includes stretching of the plantar fascia and foot orthotics, followed by extracorporeal shockwave therapy, corticosteroid injection, or platelet-rich plasma injection. Midportion Achilles tendinopathy presents with pain approximately 2 to 6 cm proximal to the Achilles insertion on the heel. The primary nonoperative treatment involves eccentric strengthening exercises, but extracorporeal shockwave therapy may be used. Conclusions and Relevance Morton neuroma, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles tendinopathy are painful foot and ankle conditions. First-line therapies are activity restriction, orthotics, and corticosteroid injection for Morton neuroma; stretching and foot orthotics for plantar fasciitis; and eccentric strengthening exercises for Achilles tendinopathy.

### Sciatic neuralgia: a clinical entity… [^116vwSGY]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Sciatica is a reflex neuralgia or a referred pain along the distribution of the sciatic nerve; it should be distinguished from sciatic neuritis, which is an inflammation of the sciatic nerve. The modern attitude, expressed by Feiling, 1 is to think of sciatica as sginifying sciatic pain without connoting any particular pathogenesis. DaCosta2 states that true sciatica is not a neuritis. Moersch3 believes that differentiation of neuralgia from neuritis of the sciatic nerve is of clinical importance. The usual classification of sciatica into primary, secondary and idiopathic groups is inaccurate and, in view of present knowledge, inadequate. More correctly, one may classify, first, sciatic neuritis or a true inflammation of the nerve; secondly, a reflex sciatic neuralgia or essential sciatica. Before the essential reflex neuralgias are described, it is necessary to classify and discuss sciatic neuritis. An inflammation of the sciatic nerve may be either primary or secondary. HAUSER EDW.

### SCIATICA… [^112hVqox]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The term "sciatica" commonly refers to a pain which extends from the sacroiliac region into the posterior or posterolateral part of the thigh and calf or lateral portion of the leg. The pain may continue as far as the heel or even into the lateral border of the foot. This pain is almost always caused by the presence of a pathological process affecting the sciatic nerve, the lumbosacral plexus or the fourth lumbar, fifth lumbar or first sacral nerve roots. Pain that extends only from the lumbosacral junction to the inferior margin of the gluteal fold or to the midportion of the posterior part of the thigh should not be classed as sciatica and may be due to pathological processes which do not affect the sciatic nerve or any of the fibers which form it. The diagnosis of the cause of sciatica depends on evaluation of a composite examination that Millikan CH. SCIATICA: DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT. JAMA. 1951; 145: 1–4.

### Painful accessory bones… [^1124pq9m]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Arthritis and Tendinopathy All common forms of arthritides affect the feet and can cause chronic foot pain. Most arthritides are best evaluated with plain radiography. Radiographic findings include joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, subchondral sclerosis, and cyst formation. The most common site for gout is the foot, especially the first metatarsophalangeal joint. As the tophi enlarge, they erode the para-articular bone, producing sharp, punched-out erosions with well-defined cortical margins. Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease is the most common form of crystal-induced arthropathy. With this disease, the talonavicular joint can sometimes be involved. Rheumatoid arthritis also typically involves the foot. Radiographic findings include periarticular soft-tissue swelling, marginal erosion, periarticular osteopenia, and uniform joint space narrowing.

There is evidence that gadolinium-enhanced MRI can be helpful in detecting early rheumatoid arthritis. Painful Accessory Bones Potentially painful normal variants, such as accessory tarsal navicular and os trigonum, have been described with chronic foot pain. 16, 17 The accessory tarsal navicular is situated adjacent to the medial and posterior margins of the tarsal navicular and has a prevalence of 4 to 14 percent. 16 Os trigonum is located adjacent to the posterior margin of the talus and has a prevalence of 14 to 25 percent.
16. Diffuse osteopenia of the involved part, which can be demonstrated on radiography, occurs in 69 percent of patients with RSD. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is a compressive entrapment neuropathy of the posterior tibial nerve or one of its branches. Patients typically complain of poorly localized, burning pain and paresthesias along the plantar surface of the foot and toes.

Causes of tarsal tunnel syndrome include varicosities, trauma, fibrosis, accessory muscles, ganglion cysts, lipoma, and nerve sheath tumors. Such lesions are best visualized using MRI. Talocalcaneal coalition is often associated with severe valgus deformity of the hindfoot, rigid painful flatfoot, and restricted subtalar motion. It is often overlooked on plain radiographs because of overlapping structures; however, secondary signs on the lateral view could be suggestive of talocalcaneal coalition.
