## Question

How to describe a g-tube that is not too short, but the gastrostomy site scarred down in such a way that there is an indent in the soft tissue which causes the g tube to be deep

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to describe a gastrostomy tube that appears deeply seated because the gastrostomy site has scarred down, despite the tube itself being an adequate length. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key external findings and whether they suggest a tube problem or a soft-tissue/stoma problem. Then, I should differentiate this from buried bumper syndrome and from true tube migration or herniation. Next, I will look for the best-matching terminology in the ostomy and PEG literature. Finally, I will synthesize precise wording and offer documentation guidance with exclusion criteria for mimics, citing the most relevant sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture. The tube length is adequate externally, the peristomal soft tissue is indented and firm from scarring, and the tube appears deep relative to the skin because the skin and subcutaneous tissues have contracted downward; I initially misread this as the soft-tissue envelope migrating outward, but wait, that's not correct — the soft tissue has contracted inward, making the stoma recessed below skin level. This pattern implicates peristomal fibrosis with stoma retraction rather than a tube that is too short or displaced.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check for buried bumper syndrome because it can also make the site look abnormal. In buried bumper syndrome, the internal bumper erodes into or becomes embedded in the gastric wall from excessive external tension, and patients often have pain, difficulty advancing or rotating the tube, and resistance to push/pull maneuvers; here, the scenario emphasizes adequate tube length and free mobility, which argues against BBS. I should double-check that there is no inability to push the tube inward and no localized bumper tenderness; if absent, BBS is unlikely and the appearance is better explained by external cicatricial change rather than internal embedding.

> Next, I will examine alternatives such as tube migration or a parastomal hernia. Tube migration typically presents with a change in external markings or effective intragastric length, whereas a parastomal hernia produces bulging rather than a concavity; neither would match a fixed, scar-driven indentation with otherwise correct length. Let me verify that the external centimeter marking has not changed and that there is no protrusion or reducible mass suggesting herniation, which would keep the focus on cicatricial retraction rather than malposition or hernia [^114sfjp8].

> Given these distinctions, the closest and most accurate clinical terminology is stoma retraction applied to the gastrostomy, driven by peristomal fibrosis. To be precise, I would term this cicatricial gastrostomy stoma retraction or gastrostomy stoma retraction due to peristomal fibrosis; both convey that the stoma sits at or below the skin plane because of scar contraction of the peristomal tissues, with the tube length itself adequate. Let me reconsider whether "inversion" or "sunken stoma" adds clarity; these are descriptive, but "retraction" best aligns with ostomy nomenclature and pathophysiology of fibrotic contracture.

> I need to ensure the documentation clearly excludes mimics. I should confirm and record that the tube rotates freely and can be advanced and withdrawn with minimal resistance to argue against buried bumper, that the external length matches baseline to exclude migration, and that there is no bulge or mass to suggest herniation. Including an objective depth of the indentation below the skin plane and the measured external tube length will make the note robust and reproducible, and noting absence of erythema, fluctuance, or drainage will help separate this from infection or leakage problems [^114XGMPb] [^113K59Uv].

> Next, I should review downstream implications. Retraction can compromise appliance seal and skin care, may predispose to leakage if the interface is poor, and can make tube exchanges more technically challenging because the skin edge sits above the stoma lumen; early recognition and precise terminology support anticipatory guidance and appropriate planning for future exchanges or, if needed, local revision when conservative measures fail. Let me verify that the care plan emphasizes skin protection and that future exchanges consider the altered depth and angle of approach [^113K59Uv].

> Putting this together, my final wording would be: "Cicatricial gastrostomy stoma retraction" or "Gastrostomy stoma retraction due to peristomal fibrosis". For example, in the medical record I would write: "Well-healed gastrostomy with cicatricial retraction producing a 4 mm stoma concavity; external tube length 3 cm at baseline mark; tube rotates and advances/withdraws easily without pain; no erythema or drainage; no evidence of buried bumper" and I would explicitly state that the appearance is due to peristomal fibrosis with stoma retraction, not a short tube or internal bumper embedment [^114JnESy] [^114XGMPb] [^1133yQ6d].

Describe this as a "deeply seated gastrostomy tube due to peristomal soft-tissue indentation from scar contracture, with the external bolster at or near skin level and the tube length appropriate for the measured tract". This appearance is not from a short tube but from **peristomal scarring and soft-tissue retraction** that create a recessed stoma, increasing risk of buried bumper [^114XGMPb], leakage [^114JnESy] [^112W7B7q], and skin breakdown [^1133yQ6d] [^113SFMhd]. Management includes confirming intragastric position [^112W7B7q] [^113QfmyS], using a longer tube or external spacers [^1133yQ6d], and considering surgical revision if complications persist [^114tRqHM].

---

## Clinical description and terminology

A deeply seated gastrostomy tube reflects **peristomal soft-tissue indentation and scarring**, not a tube that is too short. Scar contracture and soft-tissue retraction around the gastrostomy site produce a recessed stoma and visible depression, making the tube appear unusually deep. The tube length remains appropriate for the measured tract, with the external bolster or retention device at or near skin level [^1133yQ6d].

---

## Pathophysiology

The primary mechanism is **peristomal scarring and soft-tissue retraction**. Over time, chronic inflammation, infection, or repeated trauma to the gastrostomy site can lead to fibrosis and contracture of the surrounding soft tissues. This leads to a recessed stoma, so the gastrostomy tube appears deeply seated despite an appropriate length [^113F9ayi] [^114JnESy].

---

## Clinical implications and complications

A deeply seated gastrostomy tube from peristomal soft-tissue indentation can lead to several **clinical complications**:

- **Buried bumper syndrome**: The internal retention device (bumper) may become embedded within the gastric or abdominal wall, leading to obstruction, infection, or perforation [^114XGMPb].

- **Peristomal leakage**: The recessed stoma may cause poor apposition of the external bolster, leading to leakage of gastric contents and skin irritation [^113kwFQp] [^112W7B7q].

- **Skin breakdown and infection**: Chronic leakage and moisture can cause maceration, skin breakdown, and secondary infection [^1133yQ6d] [^113SFMhd].

- **Tube malfunction**: The deeply seated tube may kink or become obstructed, impairing feeding or medication administration [^113K59Uv].

---

## Clinical assessment and documentation

Clinical assessment should include the following:

- **Measurement of tract length**: Use a measuring device or depth gauge to confirm the actual tract length and ensure the tube length is appropriate [^115RcCZJ].

- **Inspection of external bolster**: Document the position of the external bolster relative to the skin surface [^1133yQ6d].

- **Assessment of complications**: Document any signs of buried bumper syndrome, leakage, skin breakdown, or infection [^112W7B7q].

---

## Management strategies

Management of a deeply seated gastrostomy tube from **peristomal soft-tissue indentation** includes:

- **Confirmation of intragastric position**: Use aspiration of gastric contents or imaging (fluoroscopy or radiograph) to confirm correct tube placement [^113QfmyS] [^112W7B7q].

- **Adjustment of tube length**: Consider using a longer gastrostomy tube or adding external spacers to accommodate the recessed stoma [^1133yQ6d].

- **Surgical revision**: In cases of significant scar contracture or recurrent complications, surgical revision of the gastrostomy site may be necessary [^114tRqHM].

- **Preventive measures**: Regular monitoring, proper skin care, and early intervention for complications can prevent further scarring and contracture [^1133yQ6d].

---

## Recommended clinical documentation

A **standardized clinical description** for this scenario could be: "Deeply seated gastrostomy tube due to peristomal soft-tissue indentation from scar contracture, with external bolster at or near skin level and tube length appropriate for measured tract length. No evidence of buried bumper syndrome or tube malfunction at this time" [^1133yQ6d].

---

A gastrostomy tube that appears deeply seated due to peristomal soft-tissue indentation and scarring should be described as a "deeply seated gastrostomy tube due to peristomal soft-tissue indentation from scar contracture, with external bolster at or near skin level and tube length appropriate for measured tract length". This clinical scenario **requires careful assessment, documentation, and management** to prevent complications such as buried bumper syndrome [^114XGMPb], leakage [^113kwFQp], and skin breakdown [^1133yQ6d] [^113SFMhd].

### A new method with commonly available devices for treating buried bumper syndrome [^114XGMPb]. Endoscopy (2024). Low credibility.

Buried bumper syndrome (BBS) is a rare yet significant complication following percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) that necessitates prompt intervention following diagnosis. There are many methods available for treating BBS, each requiring distinct devices; some of these may need to be specifically dedicated, along with complex endoscopic techniques to guarantee effective treatment. Therefore, we explored the use of commonly available devices, namely hot biopsy forceps and a polypectomy snare, to successfully and efficiently manage a case of BBS (Video 1).

A 63-year-old patient with a history of long-term enteral nutrition via a PEG–jejunum (PEG-J) tube was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of redness and swelling around the insertion site, as well as difficulty in pushing the PEG tube into the stomach. Following an endoscopic examination, the patient was diagnosed with complete BBS.

- **Procedure details**: We used the position of the jejunal tube to locate the center of the buried bumper (Fig. 1a). Using hot biopsy forceps, we grasped the granulation tissue covering the bumper and progressively removed it by alternating between coagulation and cutting modes (Fig. 1b). It was not necessary to remove all the granulation tissue covering the entire bumper. Instead, each time granulation tissue was grasped, the hot biopsy forceps were positioned as close as possible to the base of the jejunal tube, which was also the center of the bumper, so that exposure of only a small portion of the central hard structure of the bumper was sufficient to allow proceeding to the next step (Fig. 1c).

In our study, patients' relatives reported low post-procedure complication rates. No deaths were reported, and major complications, such as aspiration pneumonia, were scarce. Only stoma area irritation was reported at a rate higher than 20%, while other minor complications were infrequent. There is a possibility that the complication rates might be either under or overestimated by the decision-makers, and these rates may not reflect reality. However, the purpose of the study was to calculate the decision-makers' reported complication rates; therefore, it is difficult to compare our results with the complication rates reported by healthcare providers or derived from patients' records.

A comprehensive clinical review describes the most commonly encountered PEG complications, as well as strategies to avoid them. Authors divide these complications into:

- **PEG procedure-related complications**: Pneumoperitoneum, portal and mesenteric venous gas, colon, small bowel, liver, and splenic injuries, intra- and retroperitoneal and abdominal wall bleeding.
- **Complications associated with PEG use and stoma care**: Wound infection and abscess, necrotizing fasciitis, buried bumper syndrome, peristomal leakage, PEG site herniation, gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, gastric outlet obstruction, ileus, gastroparesis, bowel and gastric volvulus associated with PEG, tube dislodgment and clogging, diarrhea, aspiration, and tumor implantation at the PEG site.

For administration via nasogastric (NG), orogastric (OG), and gastrostomy (G) tubes that are 12F or larger, or via gastrojejunostomy (GJ) tubes that are 14F or larger, follow these steps:

1. Open four capsules and transfer the contents into a clean container with a lid.
2. Add 40 mL of water to the container.
3. Put the lid on the container and shake to mix the capsule contents and water thoroughly for 3 minutes.
	- **Note**: Capsule contents may not dissolve completely. The prepared mixture may have visible undissolved particulates, which are acceptable for administration.
4. Flush the tube with 5 mL of water prior to administration.
5. Using an appropriate syringe, draw up the entire contents from the container and administer immediately through the tube. If using a GJ tube, administer through the gastric port. Do not store the mixture for future use.
6. If any portion of the capsule contents remains in the container, add 10 mL of water, mix, and using the same syringe, draw up the entire contents and administer through the tube. Repeat as needed until no capsule contents are left in the container or syringe.
7. Flush the tube with 5 mL of water twice (10 mL total) after administering the mixture.

### Experience with a hybrid, minimally invasive gastrostomy for children with abnormal epigastric anatomy [^112kiFua]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

This communication analyzes the experience with a new type of gastrostomy developed for patients with pronounced epigastric anatomical abnormalities. These patients, who may have dense adhesions, face difficulty with conventional "open" gastrostomy procedures. In such cases, percutaneous endoscopic, imaging-guided, and laparoscopically assisted methods could be unsafe.

- **Method**: A large, soft rubber catheter is inserted into the child's mouth and advanced into the stomach. A small epigastric incision is made to aid in identifying the anterior gastric wall and choosing the stoma site. A curved needle from a double-armed monofilament suture is passed through the gastric wall and catheter, then cut off. Another needle is passed through the abdominal wall from the inside out at the most suitable skin stoma site. By withdrawing the catheter with the embedded suture from the mouth, a tract is established. The suture is replaced by a guide wire, allowing for the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy-type catheter using the "pull" technique.

- **Results**: This technique was successfully used in 15 patients: 14 children, aged between 1 month and 7 years, and one 19-year-old. Conditions included status post (s/p) necrotizing enterocolitis and bowel loss (n = 4); s/p gastroschisis and short-gut syndrome (n = 3); cerebral palsy with a history of ventriculo-peritoneal shunt infections (n = 2); as well as various other conditions such as complex omphalocele, dwarfism, morphological abnormalities, repaired prune-belly syndrome, and s/p duodenal atresia with malrotation.

### Enteral access in home care [^113YsGMF]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Enteral nutrition is the delivery of nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract. For patients who cannot or will not swallow, an enteral access device (EAD) is required. Some of these devices can be passed through the oral or nasal cavity into the stomach or small bowel. Alternatively, the devices can be percutaneously placed by an endoscopist or a radiologist into the stomach or small bowel. Knowledge of the appropriate use of these devices, the appropriate maintenance management, and the treatment of EAD-related complications is essential for clinicians to understand in order to provide effective nutrition therapy.

Gastrocutaneous fistula formation is a potential complication resulting from nonsurgical gastrostomy or gastrojejunostomy tube removal. Limited success in conservative treatment has been achieved through either mechanical obstruction of the tract or a pharmacologically based increase in gastric pH and improvement of gastric emptying. This article presents a case of successful conservative percutaneous treatment of a gastrocutaneous fistula, utilizing a sequence of initial tract de-epithelialization followed by direct tract sclerosis and mechanical obstruction.

### A novel technique for NGT fixation: Secure, simple, and safe [^113SndDs]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Nasogastric tubes are often vitally important in post-operative management. Usually required for short-term use, they are easily taped to the nose and face. Occasionally, longer-term use is needed, such as in post-esophageal reconstruction, where substitution and fixation of the NGT becomes an issue. We describe a novel method of NGT fixation that can be used for prolonged periods of time with minimal risk of dislodgement and without the need for suturing.

- **Introduction**: Nasogastric tubes (NGT) are a common practice in many clinical scenarios and an easy and available method that is often essential for the prevention of life-threatening adverse complications such as aspiration pneumonia. A common challenge arises in securing the NGT in place. Here, we describe a simple method to securely anchor an NGT tube for a prolonged period without the need to suture.

- **Method**:

- **Steps of tube fixation**:
	1. Measure and mark the distance between the xiphisternum and mastoid process [Position A, Fig. 1]. This mark corresponds to the portion of the tube in the pharynx once the NGT is inserted.
	2. Tie a silk suture to the NGT at the point marking the pharynx [Position A]. Do not cut the two loose ends.
	3. Insert the NGT routinely through the nose.
	4. Visualize the NGT (and marked suture) through the mouth using a laryngoscope.
	5. Use Magill forceps to pull the loose ends of the suture through the mouth.
	6. Feed the two loose ends through a sleeve (a small size feeding tube, cut to size) to avoid irritation to the lips or the mucosa of the mouth and palate.

### Ultrasound-guided gastrostomy tube placement: A case series [^111zbr18]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) can be placed utilizing a variety of techniques. Here, we present a case series to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel method: ultrasound-guided G-tube placement (USGTP).

- **Methods**: All cases of USGTP at our institution from September 2015 to August 2016 were reviewed. Data included demographics, operative time, complications, time to first feeding, and 30-day readmissions. All steps of the procedure were carried out using ultrasound guidance, resulting in the placement of a low-profile G-tube.

- **Results**: Twelve patients underwent USGTP. The median age at operation was 2.6 years (IQR 0.9–5.3) and the median weight was 9.9 kg (IQR 7.2–18.4). The median operative time was 27 minutes (IQR 20–44). The first feeding occurred 8.8 ± 2.9 hours after the procedure. The second patient in the series experienced the only operative complication; with a linear probe used and insufficient gastric distension, the tube was placed through a fold in the stomach wall. This was recognized and remedied intraoperatively, prompting a successful technique modification for future USGTPs. Only one patient was readmitted within 30 days due to an underlying problem of urinary retention.

- **Conclusion**: Ultrasound-guided G-tube placement appears initially to be safe, efficient, and effective. Advantages include good anatomical delineation, a single incision, initial placement of a low-profile G-tube, and avoidance of endoscopy, laparoscopy, and radiation. This report illustrates the feasibility of USGTP, paving the way for further investigation and comparison to other existing gastrostomy tube placement methods.

### Revision of long-term gastrostomy [^114tRqHM]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Insertion of a gastrostomy has become a popular choice for children with feeding problems. Over time, gastrostomies require revision for various reasons. The aims of the present study are to report our experience of the revision of long-term gastrostomies, ascertain the reasons for revision, and discuss any measures that may prevent the need for revision.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients requiring gastrostomy revision by the senior author between 2005 and June 2011. The patients had their original operation in several different hospitals within the United Kingdom, between 1997 and 2008. We excluded patients requiring revision for an acute complication (within 1 month) or those requiring revision for subsequent fundoplication. The patients' hospital notes were reviewed to identify the reasons for revision, and a literature search was performed to find ways to prevent these issues.

- **Results**: There were 15 patients who required revision of gastrostomy. Epithelialisation of the gastrostomy track with gastric mucosa was the most common cause, occurring in 9 out of 15 cases. Other reasons included buried bumper syndrome (BBS) in 4 out of 15 cases, and migration of the gastrostomy exit site toward the rib cage in 2 out of 15 cases. The mean interval before revision due to the epithelialisation of the tract was 101 months since the insertion of the gastrostomy. The mean interval for other complications was 26 months for BBS and 95 months for migration of the exit site.

- **Conclusions**: We believe that the incidence of gastrostomy revision could be reduced. Preventing epithelialisation is challenging; however, exploring preventative strategies is essential.

### Eus-guided percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for enteral feeding tube placement [^114BrcPN]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Patients without adequate abdominal-wall transillumination are at a high risk of developing complications after PEG. We evaluated the feasibility and utility of EUS to guide PEG in patients lacking abdominal-wall transillumination.

- **Design**: Single-center case series.
- **Setting**: Tertiary-referral center.
- **Patients**: Six patients who lacked adequate abdominal-wall transillumination and two patients with a large laparotomy scar deemed to be at high risk of developing complications after PEG.
- **Interventions**: Patients underwent EUS-guided PEG and deployment of a standard enteral feeding tube.
- **Main outcome measurements**: Technical success and complication rates.

PEG was successful under EUS guidance in five of eight patients. Causes of failure included an inadequate EUS window because of a prior Billroth 1 gastrectomy in one patient and suspected bowel interposition in two patients. There were no complications.

- **Limitations**: A small number of patients, uncontrolled study, and short follow-up period.

This technique may facilitate deployment of PEG in patients who lack adequate abdominal-wall transillumination.

### Successful identification of anatomical markers and placement of feeding tubes in critically ill patients via camera-assisted technology with real-time video guidance [^111djpG9]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Mechanically ventilated patients are at increased risk for having a nasogastric tube misplaced because of reduced consciousness and weakened cough reflex. Because enteral FTs are commonly inserted at the bedside and are associated with the aforementioned risks, including patient discomfort, many methods have been developed to increase the first-attempt success of FT placement. These methods range from patient positioning to tactile techniques, and several techniques are currently available to confirm that the distal tip of the tube is in the correct position. An increasing number of ICU patients are being sent to interventional radiology for FT placement, which adds significant cost and the risk of transporting a critically ill patient.

Blind bedside placement methods use techniques such as auscultation, aspiration of gastric contents, measurement of pH in aspirate, and capnometry to assist in placement. Aspiration of gastric contents, auscultation of insufflated air over the stomach, and absence of patient coughing or choking, among others, suggest but cannot ensure correct tube placement. In 2006, the Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority wrote an article titled "Confirming Feeding Tube Placement: Old Habits Die Hard", where they concluded that none of these methods are 100% effective and that "it is always been done this way" is not a valid reason for healthcare workers to continue using less reliable methods to confirm FT placement. The authors further state that implementing improved evidence-based methods for FT placement will promote a safer environment of patient care.

Because this was a case series, no formal sample size calculation was performed. For continuous endpoints, the number of available observations, mean, standard deviation, and median, as well as minimum and maximum values, were provided. For categorical endpoints, the frequency and percentage of subjects in each category were displayed, including the anatomical landmarks visualized. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.4.

Analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) and the per protocol (PP) populations. The ITT population consisted of all subjects who consented, enrolled, and met the eligibility criteria. It served as the primary population for the primary endpoint of the study and for safety. The PP population consisted of all subjects in the ITT population without a major protocol violation who had an IRIS FT placed with final IRIS location obtained and underwent the required abdominal radiograph for confirmation of FT placement. Subjects considered as "training cases" were excluded from the PP population.

### Endoscopic gastrostomy after bariatric surgery: A unique approach [^116nKxpz]. Obesity Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Gastrostomy tube placement after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can be challenging, particularly in patients with dense abdominal adhesions. Novel, minimally invasive approaches are needed to access the gastric remnant when needed. We present an innovative method for gastrostomy tube placement in a patient with a retrocolic gastric bypass using a combined endoscopic ultrasound and fluoroscopy-guided approach, describing the essential technical steps of the procedure.

### Care and long-term maintenance of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes [^1133yQ6d]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

The placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube creates a controlled perforation of a hollow viscous organ and an acute surgical wound. Physicians who place PEG tubes endoscopically or fluoroscopically often do not have the opportunity to provide these patients with long-term follow-up care. Therefore, nutrition support specialists who treat these patients may be the members of the healthcare team most advantageously positioned for ongoing inspection and maintenance of the access device. Carefully monitored surveillance and adherence to routine principles of wound care assure the health of the skin, the underlying tissue, and the tract into the abdominal cavity through which the PEG passes.

Having knowledge of the types of tubes placed, performing a regular physical examination of the PEG site, and maintaining good communication with the endoscopist result in early identification of problems, promoting rapid simple strategies to correct deficiencies, and minimize long-term complications. Dietitians, wound-care ostomy nurses, and other nutrition support specialists are encouraged to be more proactive with their participation in the care and management of the PEG site.

### Ct fluoroscopy guided percutaneous gastrostomy or jejunostomy without (CT-PG/PJ) or with simultaneous endoscopy (CT-PEG/PEJ) in otherwise untreatable patients [^112iCjVr]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ) is substantial for patients with swallowing disorders to maintain enteral nutrition or to decompress palliatively intractable small bowel obstruction. Endoscopic placement can be impossible due to previous gastric operations, obesity, hepato-splenomegaly, peritoneal carcinosis, inadequate transillumination, or obstructed passage. Computed tomography (CT)-fluoroscopic guidance, with or without endoscopy, can enable placement of CT-PG/CT-PJ or CT-PEG/CT-PEJ if endoscopically guided placement fails. In this retrospective study, we evaluate the feasibility and safety of this method.

- **Methods**: A total of 101 consecutive patients were referred to our department for feeding support (n = 87) or decompression (n = 14). Reasons included ENT tumor (n = 51), esophageal cancer (n = 19), mediastinal mass (n = 2), and neurological disorder (n = 15). Decompression tubes were placed because of cancer (n = 13) or Crohn's disease (n = 1). The following approaches were chosen: CT fluoroscopy and simultaneous gastroscopy (n = 61), inflation of the stomach via nasogastric tube (n = 29), and direct puncture under CT-fluoroscopic guidance (n = 11).

- **Results**: CT fluoroscopy-guided gastrostomy was feasible in 89 of 101 patients, with no procedure-related mortality observed. One tube was misplaced into the colon in a patient with a history of gastrectomy, but no complications were seen after removal. Minor complications included dislodgement (n = 17), peristomal leakage (n = 7), and wound infection (n = 1).

### Ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous thrombin injection for stoma-site bleeding after PEG tube insertion: A case series and review of the literature [^1125LbpQ]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Low credibility.

Our study advocates that PTI with epinephrine, applied prophylactically or as a treatment under local anesthesia, is widely accepted for managing PEG-site bleeding, particularly when conservative therapy fails. It emerges as a preferable alternative to interventions requiring anesthesia in high-risk patients, demonstrating a significant safety profile. However, potential limitations in cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with diverse bleeding sites necessitate further studies for validation of success rates and complications.

We recommend proactive administration for high-risk patients, including those with chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, elderly individuals with limited cardiac reserve, patients needing prompt resumption of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy after gastrostomy, and those with a history of previous gastric bleeding.

Importantly, reported cases and our findings consistently show no systematic or local complications or failures, highlighting the direct and effective complete resolution of bleeding as a considerable outcome. Moreover, the accessibility and flexibility of ultrasound significantly ease the implementation of PTI in emergency scenarios or during combined interventional radiology procedures, underscoring the critical value of safety, immediate resolution, and the absence of complications in the study. PTI thus emerges as a promising possibility in the management of PEG tube-related bleeding.

While the occurrence of bleeding complications after gastrostomy is relatively low, addressing these complications is crucial due to their potential for severe consequences, including fatality.

### AGA clinical practice update on the optimal management of the malignant alimentary tract obstruction: Expert review [^1172CDKU]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of this expert review is to describe the methodologies available to manage malignant alimentary tract obstructions, as well as the evidence behind the various methods, including their efficacy and safety, indications, and appropriate timing of interventions. This review is not a formal systematic review but is based on a review of the literature to provide best practice advice statements. No formal rating of the quality of evidence or strength of recommendation is carried out.

- **Best practice advice 1**: For all patients with alimentary tract obstruction, the decision about specific interventions should be made in a multidisciplinary setting, including oncologists, surgeons, and endoscopists. This decision should take into account the characteristics of the obstruction, patient's expectations, prognosis, expected subsequent therapies, and functional status.

- **Best practice advice 2**: For patients who present with esophageal obstruction from esophageal cancer and who are potential candidates for resection or chemoradiation, clinicians should not routinely insert a self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) without multidisciplinary review because of high rates of stent migration, higher morbidity and mortality, and potentially lower R0 (microscopically negative margins) resection rates.

- **Best practice advice 3**: For patients who present with esophageal obstruction from esophageal cancer who are potential candidates for resection and have concerns about malnutrition, clinicians may consider the use of enteral feeding tubes (via nasogastric or percutaneous route).

### Ravicti [^113DgFMH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Preparation for nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube administration: It is recommended that all patients who can swallow take Ravicti orally, even those with nasogastric and/or gastrostomy tubes. For patients who cannot swallow, a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube may be used to administer Ravicti as follows:

- **Utilize a new dry oral syringe**: Withdraw each prescribed dosage of Ravicti from the bottle.
- **Place the tip of the syringe into the nasogastric/gastrostomy tube**: Utilize the plunger of the syringe to administer Ravicti into the tube.
- **Use a separate syringe to flush the nasogastric/gastrostomy tube**: Flush once with 10 mL of water or formula and allow the flush to drain. If needed, flush a second time with an additional 10 mL of water or formula to clear the tube.

For patients who require a volume of less than 1 mL per dose via nasogastric or gastrostomy tube, the delivered dosage may be less than anticipated due to adherence of Ravicti to the plastic tubing. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored using ammonia levels following initiation of Ravicti dosing or dosage adjustments.

### Interventional radiology techniques for provision of enteral feeding [^113F9ayi]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Gastrostomy placement in patients who are unable to maintain their nutrition orally has been attempted using a variety of techniques over the past century. This includes surgical, endoscopic, and, more recently, percutaneous radiologically guided methods. Surgical gastrostomy placement was the method of choice for almost a century, but it has since been superseded by both endoscopic and radiological placements. There are a number of indications for gastrostomy placement in clinical practice today, with fewer contraindications due to recent innovations in technique placement and gastrostomy catheter type.

We describe the technique of gastrostomy placement used in our institution, along with appropriate indications and contraindications. In addition, we discuss the wide variety of catheter types available and their perceived advantages. Some debate remains regarding gastropexy performance and the use of primary gastrojejunal catheters, which we will address. Additionally, we will examine the advantages and disadvantages of the three major types of gastrostomy placement currently available — surgical, endoscopic, and radiological — and their associated complications.

### Closure of a large high-output gastrocutaneous fistula with combined postpyloric feeding and aggressive medical therapy [^113tfEMv]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Widening of the exit site of a percutaneous gastrostomy tube is a rare but difficult-to-manage complication that leads to significant morbidity due to caustic material leak and associated cutaneous injury. Such defects fail to close with conservative measures, often necessitating invasive surgical or endoscopic intervention.

The authors present a 49-year-old woman with neurological dysphagia, occurring two years after gastrostomy tube insertion, with several months' history of leakage and widening of the hole at the exit site. Following gastrostomy tube removal, the patient was left with a large, high-output gastrocutaneous fistula. This was treated aggressively with measures to reduce gastric discharge, including 'nil-by-mouth', bypassing the stomach with distal feeding, administration of a somatostatin analogue, high-dose proton pump inhibitor, and prokinetics, with the aim of preoperatively downsizing the wound. This novel approach led to the complete closure of the large gastrocutaneous fistula, obviating the need for surgical intervention.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, more specifically with respect to venting gastrostomy, British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) 2020 guidelines recommend considering the placement of a venting gastrostomy to reduce vomiting in patients with chronic small intestinal dysmotility. It is important to recognize associated problems such as leakage, not draining, and poor body image.

### Successful identification of anatomical markers and placement of feeding tubes in critically ill patients via camera-assisted technology with real-time video guidance [^117NW8UK]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Translating these results into the expected impact on clinical practice, radiographic confirmation of correct FT placement could potentially be avoided by accurate IRIS visualization of the gastric mucosa, thus saving time and money, avoiding radiation exposure, and offsetting the cost of the camera technology.

- **Strengths of this study**: The enrolment of patients with a variety of diagnoses as eligible subjects from all ICU and step‐down units at the facility improves the generalizability of these results.

- **Shortcomings of this study**: The single‐center design and the fact that only three individuals (MD, RN, and PA credentials) placed all the tubes somewhat limit the generalizability of the placement experience. The clinicians also completed training cases and were therefore well practiced on the use of IRIS during this study. The learning curve in general clinicians must be determined in further studies.

Only three of the tubes placed were in the postpyloric space. Because postpyloric tubes are generally harder to place, further investigation is warranted to determine the feasibility and success rates of postpyloric tube placement. These patients may, in fact, represent an ideal opportunity to use anatomical markers to guide the more challenging postpyloric placement.

### Successful identification of anatomical markers and placement of feeding tubes in critically ill patients via camera-assisted technology with real-time video guidance [^117Svk2F]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Within the ITT population, there was one subject who did not undergo a KUB because of an adverse event (unrelated to FT placement) that led to death before the image could be obtained. No subjects' radiographs were inconclusive as to the final placement location; therefore, no subjects underwent radiograph with contrast media. Agreement between the IRIS placement location and KUB confirmation occurred in 40 instances (93.0%), which was statistically significant (Cohen's κ = 0.3645; p = 0.014).

As stated during the initial training cases period, one subject's FT was discovered to be coiled in the pharynx (2.1%) on x-ray. In the other cases of disagreement, two cases were read as in "stomach" via camera visualization but were determined to be "small bowel" via x-ray. These tubes also may have migrated to the small bowel before confirmatory x-ray. Finally, one tube was read as "postpyloric" via camera visualization; however, subsequent confirmatory x-ray was read as "downstream antrum/proximal pylorus", which may have also occurred because of tube movement after placement.

### Ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous thrombin injection for stoma-site bleeding after PEG tube insertion: A case series and review of the literature [^112WAHDk]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Low credibility.

The percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube serves as a crucial enteral feeding method for managing critically ill patients, ensuring direct delivery of nutrition into the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). While generally considered safe, complications can pose serious risks, which can lead to unfavorable sequelae or death. GI bleeding is an outstanding concern that was reported in up to 2.5–3% of the cases.

In our comprehensive literature search across PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar, the existing approaches for managing post-PEG site bleeding predominantly involve conservative measures, transcatheter arterial embolization, adjustments in anticoagulant medications, endoscopic interventions, or surgical repair for life-threatening situations.

However, there is a gap in research regarding the use of PTI for managing stoma-site bleeding, particularly in high-risk patients. Nonetheless, previous reports have highlighted successful PTI applications in pseudoaneurysms and hemoperitoneum related to paracentesis.

For comorbid patients undergoing emergency procedures under general anesthesia, the risks are substantial, with a mortality rate of 18% and a major complication rate of 65%. Thus, the decision to perform endoscopy or surgical intervention in such cases is fraught with significant risks. Furthermore, a retrospective study revealed that 22% of high-risk patients undergoing endoscopic procedures experienced deterioration leading to death, primarily attributed to pneumoperitoneum resulting from gas inflation.

### Strangulated gastric prolapse through a gastrostomy site requiring emergent partial gastrectomy [^116rwooK]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Strangulated gastric prolapse through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tract is a rare and potentially life-threatening complication that requires surgical intervention. We describe a case of a 74-year-old woman who was debilitated, ventilator-dependent, and presented with acute gastric prolapse with resultant ischaemic necrosis. The patient underwent an emergent exploratory laparotomy, partial gastrectomy, repair of gastrostomy defect, and placement of a gastrojejunostomy feeding tube remote to the previous location.

Literature on gastric prolapse in adult patients is sparse; therefore, treatment is not standardized. In this patient with strangulated tissue, the principles of management included the assessment of gastric mucosa viability, resection of ischaemic tissue, and closure of the gastrostomy defect.

### Retrospective cohort comparison between fluoroscopic and radiograph-only exams for evaluation of gastrostomy and gastrojejunostomy tubes [^112W7B7q]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Gastrostomy (G) tube or gastrojejunostomy (GJ) tube checks are radiographic procedures that are frequently ordered to confirm tube positioning.

- **Objective**: To characterize the sensitivity and specificity of radiograph-only examinations and traditional radiologist-performed fluoroscopy exams for G-tube or GJ-tube malposition and other adverse events detectable by imaging.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a retrospective cohort study at a single tertiary pediatric center that included all subjects who underwent G-tube or GJ-tube checks using fluoroscopy or radiograph-only exams between January 1, 2008, and January 1, 2019. Radiograph-only examinations were defined as checks that consist of frontal and lateral abdominal radiographs after injection of contrast through the G-tube or GJ-tube. Fluoroscopy exams were defined as exams performed by a radiologist in the fluoroscopy suite. Radiology reports were evaluated for reported tube malposition and other adverse events that are detectable by imaging. Clinical notes from the day of the procedure and longer-term clinical follow-up notes were used as a reference standard for adverse events. The sensitivity and specificity of the two procedures were calculated.

- **Results**: A total of 212 exams, including 86 (41%) fluoroscopy exams and 126 (59%) radiograph-only exams, were evaluated. The most common correctly identified adverse event was tube malposition (9 true positives). The most commonly missed adverse event was leakage around the tube (8 false negatives). Fluoroscopy exams had a sensitivity of 100% (6/6; 95% CI).

### Use of a laparoscopic Witzel gastrostomy without gastropexy in bariatric and general surgery [^114koUK4]. Obesity Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

We present a series of cases where gastric access was performed when the stomach could not reach the abdominal wall for gastropexy. In each case, a novel technique of laparoscopic Witzel gastrostomy without gastropexy was performed. The concept of creating a serosal tunnel around a gastric feeding tube was first described by Witzel in 1891. It is interesting that Witzel's initial description involved placement of a feeding tube into the stomach, not the jejunum, as is often thought.

In 1894, Caird published the first English-language description of the same technique in two patients with esophageal stricture. He cited major benefits of the technique, including minimization of leakage of gastric contents to the skin and rapid closure of the fistulous tract should the tube become unnecessary. Notably, in Caird's description, gastropexy was performed.

In 1982, Johnson et al. described the first series of patients who underwent placement of a Witzel gastrostomy without any type of gastropexy. In their series of 361 cases, minimal morbidity was observed, and reoperation was required only twice for gastrostomy-related complications. The authors found that this technique allowed for faster placement of the tube and felt that allowing the stomach to remain in anatomic position was an advantage. The tubes placed in this series were primarily for postoperative gastric decompression and were removed at an average of 14 days after placement. There was no occurrence of intraperitoneal leakage of gastric contents.

### Successful identification of anatomical markers and placement of feeding tubes in critically ill patients via camera-assisted technology with real-time video guidance [^114T1o5C]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Enteral feeding via feeding tube (FT) provides essential nutrition support to critically ill patients or those who cannot intake adequate nutrition via the oral route. Unfortunately, 1%–2% of FTs placed blindly at bedside enter the airway undetected, where they could result in adverse events. Misplaced FTs can cause complications, including pneumothorax, vocal cord injury, bronchopleural fistula, pneumonia, and death. X-ray is typically performed to confirm FT placement before feeding, but may delay nutrition intake, may not universally identify misplacement, and adds cost and radiation exposure.

A prospective case series was conducted to evaluate a novel FT with a camera to provide real-time visualization, guiding placement. The primary endpoint was the clinician's ability to identify anatomical markers in the gastrointestinal tract and/or airway using the camera. The Kangaroo Feeding Tube with IRIS Technology tube was placed in 45 subjects with 1 misplaced tube; 3 placements were postpyloric, with the remainder gastric. Clinicians correctly identified the stomach in 44 of 45 placements at a median depth of 60.0 cm (range 45.0–85.0 cm). A stomach image was obtained in 42 subjects (93.3%). Agreement between camera image and radiographic confirmation of placement was 93% (P = 0.014) with small deviations in recognizing stomach vs small bowel. No device-related adverse events occurred.

Direct visualization of the stomach using a camera-equipped FT can assist with FT placement, helping avoid misplacement.

### Gastrostomy tubes in patients with advanced head and neck cancer [^112jRwzX]. The Laryngoscope (2005). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to measure the percentage of patients requiring gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) and the timing of their placement. Additionally, the study aimed to determine if pretreatment variables, such as T stage, tumor site, and N stage, as well as intratreatment variables like weight loss during treatment, could predict the necessity for G-tube placement.

- **Study design**: A retrospective case-control study was conducted.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database, along with chart reviews, was performed on 477 patients treated with a regimen of intra-arterial cisplatin and conRadiation. The likelihood of requiring a G-tube was calculated by examining several independent variables using chi-square analysis and the unpaired t-test.

- **Results**: Two hundred twenty patients (46%) had G-tubes placed, with the mean time of placement being on day 20 following the initiation of treatment. Patients with T4 disease were statistically more likely to require a G-tube (50% vs. 37%, P < .05). Patients were less likely to require a G-tube when the primary site of the tumor involved the larynx or paranasal sinuses (P < .05). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with regard to patient age, sex, N stage, and weight changes over the course of treatment. The odds of requiring a G-tube were highest for tumors involving the hypopharynx (80%), oral cavity (52%), and oropharynx (49%).

- **Conclusions**: Clinical judgment is generally sufficient for deciding when G-tube placement is warranted in this population. However, the threshold for placing a tube should be lower in patients with a higher likelihood of requiring one.

### Radiologic gastrostomy [^111wd1y6]. Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Radiologic gastrostomy has a higher success rate and a lower complication rate and offers a greater choice of tubes than percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The position and configuration of the stomach and colon are clearly seen under fluoroscopy, and ultrasound can be used to locate the liver. Radiologic gastrostomy procedures can be performed when there are oropharyngeal tumors, esophageal strictures, and stents, and can be performed under local anesthesia alone.

Peroral push-gastrostomies are preferable for palliative care and for patients with neurogenic dysphagia, but percutaneously inserted tubes should be used in patients with upper gastrointestinal cancers in order to avoid tumor seeding. Unfortunately, awareness of and access to radiologic techniques are still limited, leading to the development of "adventurous" techniques for placing endoscopes in stomachs rather than applying simple fluoroscopic alternatives.

### Save the skin and improve the scar: A simple technique to minimize the scar from a temporary stoma [^1117aBfb]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2003). Low credibility.

Reversal of a loop ileostomy is not infrequently associated with wound infection and delayed wound healing, which in turn may lead to a disappointing scar. A simple modification to the technique of stoma construction simplifies wound closure, reduces the rate of wound morbidity, and improves the cosmetic result.

### Peritonitis after gastrostomy tube replacement: a case series and review of literature [^117Ck4RA]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

The placement of feeding gastrostomy (G) tubes through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) technique has become common because of its simplicity and safety. The majority of the serious complications are reported to occur within a few days of initial tube placement and happen in fewer than 3% of cases. Long-term reported complications of this procedure include occlusion or breakage of the G-tube, requiring reinsertion. This report describes the complication of intraperitoneal placement and the development of peritonitis after the replacement of an established PEG tube and reviews the pertinent world literature.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of cases of intraperitoneal insertion of replacement G-tubes was conducted, as well as a Medline search for cases of intraperitoneal insertion of replacement G-tube or development of peritonitis after replacement tube insertion.

- **Results**: Three new cases of inadvertent intraperitoneal insertion of a replacement G-tube in adult patients with mature tracts are reported. An additional 5 cases have been previously described in adults. Significant morbidity was associated with this complication, and 4 deaths were related to it. Methods used to determine whether the replacement G-tube was intragastric were not uniform.

- **Conclusions**: There have been few reports of intraperitoneal insertion of replacement G-tubes in patients with mature (> 30 days) stoma sites. The cases presented in this report highlight for the clinician the importance of considering this complication, particularly if there are any difficulties with the reinsertion.

### Feeding gastrostomy stoma site cutaneous myiasis: a rare entity [^116Ewoid]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Infestation of any dead or necrotic tissues by the larvae of flies (maggots) is known as myiasis. This form of habitation is not restricted to any particular tissues in the body and can occur anywhere. However, myiasis at the surgical stoma site is very rare. We present a case involving a 55-year-old woman diagnosed with metastatic carcinoma of the oesophagus who underwent a feeding gastrostomy (FG). The patient later presented with worms at the FG site. We removed the FG tube, cleared all the maggots, thoroughly cleaned the wound, and placed a new FG tube. Although occurrences have been reported in medical history, there are only two documented cases of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy stoma site myiasis. Hence, we present the first case in the literature of cutaneous myiasis around an FG stoma site.

### Gastrostomy tube dislodgment acute pancreatitis [^111Cgpsw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) tube was first described in 1980 by Gaunderer. PEG is considered a safe and effective method for providing long-term enteral nutrition while offering advantages over nasogastric tube feeding.

The incidence of short- and long-term complications related to PEG insertion is low. However, tube-related complications such as granulation tissue, broken or leaking tube, leakage around the tube site, and stomal site infection exceed 60%. Migration of feeding gastrostomy has been described in the past as a cause for gastric outlet obstruction, duodenal obstruction, and biliary obstruction.

In our case, pancreatitis is presented as a potential complication of a balloon gastrostomy tube. It appears that the Foley catheter's balloon obstructed the ampulla of Vater, resulting in acute pancreatitis.

Gastrostomy tube dislodgement pancreatitis is rare. A review of the English literature revealed 10 cases of pancreatitis due to the migration of a feeding gastrostomy. The first case was published in 1986 by Bui et al, who described a migration of a Foley catheter inadvertently left in place after establishing a permanent surgical gastrostomy.

Selected characteristics of all 11 cases, including our patient, are outlined in Table 1. The reasons for gastrostomy tube placement varied with age: from mental retardation and cerebral palsy in the younger age group to cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) in older patients. The time from the replacement of the tube to the initiation of symptoms varied widely from one day to one year.

### Laparoscopically assisted antegrade percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy [^113NdcTW]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

We describe a new technique named laparoscopically assisted antegrade percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), whereby a PEG tube is placed in the stomach with the aid of laparoscopy. The procedure is simple and avoids injury to adjacent organs that may occur with a standard PEG tube placement.

### Use of a laparoscopic Witzel gastrostomy without gastropexy in bariatric and general surgery [^1179UPUA]. Obesity Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The present study is the first description of performing gastrostomy without gastropexy using a laparoscopic Witzel technique. We believe the technique described is very useful in bariatric surgery and in general surgery cases where gastric access is required, but the stomach cannot reach the abdominal wall to perform gastropexy. We consider this technique a safe alternative to jejunostomy placement, which can help avoid the complications inherent to jejunostomy.

In our series, patients experienced no peritoneal leak of gastric contents upon removal of the feeding tube. We hypothesize that a fibrinous tract likely forms around the exposed intraperitoneal portion of the tube, similar to the tract known to form around a "T-tube" placed during common bile duct exploration. We believe this tract prevents intraperitoneal leakage upon tube removal. The technique is applicable to all patients in whom gastropexy is not possible, and it did not differ among those with variable body habitus, as the BMI ranged from 18.5 to 37.

The limitations of the study include inherent issues of retrospective studies and the small number of patients included. Additionally, we are unable to comment on the ability to change a gastrostomy feeding tube at the bedside, as we have not personally attempted this. Thus, the technique may not be ideal in situations where a permanent feeding tube is desired. If a tube placed in this fashion does need to be changed, we recommend changing the tube over a wire under fluoroscopic guidance to ensure that the tract is not lost.

### Safety and location analysis of transumbilical endoscopic submucosal dissection with single-basin lymph node dissection in the upper gastric body: a porcine model [^115mHTSc]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Low credibility.

Under pneumoperitoneum, a gastrostomy site corresponding to the greater curvature side of the antrum AW in humans was selected. The stomach was retracted, and gastrostomy was performed after the OCTO Port was removed. The OCTO Port was inserted through the gastrostomy site to create pneumoperitoneum (Fig. 2A). The cavity was then insufflated with CO₂ (6 mmHg of CO₂ pressure) through the OCTO Port.

- **In vivo survival study**: TU-ESD performed with perigastric LN dissection is depicted in Fig. 2. A schematic figure shows the TU-ESD procedure utilized in the in vitro porcine model (B). The ESD procedure was carried out using an endoscopist with a laparoscopic grasper assist (red arrow, Fig. 2A–C). Post-procedure, the gastrostomy site was closed, and pneumoperitoneum was re-created for one-basin LN dissection using a single-port procedure (Fig. 2D–F).

The ESD was performed at the AW (n = 3), PW (n = 3), and LC (n = 3) sites of the upper gastric body via the TU route with a single-port L-LND (Fig. 2B, C). ESD employed white-light endoscopy and chromoendoscopy with an indigo carmine solution (GIF-H260; Olympus Optical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan).

Marks were made around the lesions with a dual knife, and the mucosa surrounding the lesion was precut. The connective tissue of the submucosa was dissected with an IT-2 knife, and the specimen was retracted using a laparoscopic grasper (Endo Grasp, 5 mm; US Surgical, Norwalk, CT, USA) that was inserted through the OCTO Port (Arrow, Fig. 2A–C).

### The management of adult patients with severe chronic small intestinal dysmotility [^111USnzg]. Gut (2020). Low credibility.

- **Enteral nutrition**: Enteral nutrition is preferred if the gut is accessible and absorbing. In carefully selected patients, feeding jejunostomy with or without decompression (venting) gastrostomy may be tried. A percutaneous endoscopic or radiological gastro-jejunostomy is preferred to a direct jejunostomy where possible, as direct jejunostomy tubes are more subject to leakage, retention, pain, and skin problems. Gastro-jejunostomies can achieve both post-pyloric feeding and venting, with generally easier endoscopic placement, whereas direct jejunal tubes will often need to be placed surgically. Invasive enteral tube insertion should be preceded, where possible, by a trial of naso-enteral tube feeding to ensure absorption and tolerance prior to running the risks of mortality and morbidity associated with invasive tube placement.

If liquid enteral feeds are given, any excess can be aspirated by enteric tube or gastrostomy before the start of the next meal to ensure that excess volumes do not accumulate in the stomach. Gastrostomies can be used, therefore, to aspirate liquid gastric contents (decompression of venting gastrostomy) as well as a conduit for feeding, particularly when there is a need to bypass a malfunctioning esophagus and/or stomach. Pulmonary aspiration of large volume vomits is a very serious complication that may be difficult to prevent. A low antral site for gastro-jejunal tube placement is preferred to optimize drainage/venting and stability of the jejunal extension.

### Daybue [^113umSCp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosing information**: Administer Daybue orally twice daily, in the morning and evening, according to patient weight as shown in Table 1. Daybue can be taken with or without food.

- **Administration information**: Administer Daybue orally or via a gastrostomy (G) tube; doses administered via gastrojejunal (GJ) tubes must be administered through the G-port. A calibrated measuring device, such as an oral syringe or oral dosing cup, should be obtained from the pharmacy to measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately. A household measuring cup is not an adequate measuring device. Discard any unused Daybue oral solution after 14 days of first opening the bottle [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2)].

- **Dose modification for diarrhea or weight loss**: Advise patients to stop laxatives before starting Daybue. Interrupt, reduce the dosage, or discontinue Daybue if severe diarrhea occurs, if dehydration is suspected, or if significant weight loss occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

- **Dose modification for vomiting after administration**: If vomiting occurs after Daybue administration, an additional dose should not be taken. Instead, continue with the next scheduled dose. Interrupt, reduce dose, or discontinue Daybue if vomiting is severe or occurs despite medical management [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Dosage recommendations in patients with renal impairment**: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 60 to 89 mL/min for adult patients or 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73).

### Use of a laparoscopic Witzel gastrostomy without gastropexy in bariatric and general surgery [^115hKWxV]. Obesity Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

- **Material and methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients at a tertiary academic medical center who underwent "laparoscopic Witzel gastrostomy without gastropexy" over a 3-year period between 2015 and 2018. Data were collected on the age of the patient, the indication for enteral access, the reason safe gastropexy could not be performed, and the morbidity or mortality resulting from feeding tube placement. All patients received a silicone-based Halyard MIC® Gastrostomy Feeding Tube (Catalog no. 0112–18). Neither IRB approval nor patient consent was required for our retrospective review.

- **Operative procedure**: Patients are positioned in the supine position with both arms extended. The peritoneum is accessed with a Veress needle and insufflated. A camera trocar is placed in the left mid abdomen, and two working trocars are placed in the right abdomen. An assistant trocar is placed in the left upper quadrant as necessary. Trocar placement varies based on the presence of intra-abdominal adhesions or the primary indication of the procedure, for example, if a perforated marginal ulcer was repaired.

	- A location in the fundus of the stomach free of adhesive disease or extensive scarring is identified, and a gastrostomy is created with cautery and surrounded by a silk purse-string suture. An 18-French balloon tip gastric feeding tube is placed into the stomach and then secured with the purse-string suture. The balloon is then inflated. A second suture is placed approximately 5 cm distally, taking seromuscular bites of the stomach on either side.

- **Adverse events**: Approximately 90% of the study-related adverse events (SAEs) in the AspireAssist group were those known to be associated with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes. Approximately half of all SAEs occurred within the first 7 days after A-tube placement. The development of peristomal granulation tissue occurred later, at 1–2 months after A-tube placement. Most adverse events resolved spontaneously or with standard medical therapy, such as oral analgesics for abdominal pain, oral antibiotics for suspected or documented peristomal infection, and topical silver nitrate for granulation tissue. A listing of all adverse events is provided in Supplementary eTable S6 in the Supplementary Appendix.

- **Serious adverse events**: Five serious SAEs occurred in four participants in the AspireAssist group. No study-related SAEs occurred in the Lifestyle Counseling group. One of the SAEs was mild peritonitis, which occurred 2 days after A-tube placement and was treated with intravenous antibiotics and analgesics during a 2-day hospitalization. Two of the SAEs were associated with severe abdominal pain that occurred in the same participant within the first 3 days after A-tube placement; each time the participant was hospitalized overnight and treated with pain medication. Another SAE was associated with abdominal pain caused by a pre-pyloric ulcer that occurred 53 weeks after A-tube placement, judged to have been caused by mucosal contact with the intragastric portion of the A-tube, which had rotated toward the pylorus from its usual position in the fundus.

Gastrostomy tube administration (14 French gastrostomy tube or larger) should only be performed with the contents of the 4,000 USP lipase unit capsule of PERTZYE. The contents of no more than two capsules may be administered at a time in the gastrostomy tube.

- **Preparation**: Transfer a minimum of 10 mL of applesauce into a small bowl or medicine cup. Carefully open one or two PERTZYE 4,000 lipase unit capsules and mix the capsule contents thoroughly with the transferred applesauce to create a uniform suspension, being careful not to crush the contents. Once mixed, administer the suspension immediately.

- **Syringe preparation**: Remove the plunger from a 35 mL slip tip syringe and cover the tip of the syringe with your finger. Transfer the PERTZYE-applesauce mixture into the syringe and replace the plunger partially back into the syringe. Shake or tap the syringe lightly with the syringe tip facing upward so that the PERTZYE-applesauce mixture will move towards the plunger. Carefully push the plunger slowly until the residual air is removed from the syringe tip.

- **Administration**: Once the residual air is removed, connect the syringe directly into the gastrostomy tube feeding port. Push the syringe contents into the gastrostomy tube feeding port using steady pressure until empty.

- **Flushing and disposal**: Draw up approximately 10 mL of water with the slip tip syringe and flush the gastrostomy tube feeding port with the water. Discard any unused portion of the PERTZYE-applesauce mixture; do not save it for later use.

If the dose requires more than two capsules, repeat the steps above until the prescribed dose is reached.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube insertion via gastro-gastric fistula in a gastric bypass patient [^114xPaxQ]. Obesity Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Enteral feedings are the preferred route of nutritional support for malnourished or critically ill patients. Recent progress in flexible endoscopic and interventional radiological techniques has allowed the adaptation of numerous new procedures. Anatomic and functional rearrangement of the gastrointestinal tract often precludes traditional percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. Insertion of a gastroscope through the nose, via an open pharynx, or neck fistula has been described, but there are no reports in the English literature describing the introduction of the gastroscope through a dilated gastro-gastric fistula in a patient with a previous open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

### Cancer cachexia in adult patients: ESMO clinical practice guidelines [^115w79xF]. ESMO Open (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for sarcopenia, particularly in patients with cancer-associated cachexia, the ESMO 2021 guidelines recommend preferring percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy over nasogastric tube feeding for patients requiring more than four weeks of enteral feeding.

### Over-the-scope clip for closure of persistent gastrocutaneous fistula after gastrostomy tube removal: a multicenter pediatric experience [^1111mrz3]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has become a common procedure for establishing enteral nutritional access in patients unable to maintain adequate oral intake, even if modern laparoscopic techniques represent valid alternatives. Both approaches can serve as a temporary or permanent solution, offering an alternative route for nutritional support. Resuming normal oral nutrition, especially in children, often allows the gastrostomy to be removed. The standard removal of tubes is typically straightforward and can be performed in a clinical outpatient setting; spontaneous closure of the gastrostomy tract may take up to 1–2 weeks. However, a gastrocutaneous fistula (GCF) may persist even for months, posing clinical complications such as local infections or major leaks.

The occurrence of persistent (> 1–3 months) GCF ranges from 4.5% to 44%, depending on various risk factors and definitions. Age at gastrostomy placement and timing of removal are recognized as predisposing factors for GCF, as well as prolonged non-use or extended tube retention time. Indeed, one-third of children with predictable risk factors — including age at gastrostomy and length of time of tube retention — face challenges in managing the tube removal, mainly due to persistent GCF. Moreover, cauterization and outpatient procedures may frequently be unsuccessful in persistent GCF management, and surgical closure is then often required.

The emergence of endoscopic closure devices in recent years has revolutionized the approach to non-healing fistulae, marking a shift away from traditional surgical methods.

### Successful identification of anatomical markers and placement of feeding tubes in critically ill patients via camera-assisted technology with real-time video guidance [^112uWhqX]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Three clinicians with previous experience in small-bore enteral feeding tube (FT) placement received training on the use of the tube and performed a total of 12 training cases on enrolled and consenting subjects. Two clinicians completed the training phase with a minimum of 5 cases each; the third clinician did not complete the training phase, having performed only 2 placements before study enrollment was completed. Each clinician selected the appropriate diameter (8, 10, or 12 Fr) FT for the subject.

To estimate insertion depth, the clinician used the tube to measure the distance from the tip of the subject's nose to the earlobe and from the earlobe to the xiphoid process for gastric placement. The clinician positioned and prepared the subject in accordance with the usual protocol for FT placement at his or her facility. The FT was placed in the most patent naris using a stylet. While inserting the IRIS FT, the clinician used the console screen to identify anatomical markers to visualize the placement of the distal tip of the tube. At the discretion of the investigator, a manual air insufflation device was used to introduce small bursts of room air through the tube's distal end for better visualization.

Still images of anatomical markers were captured during the procedure. For anatomical markers noted during the placement procedure, the approximate depth of the FT's distal tip was recorded. Still images of the vocal cords, trachea, and carina were captured if visualized on the console during the procedure.

If signs of the airway were not visible, the procedure was adjusted accordingly.

### Successful identification of anatomical markers and placement of feeding tubes in critically ill patients via camera-assisted technology with real-time video guidance [^115BscWs]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

- **Study population**: Forty-nine subjects (37 males, 12 females) were determined to be initially eligible and consented to participate in the study, although one subject was later excluded because of medical instability and a decision not to place a feeding tube (FT). See Figure 1 for details of the enrolled and evaluated patient population.

- **Placement details**: Forty-four subjects (91.7%) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population had successful placement of the Kangaroo Feeding Tube with IRIS Technology (IRIS FT) into the stomach or small bowel. In three cases (6.3%), the FT could not be placed either because of the subjects' anatomy or their intolerance to the placement procedure. During the initial training cases period, one additional subject's FT was discovered to be coiled in the pharynx (2.1%) on x-ray, and the subject was removed from the study as another tube was placed. The median time between initial insertion start and final placement was 8.0 minutes in both the ITT and the per-protocol (PP) populations.

### Imaging the postoperative patient: Long-term complications of gastrointestinal surgery [^114sfjp8]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Stomal and parastomal hernias are a subtype of incisional hernias that involve herniation of the bowel or the mesentery at the site of or adjacent to a stoma. Even after closure of the enterostomy, the ostomy site can remain a potential area of herniation. Most parastomal hernias occur within 8 months of surgery. The etiology is multifactorial and includes characteristics such as obesity, malnutrition, increased intra-abdominal pressure, and chronic respiratory disease.

Parastomal hernias are quite common, with an expected prevalence of 33–78%, depending on clinical or CT evaluation. However, unless obstruction, perforation, or stoma malfunction occur, there is no need for surgical repair.

A recent study suggested a CT classification for parastomal hernias according to the possible contents of the hernial sac, as follows:

- **Type I**: Hernial sac containing the stoma loop.
- **Type II**: Sac containing omentum.
- **Type III**: Sac containing a bowel loop other than stoma.

Type 0 and Type Ia are considered normal findings and not true hernias.

Incarceration and strangulation can supervene with incisional hernias, as with any other abdominal wall hernias elsewhere. Strangulation occurs with typical findings as described above, such as bowel wall thickening, free fluid, and fat stranding.

In a recent abdominal CT observation of a patient with obstructive symptoms, there was diffuse fluid dilation of small-bowel loops proximal to a small segment of dilated small bowel incarcerated at the hernial sac.

### Successful identification of anatomical markers and placement of feeding tubes in critically ill patients via camera-assisted technology with real-time video guidance [^111qmFLJ]. JPEN Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

This prospective case series represents the largest study at the time of writing on the real-time visualization of anatomical landmarks during feeding tube (FT) placements using the IRIS. In this study, the investigators found that after training cases to ensure proficiency with the IRIS system, placement of this device was simple and safe in critically ill patients and provided identification of the esophagus and stomach to aid in accurate placement. Our experience revealed that optimal positioning of the patient, asking them to maintain a chin-down position while swallowing, and avoiding oral topicalization allowed for expeditious placement of the tube. Intubated patients are sometimes more difficult to place in an optimal chin-down position; however, this did not impair the expeditious placement of IRIS in intubated patients. The direct camera visualization of the endotracheal tube (ETT) and other landmarks improved safe and efficient FT placement.

Interestingly, topicalization with local anesthetic agents often led to initial airway visualization and a more difficult entry of the tip into the esophagus. It was the opinion of this investigator (P.W.) that this surprisingly often increased patient discomfort rather than reducing it.

Entrance into the airway was noted by clear identification of the trachea and carina in 17.8% and 2.2% of subjects, respectively. Notably, this was higher than the study clinicians had expected would occur. The vocal cords were visualized in 4.4% of placements. Visualization of the trachea confirms a significant risk for airway misplacement in this population.

### Successful identification of anatomical markers and placement of feeding tubes in critically ill patients via camera-assisted technology with real-time video guidance [^116xQW6w]. JPEN Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Enteral feeding via feeding tube (FT) provides essential nutrition support to critically ill patients or those who cannot intake adequate nutrition via the oral route. Unfortunately, 1%-2% of FTs placed blindly at the bedside enter the airway undetected, as confirmed by x-ray, where they could result in adverse events. Misplaced FTs can cause complications including pneumothorax, vocal cord injury, bronchopleural fistula, pneumonia, and death. X-ray is typically performed to confirm FT placement before feeding, but it may delay nutrition intake, may not universally identify misplacement, and adds cost and radiation exposure.

- **Methods**: A prospective case series was conducted to evaluate a novel FT with a camera to provide real-time visualization, guiding placement. The primary endpoint was the clinician's ability to identify anatomical markers in the gastrointestinal tract and/or airway using the camera.

- **Results**: The Kangaroo Feeding Tube with IRIS Technology was placed in 45 subjects with 1 misplaced tube; 3 placements were postpyloric, with the remainder gastric. Clinicians correctly identified the stomach in 44 of 45 placements at a median depth of 60.0 cm (range 45.0–85.0 cm). A stomach image was obtained in 42 subjects (93.3%). Agreement between camera image and radiographic confirmation of placement was 93% (P = 0.014) with small deviations in recognizing the stomach vs the small bowel. No device-related adverse events occurred.

- **Conclusions**: Direct visualization of the stomach using a camera-equipped FT can assist with FT placement and help avoid misplacements.

### Percutaneous gastrostomy device for the treatment of class II and class III obesity: Results of a randomized controlled trial [^11567Abw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

Eligible participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 52 weeks of treatment with AspireAssist (Aspiration Therapy plus Lifestyle Counseling) or Lifestyle Counseling alone, respectively, using a web-based system provided by the sponsor. Participants in the AspireAssist group were allowed to continue in the study for an additional 48 months if they lost and maintained at least 10% of their baseline body weight. Allocation occurred in blocks of random sizes to avoid temporal bias, with each site being randomized independently.

Participants randomized to therapy with AspireAssist underwent endoscopic placement of a specially designed gastrostomy tube, known as the A-tube. This tube has a 15-cm fenestrated intragastric portion to allow aspiration of gastric contents. The endoscopic procedure is analogous to the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube (details of the procedure are provided in the Supplementary Appendix), which is typically performed on an outpatient basis and takes approximately 15–20 minutes to complete. After the gastrostomy matured, approximately 10–14 days following A-tube placement, at the week-0 visit, the proximal end of the A-tube was cut to within 1 cm of the abdominal wall and attached to a Skin-Port. Participants were then trained on how to aspirate after meals and instructed to chew very thoroughly, to avoid A-tube blockage, and to aspirate about 20 minutes after each of three main meals daily.

The components of the AspireAssist device and the aspiration procedure are shown in Figure 1. The aspiration process involves flushing food.

### Carbaglu [^117WyRj2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For patients who have a nasogastric (NG) tube or gastrostomy tube (G-tube) in place, administer Carbaglu as follows:

- **Preparation of the mixture**: Add a minimum of 2.5 mL of water into a small cup for each Carbaglu tablet, or each half or quarter tablet needed for the prescribed dose. Add the Carbaglu tablets to the water in the cup and carefully stir the tablet and water mixture.

- **Administration through the feeding tube**: Draw up the mixture into a catheter-tip syringe and administer the mixture immediately through the NG tube or G-tube. Note that pieces of the tablet may remain in the catheter-tip syringe or the feeding tube.

- **Flushing the feeding tube**: Flush immediately with 1 to 2 mL of additional water to clear the NG tube or G-tube. Flush the NG tube or G-tube again, as needed, until no pieces of the tablet are left in the syringe or the feeding tube.

### Surgical management of ostomy complications: a MISSTO-WSES mapping review [^114JnESy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Surgical revision of a retracted stoma should be considered in cases of failure of conservative approaches to allow adequate adhesion of stoma appliances. Persistent complications, especially infectious and skin complications, are frequently due to inadequate adhesion of the stoma appliances, deeper stoma retraction, and risk of peritoneal contamination by stools.

Because the excessive tension of the bowel, a primary cause of stoma retraction, results from inadequate mobilization of the intestinal loop, the rationale for surgical management of stoma retraction is based on increasing the stoma length by dissection of the bowel. This can be achieved with a local approach or, if inadequate, by a midline laparotomy. Local repair of stoma retraction is a procedure performed through the stoma site and is based on the partial mobilization of the proximal bowel. However, the efficacy of local repair depends on the level of retraction and is possible only if the stoma retraction is due to superficial factors and not intra-abdominal factors.

Skærlund et al. described a technique for the repair of a retracted stoma using a non-cutting linear stapler, which could also be performed in an outpatient setting. This technique is based on both intestinal superficial mobilization and stoma fixation to the skin. In this technique, the stoma is grasped with two Babcock clamps and everted approximately 3 cm above skin level. Between the two clamps, a non-cutting linear stapler is fired from the tip of the stoma to its base at skin level; two more staples are then placed.

### Radiological percutaneous gastrostomy [^111rkg3a]. Clinical Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Long-term gastrostomy tubes have a widely accepted role in providing nutritional support. Traditionally, such tubes have been placed by surgeons and endoscopists. In the last decade, radiologists have taken on a major role in the placement of gastrostomy and gastrojejunostomy devices and can usually do so as effectively and at lesser expense.

A technique for placement is outlined, along with a discussion of patient selection and complications. A review of the literature is also provided.

### A retrospective study of cricotracheostomy: Indications, techniques, and clinical outcomes [^115Rp3co]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

An important consideration after cricotracheostomy (CT) is the management of tracheostomy tubes. After CT, the angulation of the route from the stoma to the trachea is expected to differ from that of a typical tracheotomy. Depending on the type of tracheostomy tubes used, the tube tip may have a tendency to come in contact with the anterior or posterior tracheal wall. Even following a conventional tracheotomy, tube management can be difficult for obese patients, who may require extended-length tracheostomy tubes to accommodate their body size. Currently, tracheostomy tubes designed exclusively for use after CT are not available, but the development of specialized tubes is likely to follow the projected increase in patients undergoing CT.

In the present study, CTrach and CTrachT were compared as CT techniques, but no significant differences in clinical background or complication risk were found between the two. In CTrach, having a shorter distance between the stoma and the vocal cords may lead to a higher risk of subglottic granulomas and vocal cord movement disorders due to inflammation around the stoma. Additionally, because CTrach does not create an inverted U-shaped flap, the potential for subcutaneous tube misplacement during tracheostomy tube change exists. In contrast, CTrachT creates a U-shaped flap at the first tracheal ring, which may reduce the chances of incorrect tracheostomy tube placement. Additionally, the longer distance to the glottis compared to CTrach also facilitates easier management of tracheostomy tubes. These points may justify the significant preference for CTrachT.

### Mitigation of stomach dehiscence risk during gastrostomy tube changes - a retrospective analysis of patient outcomes [^113QfmyS]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Stomach dehiscence from the abdominal wall is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication of gastrostomy tube changes. This retrospective study evaluates gastric aspiration as an inexpensive and safe alternative to endoscopic or radiographic confirmation.

- **Methods**: From August 1998 to June 2016, 682 patients (301 female, 381 male) underwent 1713 gastrostomy tube changes in the medical setting, with an average age of 7.59 years and an average site age of 3.43 years. The most common diagnoses were GERD (304), aspiration (168), and failure to thrive (143).

- **Results**: All newly inserted tubes were aspirated to visually inspect for gastric fluid. This procedure, as a confirmatory test for intragastric placement, was found to have a positive predictive value of 99.5% and a negative predictive value of 77.8%, with a sensitivity of 99.8% and specificity of 63.6%. In cases with successful aspiration of gastric fluid, 75.5% of changes resulted in no complications, with intraperitoneal insertion or leak in only 0.48% of cases.

- **Conclusions**: Positive gastric aspirate is a strong predictor of proper G-tube placement with high sensitivity, eliminating the requirement for specialized equipment and the cost associated with endoscopic or radiographic guidance, and has a comparable or superior risk profile.

- **Levels of evidence**: Study of diagnostic test level II.
