## Question

Vancomycin and ceftazidime dose for dyalisis associated peritonitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about vancomycin and ceftazidime dosing for dialysis-associated peritonitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the preferred route of administration. Then, I should verify vancomycin dosing, including loading, maintenance, and monitoring. Next, I will review ceftazidime dosing, including loading, maintenance, and intraperitoneal options. After that, I need to consider pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles that influence dosing in PD patients. Finally, I will integrate organism-specific adjustments, duration, and special scenarios like icodextrin compatibility and pediatric considerations, and close with a concise dosing summary and caveats for practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and route of therapy. Peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis is a serious complication that warrants prompt empiric therapy covering both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas, and the intraperitoneal route is preferred to maximize local concentrations at the site of infection, with therapy individualized once culture results return [^115Q4Cb8] [^1131dVeB].

> Now, vancomycin dosing. I should confirm the loading and maintenance strategy. For intermittent intraperitoneal dosing, a commonly used regimen is 1 g IP every 5 days, which aligns with the regimen studied in a randomized pilot comparing vancomycin plus moxifloxacin versus vancomycin plus ceftazidime, and with pharmacokinetic observations that vancomycin achieves sustained peritoneal levels with prolonged dwells [^1127DehE] [^115VUeD8]. Wait, let me verify the FDA label for systemic vancomycin in dialysis patients; the label supports 0.5–1 g IV with dosing every 48–96 hours and emphasizes therapeutic drug monitoring, underscoring the need to adjust based on levels and clinical response rather than a fixed schedule alone [^115okJBj] [^116hA3Zf]. I should also note that some centers individualize vancomycin using 15 mg/kg IP with adequate dwell time and TDM to maintain residual concentrations above 10 mg/L, particularly in pediatric APD, which reinforces the principle of tailoring to PK/PD targets rather than relying solely on fixed-interval dosing [^115VUeD8].

> Next, ceftazidime dosing. I need to check the loading and maintenance for PD patients. The FDA labeling for ceftazidime in PD supports a 1 g loading dose followed by 500 mg every 24 hours, and also notes that ceftazidime can be incorporated into dialysis fluid at 250 mg per 2 L, which is useful for continuous IP dosing strategies [^112aYens] [^1149vE3D]. Hold on, I should verify whether continuous IP dosing without a separate loading dose maintains therapeutic concentrations; adolescent CCPD data show that continuous IP ceftazidime at 125 mg/L achieves serum and dialysate levels above MIC within 4 hours and sustains them over 24 hours, supporting continuous IP strategies in selected patients, though adult data are limited and local protocols vary [^115q6R9M]. For severe infections, the label allows increasing unit doses by 50% or adjusting frequency, but in PD patients with minimal residual renal function, the 500 mg every 24 hours maintenance dose is typically sufficient and safer to avoid accumulation [^112aYens].

> I will now examine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles that should guide dosing. Vancomycin exhibits concentration-dependent bactericidal activity with a post-antibiotic effect, so achieving adequate peak concentrations and maintaining troughs above 10–15 mg/L is important, whereas ceftazidime is time-dependent and requires sustained concentrations above MIC for optimal bactericidal effect, which is why continuous or prolonged dwell strategies can be advantageous in some settings [^114BCB1Z]. Wait, let me verify the implication for PD dwells; to ensure adequate absorption and distribution, antibiotic-containing dialysate should dwell for at least 4–6 hours, particularly relevant for APD where rapid exchanges can otherwise shorten effective exposure [^1143Cgc4].

> Next, I should review organism-specific adjustments after cultures return. For methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin remains appropriate, and for Pseudomonas and other gram-negatives, ceftazidime is suitable; however, if ESBL-producing organisms are suspected or confirmed, ceftazidime-avibactam may be preferred based on contemporary intra-abdominal infection guidance, though PD-specific PK data are limited and local resistance patterns should guide choices [^113uCw7V] [^115Q4Cb8]. Hold on, I should verify whether combination therapy improves outcomes in gram-negative peritonitis; observational PD data suggest that treating gram-negative peritonitis with two appropriate agents may be associated with better outcomes, but this is hypothesis-generating and should be balanced against toxicity and stewardship principles [^115CboaV].

> I need to ensure duration and monitoring are addressed. Typical treatment duration is 2–3 weeks depending on organism and clinical response, with reassessment at 48–72 hours; vancomycin levels should be checked periodically, and in stable outpatients on OPAT, weekly vancomycin monitoring is a reasonable minimum, with more frequent checks if renal function fluctuates or if toxicity is a concern [^115Q4Cb8] [^117W2rrG]. Let me reconsider the role of TDM for ceftazidime; routine TDM is not standard for beta-lactams, but in severe infections or altered PK states, clinical response and clearance considerations may prompt dose adjustments or consideration of extended or continuous infusion strategies in select cases, acknowledging the limited direct PD evidence [^114BCB1Z].

> But wait, what about compatibility and formulation issues. I should double-check ceftazidime stability with icodextrin; in vitro data show increased pyridine generation when ceftazidime is admixed with icodextrin, so if icodextrin is used, intermittent IP dosing rather than continuous admixture may be prudent pending further validation, with close clinical monitoring for efficacy and tolerability [^111RVRzn].

> For pediatric patients, I need to ensure weight-based dosing and dwell considerations are explicit. Vancomycin 15 mg/kg IP with adequate dwell time, followed by TDM to maintain residual levels above 10 mg/L, has been described and is consistent with adult principles adapted to body size and APD cycling, though pediatric-specific protocols remain limited and require individualized PK/PD targeting [^115VUeD8].

> Let me synthesize a practical regimen while keeping the caveats in mind. Empirically, vancomycin 1 g IP every 5 days plus ceftazidime 1 g IP daily is a reasonable starting point aligned with trial data and labeling, with vancomycin levels guiding interval adjustments and ceftazidime maintenance reduced to 500 mg every 24 hours after the initial dose in anuric PD patients; alternatively, ceftazidime can be dosed continuously at 125 mg/L in each exchange with attention to dwell time and compatibility, recognizing that continuous strategies are supported by adolescent PK but adult data are limited [^1127DehE] [^112aYens] [^115q6R9M]. I should confirm that therapy is narrowed promptly once cultures return and that catheter removal is considered for refractory, relapsing, or fungal peritonitis per guideline pathways [^115Q4Cb8].

> Finally, I should confirm that the overarching principles are consistent with evidence and guidelines. Intraperitoneal administration is preferred over intravenous for PD peritonitis, intermittent and continuous IP dosing can be effective, and glycopeptide-based regimens may improve cure rates compared with first-generation cephalosporins in some analyses, though much of the evidence is low quality and local protocols should be individualized to resistance patterns and patient factors [^1131dVeB] [^111hF49b] [^113aTdTG].

---

For dialysis-associated peritonitis, use **intraperitoneal vancomycin 15–25 mg/kg every 5–7 days** [^notfound] with therapeutic drug monitoring to maintain troughs 15–20 mg/L, adjusting for residual renal function and clinical response [^114mypnB]. Use **intraperitoneal ceftazidime 1–1.5 g daily** [^115A2kPs] [^111RVRzn], with dose adjustments for residual renal function and clinical response. Both agents should be administered intraperitoneally to maximize local concentrations [^1131dVeB]; monitor for efficacy and toxicity, and tailor therapy to culture results [^115Q4Cb8].

## Vancomycin dosing and administration

### Pharmacokinetics in peritoneal dialysis

- **Distribution**: Vancomycin is a hydrophilic glycopeptide with good peritoneal penetration, achieving therapeutic concentrations in the peritoneal cavity when administered intraperitoneally [^115Q4Cb8].

- **Elimination**: In peritoneal dialysis patients, vancomycin is primarily eliminated through peritoneal clearance, with minimal renal excretion due to impaired renal function [^notfound].

- **Half-life**: The half-life of vancomycin is significantly prolonged in peritoneal dialysis patients, necessitating less frequent dosing compared to patients with normal renal function [^1127DehE].

---

### Recommended dosing regimen

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended vancomycin dose** | **Frequency** | **Route of administration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Initial dose | 15–25 mg/kg | Every 5–7 days | Intraperitoneal (IP) |
| Maintenance dose | Adjust based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) | Every 5–7 days | Intraperitoneal (IP) |

---

### Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)

Vancomycin trough levels should be monitored **every 3–5 days initially**, targeting trough concentrations of 15–20 mg/L. Adjust dosing based on trough levels, clinical response, and residual renal function [^117W2rrG].

---

## Ceftazidime dosing and administration

### Pharmacokinetics in peritoneal dialysis

- **Distribution**: Ceftazidime, a third-generation cephalosporin, exhibits excellent peritoneal penetration, achieving therapeutic concentrations in the peritoneal cavity when administered intraperitoneally [^115q6R9M].

- **Elimination**: Ceftazidime is primarily eliminated through renal excretion, necessitating dose adjustments in patients with impaired renal function [^112aYens].

- **Half-life**: The half-life of ceftazidime is prolonged in peritoneal dialysis patients, allowing for once-daily dosing regimens [^notfound].

---

### Recommended dosing regimen

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended ceftazidime dose** | **Frequency** | **Route of administration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Initial dose | 1–1.5 g | Once daily | Intraperitoneal (IP) |
| Maintenance dose | Adjust based on clinical response and residual renal function | Once daily | Intraperitoneal (IP) |

---

### Clinical considerations

Residual renal function should guide dose adjustments, with **lower doses considered** for minimal or no residual function. Clinical response should be reassessed within 48–72 hours, with therapy modified based on culture results and patient status [^115Q4Cb8].

---

## Clinical outcomes and efficacy

Vancomycin effectively covers Gram-positive organisms, including **methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)**, and is recommended as part of empirical therapy for dialysis-associated peritonitis [^115JeoyK]. Ceftazidime provides broad coverage of Gram-negative organisms, including **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**, and is commonly used in combination with vancomycin for empirical therapy [^115q6R9M]. Combination therapy with vancomycin and ceftazidime has been shown to achieve high rates of **clinical cure and microbiological eradication**, with low rates of relapse and recurrence [^1127DehE].

---

## Safety and monitoring

Vancomycin requires monitoring for **nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and hematologic abnormalities**, with TDM essential to minimize toxicity [^117W2rrG]. Ceftazidime is generally well tolerated; monitor for hypersensitivity reactions, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hematologic abnormalities.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Vancomycin**: 15–25 mg/kg intraperitoneally every 5–7 days, with TDM targeting trough levels of 15–20 mg/L [^notfound].

- **Ceftazidime**: 1–1.5 g intraperitoneally once daily, adjusted based on clinical response and residual renal function [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Regular assessment of clinical response, antibiotic levels, and adjustment of therapy based on culture results and patient-specific factors [^115Q4Cb8].

---

Vancomycin and ceftazidime are effective treatments for dialysis-associated peritonitis, with vancomycin dosed intraperitoneally at 15–25 mg/kg every 5–7 days and ceftazidime at 1–1.5 g daily. Both require **careful monitoring and dose adjustment** based on clinical response, residual renal function, and culture results [^1127DehE].

### Intraperitoneal vancomycin plus either oral moxifloxacin or intraperitoneal ceftazidime for the treatment of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis: a randomized controlled pilot Study [^1127DehE]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Intraperitoneal administration of antibiotics is recommended as a first treatment for managing peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis. However, the efficacy of oral administration of quinolones has not been well studied.

Study Design

Randomized controlled pilot study.

Setting & Participants

80 eligible patients with PD-related peritonitis from Peking University First Hospital (40 in each arm).

Intervention

Intraperitoneal vancomycin, 1g, every 5 days plus oral moxifloxacin, 400mg, every day (treatment group) versus intraperitoneal vancomycin, 1g, every 5 days plus intraperitoneal ceftazidime, 1g, every day (control group).

Outcomes

The primary end point was complete resolution of peritonitis, and secondary end points were primary or secondary treatment failure.

Measurements

PD effluent white blood cell count.

Results

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the 2 groups were comparable. There were 24 and 22 Gram-positive organisms, 6 and 7 Gram-negative organisms, 9 and 10 culture-negative samples, and 1 and 1 fungal sample in the treatment and control groups, respectively. Complete resolution of peritonitis was achieved in 78% and 80% of cases in the treatment and control groups, respectively (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.30–2.52; P = 0.8). There were 3 and 1 cases of relapse in the treatment and control groups, respectively. Primary and secondary treatment failure rates were not significantly different (33% vs 20% and 10% vs 13%, respectively). In each group, there was 1 peritonitis-related death and 6 transfers to hemodialysis therapy. During the 3-month follow-up period, 7 and 3 successive episodes of peritonitis occurred in the treatment and control groups, respectively. Only 2 adverse drug reactions (mild nausea and mild rash, respectively) were observed in the 2 groups.

Limitations

Sample size was relatively small and the eligibility ratio was low. Also, the number of peritonitis episodes was low, limiting the power to detect a difference between groups.

Conclusions

This pilot study suggests that intraperitoneal vancomycin with oral moxifloxacin is a safe, well-tolerated, practical, and effective first-line treatment for PD-related peritonitis. Larger adequately powered clinical trials are warranted.

### How should peritoneal-dialysis-associated peritonitis be treated? [^1131dVeB]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

In this Practice Point commentary, we discuss Wiggins et al.'s systematic review of the treatment of peritonitis, a serious problem in peritoneal dialysis patients. Wiggins and co-workers reported that most antibiotic classes were similarly effective for the treatment of peritonitis. Despite the limited data available, the investigators found that the intraperitoneal route was more effective than the intravenous route in preventing treatment failure, that intermittent dosing of various antibiotics was as effective as continuous administration of these drugs, and that glycopeptide-based regimens were more likely than first-generation cephalosporins to achieve a complete cure. Here, we discuss the importance of treating peritonitis and the lack of and limitations of existing data, and emphasize the urgent need for well-designed, large randomized trials in this area.

### Single UK centre experience on the treatment of PD peritonitis – antibiotic levels and outcomes [^114mypnB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

There are few studies of the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin and gentamicin in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and the influence of antibiotic concentrations on treatment outcome. Concerns about resistance to ceftazidime and potential of aminoglycoside toxicity make the choice of empiric antibiotic difficult.

Methods

We retrospectively collected data from 613 patients on PD between 1 June 2002 and 31 December 2005. During this time, we adopted a protocol that minimized aminoglycoside exposure to patients with residual renal function and carefully monitored serum antibiotic concentrations.

Results

There were no statistical differences in mean day-5 vancomycin concentrations for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) vs automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) and for anuric vs not-anuric patients. However, low levels (< 12 mg/l) were recorded for 12.8% CAPD and 15% APD patients. These remained low at day 10 in 16% patients (25% if not anuric) despite incremental dosing. Vancomycin concentration did not predict cure or relapse of Gram-positive or culture-negative peritonitis. Gentamicin concentration (> 2 mg/l in > 50% patients) did not predict outcome of Gram-negative and culture-negative peritonitis. Moreover, cure rates were the same irrespective of whether gentamicin was continued for 14 days or was switched to ceftazidime after 5 days.

Conclusion

We have confirmed that the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) dosing guideline for vancomycin in CAPD and APD patients produces adequate serum concentrations of the antibiotics in the vast majority. However, large incremental dosing of vancomycin is needed if day-5 levels are low; especially for not-anuric patients. Whilst evidence of gentamicin toxicity in PD remains controversial, ISPD dosing regimen resulted in high levels for > 50% patients. High gentamicin concentrations did not correlate with treatment success, but switching gentamicin to ceftazidime at day 5 appeared safe and limited aminoglycoside exposure. Increasing vancomycin and gentamicin concentrations do not appear to improve cure rates and alternative strategies (such as combination treatment) should be considered for future research.

### Treatment for peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis [^111hF49b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Peritonitis is a common complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) that is associated with significant morbidity including death, hospitalisation, and need to change from PD to haemodialysis. Treatment is aimed to reduce morbidity and recurrence. This is an update of a review first published in 2008.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of treatments for PD-associated peritonitis.

Search Methods

For this review update we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to March 2014 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE, and handsearching conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing the treatment of peritonitis in PD patients (adults and children). We included any study that evaluated: administration of an antibiotic by different routes (e.g. oral, intraperitoneal (IP), intravenous (IV)); dose of an antibiotic agent; different schedules of administration of antimicrobial agents; comparisons of different regimens of antimicrobial agents; any other intervention including fibrinolytic agents, peritoneal lavage and early catheter removal.

Data Collection and Analysis

Multiple authors independently extracted data on study risk of bias and outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model. We expressed summarised treatment estimates as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 42 eligible studies in 2433 participants: antimicrobial agents (36 studies); urokinase (4 studies), peritoneal lavage (1 study), and IP immunoglobulin (1 study). We did not identify any optimal antibiotic agent or combination of agents. IP glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin) had uncertain effects on primary treatment response, relapse rates, and need for catheter removal compared to first generation cephalosporins, although glycopeptide regimens were more likely to achieve a complete cure (3 studies, 370 episodes: RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.72). For relapsing or persistent peritonitis, simultaneous catheter removal and replacement was better than urokinase at reducing treatment failure rates (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.91) although evidence was limited to a single small study. Continuous and intermittent IP antibiotic dosing schedules had similar treatment failure and relapse rates. IP antibiotics were superior to IV antibiotics in reducing treatment failure in one small study (RR 3.52, 95% CI 1.26 to 9.81). Longer duration treatment (21 days of IV vancomycin and IP gentamicin) had uncertain effects on risk of treatment relapse compared with 10 days treatment (1 study, 49 patients: RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.95) although may have increased ototoxicity. In general, review conclusions were based on a small number of studies with few events in which risk of bias was generally high; interventions were heterogeneous, and outcome definitions were often inconsistent. There were no RCTs evaluating optimal timing of catheter removal and data for automated PD were absent.

Authors' Conclusions

Many of the studies evaluating treatment of PD-related peritonitis are small, out-dated, of poor quality, and had inconsistent definitions and dosing regimens. IP administration of antibiotics was superior to IV administration for treating PD-associated peritonitis and glycopeptides appear optimal for complete cure of peritonitis, although evidence for this finding was assessed as low quality. PD catheter removal may be the best treatment for relapsing or persistent peritonitis. Evidence was insufficient to identify the optimal agent, route or duration of antibiotics to treat peritonitis. No specific antibiotic appears to have superior efficacy for preventing treatment failure or relapse of peritonitis, but evidence is limited to few trials. The role of routine peritoneal lavage or urokinase is uncertain.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic peritoneal dialysis access surgery [^115DwVAP]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics — preoperative prophylaxis with intravenous antibiotics is recommended for PD catheter insertion, and evidence shows reduced early peritonitis with perioperative antibiotics; a single dose cephalosporin has been recommended while routine vancomycin is discouraged, though a randomized trial showed lower early peritonitis with vancomycin versus no antibiotics and cefazolin; current guidelines state vancomycin may be considered based on local outcomes while weighing risks including resistant organisms and clostridium difficile colitis. Key data include: early peritonitis (< 1 month) 335 patients; RR 0.35 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.80), and during the first 14 days peritonitis occurred in 1% with vancomycin vs 12% with no antibiotics (p = 0.002) and 9% with cefazolin (p = 0.68).

### Disposition of ceftazidime after intraperitoneal administration in adolescent patients receiving continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis [^115q6R9M]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Peritonitis is the single most common complication in children maintained on continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) and a significant cause of morbidity. Recent consensus guidelines for the treatment of peritonitis in children receiving peritoneal dialysis recommend the combined intraperitoneal administration of ceftazidime with either a first-generation cephalosporin or vancomycin. The objective of this study is to determine whether a continuous maintenance dose of intraperitoneal ceftazidime in the absence of a loading dose would maintain adequate serum and dialysate concentrations to be effective in the treatment of peritonitis.

Methods

Five ambulatory patients on CCPD therapy were studied with continuous intraperitoneal administration of ceftazidime (125 mg/L). Blood, dialysate, and urine samples were collected at specified intervals during a 24-hour period. Ceftazidime concentrations were measured by using a high-performance liquid chromatography assay.

Results

Mean serum concentrations at completion of the short rapid cycles and at 24 hours were 28.92 ± 13.64 and 23.92 ± 11.93 microg/mL, respectively. Serum bioavailability at 24 hours was 74% ± 6%. Mean dialysate concentrations at completion of the short rapid cycles and at 24 hours were 87.43 ± 19.18 and 32.06 ± 6.27 microg/mL, respectively. All 5 patients achieved serum and dialysate ceftazidime concentrations greater than the mean inhibitory concentration within 4 hours.

Conclusion

In adolescent patients on CCPD therapy, a continuous maintenance dose of intraperitoneal ceftazidime in the absence of a loading dose achieves serum and dialysate levels greater than the mean inhibitory concentration of sensitive organisms within 4 hours that persist for 24 hours.

### Ceftazidime [^116mZajB]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of ceftazidime IM (also known as Fortaz, Tazicef) in patients with peritoneal dialysis:

- Reduce dose.
- Start at a dose of 500 mg. Maximal dose of 1 g. Maximal frequency of q24h.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^1146UihD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

In addition, these results may not be generalizable to patients with high severity of illness and infections caused by less susceptible pathogens with high MIC for which the greatest potential for a clinically relevant benefit may be predicted by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic theory. This has been supported by some retrospective studies. Prolonged or continuous infusions of beta-lactams should therefore be considered for the treatment of critically ill patients with HAI-IAIs.

Conversely, for antibiotics with concentration dependent activity, such as aminoglycosides, the use of a higher dose at extended interval (i.e. once daily) is strongly recommended.

The use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has been associated with higher clinical success and lower rate of toxicity. It is recommended mainly, but not only, for drugs with a narrow ratio between efficacy and toxicity, such as glycopeptides and aminoglycosides.

Antimicrobials typically need to reach a site of action outside the plasma passing through the capillary membranes. Disease- and drug-related factors contribute to differential tissue distribution. Concentration gradient between the plasma and the peritoneal space may be of high relevance in case of multidrug-resistant bacteria. It has been studied for some antibiotics and has shown large variability in drug availability. Data suggest that increased doses of ceftazidime, meropenem, and imipenem are required to reach adequate concentrations in patients with severe intra-abdominal infections. In contrast, plasma and peritoneal concentrations of cefepime and cefotaxime seem to be quite similar and an increase in the doses is probably not required. The same concept can be applied for tigecycline with lipophilic characteristics that are minimally impacted by severe intra-abdominal infections.

Statement 26

The patient should be reassessed when the results of microbiological testing are available. Antimicrobial de-escalation or withdrawal should be considered (Recommendation 1C).

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^113Z4mTA]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to consider initiating antibiotics known to be highly nephrotoxic in patients with cirrhosis, such as vancomycin or aminoglycosides, in cases of severe infections sustained by extensively drug-resistant bacteria. Monitor serum levels of these drugs in accordance with local policy thresholds.

### Empirical aminoglycosides for peritonitis do not affect residual renal function [^111uyuvQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Aminoglycosides have been proven to be an efficacious treatment for peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients for many years. Consequently, they have been recommended in previous guidelines for the empirical treatment of peritonitis. However, with the increasing emphasis on preserving residual renal function (RRF), there has been concern about the nephrotoxic potential of these compounds. The 2000 International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) guidelines recommended that aminoglycosides not be used in patients with RRF, and that ceftazidime be used instead. In 1997, in response to the 1996 ISPD guidelines, we changed our peritonitis regimen from vancomycin and ciprofloxacin to cefazolin and gentamicin. The aim of this study is to compare the change in renal function occurring after treatment of peritonitis with and without gentamicin.

Methods

Using 6-monthly urine and dialysis clearance measurements, preperitonitis and postperitonitis RRF (mean of 24-hour urea and creatinine clearance) were determined for 70 peritonitis episodes treated with the aminoglycoside-based regimen (group A), 61 episodes treated without aminoglycosides (group B), and 74 control patients without peritonitis (group C).

Results

Group A had mean declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate and urine output of -0.08 ± 0.50 mL/min/mon and -8.82 ± 88.09 mL/24 h/mon compared with -0.17 ± 0.27 mL/min/mon and -34.68 ± 69.58 mL/24 h/mon in group B and -0.20 ± 0.39 mL/min/mon and -14.61 ± 77.33 mL/24 h/mon in group C, respectively. There were no significant differences between groups.

Conclusion

In our patients, there was no evidence of an accelerated decline in RRF when using an empirical regimen containing aminoglycosides for peritonitis. Because there are few data to contradict this finding, we recommend the continued use of these drugs in peritonitis regimens, even in patients with significant RRF.

### Ceftazidime (Tazicef) [^112m57LY]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of ceftazidime IV (also known as Fortaz, Tazicef) in patients with peritoneal dialysis:

- Reduce dose.
- Start at a dose of 500 mg. Maximal dose of 1 g. Maximal frequency of q24h.

### Treatment for peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis [^113aTdTG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Peritonitis is a common complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and is associated with significant morbidity. Adequate treatment is essential to reduce morbidity and recurrence.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of treatments for PD-associated peritonitis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE and reference lists without language restriction. Date of search: February 2005

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing the treatment of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients (adults and children) evaluating: administration of an antibiotic(s) by different routes (e.g. oral, intraperitoneal, intravenous); dose of an antibiotic agent(s); different schedules of administration of antimicrobial agents; comparisons of different regimens of antimicrobial agents; any other intervention including fibrinolytic agents, peritoneal lavage and early catheter removal were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors extracted data on study quality and outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the dichotomous results were expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI.

Main Results

We identified 36 studies (2089 patients): antimicrobial agents (30); urokinase (4), peritoneal lavage (1) intraperitoneal (IP) immunoglobulin (1). No superior antibiotic agent or combination of agents were identified. Primary response and relapse rates did not differ between IP glycopeptide-based regimens compared to first generation cephalosporin regimens, although glycopeptide regimens were more likely to achieve a complete cure (3 studies, 370 episodes: RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.58). For relapsing or persistent peritonitis, simultaneous catheter removal/replacement was superior to urokinase at reducing treatment failure rates (1 study, 37 patients: RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.91). Continuous IP and intermittent IP antibiotic dosing had similar treatment failure and relapse rates. IP antibiotics were superior to IV antibiotics in reducing treatment failure (1 study, 75 patients: RR 3.52, 95% CI 1.26 to 9.81). The methodological quality of most included studies was suboptimal and outcome definitions were often inconsistent. There were no RCTs regarding duration of antibiotics or timing of catheter removal.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on one study, IP administration of antibiotics is superior to IV dosing for treating PD peritonitis. Intermittent and continuous dosing of antibiotics are equally efficacious.

### Intraperitoneal cefepime monotherapy versus combination therapy of cefazolin plus ceftazidime for empirical treatment of CAPD-associated peritonitis: a multicenter, open-label, noninferiority, randomized, controlled trial [^115A2kPs]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Compared to combination therapy, intraperitoneal (IP) cefepime monotherapy for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)-associated peritonitis may provide potential benefits in lowering staff burden, shortening time-consuming antibiotic preparation, and reducing bag contamination risk. This study sought to evaluate whether cefepime monotherapy is noninferior to combination regimens.

Study Design

Multicenter, open-label, noninferiority, randomized, controlled trial.

Setting & Participants

Adult incident peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with CAPD-associated peritonitis in 8 PD centers in Thailand.

Interventions

Random assignment to either IP monotherapy of cefepime, 1g/d, or IP combination of cefazolin and ceftazidime, 1g/d, both given as continuous dosing.

Outcomes

Primary end point: resolution of peritonitis at day 10 (primary treatment response).

Secondary Outcomes

initial response (day 5), complete cure (relapse/recurrence-free response 28 days after treatment completion), relapsing/recurrent peritonitis, and death from any cause. Noninferiority would be confirmed for the primary outcome if the lower margin of the 1-sided 95% CI was not less than-10% for difference in the primary response rate. A 2-sided 90% CI was used to demonstrate the upper or lower border of the 1-sided 95% CI.

Results

There were 144 eligible patients with CAPD-associated peritonitis, of whom 70 and 74 patients were in the monotherapy and combination-therapy groups, respectively. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were not different between the groups. The primary response was 82.6% in the monotherapy group and 81.1% in the combination-therapy group (treatment difference, 1.5%; 90% CI, -9.1% to 12.1%; P = 0.04). There was no significant difference in the monotherapy group compared with the combination-therapy group in terms of initial response rate (65.7% vs 60.8%; treatment difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -10.8% to 20.6%; P = 0.5) and complete cure rate (80.0% vs 80.6%; treatment difference, -0.6%; 95% CI, -13.9% to 12.8%; P = 0.7). Relapsing and recurrent peritonitis occurred in 4.6% and 4.6% of the monotherapy group and 4.2% and 5.6% of the combination-therapy group (P = 0.9and P = 0.8, respectively). There was nominally higher all-cause mortality in the monotherapy group (7.1% vs 2.7%; treatment difference, 4.4%; 95% CI, -2.6% to 11.5%), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.2).

Limitation

Not double blind.

Conclusions

IP cefepime monotherapy was noninferior to conventional combination therapy for resolution of CAPD-associated peritonitis at day 10 and may be a reasonable alternative first-line treatment.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^115TxeUH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

An extensive literature review demonstrated some evidence in favour of using empirical therapy with enterococcal coverage for IAIs in the following cases: 1) immunocompromised patients or patients with hospital-acquired/post-operative cIAIs; 2) patients with cIAIs who have previously received cephalosporins and other broad-spectrum antibiotics selecting Enterococcus spp.; 3) patients with cIAIs and valvular heart disease or prosthetic intravascular material, at high risk of endocarditis. The ideal therapeutic regimen for these high-risk patients remains to be determined, but empirical therapy directed against enterococci should be considered.

Nearly all strains of E. faecalis, including some strains of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, are susceptible to ampicillin. In patients with IAIs, E. faecium is increasingly encountered, particularly in patients with hospital-acquired IAIs. In contrast to E. faecalis, nearly all strains of E. faecium are resistant to ampicillin and the growing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant strains is an area of concern, although the main clinical problem seems strictly related to BSIs. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis showed a higher mortality for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium BSIs compared with vancomycin-sensitive E. faecium BSIs (RR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.17–1.82). For patients with VanA-type vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, linezolid or daptomycin are the preferred agents. Both linezolid and daptomycin have good in vitro activity against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium although higher daily doses are needed. For VanB-type resistant strains teicoplanin should be considered the preferred drug.

What are the optimal daily doses and modality of administration of antibiotics in patients with IAIs?

19. In patients with IAIs and sepsis or septic shock, appropriate dose and administration mode of antibiotics should include: 1) proper loading dose, 2) extended or continuous infusion for beta-lactams and 3) knowledge of the peritoneal/biliary penetration rate (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

20. Beta-lactam antibiotics exhibit good penetration rate in the peritoneal exudate fluid. In critically ill patients, continuous infusion should be implemented to grant optimal PK/PD target attainment at the infection site (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

Administering adequate doses of antibiotics should be based on the intrinsic pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of each antibiotic class, the specific agent, and the specific pathophysiologic characteristics of the patient.

### Ceftazidime (Tazicef) [^1149vE3D]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)

Females: 0.85 x male value

In patients with severe infections who would normally receive 6 grams of Tazicef daily were it not for renal insufficiency, the unit dose given in the table above may be increased by 50% or the dosing frequency may be increased appropriately. Further dosing should be determined by therapeutic monitoring, severity of the infection, and susceptibility of the causative organism.

In pediatric patients as for adults, the creatinine clearance should be adjusted for body surface area or lean body mass, and the dosing frequency should be reduced in cases of renal insufficiency.

In patients undergoing hemodialysis, a loading dose of 1 gram is recommended, followed by 1 gram after each hemodialysis period.

Tazicef (ceftazidime for injection, USP) can also be used in patients undergoing intraperitoneal dialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. In such patients, a loading dose of 1 gram of Tazicef may be given, followed by 500 mg every 24 hours. In addition to IV use, Tazicef can be incorporated in the dialysis fluid at a concentration of 250 mg for 2 L of dialysis fluid.

Note: Generally, Tazicef should be continued for 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared, but in complicated infections longer therapy may be required.

### Efficacy and safety of ceftazidime-avibactam plus metronidazole versus meropenem in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infection: results from a randomized, controlled, double-blind, phase 3 program [^112DkCvN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Randomization and Masking

Patients were randomly allocated 1:1 according to a central randomization schedule, using a block size of 4, to receive either ceftazidime-avibactam (2000 mg of ceftazidime and 500 mg of avibactam as a 2-hour intravenous infusion every 8 hours), followed by metronidazole (500 mg as a 60-minute intravenous infusion every 8 hours); or meropenem (1000 mg as a 30-minute intravenous infusion every 8 hours). A double-dummy design was used, with patients receiving matching placebo as appropriate. All study treatments were administered for 5–14 days.

Patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline (estimated Cockcroft-Gault–calculated creatinine clearance [CrCl], > 30 to ≤ 50 mL/min) received a reduced dose of ceftazidime-avibactam (1000 mg of ceftazidime and 250 mg of avibactam in a 2-hour intravenous infusion every 12 hours), or meropenem 1000 mg, 30-minute infusion every 12 hours was given. No adjustment for renal impairment was necessary for metronidazole.

After ≥ 5 full days of intravenous study therapy, treatment could be discontinued if patients showed clinical improvement. If Enterococcus species or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was suspected or isolated, open-label vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin could be added to either regimen, according to the investigator's discretion. Antifungal therapy was not permitted. Study protocols were designed to minimize potential for prior use of other antibiotics that may confound assessment of the treatment effect (see). Patients receiving systemic antibacterial therapy during the 72-hour period before study entry were enrolled only if they had a new infection (with ≤ 24 hours of therapy and ≤ 1 dose administered postoperatively ≤ 6 hours after the procedure), or were considered to have failed previous treatment (with ≥ 72 hours of therapy of inadequate therapy and requirement for operative intervention). Studies were stratified by baseline disease severity, based on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (≤ 10 or > 10 to ≤ 30), and by region (North America and Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and the rest of the world).

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^111eRYXS]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

SIS guidelines on intra-abdominal infection — renal impairment dosing principles state that most antimicrobial agents do not require dosage adjustments until the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases below 60 mL/min, that the initial dosage of most antimicrobial agents should not be altered in patients with impaired renal function, and that subsequent dosing is typically adjusted according to eGFR; dosing adjustments can be expedited using therapeutic drug monitoring, for which commercial assays are commonly available for vancomycin and aminoglycosides, and therapeutic drug monitoring may be particularly valuable when GFR fluctuates during therapy.

### Plasma and intraperitoneal pharmacokinetics of ceftazidime / avibactam in peritoneal dialysis patients [^111acyyz]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Peritonitis is a serious complication in patients undergoing automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) that increases morbidity and frequently disqualifies patients from the peritoneal dialysis programme. Ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ/AVI) is a potential treatment option for APD patients with peritonitis caused by resistant Gram-negative bacteria, but limited data exist on systemic and target-site pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients undergoing APD. This study set out to investigate the PK of CAZ/AVI in plasma and peritoneal dialysate (PDS) of patients undergoing APD.

Methods

A prospective, open-label PK study was conducted on eight patients undergoing APD. CAZ/AVI was administered as a single intravenous dose of 2 g/0.5 g over 120 minutes. APD cycles were initiated 15 hours after the study drug administration. Dense PDS and plasma sampling was performed for 24 hours after the start of administration. PK parameters were analysed with population PK modelling. Probability of target attainment (PTA) was simulated for different CAZ/AVI doses.

Results

PK profiles of both drugs in plasma and PDS were similar, indicating that the two drugs are well suited for a fixed-dose combination. A two-compartment model best described the PK of both drugs. A single dose of 2 g/0.5 g CAZ/AVI led to concentrations that far exceeded the PK/PD targets of both drugs. In the Monte Carlo simulations, even the lowest dose (750/190 mg CAZ/AVI) achieved a PTA of > 90% for MICs up to 8 mg/L (The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing epidemiological cut-off value for Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in plasma and PDS.

Discussion

On the basis of PTA simulations, a dose of 750/190 mg CAZ/AVI would be sufficient to treat plasma and peritoneal fluid infections in patients undergoing APD.

Statement 25

The correct dose and correct administration of antimicrobials should include: 1) loading dose when indicated, especially in critically ill patients; 2) extended or prolonged infusion for beta-lactam antibiotics; 3) peritoneal distribution (Recommendation 2 C).

To ensure timely and effective administration of antimicrobial therapy in patients with severe infection, clinicians must consider also the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics properties of the employed antibiotics.

The "dilution effect", also known as the "third spacing phenomenon", is very important for hydrophilic agents. Higher than standard loading doses (LD) of hydrophilic agents such as beta-lactams should be administered to ensure optimal exposure at the infection site, maintaining a therapeutic threshold that considers the effects of renal function.

In patients with sepsis and septic shock, missing of LD results in an under exposure to hydrophilic antibiotics that may be critical for patients.

Once appropriate initial loading is administered, daily reassessment of the antimicrobial regimen is warranted because pathophysiological changes may significantly affect drug availability.

The mechanisms of action of antibiotics should also be taken into account in establishing the maintenance dose. Some antibiotics, including beta-lactam antibiotics, exhibit time-dependent activity and exert optimal bactericidal activity when drug concentrations are maintained above the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), whereas high peak concentrations are not beneficial. As a consequence, the more prolonged the time during which the drug levels are above the MIC value, the greater is the chance of clinical cure. In fact, prolonged or continuous infusions of beta-lactams have been proposed in order to maximize the time that the drug concentration exceeds the MIC.

However, the results obtained from clinical studies on the continuous or extended infusion of beta-lactams, including two blinded multicenter RCTs, were not conclusive. The first RCT, of 60 patients, showed that continuous infusion (CI) was associated with higher clinical cure, while the second one, of 432 patients, did not find significant differences in the clinical cure of patients receiving CI or intermittent administration of beta-lactams. This difference could be partially explained by the enrollment of patients on renal replacement therapy in the second RCT.

Study medications

The composition of the study fluids is given in Table 1. Both Bicavera ® and Balance will be available in three different glucose concentrations to meet individual ultrafiltration requirements. The fluids will be administered at a dose of approximately 1,100 ml/m 2 body surface area per dwell. Both in patients on CAPD and CCPD, the number of cycles and dwell times can be varied according to clinical needs. The dose of dialysis will be tailored individually in order to ascertain a minimum total weekly Kt/V Urea of ≥ 2.0.

Table 1

Any kind of concomitant medication during the run-in period and the study period will be documented in the case report form with respect to type, dosage and mode of delivery. In case of peritonitis (defined by cloudy effluent, white blood cell count greater than 100/mm 3 with more than 50% polymorphonuclear leukocytes), treatment will be given intraperitoneally according to international pediatric guidelines using cefazoline and ceftazidime in patients with mild peritonitis and a glycopeptide/ceftazidime combination in patients with defined risk factors for severe course and poor outcome.

Bicarbonate supplementation will be discontinued at start of the run-in period and only re-instituted if blood bicarbonate levels drop below 17 mmol/l despite sufficient dialysis efficacy. The recommended dosage is 0.5 mmol/kg/day divided into 3 doses.

### Recommended β-lactam regimens are inadequate in septic patients treated with continuous renal replacement therapy [^114H8BN8]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Reaching high target concentrations early in the course of treatment seems particularly important in severely ill patients, especially given the heterogeneous nature of these patients. In such patients, the pharmacokinetics is altered both in terms of distribution (sepsis itself can modify the V d, resuscitation measures and nutritional factors) and of elimination (drains, altered metabolism and clearance changes). The higher V d in the initial phase of sepsis has been previously described in studies on aminoglycosides and vancomycin. We recently demonstrated an increased V d and a high variability of serum antibiotic concentrations in ICU patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

Effective cure of infection in ICU patients can be compromised for other reasons. First, ICU patients are frequently immunosuppressed because of underlying diseases, treatments, or other medical interventions. Impairments in neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage functions are common in critically ill patients and may play a role in the increased risk of developing sepsis and in the severity of the infection. Secondly, bacterial loads can be particularly high; for example, in ventilator-associated pneumonia, intra-abdominal abscesses or peritonitis. Finally, resistant bacteria can be selected by prior antimicrobial treatment or through nosocomial transmission. For the above reasons, high concentration targets may be preferable in difficult-to-treat infections such as those caused by Pseudomonas spp. which are associated with the highest mortality rates.

### Ceftazidime [^112aYens]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Dosage

The usual adult dosage is 1 gram administered intravenously or intramuscularly every 8 to 12 hours. The dosage and route should be determined by the susceptibility of the causative organisms, the severity of infection, and the condition and renal function of the patient.

The guidelines for dosage of ceftazidime for injection are listed in Table 3. The following dosage schedule is recommended.

Impaired Hepatic Function

No adjustment in dosage is required for patients with hepatic dysfunction.

Impaired Renal Function

Ceftazidime is excreted by the kidneys, almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Therefore, in patients with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 50 mL/min), it is recommended that the dosage of ceftazidime be reduced to compensate for its slower excretion. In patients with suspected renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 1 gram of ceftazidime may be given. An estimate of GFR should be made to determine the appropriate maintenance dosage. The recommended dosage is presented in Table 4.

When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (Cockcroft's equation)1may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function:

In patients with severe infections who would normally receive 6 grams of ceftazidime for injection daily were it not for renal insufficiency, the unit dose given in the table above may be increased by 50% or the dosing frequency may be increased appropriately. Further dosing should be determined by therapeutic monitoring, severity of the infection, and susceptibility of the causative organism.

In pediatric patients as for adults, the creatinine clearance should be adjusted for body surface area or lean body mass, and the dosing frequency should be reduced in cases of renal insufficiency.

In patients undergoing hemodialysis, a loading dose of 1 gram is recommended, followed by 1 gram after each hemodialysis period.

Ceftazidime for injection can also be used in patients undergoing intraperitoneal dialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. In such patients, a loading dose of 1 gram of ceftazidime for injection may be given, followed by 500 mg every 24 hours. In addition to IV use, ceftazidime for injection can be incorporated in the dialysis fluid at a concentration of 250 mg for 2 L of dialysis fluid.

Note: Generally, ceftazidime for injection should be continued for 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared, but in complicated infections longer therapy may be required.

### The effects of living distantly from peritoneal dialysis units on peritonitis risk, microbiology, treatment and outcomes: a multi-centre registry study [^113qmE6j]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

A vancomycin-based regimen was more commonly used to treat peritonitis in distant patients, than those living within 100 km of their PD unit. This therapeutic decision may have been influenced by the lower probability of hospitalisation of remote patients (probably reflecting logistic considerations) and the convenience of a less frequent dosing requirement for vancomycin, which was more suited to outpatient treatment. Clinical outcomes with vancomycin-based regimens were comparable to those of cephalosporin-based regimens and superior to those of other Gram positive agents.

Indeed, the overall clinical outcomes of peritonitis episodes in patients living at least 100 km away from the nearest PD unit were comparable with those of patients residing closer to nephrologic care. When adjustments were made for differences in baseline characteristics (including an over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in remote living patients), distant patients achieved higher cures rates with antimicrobial agents alone and lower rates of catheter removal or permanent haemodialysis transfer. These findings may reflect a stronger incentive to persist with antibiotics in remote living patients rather than removing the PD catheter and transferring to haemodialysis since such an action might have significant social implications for the patient, such as relocation closer to the dialysis service and dislocation from their family and community. Nevertheless, the time to catheter removal did not differ significantly between distant and local patients.

### Cefepime versus vancomycin plus netilmicin therapy for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis [^114VgeFP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Cefepime is a cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. In this study, we attempted to compare the safety and efficacy of cefepime monotherapy against the potentially more toxic combination of vancomycin and netilmicin in the treatment of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)-associated bacterial peritonitis. Eighty-one consecutive CAPD patients who presented with peritonitis from January 1, 1998, to June 30, 2000, were recruited for study. Patients were randomized to be administered either intraperitoneal (IP) cefepime, 1 g once daily (group A), or intravenous vancomycin and netilmicin at conventional doses (group B) for 10 days. Bacterial growth was obtained in 52 episodes (66%), and pathogens identified included gram-positive organisms (30 episodes; 38%), gram-negative organisms (14 episodes; 18%), mixed organisms (2 episodes; 2.5%), and fungus (6 episodes; 8%). Eight patients were excluded after randomization for various reasons (6 patients, fungal peritonitis; 2 patients, wrong diagnoses). Because of the relatively low peritonitis rate after the use of a disconnect system, the sample size of this study was relatively small, giving a power of 0.45. There were no significant differences in primary response rates and cure rates (no relapse > 28 days after completion of antibiotic therapy) between both groups of patients (group A versus group B, 82% [32 of 39 patients] versus 85% [29 of 34 patients] and 72% [28 of 39 patients] versus 76% [26 of 34 patients], respectively; P = not significant). No significant side effect was encountered in either group. Total peritonitis-related hospitalizations were 84 patient-days (1, 7, 8, 11, 20, and 37 patient-days) and 115 patient-days (3, 6, 9, 14, 21, 21, and 41 patient-days), whereas total costs per patient cure were estimated to be US $1,039 and US $1,371 in groups A and B, respectively. We conclude that once-daily 1-g IP cefepime monotherapy is a simple, safe, and cost-effective alternative to vancomycin and netilmicin therapy in the treatment of CAPD-associated bacterial peritonitis.

### Pet-related Pasteurella multocida induced peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis: a case report and review of the literatures [^111ogbyn]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Based on the history, physical examination and laboratory results with the findings in the peritoneal dialysis fluid, a diagnosis of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis was confirmed. Besides related symptomatic treatments, the empiric antibiotic treatment was initiated with levofloxacin (0.5 g intravenously) every day, ceftazidime (0.25 g intraperitoneally) in a 3-h dwell four times every day and vancomycin (1.0 g intraperitoneally) in an 8-h dwell once at night every 5 days. Final culture of initial peritoneal effluent results indicated the organism was P. multocida, which was found to be sensitive to ampicillin/sulbactam, cefazolin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, levofloxacin, ampicillin, cefuroxime, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, meropenem, and cefoperazone/sulbactam, while in the blood there were no bacterial infections were having been found. According to the drug-sensitive test, the intravenously antibiotic treatment was switched to meropenem (0.5 g intravenously) every 12 h, with peritoneal antibiotic treatment still. After one-day treatment, the symptoms disappeared but the WBC count of peritoneal effluent was still above the normal level of the WBC counts, which reminded the infection remained existed. Therefore, Cefazidime was switched to amikacin (200 mg intraperitoneally) in a 3-h dwell four times every day and on Aug. 18th, intravenously meropenem was switched to cefoperazone/sulbactam (1.5 g intravenously) every 12 h. And for the reason that the CAPD was noneffective and the peritoneal infection was not controlled, the patient was undergone temporary hemodialysis four times every week with imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg intraperitoneally) in a 6-h dwell every day for continuing peritoneal antibiotic treatment. After 12-day antibiotic treatment, the WBC count of peritoneal effluent was not significantly improved and the peritoneal effluent was still cloudy. When it was the deadline of the ISPD guideline recommending to hemodialysis, the patient firmly refused the lasting hemodialysis and asked for a further treatment. According to the drug-sensitive results and reviewed case reports (Table 1), the patient was switched to ampicillin/sulbactam (3 g intravenously) twice every day. The WBC count of peritoneal effluent was markedly improved and the antibiotic treatment was continued until the WBC count of the peritoneal effluent was below 100 × 106/L and the PD effluent was clear, which revealed the infection was controlled (Fig. 1 b, c). During the treatment, the patient was undergone temporary hemodialysis 12 times to maintain the function of excretion. When the infection was controlled and the function of CAPD recovered, the temporary hemodialysis was stopped and the patient was returned to CAPD. The patient discharged after using ampicillin/sulbactam for 17 days and continued amoxicillin (0.25 g orally) three times a day for another 6 days. The detail key dates of altering antibiotics and methods have been listed (Table 2).

Guideline 5.1.1 – PD infectious complications: Prevention strategies

We recommend that PD units should undertake regular audit of their peritonitis and exit-site infection rates, including causative organism, treatment and outcomes. They should enter into active dialogue with their microbiology department and infection control team to develop optimal local treatment and prevention protocols (1B).

Guideline 5.1.2 – PD infectious complications: Prevention strategies

We recommend that flush-before-fill dialysis delivery systems should be used for CAPD (1A).

Guideline 5.1.3 – PD infectious complications: Prevention strategies

We recommend that patients (and/or carers or parents) should undergo regular revision of their technique (at least annually or more frequently if indicated, such as after an episode of PD-related infection or a significant interruption to the patient performing PD) and receive intensified training if this is below standard (1C).

Guideline 5.1.4 – PD infectious complications: Prevention strategies

We recommend that initial catheter insertion should be accompanied by antibiotic prophylaxis (1B).

Guideline 5.1.5 – PD infectious complications: Prevention strategies

We recommend that invasive procedures should be accompanied by antibiotic prophylaxis and emptying the abdomen of dialysis fluid for a period commensurate with the procedure (1C).

Guideline 5.1.6 – PD infectious complications: Prevention strategies

We recommend that topical antibiotic administration should be used to reduce the frequency of exit-site infection and peritonitis (1A).

Guideline 5.2 – PD: Infectious complications

Guideline 5.2.1 – PD infectious complications: Treatment

We recommend that exit site infection is suggested by pain, swelling, crusting, erythema and serous discharge; purulent discharge always indicates infection. Swabs should be taken for culture and initial empiric therapy should be with oral antibiotics that will cover S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (1B).

Guideline 5.2.2 – PD infectious complications: Treatment

We recommend that methicillin resistant organisms (MRSA) will require systemic treatment (e.g. vancomycin) and will need to comply with local infection control policies (1C).

Guideline 5.2.3 – PD infectious complications: Treatment

We recommend that initial treatment regimens for peritonitis should include cover for bacterial Gram positive and Gram negative organisms including Pseudomonas species until result of culture and antibiotic sensitivities are obtained (1C).

### Treatment of peritonitis in APD: pharmacokinetic principles [^1143Cgc4]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

Clinicians treating peritoneal dialysis (PD)-associated peritonitis should be aware that continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) and automated PD (APD) have different effects on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics. Results from various APD and comparative CAPD pharmacokinetic studies are reviewed. In APD patients, antibiotic half-lives were shorter during the cycler exchanges. Antibiotic peritoneal clearance was greater in patients treated with APD than those treated with CAPD regimens. Antibiotic clearance depends upon residual renal function and dialysate flow rate. To ensure that maximal antibiotic bioavailability occurs with intermittent intraperitoneal (IP) dosing, it is recommended that the antibiotic-containing dialysate must dwell at least 4 hours to ensure an adequate antibiotic depot in the body. Knowledge of antibiotic disposition in PD patients will assist clinicians in appropriate IP antibiotic dose selection and prevention of dose-related adverse effects.

### High pyridine generation in ceftazidime-icodextrin admixtures used to treat peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis [^111RVRzn]. Clinical Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the amount of pyridine generated from degradation of ceftazidime in icodextrin peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions.

Methods

PD solutions that contained 1 and 1.5 g of ceftazidime were stored at 25 °C for 12 hours and then at 37 °C for 14 hours. An aliquot was withdrawn at predefined time points and analyzed for the concentrations of ceftazidime and pyridine.

Findings

The amount of pyridine generated was > 225% and 400% of its maximum recommended daily exposure in the 1- and 1.5-g ceftazidime-PD admixtures, respectively.

Implications

Until these results are confirmed with appropriate in vivo studies, intermittent intraperitoneal dosing of ceftazidime admixed with icodextrin should be used with caution and appropriate clinical monitoring or a suitable alternative antibiotic should be used.

### Variation in peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis outcomes in the peritoneal dialysis outcomes and practice patterns study (PDOPPS) [^111eewAn]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-associated peritonitis is a significant PD-related complication. We describe the likelihood of cure after a peritonitis episode, exploring its association with various patient, peritonitis, and treatment characteristics.

Study Design

Observational prospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

1,631 peritonitis episodes (1,190 patients, 126 facilities) in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Exposure

Patient characteristics (demographics, patient history, laboratory values), peritonitis characteristics (organism category, concomitant exit-site infection), dialysis center characteristics (use of icodextrin and low glucose degradation product solutions, policies regarding antibiotic self-administration), and peritonitis treatment characteristics (antibiotic used).

Outcome

Cure, defined as absence of death, transfer to hemodialysis (HD), PD catheter removal, relapse, or recurrent peritonitis within 50 days of a peritonitis episode.

Analytical Approach

Mixed-effects logistic models.

Results

Overall, 65% of episodes resulted in a cure. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for cure were similar across countries (range, 54%-68%), by age, sex, dialysis vintage, and diabetes status. Compared with Gram-positive peritonitis, the odds of cure were lower for Gram-negative (AOR, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.30–0.57]), polymicrobial (AOR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.20–0.47]), and fungal (AOR, 0.01 [95% CI, 0.00–0.07]) peritonitis. Odds of cure were higher with automated PD versus continuous ambulatory PD (AOR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.02–1.82]), facility icodextrin use (AOR per 10% greater icodextrin use, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.01–1.12]), empirical aminoglycoside use (AOR, 3.95 [95% CI, 1.23–12.68]), and ciprofloxacin use versus ceftazidime use for Gram-negative peritonitis (AOR, 5.73 [95% CI, 1.07–30.61]). Prior peritonitis episodes (AOR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.74–0.99]) and concomitant exit-site infection (AOR, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.26–0.64]) were associated with a lower odds of cure.

Limitations

Sample selection may be biased and generalizability may be limited. Residual confounding and confounding by indication limit inferences. Use of facility-level treatment variables may not capture patient-level treatments.

Conclusions

Outcomes after peritonitis vary by patient characteristics, peritonitis characteristics, and modifiable peritonitis treatment practices. Differences in the odds of cure across infecting organisms and antibiotic regimens suggest that organism-specific treatment considerations warrant further investigation.

Clinical patient's severity

This choice of the antimicrobial regimen poses serious problems for the management of critically ill patients. In patients with severe sepsis or septic shock an early correct empirical antimicrobial therapy has a significant impact on the outcome, independently by the site of infection.

This data confirm the results of Riché and coll. who demonstrated, in a prospective observational study involving 180 consecutive patients with secondary generalized peritonitis, a significantly higher mortality rate in septic shock (35 versus 8% for patients without shock).

Recent international guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock (Surviving Sepsis Campaign) recommend intravenous antibiotics within the first hour after severe sepsis and septic shock are recognized, use of broad-spectrum agents with good penetration into the presumed site of infection, and reassessment of the antimicrobial regimen daily to optimize efficacy, prevent resistance, avoid toxicity and minimize costs. Full adherence to these recommendations requires that clinicians, in order to optimize antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients, be aware that it is not sufficient to make the correct choice on the basis of the anti-biogram or of a correct epidemiological evaluation of risk factor for microorganisms and resistance patterns, but it is also mandatory to implement timely administration of the right dose on the right schedule, according to the pathophysiological and immunological status of the patient and to the pharmacokinetics properties of the chosen drugs.

This concept is correct not only from a clinical point of view; in fact sub-optimal plasma levels of antimicrobials and/or suboptimal exposure to antimicrobials in the infection site represent the best condition to favor the emergence of resistant strains, with a consequent higher probability of therapeutic failure and increased human and social costs.

For example, in critically ill patients, higher-than-standard loading doses of b-lactams, aminoglycosides or glycopeptides should be administered to ensure optimal exposure at the infection site independently of the patient's renal function.

For lipophilic antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines, the 'dilution effect' in the extracellular fluids during severe sepsis may be mitigated by the rapid redistribution of the drug from the intracellular compartment to the interstitium. In contrast to what happens with hydrophilic antimicrobials, standard dosages of lipophilic antimicrobials may frequently ensure adequate loading even in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

However its routine should only be considered based on local resistance patterns and outcomes. (+++ Evidence, Strong recommendation).

Once initial loading is achieved, it is recommended that clinicians reassess the antimicrobial regimen daily, given that pathophysiological changes may occur that significantly alter drug disposition in critically ill patients.

Lower-than-standard dosages of renally excreted drugs must be administered in the presence of impaired renal function, while higher-than-standard dosages of renally excreted drugs may be required for optimal exposure in patients with glomerular hyperfiltration.

Table 2 overviews recommended dosing regimens of the most commonly used renally excreted antimicrobials.

Table 2
Recommended dosing regimens (according to renal function) of the most commonly used renally excreted antimicrobials

The therapeutic approach undertaken by clinicians must take into account the activity of employed antimicrobials.

Antibiotics such as quinolones, daptomycin, tigecycline, aminoglycosides, polienes, and echinocandins exhibit concentration-dependent activity; as such, the dose should be administered in a once-a-day manner (or with the lowest possible daily administrations) in order to achieve zenithal plasma levels.

Beta-lactams, glycopeptides, oxazolidinones, and azoles exhibit time-dependent activity and exert optimal bactericidal activity when drug concentrations are maintained above the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC).

The efficacy of time-dependent antibacterial agents in severely ill patients is related primarily to the maintenance of supra-inhibitory concentrations, and therefore multiple daily dosing may be appropriate.

For these drugs, continuous intravenous infusion ensures the highest steady-state concentration under the same dosage constraints and may therefore be the most effective means of maximizing pharmacodynamic exposure.

For patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections (CA-IAIs), agents with a narrower spectrum of activity are preferred. However, if CA-IAI patients have prior exposure to antibiotics or serious comorbidities requiring concurrent antibioitic therapy, anti-ESBL-producer converage may be warranted. By contrast, for patients with healthcare-associated infections, antimicrobial regimens with broader spectra of activity are preferred (Recommendation 1B).

Antibiotic stewardship — alternative dosing strategies based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) principles for hospitalized patients on broad-spectrum β-lactams and vancomycin are addressed as follows: "In hospitalized patients, we suggest ASPs advocate for the use of alternative dosing strategies vs standard dosing for broad-spectrum β-lactams to decrease costs (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence)", and "Considering the limited evidence, we cannot give any recommendation about the utility of alternative dosing strategies for vancomycin". For β-lactams, "one meta-analysis showed decreased mortality (risk ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, .41–.83) among patients receiving continuous infusions of carbapenems or piperacillin-tazobactam vs standard infusions", though "This meta-analysis included 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that comprised only 25% of the patient outcomes analyzed". In contrast, "another meta-analysis that included 14 RCTs did not support improved outcomes" and "A Cochrane review [104] and a recent randomized trial [105] in critically ill patients of continuous infusions of β-lactam antibiotics compared with standard intermittent dosing also did not demonstrate benefits in outcome". For vancomycin, "continuous infusion has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes in adults but has been associated with decreased nephrotoxicity in a meta-analysis", and in children continuous infusion "has been associated with fewer adverse effects and no nephrotoxicity". Cost data indicate that "Alternative dosing strategies for β-lactam antibiotics [108] and vancomycin [109] were associated with significantly lower costs than intermittent infusions in randomized studies".

### Initial treatment of peritoneal dialysis peritonitis without vancomycin with a once-daily cefazolin-based regimen [^1139sXqS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

To reduce the use of vancomycin, the current recommendations of the International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) for the initial treatment of peritonitis complicating PD are to administer intraperitoneal (IP) cefazolin or cephalothin in every PD fluid bag, together with once-daily gentamicin. In view of the inherent impracticalities of this regimen, we studied the efficacy of once-daily cefazolin (1.5 g) IP with gentamicin IP as initial treatment for primary (nonrecurrent) PD peritonitis. This regimen has been used in all episodes of peritonitis not associated with tunnel or exit-site infections or fluid leaks. Sixty-nine episodes in 61 patients were analyzed (44 patients, continuous ambulatory PD; 22 patients, automated PD; and 3 patients, hospital-based intermittent PD), of which 38 episodes (55%) were gram-positive infections, 6 episodes (9%) were gram-negative infections, and 18 episodes (26%) had negative culture results. Four patients died within 4 weeks of infection (none considered attributable to inadequate treatment of their peritonitis). Ten catheters (14.5%) required removal to clear the infection; 7 catheters were in patients with gram-negative infections. The relapse rate within 4 weeks of ceasing antibiotic therapy was 8.9%. Compared with the results of 40 episodes of peritonitis treated initially with our previous IP vancomycin and gentamicin regimen, successful treatment (no death, catheter removal, or recurrence) was achieved in 52 of 69 episodes in the cefazolin group (75.4%) versus 23 of 40 episodes in the vancomycin group (57.5%; P: = 0.058). In conclusion, once-daily IP cefazolin and gentamicin for the initial treatment of PD peritonitis is at least as effective as a vancomycin-based regimen and is well tolerated.

### Linking clinical manifestations and causative organisms may provide clues for the treatment of peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis [^115JeoyK]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

PDAP is a common complication of peritoneal dialysis, and it is the main cause of PD-related technical failure, even leading to death. Few studies have explored the relationship between the clinical manifestations of PDAP and related vancomycin sensitivity.

The ISPD guidelines recommend that gram-positive organisms be covered by a first-generation cephalosporin or vancomycin and that gram-negative organisms be covered by a third-generation cephalosporin or aminoglycoside. We found that cloudy dialysis effluent, as the only clinical manifestation at the onset of PDAP, is an independent indicator of vancomycin-sensitive peritonitis with high specificity, which indicates that vancomycin may be chosen as monotherapy for initial management of PDAP patients with only cloudy dialysis effluent as the initial manifestation.

As documented by this and previous studies, approximately 20–30% of patients are without abdominal pain when peritonitis occurs; if vancomycin could be chosen as the initial treatment for these patients, a substantial percentage of patients could avoid gram-negative antibiotics. Therefore, this strength could theoretically decrease the occurrence of fungal peritonitis and reduce treatment costs.

### Cefazolin plus netilmicin versus cefazolin plus ceftazidime for treating CAPD peritonitis: effect on residual renal function [^116DJkfu]. Kidney International (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

BACKGROUND. The International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) treatment guidelines for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) peritonitis 2000 recommended the use of cefazolin plus ceftazidime as the initial empirical therapy in patients with residual renal function (RRF). However, this treatment regimen has not been compared with the conventional regimen of cefazolin plus netilmicin in prospective, randomized controlled trials.

Methods

Stable CAPD patients who developed clinical evidence of peritonitis were randomized to receive intraperitoneal (i.p.) cefazolin plus netilmicin or cefazolin plus ceftazidime once daily in the long dwell for 14 days. For patients with RRF (> 1 mL/minute) before entry into the study (N = 50), RRF and 24-hour urine volume were measured at days 1, 14, and 42 after commencement of i.p. antibiotic treatment.

Results

One hundred and two patients were recruited into the study. The primary cure rates of i.p. cefazolin plus netilmicin and cefazolin plus ceftazidime were 66.7% and 64.7%, respectively. The overall cure rate for the 2 treatment regimens was 82.3% for both. Seven patients (14%) from each treatment group required removal of the dialysis catheters due to treatment failure. Relapse of peritonitis occurred in 2 patients (4%) in both treatment groups. Thirty-six patients with RRF at baseline achieved primary cure of their peritonitis by the assigned antibiotics. In this subgroup of patients, their RRF and daily urine volume showed significant reduction at day 14 and returned to near baseline values at day 42. The degree of reduction in RRF and urine volume did not differ significantly between the patients treated with cefazolin plus netilmicin and cefazolin plus ceftazidime.

Conclusion

Intraperitoneal cefazolin plus netilmicin and cefazolin plus ceftazidime have similar efficacy as empirical treatment for CAPD peritonitis. In CAPD patients with RRF, significant but reversible reduction in RRF and 24-hour urine volume could occur after an episode of peritonitis, despite successful treatment by i.p. antibiotics. The effect of i.p. cefazolin plus netilmicin, or i.p. cefazolin plus ceftazidime on RRF in CAPD patients with peritonitis does not appear to be different. Our findings do not support the routine use of cefazolin and ceftazidime as the empirical treatment for CAPD peritonitis.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes between culture-negative and positive peritonitis in patients undergoing maintenance peritoneal dialysis: a prospective cohort study [^111J83To]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Due to the absence of established protocols for the PDF culture technique at our center so the selection of the PD collection and culture technique was at the discretion of the attending physicians and nurses. It is important to note that PD specimen collection for culture was the responsibility of the nurse working at the specific location who is not necessarily the PD nurse.

At our center, the treatment of PD-associated peritonitis follows the recommendations set out in the ISPD guidelines. Initial empirical antibiotic coverage includes a combination of first-generation cephalosporin or vancomycin and third-generation cephalosporin or aminoglycoside. The antibiotic regimen is adjusted based on sensitivity and culture data. For culture-negative peritonitis that responds promptly to antibiotics, treatment with a first-generation cephalosporin or vancomycin is continued for 2 weeks. Discontinuation of a third-generation cephalosporin or aminoglycoside is at the discretion of the attending physician. However, if culture-negative peritonitis does not improve after antibiotic treatment and repeated peritoneal fluid culture remains negative, the PD catheter is removed and intravenous antibiotics are administered for 2 weeks. In cases of fungal peritonitis, we will remove the peritoneal catheter and administer systemic antifungal therapy based on the infecting organism. For patients who do not appear septic or have logistical difficulties, antibiotics are administered intraperitoneally.

### Linking clinical manifestations and causative organisms may provide clues for the treatment of peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis [^116NzsEh]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The ISPD guidelines suggest empiric use of first-generation cephalosporin or vancomycin to treat gram-positive bacteria at the onset of PDAP. However, a number of studies have shown that cefazolin is not suitable as an initial therapy for gram-positive bacteria. Vancomycin is a tricyclic glycopeptide antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive bacteria. It is effective for the treatment of gram-positive infections, including peritonitis, and is the choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The ISPD guidelines recommend that vancomycin should be considered in centers with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant organisms. As reported in a previous study, the number of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus species has substantially increased. A study also showed that, based on in vitro susceptibility data, 25.5% (128/501) of the isolates were resistant to empirical therapy consisting of cefazolin plus tobramycin. Further analysis from this study revealed that 87.6% (439/501) of patients with new episodes of PDAP were susceptible to therapy with vancomycin plus tobramycin. In our study, except for a single case of Enterococcus gallinarum that was naturally resistant to vancomycin in the PDAP-cloudy group, all of the gram-positive bacteria were sensitive to vancomycin, including gram-positive bacilli species (Lactobacillus, Corynebacterium, and Bacillus cereus). Enterococcus gallinarum is rare, and it should be noted that this species is resistant to vancomycin, whereas all the cephalosporin and empiric initial antibiotic regimens suggested by the ISPD guidelines cannot cover.

### Relapsing peritonitis in children who undergo chronic peritoneal dialysis: a prospective study of the international pediatric peritonitis registry [^113xE1TR]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The International Pediatric Peritonitis Registry (IPPR) was established to collect prospective data regarding peritoneal dialysis (PD)-associated peritonitis in children. In this report, we present the IPPR results that pertain to relapsing peritonitis (RP).

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This was an online, prospective entry into the IPPR of data that pertain to peritonitis cases by participating centers.

Results

Of 490 episodes of nonfungal peritonitis, 52 (11%) were followed by a relapse. There was no significant difference between RP and non-RP in distribution of causative organisms and antibiotic sensitivities. Initial empiric therapy-ceftazidime with either first-generation cephalosporin or glycopeptide (vancomycin or teicoplanin)-was not associated with relapse. Switching to monotherapy with a first-generation cephalosporin on the basis of culture results was associated with higher relapse rate (23%) than other final antibiotic therapies (0 to 9%). Culture-negative RP was less likely to have a satisfactory early treatment response than non-RP (82 versus 98%). Young age, single-cuff catheter, downward-pointing exit site, and chronic systemic antibiotic prophylaxis were additional independent risk factors for RP in the multivariate analysis. Compared with non-RP, RP was associated with a lower rate of full functional recovery (73 versus 91%), higher ultrafiltration problems (14 versus 2%), and higher rate of permanent PD discontinuation (17 versus 7%).

Conclusions

This is the largest multicenter, prospective study to date to examine RP in children. In addition, this is the first report in the literature to examine specifically the relationship of postempiric antibiotic treatment regimens to the subsequent risk for relapse.

### Intraperitoneal ampicillin treatment for peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis with Listeria monocytogenes-a case report [^113HgoxW]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Therefore, because determining a clear generalized recommendation for the dosage of intraperitoneal ampicillin does not appear to be possible, the dosage for these patients must be determined individually in the context of peritonitis and diuresis. For this purpose, the determination of serum concentrations of ampicillin can be helpful and is recommended.

In this case, adequate serum levels of ampicillin were achieved even when ampicillin was administered intraperitoneally only intermittently for 12 h, and this method of administration also effectively reduced the leukocyte count in the PD effluent. The current ISPD guideline contains no recommendation for intermittent administration of ampicillin, unlike vancomycin or gentamicin; instead, the guideline recommends a maintenance dose administered continuously in all dialysate exchanges.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of a case of PD-related peritonitis with L. monocytogenes for which serum ampicillin concentrations were monitored for both intravenous and intraperitoneal administration. Even though serum concentrations of ampicillin were clearly sufficient with intravenous administration alone, a permanent reduction of the leukocyte count in the PD effluent was achieved only by combined intravenous and intraperitoneal administration of ampicillin. Adequate serum ampicillin concentrations were also achieved with intraperitoneal application alone. Thus, the ampicillin concentrations reported here provide a good indication of the dosage of intraperitoneal ampicillin to be used to treat PD-related peritonitis. However, pharmacokinetic studies are necessary for a more detailed therapy recommendation.

Peritonitis with L. monocytogenes is a serious complication of PD. Recent guidelines provide only an imprecise therapy recommendation regarding the choice of antibiotic, the dosage, and the route of application. This report presents the first case of intraperitoneal treatment of PD-related peritonitis for which serum concentrations of ampicillin were determined.

We found that intraperitoneal administration of ampicillin at the site of infection produced a sufficiently high systemic concentration of the drug, whereas intravenous administration did not adequately treat peritonitis even with very high serum levels of ampicillin. Pharmacokinetic studies are needed for specifying therapy recommendations.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^115DP8fS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Once appropriate initial loading is achieved, daily reassessment of the antimicrobial regimen is warranted, because the pathophysiological changes that may occur could significantly affect drug disposition in the critically ill patients.

Conversely, it is less evident that higher than standard dosages of renally excreted drugs may be needed for optimal exposure in patients with glomerular hyperfiltration.

Therefore, selecting higher dosages and/or alternative dosing regimens focused on maximizing the pharmacodynamics of antimicrobials might be worthwhile, with the intent being to increase clinical cure rates among critically ill patients.

Indeed, different approaches should be pursued according to the mechanism of antimicrobial activity exhibited by each antimicrobial. Two patterns of bactericidal activity have been identified: time-dependent activity (where the time that the plasma concentration persists above the MIC of the etiological agent is considered the major determinant for efficacy) and concentration-dependent activity (where the efficacy is mainly related to the plasma peak concentration in relation to the MIC of the microorganism). In addition, these agents show an associated concentration-dependent post-antibiotic effect, and bactericidal action continues for a period of time after the antibiotic level falls below the MIC.

Beta-lactams, glycopeptides, oxazolidinones, and azoles exhibit time-dependent activity: the shorter the drug elimination half-life, the more frequent the daily dose fractioning must be. For these drugs the employ of intravenous continuous infusion, which ensures the highest steady-state concentration under the same total daily dosage, may be the most effective way of maximizing pharmacodynamic exposure.

On the other hand, quinolones, daptomycin, tigecycline, aminoglycosides, polienes and echionocandins exhibit concentration-dependent activity; therefore the entire daily dose should be administered in a once daily way (or with the lowest possible number of daily administrations) with the intent of achieving the highest peak plasma level.

Perioperative considerations for laparoscopic peritoneal dialysis (PD) access advise that presurgical assessment should include thorough examination for hernias and the catheter exit site should be marked before surgery (+ Evidence, Weak recommendation). A need for preoperative bowel preparation has not been conclusively demonstrated and further evidence is needed before a recommendation can be provided. Prophylactic antibiotics should be used prior to laparoscopic insertion of PD catheter, and vancomycin may be superior to first generation cephalosporins in minimizing early peritonitis after PD insertion but local resistance patterns should be also considered when choosing the preoperative antibiotic (+++ Evidence, Strong recommendation).

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^114CNEvA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

When treating abdominal sepsis, clinicians must be aware that drug pharmacokinetics may significantly vary between patients due to the changeable pathophysiology of sepsis and must also consider the pathophysiological and immunological status of the patient.

The "dilution effect", also called as "third spacing" phenomenon, must be considered when administering the loading dose of hydrophilic antibacterial agents such as beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and glycopeptides, which distribution is limited to the extracellular space. Otherwise, the dilution effect may cause underexposure at the infection site, namely in the peritoneal fluid, and may cause treatment failure and/or resistance development.

Generally, to ensure prompt achievement of adequate therapeutically effective drug exposure at the infection site in patients with sepsis or with septic shock the loading dose of beta-lactams or glycopeptides should be 1.5-fold higher than the standard one used in clinically stable patients. Afterwards, the maintenance doses should be based on the degree of the patient's renal function and should be reassessed daily, because the changeable pathophysiological conditions of the critically ill patients may significantly affect drug disposition. Maintenance doses of renally excreted drugs must be decreased in patients with impaired renal function and must be increased in patients with augmented renal clearance (a creatinine clearance > 130 mL/min). Serum creatinine is an unreliable marker of renal function in critically ill patients. Urinary creatinine clearance should be measured to properly assess the renal function.

Clinical outcomes of anaerobic PD peritonitis

Table 3 displays the outcomes of patients with anaerobic PD peritonitis. For the first-line antibiotics, intraperitoneal cefazolin/ceftazidime was used in 5 episodes, while intraperitoneal cefazolin/tobramycin was used in 3 episodes (all before 1998). Two patients were given intravenous vancomycin/meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin with amphotericin B to cover potential nosocomial pathogens. A primary response was achieved in 5 episodes, and a secondary response occurred after antibiotic switching, from intraperitoneal cefazolin/ceftazidime to ceftazidime/amikacin or gentamicin in 3 episodes. Tenckhoff catheter removal was necessary in 2 patients because of refractory peritonitis, even under intravenous vancomycin/meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin. One patient was later switched to hemodialysis, and the other died of intestinal perforation 1 month later, considering that surgical intervention was unsuitable because of the patient's poor condition. Those who responded to antibiotics were maintained on antibiotics for a total of 14 days. There was no relapse or repeat peritonitis after anaerobic PD peritonitis episodes.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on peritoneal dialysis in adults and children [^115CboaV]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

The International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) has developed a simple scoring system for exit site signs and symptoms which is easy to use and gives guidance on when to treat immediately rather than waiting for a swab result. Purulent discharge is an absolute indicator for antibiotic treatment.

The ISPD has become less dogmatic about the initial choice of antibiotic treatment for peritonitis, provided that gram positive and negative infections are covered. It is recognised that patterns of resistance vary considerably and thus a local policy must be developed. Studies do not currently demonstrate a favoured regime. For exit site infections the presence of a tunnel infection should be recognised as it may require more aggressive management. We concur with the ISPD guidelines that suggest suitable antibiotic dosing regimens, including options for intermittent and continuous dosing of intraperitoneal antibiotics. We also note their comment that infections from Gram negative organisms are more likely to lead to refractory or recurrent peritonitis. A single study suggested that treating Gram negative peritonitis with 2 appropriate antibiotics might be associated with better outcomes. It is also important to be aware of the potential for impaired absorption of oral antibiotics in some situations, e.g. co-prescription of ciprofloxacin with some phosphate binders.

We would emphasise the ISPD guidelines that it is important that timely PD catheter removal is undertaken in refractory PD peritonitis. PD catheter removal or swap is also required in refractory exit site infections, and may be required earlier where there is a Pseudomonas infection or associated tunnel infection, which can be confirmed by ultrasound imaging.

There will be a lower threshold in paediatrics for admission for IV antibiotics (at least for first 48 h), especially in infants and small children where oral antibiotics commonly cause diarrhoea/feed intolerance.

### Intraperitoneal ampicillin treatment for peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis with Listeria monocytogenes-a case report [^113eaLo7]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an established method of renal replacement therapy. PD-related peritonitis is a rare but serious complication and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates. In addition, each instance of peritonitis reduces the transport capacity of the peritoneum and eventually limits the effectiveness of dialysis.

PD-related peritonitis is most commonly caused by gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus aureus, but infection with Listeria monocytogenes may also occur. Antibiotics used to treat peritonitis may be administered intravenously, orally, or intraperitoneally, but intraperitoneal administration is preferred to ensure maximal antibiotic concentrations at the site of infection. Recommendations of antibiotic therapy for Listeria infection are currently based on a small number of case reports and suggest the administration of ampicillin. But, unlike vancomycin or gentamicin, for ampicillin the route of application, dosage, and duration of treatment have not yet been established. We report a case of PD-associated peritonitis due to L. monocytogenes infection that was managed with ampicillin administered intravenously and intraperitoneally, separately and in combination.

### Vancomycin dosing strategy for the treatment of peritonitis in a child on automated peritoneal dialysis: a first pediatric case report [^115VUeD8]. Seminars in Dialysis (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacterial peritonitis is a common complication of peritoneal dialysis. In the absence of systemic signs of infection, adult guidelines recommend treatment with intraperitoneal vancomycin either as empiric coverage of gram-positive organisms or as targeted therapy. However, there is no guidance on how to administer vancomycin in children on automated peritoneal dialysis.

Case Report

We report vancomycin pharmacokinetics upon intraperitoneal administration for the treatment of a Staphylococcus hominis peritonitis in an 11-year-old patient on automated nocturnal intermittent peritoneal dialysis. While the patient was hospitalized, vancomycin was administered intraperitoneally as a continuous treatment. After hospital discharge, the nocturnal peritoneal dialysis was resumed. In the absence of treatment guidelines, intraperitoneal vancomycin was initially administered empirically only during the nocturnal dialysis exchanges which led to repetitive subtherapeutic vancomycin plasma concentrations and the persistence of S. hominis in dialysate cultures. Based on studies in adults, the dosing strategy was subsequently modified to administer vancomycin at a dosage of 15mgkg -1 in the dialysate with a 6-h dwell period prior to the nocturnal dialysis thereby allowing to reach optimal peak concentrations. The dosing interval was subsequently individualized using therapeutic drug monitoring to ensure residual vancomycin concentrations > 10mgL -1 thereby leading to clinical and microbiological recovery.

Conclusions

This case presents a dosing strategy based on a comprehensive review of the literature and highlights that a sufficient dwell period is critical when treating pediatric patients on automated peritoneal dialysis in order to allow vancomycin distribution and equilibration between the dialysate and the plasma.

### Vancomycin and daptomycin dosing recommendations in patients receiving home hemodialysis using monte carlo simulation [^115a1DRL]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Home hemodialysis (HHD) offers a more flexible and convenient dialysis schedule for patients to treat their end stage kidney disease (ESKD), compared to in-center hemodialysis with its rigid thrice-weekly schedule. HHD also allows individualized dialysis delivery with more frequent and/or longer session to meet patient's solute and fluid control needs. Studies report that HHD is associated with improved survival, cardiovascular outcomes, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Despite increasing perception of these clinical and lifestyle benefits, HHD is underutilized in the United States. Between 2009 and 2019, the percentage of patients receiving home dialysis (peritoneal dialysis and HHD) only increased from 1.2% to 1.9%. In 2019, only 0.3% of patients who initiate dialysis started with HHD.

### Linking clinical manifestations and causative organisms may provide clues for the treatment of peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis [^116k9Lyg]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Most importantly, by such grouping, our study revealed that the PDAP cloudy group is an independent factor for predicting vancomycin sensitivity with 98.48% specificity and potentially the possibility of vancomycin monotherapy at the initiation of PDAP for patients who present with only cloudy effluent.

It should be noted that for PD center using cefazolin as the initial peritonitis treatment regimen, the approach raising by this study may increase the exposure to vancomycin and perhaps increase the likelihood of vancomycin-resistant organisms. On the other hand, some patients have poorly characterized initial presentation, therefore, in these patients, it is recommended to follow the ISPD guidelines for the treatment of patients who have difficulty in determining the initial manifestations of the disease.

The strengths of this study include the first link between clinical manifestations and the causative organism and vancomycin sensitivity; therefore, vancomycin monotherapy is a potential treatment for some PDAP patients. Despite these strengths, the study had several limitations, including its retrospective design, possible classification bias and small sample size. Moreover, it should be noted that the sensitivity the PDAP cloudy group is an independent factor for predicting vancomycin sensitivity is low as only 30.2%, suggesting many vancomycin-sensitive cases would be missed if this criterion was used alone to guide treatment.

In summary, our study established a relationship between the clinical manifestations of PDAP at onset and the effectiveness of vancomycin antibiotic therapy. Cloudy dialysate, the only symptom at PDAP onset, is an independent predictor of vancomycin-sensitive PDAP, with a specificity of 98.48%, which may be an important new insight that can guide the choice of vancomycin as an initial monotherapy antibiotic for this subgroup of patients with peritonitis. However, prospective randomized controlled studies are required to confirm these findings.

### Linking clinical manifestations and causative organisms may provide clues for the treatment of peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis [^1167zZRb]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an effective renal replacement therapy for the treatment of end-stage renal disease. However, PD-associated peritonitis (PDAP) is a serious complication that is the greatest contributor to infection-related morbidity, including the risk of hospitalization, temporary or permanent transfer to hemodialysis and mortality. Timely and effective treatment of PDAP is essential.

A precise etiological diagnosis and early targeted antibiotic therapy are highly desirable. However, the causative organisms are difficult to determine at the time of initial diagnosis of peritonitis. Consequently, ISPD recommends that gram-positive organisms be covered by a first-generation cephalosporin or vancomycin and that gram-negative organisms be covered by a third-generation cephalosporin or an aminoglycoside. However, broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage increases the possibility of secondary infections such as fungal peritonitis episodes and potential problems (including drug interactions and the emergence of resistant strains) with fungal prophylaxis treatment.

According to a previous study, the most common germs causing PDAP were gram-positive, including coagulase-negative staphylococci, which are the most frequent cause of PDAP in many centers, with an oxacillin resistance rate of 69.6%. Theoretically, vancomycin is a tricyclic glycopeptide antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive bacteria. It is effective for the treatment of gram-positive peritonitis, including that caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. In addition to cephazolin, which can only cover some coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains, vancomycin can also cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The use of vancomycin as the first treatment for gram-positive peritonitis was found to be an independent predictor of resolution. However, identifying how to treat PDAP with vancomycin alone is a challenge.

In practice, a substantial percentage of peritonitis patients present with only cloudy effluent, without abdominal pain or fever. This manifestation is always linked to gram-positive organisms, including coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. We hypothesized that certain clinical manifestations could be indicators for initial vancomycin monotherapy.

Therefore, In the present study, we analyzed the initial clinical manifestations of culture-positive PDAP, including patients who presented with only cloudy effluent and patients who presented with cloudy effluent, abdominal pain and/or fever. We linked the clinical characteristics of peritonitis to the susceptibility of the causative organism to vancomycin and investigated the possibility of using vancomycin monotherapy as an initial treatment regimen for some patients with PDAP to avoid unnecessary antibiotic exposure and secondary infection.

### Peritoneal dialysis related peritonitis: insights from a long-term analysis of an Italian center [^116JWucp]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the previous drawbacks, the paper includes long-term follow-up of a relatively large and unselected PD cohort with data collection performed trough the support of an electronic database. In summary, our study adds additional evidence to some relevant aspects concerning PD-associated peritonitis. Although representing the main cause of HD transfer and a potentially severe complication, more than 50% of incident PD patients will never experience peritonitis. Furthermore, entities such as relapsing, recurrent and enteric peritonitis carry a worse outcome than generic peritonitis. Thus, these episodes should be promptly addressed and aggressively treated. Conversely, culture-negative peritonitis showed a better prognosis as compared to positive-culture episodes. However, aiming at the prevention of microbial resistances, the reduction of culture-negative cases is necessary to minimize patient exposure to empiric therapy with multiple antibiotics. In our experience first-line empirical antibiotic therapy, constituted by intraperitoneal cefazolin in association with tobramycin, was effective in almost 65% of the cases. Nevertheless, the efficacy of this regimen was unsatisfactory in Gram-negative microorganisms requiring further microbiological sensitivities investigations as well as pharmacokinetic evaluation.

In conclusion, the use of standardized definitions followed by a defined protocols for peritonitis treatment based on the sources of the bacteria involved may enhance clinical practice and allows comparative studies.

Continuous infusion of ceftazidime (4.5 g/day) was also associated with a higher peritoneal AUC at day 2 compared to bolus dosing (1.5 g tid) in surgical patients with peritonitis (522 mg × hour/L vs. 316 mg × hour/L; P = 0.01), despite similar serum AUC (and Cr Cl > 30 mL/minute). Therefore, although serum T > 4 × MIC was > 90% in all patients, peritoneal T > 4 × MIC was still > 90% with continuous infusion but only 44% with bolus dosing. Nevertheless, no difference in mortality was noted (25% vs. 33%; P = 1.0). A PD model of ceftazidime in ICU patients also showed higher PTA with continuous infusion (100% for MIC ≤ 8 mg/L) than with bolus dosing.

Ceftazidime concentration in bronchial secretions was measured in four studies of VAP patients. Very low concentrations, < 0.5 mg/L and < 0.3 mg/L, were found in two of them. Bressole et al. found a higher ratio between bronchial secretions and plasma concentration (0.76) in patients infected after abdominal surgery. A longer T 1/2 (6.1 hours) and a lower Cl (4.2 L/hour) may explain some of these differences. With continuous infusion, a ratio of 0.21 between ELF and serum was observed.

Distribution and vancomycin susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria

Of the 162 peritonitis who had a positive bacterial culture of PD effluent, 30 episodes of peritonitis were in the PDAP-cloudy group, and 132 episodes of peritonitis were in the PDAP-multi group. The comparison of the two groups is presented in Supplement Table 1.

The results of peritoneal effluent culture and vancomycin susceptibility testing are presented in Table 2. Thirty (100%) peritonitis in the PDAP-cloudy group were positive for gram-positive bacteria, which was significantly greater than that in the PDAP-multi group (51.5%) (P < 0.001).

Twenty-nine (96.7%) peritonitis in the PDAP-cloudy group were susceptible to vancomycin, compared to 67 (50.8%) in the PDAP-multi group (P < 0.001) (Fig. 2). Only one patient (3.3%) in the PDAP-cloudy group experienced vancomycin-resistant peritonitis caused by Enterococcus gallinarum, which could neither be covered by vancomycin nor by the initial antibiotic regimen recommended by the current ISPD guidelines.

### Expanded-spectrum β-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae-related peritonitis in a patient on peritoneal dialysis [^114qUHtX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

While hospitalized for pneumonia with ventilator-dependent respiratory failure, a 45-year-old man on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) had nosocomial peritonitis secondary to infection by expanded spectrum beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-Kp). He was treated successfully with a 3-week course of intraperitoneal (IP) flomoxef therapy without subsequent relapse, loss of peritoneal catheter, ultrafiltration failure, or dialysis inadequacy. The International Consensus Panel recommends IP ceftazidime as the treatment of choice for CAPD patients suffering Klebsiella species-related peritonitis. However, the most appropriate form of IP antibiotic therapy and the outcomes for expanded-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria-related peritonitis for CAPD patients have not been established yet. Further, the ability to correctly report minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftazidime for ESBL bacteria in the resistant range varies between laboratories, making the diagnosis of ESBL-Kp-related CAPD peritonitis more complex and difficult. Thus, it appears reasonable to suggest that its incidence is probably underestimated and its significance ignored. The authors suggest that a 3-week IP treatment with flomoxef, a synthesized oxacephem, with loading and maintenance doses of 250 and 125 mg/L, respectively, is effective and safe for ESBL-Kp-related peritonitis in these patients. ESBL producing bacterial infection should be considered as a possible cause of overt CAPD-related peritonitis. Early detection of ESBLB pathogens and institution of effective antibiotic treatment may improve the prognosis.

### Peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis [^115Q4Cb8]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Peritonitis is a common and severe complication in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Detailed recommendations on the prevention and treatment of PD-associated peritonitis have been published by the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD), but there is a substantial variation in clinical practice among dialysis units. Prophylactic antibiotics administered before PD catheter insertion, colonoscopy, or invasive gynecologic procedures, daily topical application of antibiotic cream or ointment to the catheter exit site, and prompt treatment of exit site or catheter infection are key measures to prevent PD-associated peritonitis. When a patient on PD presents with clinical features compatible with PD-associated peritonitis, empirical antibiotic therapy, with coverage of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas species), should be started once the appropriate microbiologic specimens have been obtained. Intraperitoneal is the preferred route of administration. Antifungal prophylaxis, preferably oral nystatin, should be added to prevent secondary fungal peritonitis. Once the PD effluent Gram stain or culture and sensitivity results are available, antibiotic therapy can be adjusted accordingly. A detailed description on the dosage of individual antibiotic can be found in the latest recommendations by the ISPD. The duration of antibiotics is usually 2–3 weeks, depending on the specific organisms identified. Catheter removal and temporary hemodialysis support is recommended for refractory, relapsing, or fungal peritonitis. In some patients, a new PD catheter could be inserted after complete resolution of the peritonitis. PD catheter removal should also be considered for refractory exit site or tunnel infections. After the improvement in clinical practice, there is a worldwide trend of reduction in PD-associated peritonitis rate, supporting the use of PD as a first-line dialysis modality.

### Linezolid for treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal peritonitis [^11678ZhK]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

She was treated successfully with intravenous linezolid, fluconazole given by nasogastric tube, and removal of the peritoneal catheter. A concentration of linezolid above the minimum inhibitory concentration for most gram-positive pathogens, including vancomycin-resistant E faecium, was achieved in the dialysate fluid after an oral loading dose of 1200 mg. Additional data are needed to establish the role of linezolid in treating CAPD-associated peritonitis.

### Regional variation in the treatment and prevention of peritoneal dialysis-related infections in the peritoneal dialysis outcomes and practice patterns study [^112zeaU6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related infections lead to significant morbidity. The International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) guidelines for the prevention and treatment of PD-related infections are based on variable evidence. We describe practice patterns across facilities participating in the Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (PDOPPS).

Methods

PDOPPS, a prospective cohort study, enrolled nationally representative samples of PD patients in Australia/New Zealand (ANZ), Canada, Thailand, Japan, the UK and the United States. Data on PD-related infection prevention and treatment practices across facilities were obtained from a survey of medical directors'.

Results

A total of 170 centers, caring for > 11000 patients, were included. The proportion of facilities reporting antibiotic administration at the time of PD catheter insertion was lowest in the United States (63%) and highest in Canada and the UK (100%). Exit-site antimicrobial prophylaxis was variably used across countries, with Japan (4%) and Thailand (28%) having the lowest proportions. Exit-site mupirocin was the predominant exit-site prophylactic strategy in ANZ (56%), Canada (50%) and the UK (47%), while exit-site aminoglycosides were more common in the United States (72%). Empiric Gram-positive peritonitis treatment with vancomycin was most common in the UK (88%) and USA (83%) compared with 10–45% elsewhere. Empiric Gram-negative peritonitis treatment with aminoglycoside therapy was highest in ANZ (72%) and the UK (77%) compared with 10–45% elsewhere.

Conclusions

Variation in PD-related infection prevention and treatment strategies exist across countries with limited uptake of ISPD guideline recommendations. Further work will aim to understand the impact these differences have on the wide variation in infection risk between facilities and other clinically relevant PD outcomes.

### Culture-negative peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients in Australia: predictors, treatment, and outcomes in 435 cases [^114ZEvuE]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Reports of culture-negative peritoneal dialysis (PD)-associated peritonitis have been sparse, conflicting, and limited to small single-center studies. The aim of this investigation is to examine the frequency, predictors, treatment, and outcomes of culture-negative PD-associated peritonitis.

Study Design

Observational cohort study using Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) data.

Setting & Participants

All Australian PD patients between October 1, 2003, and December 31, 2006.

Predictors

Demographic, clinical, and facility variables.

Outcomes & Measurements

Culture-negative PD-associated peritonitis occurrence, relapse, hospitalization, catheter removal, hemodialysis transfer, and death.

Results

Of 4,675 patients who received PD in Australia during the study period, 435 episodes of culture-negative peritonitis occurred in 361 individuals. Culture-negative peritonitis was not associated with demographic or clinical variables. A history of previous antibiotic treatment for peritonitis was more common with culture-negative than culture-positive peritonitis (42% vs 35%; P = 0.01). Compared with culture-positive peritonitis, culture-negative peritonitis was significantly more likely to be cured using antibiotics alone (77% vs 66%; P < 0.001) and less likely to be complicated by hospitalization (60% vs 71%; P < 0.001), catheter removal (12% vs 23%; P < 0.001), permanent hemodialysis therapy transfer (10% vs 19%; P < 0.001), or death (1% vs 2.5%; P = 0.04). Relapse rates were similar between the 2 groups. Patients with relapsed culture-negative peritonitis were more likely to have their catheters removed (29% vs 10% [P < 0.001]; OR, 3.83; 95% CI, 2.00–7.32). Administration of vancomycin or cephalosporin in the initial empiric antibiotic regimen and the timing of catheter removal were not significantly associated with clinical outcomes.

Limitations

Limited covariate adjustment. Residual confounding and coding bias could not be excluded.

Conclusions

Culture-negative peritonitis is a common complication with a relatively benign outcome. A history of previous antibiotic treatment is a significant risk factor for this condition.

Specifically, cefazolin and gentamicin were empirically chosen as empirical antibiotics before the year 2000; cefazolin and ceftazidime were empirically used in the following years. These empirical antibiotics were subsequently adjusted based on the isolated pathogen(s) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing as necessary. In general, antimicrobial treatment lasted for at least two weeks, and the treatment duration might be extended based on the clinical judgment made by the patient's attending nephrologist. PD catheters were removed if antimicrobial therapy alone failed to resolve the peritonitis within 2–3 weeks, and PD was then replaced by temporary or permanent hemodialysis.

This study was conducted with a waiver of patient consent approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (Document no. 100–2661B).

Statistical analysis

Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data between the mono-VS peritonitis and mixed-VS peritonitis groups were compared with each other. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparing continuous variables while Fisher's exact test or chi-square test was used for comparing dichotomous variables. Two-tailed P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS software (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0, IBM Corp. Armonk, NY).

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^113iwFvz]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Continuous or prolonged infusion of β-lactam antibiotics — Continuous or prolonged (over 3–4 h) antibiotic infusion, as opposed to intermittent infusion (over 30–60 min), aims to optimize the time that local concentration remains above the MIC (ideally, 40% or more of the dosing interval), and one IAI study found continuous cefoxitin infusion produced peritoneal fluid concentrations at least five times greater than the MICs of infecting Enterobacteriaceae. However, meta-analyses have come to conflicting conclusions, and a recent large RCT of severe sepsis patients, 25% with an abdominal source, did not demonstrate any advantage to continuous infusion; a single RCT in IAI with piperacillin-tazobactam also did not demonstrate any advantage.

### Continuous infusion of ceftazidime in critically ill patients undergoing continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration: pharmacokinetic evaluation and dose recommendation [^111emiVY]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Key messages

- 	CVVHDF effectively removes continuously infused ceftazidime, with a mean sieving coefficient of 0.81 and a mean CVVHDF clearance of 33.6 ml/min.

- 	In critically ill patients with severe acute renal failure treated with CVVHDF and receiving a continuous infusion of cefatzidime, extrarenal clearance of ceftazidime is substantial and accounts for about 50% of total clearance of the drug.

- 	As compared with intermittent administration, continuous infusion of ceftazidime does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug in critically ill patients receiving CVVHDF.

- 	We recommend a 2 g loading dose of ceftazidime followed by 3 g/day continuous infusion in critically ill patients undergoing CVVHDF.

### Optimising intraperitoneal gentamicin dosing in peritoneal dialysis patients with peritonitis (GIPD) study [^114UQ1Zw]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Aminoglycosides display concentration dependent bacterial killing meaning maximal bacterial killing requires high peak drug concentrations and also have a prolonged post-antibiotic effect (PAE) where bacterial growth continues to be inhibited even when the drug concentrations fall below the minimum inhibitory concentration. Both the concentration dependent killing and the PAE justify the recommendations for once-daily gentamicin dosing. IP antibiotic dosing according to current guidelines gives rise to high gentamicin concentrations in the peritoneal cavity for at least six-hours, which increases the likelihood of systemic absorption and subsequent toxicity without additional antibacterial effect.

A gentamicin trough concentration of < 2 mg/L is usually recommended because early studies reported an increased risk of toxicity with higher concentrations. A recent retrospective study from the UK found that the current ISPD dosing guidelines for IP gentamicin resulted in high trough plasma concentrations in over 50% of patients. High plasma concentrations of gentamicin can not be rapidly removed by renal excretion in patients requiring PD increasing the risk of toxicity. Monitoring of gentamicin plasma concentrations in patients with renal impairment is useful in avoiding drug accumulation and minimising the possible toxicities of the drug, including loss of residual renal function.

This pharmacokinetic study of gentamicin was designed to develop improved dosing guidelines to achieve optimal bacterial kill, based on the performance of drug delivered intraperitoneally to a population with poor or no renal function.

Aims

To describe the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin administered intraperitoneally in PD patients with peritonitis using a population pharmacokinetic model; and To test this pharmacokinetic model by computerised dosing simulations and subsequently develop dosing recommendations for IP gentamicin to optimise antibiotic efficacy and minimise toxicity.

### Optimising intraperitoneal gentamicin dosing in peritoneal dialysis patients with peritonitis (GIPD) study [^114Fny5H]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Peritonitis is a major complication of PD and is one of the main reasons why patients are transferred to haemodialysis. Antibiotics used to treat peritonitis may be delivered via the intraperitoneal (IP), intravenous (IV) or oral routes. In most cases of PD related peritonitis, the infection is localised to the peritoneum and cells lining the peritoneal cavity. The IP route of antibiotic administration is preferred because it ensures antibiotic concentrations at the local site/s of the infection are maximised. However, drugs administered intraperitoneally may still be absorbed into the systemic circulation potentially leading to toxicity. Peritonitis may also alter the permeability of the peritoneal membrane with an inflamed peritoneal membrane allowing increased absorption of drugs from the peritoneal cavity into the blood stream.

Most studies in this area have concentrated on the effectiveness and outcomes of IP antibiotic therapy in PD related peritonitis. Only a few small studies have reported the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics delivered via the IP route. Most were conducted in volunteer PD patients without peritonitis. The absorption and clearance of drugs administered intraperitoneally are not well described, particularly in pathological states such as inflammation and infection. Poor or absent renal excretion adds complexity to the pharmacodynamics when drugs that reach the systemic circulation and are excreted by the kidneys, such as gentamicin, are used.

Gentamicin belongs to the aminoglycoside class of antibiotics and provides excellent coverage against Gram-negative bacteria. However, high blood levels are associated with nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. In the past, gentamicin was not recommended for use in PD patients with residual renal function due to the risk of causing it to further decline. A recent study has shown that the short term use of aminoglycosides is safe and does not compromise residual renal function. This is reflected in the current International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) Guidelines/Recommendation for Peritoneal Dialysis-Related Infections published in 2005 where gentamicin is listed as one of the drug options for gram negative empirical antibiotic cover. The recommended dose for intraperitoneal gentamicin in anuric patients is 0.6 mg/kg in a single dialysis bag administered once daily and allowed to dwell for at least six-hours.

### Peritoneal dialysis related peritonitis: insights from a long-term analysis of an Italian center [^1147k25i]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Abiding by the recent definitions of outcomes and measurement methods, our experience confirms that peritonitis still represents a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in PD patients. In fact, peritonitis required hospitalization in more than 50% of the cases and accounted for approximately 35% of the transfer to HD and 7% of deaths.

Our overall peritonitis rate was far below the threshold of 0.4 episode/patient-year proposed by the ISPD recommendations. Furthermore, nearly 60% of the incident patients never experienced peritonitis, while the peritonitis-free survival at 3 months and at one year of treatment was above 90 and 80%, respectively. Those good results might be associated with the early start of in-hospital PD training (mainly the day after the catheter insertion) that patients received in our center.

More than two-thirds of the episodes were successfully treated by antibiotic therapy, conversely catheter removal was necessary in less than one-fifth of the events. Those results should reassure PD candidates that even if peritonitis may represent a severe complication, in most of the cases it is manageable by medical treatment.

The empiric antibiotic therapy (first-generation cephalosporin plus aminoglycosides) resulted effective in almost 65% of the cases. Although the initial treatment was successful in the most cases of peritonitis caused by gram-positive bacteria, a second-line antimicrobial therapy was required in almost two-thirds of the episodes due to gram-negative microorganisms. These results drew our attention to act soon on: an investigation regarding Gram-negative antibiotic sensitivities at our center, a tobramycin pharmacokinetic study in CAPD.

Whenever empiric antibiotic treatment fails, the identification of the organism and its antibiotic sensitivities indicate the possible source of infection and help physicians to guide the choice of therapy. In our experience, the rate of culture-negative peritonitis was approximately 25%, substantially greater than the suggested ISPD benchmark of 15%.

Infectious culture-negative peritonitis may result from recent antibiotic exposure, suboptimal sample collection or culture methods, or unusual organisms.

Thus, we promptly revised the method of culturing PD effluent aiming at enhancing the yield of peritoneal fluid culture and reducing the time needed for a positive result. Two significant changes that we recently implemented were the following: centrifugation of 50 mL of PD effluent followed by resuspension of the sediment in 5 mL and subsequent inoculation in blood-culture bottles; routinely culture of PD dialysate in both aerobic and anaerobic media.

### Optimising intraperitoneal gentamicin dosing in peritoneal dialysis patients with peritonitis (GIPD) study [^1172rS6L]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are preferentially delivered via the peritoneal route to treat peritonitis, a major complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD), so that maximal concentrations are delivered at the site of infection. However, drugs administered intraperitoneally can be absorbed into the systemic circulation. Drugs excreted by the kidneys accumulate in PD patients, increasing the risk of toxicity. The aim of this study is to examine a model of gentamicin pharmacokinetics and to develop an intraperitoneal drug dosing regime that maximises bacterial killing and minimises toxicity.

Methods/Design

This is an observational pharmacokinetic study of consecutive PD patients presenting to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital with PD peritonitis and who meet the inclusion criteria. Participants will be allocated to either group 1, if anuric as defined by urine output less than 100 ml/day, or group 2: if non-anuric, as defined by urine output more than 100 ml/day. Recruitment will be limited to 15 participants in each group. Gentamicin dosing will be based on the present Royal Brisbane & Women's Hospital guidelines, which reflect the current International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis Peritonitis Treatment Recommendations. The primary endpoint is to describe the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin administered intraperitoneally in PD patients with peritonitis based on serial blood and dialysate drug levels.

Discussion

The study will develop improved dosing recommendations for intraperitoneally administered gentamicin in PD patients with peritonitis. This will guide clinicians and pharmacists in selecting the most appropriate dosing regime of intraperitoneal gentamicin to treat peritonitis.

### Serum ceftazidime concentrations in hemodialysis patients (CEFTAHEMOD) [^111qGGCQ]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

In case of severe infections, the first 24h of treatment are critical to limit the severity and the mortality. Thus, the antibiotic treatment must be initiated as soon as possible, be efficacious against the causative organism, and reach concentrations in the infected tissues larger than the minimal inhibitory concentration. In case of sepsis, pharmacokinetic parameters are modified, increase and decrease of the renal clearance), which impacts on the actual concentration and activity of the antibiotic. For most antibiotics, the adaptation of the dosages is performed in a very crude fashion in case of renal failure.

A first study has demonstrated that the antibiotic doses prescribed in case of sepsis were, in most of the cases, insufficient to obtain a concentration of 4 times or even 1 time the MIC of the causative organism during the desired fractions of the time between two successive administration. This showed that the ceftazidime clearance increases with the rate of dialysis fluid flow, the ultrafiltration volume, and the urea clearance. There is a positive correlation between the increase in blood flow and the ceftazidime clearance that, however, is observed only in patients for whom an AN69 membrane was used. A dose of 2 g of ceftazidime after each dialysis session was effective for isolates for which the MIC of ceftazidime was not superior to 16 mg/L. This study, however, is based on data collected in 1983 and included only 6 patients.

Thus, there has been no in vivo study looking as to whether a dose of 1 or 2 g of ceftazidime administered after each dialysis session is sufficient when using contemporary dialysis equipment. Moreover, no measure of the free fraction has been made. Primary objective Assess whether the standard doses of ceftazidime administered at the end of the dialysis session allow to obtain the following serum concentrations:

- Assess whether the standard doses of ceftazidime administered at the end of the dialysis session allow to obtain a trough concentration at 32 mg/L if the causative organism is not identified and 4 times its MIC if it is identified and its MIC determined and lower or equal to 8 mg/L.
