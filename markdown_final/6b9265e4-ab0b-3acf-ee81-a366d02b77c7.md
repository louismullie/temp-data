## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the meaning of "deliver" across medical contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most common clinical usage, which is obstetric delivery. Then, I should verify how "deliver" is used in drug delivery and therapeutic delivery systems. Next, I will consider delivery of care models and systems. After that, I should review delivery of information and communication, including breaking bad news. Finally, I will synthesize a cross-context definition and highlight key principles that unify these usages, making sure I anchor each point to authoritative sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the primary clinical meaning: in medicine, "deliver" most often refers to childbirth, encompassing vaginal delivery and assisted vaginal delivery, with operative vaginal birth guided by indications, timing, and shared decision-making to optimize maternal and neonatal outcomes, and with explicit cautions against nonmedically indicated early-term deliveries due to increased neonatal risks [^115f9DU4] [^115jCG7V] [^112dakFM].

> Wait, let me verify the timing nuances because they matter clinically. ACOG redefined "term" into early term, full term, late term, and postterm to reflect that neonatal outcomes vary by gestational age, and committee opinions emphasize that elective delivery should generally occur at 39 weeks or later unless there is a medical indication for earlier delivery, balancing maternal and fetal risks rather than relying on fetal lung maturity testing to time delivery [^112hxKvT] [^1162x7Gc] [^115EYHV6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "delivery" only meaning childbirth. I need to check drug delivery next. In therapeutics, "delivery" refers to the targeted administration of medications or biologics, including advances in mRNA delivery, extracellular vesicle-based delivery, and controlled-release systems that improve bioavailability, tissue targeting, and safety profiles, thereby expanding therapeutic options across vaccination, protein replacement, and gene editing [^111viWSb] [^113B3uWf] [^114bghaD].

> I will now examine delivery of care, because this is a major domain where "deliver" is used. Integrated care models, the pediatric medical home, and collaborative care frameworks all describe how services are delivered across settings and providers to be accessible, continuous, coordinated, and person-centered, with explicit attention to equity, cultural tailoring, and system-level supports to realize the quadruple aim [^1129oohK] [^115oWzKn] [^115bVF2g].

> Let me consider delivery of information and communication, since clinicians often say "deliver news". Best practices for delivering bad news emphasize preparing the recipient, stating clearly and directly, checking understanding, and aligning with the patient's information preferences, while also acknowledging uncertainty and offering hope where appropriate, which is especially relevant in trauma and critical care contexts [^115qRnXN].

> But wait, what if the context is public health or policy? I should confirm that "deliver" also applies to programs and interventions. Community health worker-led hypertension programs, telemedicine-enabled services, and cancer care delivery research all illustrate how interventions are delivered in real-world settings, with attention to reach, fidelity, and adaptation to local context to improve outcomes and equity [^114fCJHA] [^11515P3y] [^117WQZcz].

> Let me synthesize a cross-context definition so I don't miss anything. Across medicine, "deliver" denotes the intentional, structured provision of a clinical act, substance, or service to a recipient in a manner that is safe, effective, and aligned with evidence, context, and patient preferences, whether that act is childbirth, administration of a therapy, provision of integrated care, or communication of information, and it inherently implies accountability for outcomes and quality [^115f9DU4] [^111viWSb] [^1129oohK] [^115qRnXN].

> I should double-check the unifying principles that make these usages coherent. Key themes include timeliness and appropriateness matched to indication, patient-centeredness and shared decision-making, system-level coordination and equity, and continuous quality improvement with feedback loops, all of which are repeatedly emphasized in guidelines and consensus statements across obstetrics, therapeutics, and care delivery science [^1162x7Gc] [^1129oohK] [^113Jc7v8].

---

The term "deliver" in medicine refers to the **act of providing care, treatment, or services** to patients across settings, including hospitals, clinics, homes, and communities [^1129oohK]. It encompasses the **administration of therapies**, the **implementation of care plans**, and the **communication of information** (e.g. delivering results or counseling) [^115qRnXN]. Delivery is guided by evidence-based practice, patient-centeredness, and safety, with attention to context, equity, and outcomes [^115SwMZU] [^116YMCZb]. Effective delivery requires coordination among providers, systems, and patients, and is continuously evaluated for quality and value [^113Jc7v8] [^117WQZcz].

---

## Clinical contexts of delivery

Delivery occurs across diverse clinical contexts, including:

- **Hospital-based care**: Inpatient services, surgeries, emergency care, and intensive care unit (ICU) services [^114e6jTV].
- **Outpatient care**: Clinic visits, ambulatory procedures, and specialty consultations.
- **Home-based care**: Home health services, palliative care, and chronic disease management.
- **Community-based care**: Public health interventions, preventive services, and community health programs [^114fCJHA].

---

## Components of medical delivery

Medical delivery comprises several **key components**:

| **Component** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Clinical interventions | Administration of treatments, medications, surgeries, and therapies [^111viWSb] |
| Care coordination | Integration of services across providers and settings to ensure continuity of care [^113Jc7v8] |
| Patient education | Providing information and counseling to patients and families [^115qRnXN] |
| Communication | Sharing results, diagnoses, and treatment plans with patients and healthcare teams [^115qRnXN] |
| Follow-up and monitoring | Ongoing assessment of patient outcomes and adjustment of care plans [^115zbdDy] |

## Principles guiding medical delivery

Effective medical delivery is guided by **core principles**:

- **Evidence-based practice**: Use of current research and clinical guidelines to inform care decisions [^1156xoPj].
- **Patient-centered care**: Tailoring care to patient preferences, values, and needs [^115NSyxM].
- **Safety and quality**: Minimizing errors, adverse events, and ensuring high-quality outcomes [^115SwMZU].
- **Equity and access**: Addressing disparities and ensuring fair access to care [^117WQZcz].
- **Efficiency and value**: Optimizing resource use and delivering cost-effective care [^1129oohK].

---

## Challenges in medical delivery

Medical delivery faces several **challenges**, including:

- **Fragmentation of care**: Lack of coordination among providers and settings [^114TtYnx].
- **Resource constraints**: Limited staffing, equipment, and funding [^114e6jTV].
- **Health disparities**: Unequal access and outcomes across populations [^111dxvA2].
- **Technological barriers**: Inadequate integration of health information systems [^114TtYnx].
- **Patient engagement**: Difficulty engaging patients in shared decision-making and self-management [^115zbdDy].

---

## Strategies to improve medical delivery

To address these challenges, healthcare systems employ **various strategies**:

- **Integrated care models**: Coordinating services across providers and settings [^115oWzKn].
- **Telemedicine**: Expanding access to care through remote services [^11515P3y].
- **Quality improvement initiatives**: Continuous monitoring and enhancement of care processes [^115zbdDy].
- **Patient engagement tools**: Education, shared decision-making, and self-management support [^113Jc7v8].
- **Policy reforms**: Addressing systemic barriers and promoting equitable access [^117WQZcz].

---

## Outcomes of effective medical delivery

Effective medical delivery leads to **improved patient outcomes**, including:

- **Better health outcomes**: Reduced morbidity, mortality, and improved quality of life [^113NMkLX].
- **Enhanced patient satisfaction**: Improved patient experience and engagement [^115zbdDy].
- **Reduced healthcare costs**: Lower utilization of emergency services and hospitalizations [^notfound].
- **Improved provider satisfaction**: Reduced burnout and improved job satisfaction [^1129oohK].

### Integrated behavioral health: definitions and contexts [^115Zk1mm]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Most children and adolescents with behavioral and mental health concerns first present to their pediatricians. Although pediatricians are fully cognizant of the importance of addressing behavioral and mental health concerns, they often find it difficult to deliver such care effectively and efficiently within a typical practice setting. Integration of medical and behavioral health care has emerged as a model to deliver such care. In the pediatric primary care practice, integrated behavioral health has been shown to be a cost-effective way to deliver high-quality care. This article describes basic definitions and contexts of integrated pediatric behavioral health.

### Recommendations for robust and reproducible preclinical research in personalised medicine [^114MNbkj]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The "personalised medicine" (PM) paradigm brings promise of delivering tailor-made prevention and treatment strategies for individuals or groups of patients. The idea that individual patients experience disease and response to treatment differently due to variability in genetic and environmental factors is not a new idea, but this recent shift of focus in medicine is driven by advances in multifaceted biological profiling. Improved disease profiling has manifested the need for preclinical models which can generate reliable and predictive data for therapeutic development. The increasing complexity of PM research demands scientific rigour and standardisation of methods in every step. These recommendations were developed in the context of the PERMIT (Personalised Medicine Trials) project. The definition of PM was aligned with the European council conclusion as "a medical model using characterisation of individuals' phenotypes and genotypes (e.g. molecular profiling, medical imaging, lifestyle data) for tailoring the right therapeutic strategy for the right person at the right time, and/or to determine the predisposition to disease and/or to deliver timely and targeted prevention". Specifically, the following common operational definition of PM research was applied: a set of comprehensive methods (methodology, statistics, validation, technology) to be applied in the different phases of the development of a personalised approach to treatment, diagnosis, prognosis, or risk prediction. Ideally, robust and reproducible methods should cover all the steps between the generation of the hypothesis (e.g. a given stratum of patients could better respond to a treatment), its validation, and preclinical development, up to the definition of its value in a clinical setting.

### What the COVID-19 pandemic can teach Us about resource stewardship and quality in health care [^115SwMZU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has forever changed how we view health care service delivery. Although there are undoubtedly some unintended consequences that will result from current health care service reallocation, it provides a unique opportunity to consider how to deliver quality care currently, and after the pandemic. In the context of lessons learned, moving forward some of what was previously routine could remain reserved for more exceptional circumstances. To determine what is "routine", what is "essential", and what is "exceptional", it is necessary to view medical decisions within the paradigm of high-quality care. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement definition of the dimensions of quality is based on whether the care is safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable. This type of stewardship has been applied to many interventions already deemed unnecessary by organizations such as the Choosing Wisely initiative, but the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic provides a lens from which to consider other aspects of care. The following will provide examples from Allergy/Immunology that outline how we can reconsider what quality means in the post-coronavirus disease health care system.

### Adapting interventions to new contexts-the ADAPT guidance [^1143UhM6]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Interest is growing in adapting evidence informed interventions for implementation in new contexts. Box 1 provides a list of definitions of key terms. Use of interventions with an existing evidence base could be more efficient than the development of new interventions for each context. However, effects often depend on the context. Hence, interventions that are simply replicated might be less likely to reproduce effects than those adapted to achieve a good fit between intervention and context. Situations in which adaptation might be needed include transporting an intervention to a new settingor targeting different populations, such as adapting for sociocultural groups(box 2 lists examples). Adaptations might aim to avoid inequalities generated from interventions, by ensuring that interventions delivered at the population level are sensitive to the needs of disadvantaged groups. When effects are not reproduced in new contexts, however, it can be difficult to determine whether this result is due to inappropriate adaptation, weaknesses in original evidence, mechanisms that do not function in the new context, or another explanation.

Box 1
Definitions of key terms

Box 2
Examples of types of intervention adaptation

Efforts to examine what kinds of adaptation enhance the likelihood of interventions working in new contexts have proven inconclusive owing to limited transparency in conduct and reporting of adaptation. In the ADAPT study, funded by the UK Medical Research Council and National Institute for Health Research, we developed guidance to improve the conduct and reporting of intervention adaptations. Our guidance focuses on involving stakeholders in adaptation, selecting a suitable evidence informed intervention, planning and undertaking adaptations, evaluating adapted interventions, implementing adapted interventions in routine practice, and reporting adaptation processes and outcomes.

Summary points

Use of interventions with a previous evidence base in new contexts might be more efficient than developing new interventions
Many population health problems and interventions are highly sensitive to context, so implementing an intervention in a new context without adaptation might be less likely to lead to positive outcomes
A new consensus informed guidance for adapting interventions to achieve a good fit between the intervention and context (ADAPT) proposes systematic processes for adapting interventions to new contexts, and transparent reporting to facilitate synthesis on what does or does not work
The ADAPT guidance was developed using systematic review methods, qualitative interviews, extensive consultation, and formal consensus methods. It provides a framework and step-by-step guidance for working with stakeholders, selecting suitable interventions, undertaking adaptations, making decisions on evaluation and implementation, and reporting adapted interventions

### ACOG committee opinion No 579: definition of term pregnancy [^112hxKvT]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

In the past, the period from 3 weeks before until 2 weeks after the estimated date of delivery was considered "term", with the expectation that neonatal outcomes from deliveries in this interval were uniform and good. Increasingly, however, research has shown that neonatal outcomes, especially respiratory morbidity, vary depending on the timing of delivery within this 5-week gestational age range. To address this lack of uniformity, a work group was convened in late 2012, which recommended that the label "term" be replaced with the designations early term (37 0/7 weeks of gestation through 38 6/7 weeks of gestation), full term (39 0/7 weeks of gestation through 40 6/7 weeks of gestation), late term (41 0/7 weeks of gestation through 41 6/7 weeks of gestation), and postterm (42 0/7 weeks of gestation and beyond) to more accurately describe deliveries occurring at or beyond 37 0/7 weeks of gestation. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine endorse and encourage the uniform use of the work group's recommended new gestational age designations by all clinicians, researchers, and public health officials to facilitate data reporting, delivery of quality health care, and clinical research.

### Redefining palliative care – A new consensus-based definition [^115rndjQ]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Definition

This article describes a consensus-based process to develop a new PC definition that engaged PC stakeholders from around the world. To our knowledge, it is the first time that such a large-scale effort has been implemented to reach a definition for this field. Previous definitions, including the WHO definition, have been developed by a small group of individuals with no broader input. The definition described in this article resulting from a methodologically sound process reflects the consensus of more than 450 PC workers from around the globe, located in all geographical regions, representing different fields of work and working in different settings. The definition is well aligned with the 2014 resolution by the World Health Assembly on PCand reflects the international growth of and transitions in PC over time.

The resulting definition is based on the SHS concept, as put forward by the Lancet Commission. Emphasizing suffering as a mainstay of the new definition allows a further shift from a disease-centered conceptualization to a more person-centered approach to PC. The definition recognizes that PC should be delivered based on need rather than prognosis, is applicable in all care settings and levels, and encompasses both general and specialist care. Increasingly, SHS is replacing older concepts in population-based studies and strategic planning of health care delivery, to identify PC need and monitor effective access for target populations, and this revised definition is a useful complement to that work.

This consensus-based definition follows a similar structure to the current WHO definitions and is separated into two sections: an initial concise statement and a list of bulleted and more specific components.

A third section was added after participants suggested that a set of recommendations to governments should accompany the definition. These recommendations are directed to national and local governments on how to achieve PC integration into health systems as a component of Universal Health Coverageto achieve the sustainable development goals by 2030.

The new definition includes family members and caregivers as the unit of care, thus requiring additional resources from care services, which may be challenging to health care systems with limited resources.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^111ZZ139]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Standards of care — global language use and definitions of gender affirmation specify that When applying the Standards of Care globally, we recommend health care professionals (HCPs) utilize local language and terms to deliver care in their specific cultural and/or geographical locale. Gender affirmation refers to the process of recognizing or affirming TGD people in their gender identity — whether socially, medically, legally, behaviorally, or some combination of these, and Gender-affirming care is not synonymous with transition-related care; Provision of transition-related care, such as medical gender affirmation via hormones or surgery, does not alone ensure provision of gender-affirming care, nor does it indicate the quality or safety of the health care provided. Consultation and partnerships with TGD communities can help to ensure relevancy and inclusivity of the language used in providing health care locally in a particular context and setting.

### Deliver optimal care-national cancer plan… [^117WQZcz]. nationalcancerplan.cancer.gov (2023). Medium credibility.

The health care system delivers to all people evidence-based, patient-centered care that prioritizes prevention, reduces cancer morbidity and mortality, and improves the lives of cancer survivors, including people living with cancer. Ongoing improvements across our health care system are required to ensure that high-quality cancer care is available and affordable for all who need it. While health care delivery research can reveal what to do to improve routine cancer care, it is up to the government, industry, communities, and individuals to use research knowledge to produce the changes necessary to end cancer as we know it. Given these issues, research to improve cancer care delivery is extremely important. However, it is also challenging for several reasons:

- Improvement requires cooperation among clinicians and health systems that currently lack the time and resources to conduct research.
- Data collections needed for research are hard to access and are spread across electronic medical records, insurance claims, cancer registries, pharmacy databases, and other places throughout the health care system.
- Working with many different parts of the health care system to gather, format, and analyze these data is difficult, time consuming, and can be met with resistance. Strategies to advance cancer care delivery
- Advance how cancer care is delivered, including through research identifying and addressing inequities to improve prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.
- Increase collaboration between NCI and other government and private groups to capitalize on data, resources, and expertise that help enable cancer care delivery research.
- Work across government agencies and with private companies to promote widespread use of research-proven ways to lower cancer death rates and improve survivor well-being.
- Identify and put into effect best practices for public engagement, communication, and health literacy related to cancer risk, prevention, treatment, and survivorship that are tailored to community needs. Examples of activities across the government to achieve this goal
- The Enhancing Oncology Model, designed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Innovation Center, tests ways to improve patient-centered care and strategies to deliver cancer care that will generate the best possible patient outcomes.
- Primary care practitioners are significant contributors toward early cancer diagnosis and overall cancer care. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality EvidenceNow Model is a blueprint for delivering external support to primary care practices to improve health care quality and implement new evidence into care delivery. AHRQ also produces a webinar series featuring studies that strengthen the research and delivery of primary care.

### Person-reported outcomes in diabetes care: what are they and why are they so important? [^11361h1t]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

In this review, we aim to show how person-reported outcomes (PROs) and person-reported experiences (PREs) can significantly contribute to the way diabetes care is delivered, the involvement of people with diabetes in diabetes care, and the collaboration between health care professionals and people with diabetes. This review focuses on the definition and measurement of PROs and PREs, the importance of PROs and PREs for person-centred diabetes care, and integrating the perspectives of people with diabetes in the evaluation of medical, psychological and technological interventions. PROs have been increasingly accepted by Health Technology Assessment bodies and are therefore valued in the context of reimbursement decisions and consequently by regulators and other health care stakeholders for the allocation of health care resources. Furthermore, the review identified current challenges to the assessment and use of PROs and PREs in clinical care and research. These challenges relate to the combination of questionnaires and ecological momentary assessment for measuring PROs and PREs, lack of consensus on a core outcome set, limited sensitivity to change within many measures and insufficient standardization of what can be considered a minimal clinically important difference. Another issue that has not been sufficiently addressed is the involvement of people with diabetes in the design and development of measures to assess PROs and PREs.

### Unpicking the gordian knot: a systems approach to traumatic brain injury care in low-income and middle-income countries [^1176kFGE]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

What is required to overcome these myriad challenges? Better epidemiological data are essential, both to characterise and quantify injuries being sustained in different contexts, and to map their current management. Clinical medicine clearly has a role to play, with guidelines, protocols and pragmatic trials based in LMICs needed to generate an appropriate and applicable evidence base to guide management, alongside the development of innovative technologies appropriate to the LMIC context. However, these will only solve part of the problem. Allied disciplines such as Improvement Science, Implementation Science, Operational Research and Human Factors Engineering may all offer insights as to not only what to do but how to do it.

A central tenet of many of these disciplines is the concept of medical care as delivered by a system. Systems thinking in healthcare is endorsed by WHO as particularly apposite for improvement in healthcare in LMICs, while in the field of global surgery, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery 2015 notes the importance of focussing on systems with regard to surgical improvement. More specifically in TBI, the importance of the health system is highlighted in the recent Lancet Neurology Commission on Traumatic Brain Injury. However, a universal definition of systems thinking, or even of a system in the context of healthcare, is lacking. There is an increasing recognition that healthcare represents a complex, adaptive, sociotechnical system consisting of people and equipment, processes and institutions. The complexity arises from both the number of, and the variability in, the interactions between these different components. Indeed, several elements of complex systems may be observable in healthcare including emergence, path dependence, self-organisation, non-linearity and non-scalability.

### Redefining palliative care – A new consensus-based definition [^111dxvA2]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Access to palliative care (PC) — an essential component of health care and integral to Universal Health Coverage, — is still grossly inadequate or nonexistent in most parts of the world. The Lancet Commission on Global Access to Palliative Care and Pain Relief (hereafter referred to as The Lancet Commission) estimated that annually, more than 61 million people experience health conditions associated with suffering that could be significantly ameliorated through PC. At least 80% lack access to even the most basic PC interventions, such as pain medication.

Appropriately defining and delimiting the nature and scope of PC is key for integration into the care continuum, to identifying the human, financial and physical resources required to meet global need, and to close the enormous inequitable divides in access. Yet, as clinical science and capacity to deliver health care have evolved, the debates around the definition of PC have become more intense and complex.

PC initially and historically focused on alleviating the relief of suffering at the end of life. However, it is now considered best practiceand is increasingly implemented earlier in the trajectory of life-threatening health conditions. Furthermore, the historical development of PC was focused largely on patients with cancer, whereas it is now being integrated into treatment of all life-threatening health conditions. Existing research suggests that PC is both effective in reducing symptom burden and improving quality of life, cost effective, and synonymous with quality of care.

A consensus on the definition is required for conceptual clarity in PC, which in turn impacts on scope of practice, therapeutic aims, and outcome assessment. Lack of conceptual clarity may hamper the efforts of countries, especially those of low income and middle income, to implement PC and thus to achieve universal health care.

The Lancet Commission identified the need to review and revise the definition of PC. As part of its agreement of work as a nongovernmental organization in official relations with the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care (IAHPC) took on this task.

The objective of this article is to present the research behind the new definition. We developed a consensus-based definition of PC that focuses on the relief of serious health-related suffering (SHS), a concept put forward by the Lancet Commission, that is, timely and is applicable to all patients regardless of diagnosis, prognosis, geographic location, point of care, or socioeconomic level. This article describes the process undertaken by IAHPC, the findings of the consensus-building exercises, and presents the resulting definition and recommendations.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^112DENjh]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Medical necessity and accepted standards — definition and policy context — are specified as care that is "appropriate, in terms of type, frequency, extent, site and duration, and considered effective for the patient's illness, injury, or disease" and "not primarily for the convenience of the patient, physician, or other health care provider, and not more costly than an alternative service or sequence of services at least as likely to produce equivalent therapeutic or diagnostic results as to the diagnosis or treatment of that patient's illness, injury or disease". The document adds, "The treating HCP asserts and documents that a proposed treatment is medically necessary for treatment of the condition", and clarifies that "Generally, 'accepted standards of medical practice' means standards that are based on credible scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally recognized by the relevant medical community, designated Medical Specialty Societies and/or legitimate Medical Colleges' recommendations, and the views of physicians and/or HCPs practicing in relevant clinical areas". It notes "Medical necessity is central to payment, subsidy, and/or reimbursement for health care in parts of the world", and that if policies challenge medical necessity "there may be an opportunity to appeal to a governmental agency or other entity for an independent medical review". The page also states, "It should be recognized gender diversity is common to all human beings and is not pathological".

### ICU admission, discharge, and triage guidelines: a framework to enhance clinical operations, development of institutional policies, and further research [^114e6jTV]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

ICU admission — definition and scope state that the ICU is an area within a medical facility equipped with advanced technologies such as ventilators and personnel trained to provide intensive, advanced life-supportive care to critically ill patients. These units can be general or specialized and can be organized by specific systems, pathologies, or problems (e.g., neurological, burn, or trauma ICUs, and medical or surgical ICUs) or by age groups (e.g., adult or PICUs). Given the scarce human and economic resources available to support these units and the inappropriateness of delivering therapies that are not medically indicated, whether knowingly or not, the admission to these is heavily guarded.

### Medically indicated late-preterm and early-term deliveries: ACOG committee opinion, number 818 [^115EYHV6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The neonatal risks of late-preterm and early-term births are well established, and the potential neonatal complications associated with elective delivery at less than 39 0/7 weeks of gestation are well described. However, there are a number of maternal, fetal, and placental complications in which either a late-preterm or early-term delivery is warranted. The timing of delivery in such cases must balance the maternal and newborn risks of late-preterm and early-term delivery with the risks associated with further continuation of pregnancy. Deferring delivery to the 39th week is not recommended if there is a medical or obstetric indication for earlier delivery. If there is a clear indication for a late-preterm or early-term delivery for either maternal or newborn benefit, then delivery should occur regardless of the results of lung maturity testing. Conversely, if delivery could be delayed safely in the context of an immature lung profile result, then no clear indication for a late-preterm or early-term delivery exists. Also, there remain several conditions for which data to guide delivery timing are not available. Some examples of these conditions include uterine dehiscence or chronic placental abruption. Delivery timing in these circumstances should be individualized and based on the current clinical situation. This Committee Opinion is being revised to include frequent obstetric conditions that would necessitate delivery before 39 weeks of gestation and to apply the most up-to-date evidence supporting delivery recommendations.

### Principles of financing the medical home for children [^1129oohK]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric medical home definitions and aims — The "pediatric medical home" delivers accessible, continuous, comprehensive, patient- and family-centered, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally effective health care, and by extension, a "pediatric medical neighborhood" includes pediatric medical subspecialists, surgical specialists, mental and behavioral health specialists, and others who work collaboratively with the pediatric medical home. The "triple aim", as adopted by payers, is to improve the value of health care, to improve the individual patient's experience of care, and to improve community health as a whole, and this triple aim has expanded to a quadruple aim by recognizing that improved provider satisfaction is another key goal of the health system enterprise; attention to how the care team experiences the quality of its work life is required to counter the erosion of provider manpower, efficiency, and empathy resulting from accelerating and often onerous administrative demands.

### What is a clinical pathway? Development of a definition to inform the debate [^114v1S91]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical pathways are tools used to guide evidence-based healthcare that have been implemented internationally since the 1980s. However, there is widespread lack of agreement on the impact of clinical pathways on hospital resources and patient outcomes. This can be partially attributed to the confusion for both researchers and healthcare workers regarding what constitutes a clinical pathway. This paper describes efforts made by a team of Cochrane Review authors to develop criteria to assist in the objective identification of clinical pathway studies from the literature.

Methods

We undertook a four-stage process aiming to develop criteria to define a clinical pathway: (1) identify publications exploring the definition of a clinical pathway; (2) derive draft criteria; (3) pilot test the criteria; and (4) modify criteria to maximise agreement between review authors.

Results

Previous literature and liaison with the European Pathways Association resulted in five criteria being used to define a clinical pathway: (1) the intervention was a structured multidisciplinary plan of care; (2) the intervention was used to translate guidelines or evidence into local structures; (3) the intervention detailed the steps in a course of treatment or care in a plan, pathway, algorithm, guideline, protocol or other 'inventory of actions'; (4) the intervention had timeframes or criteria-based progression; and (5) the intervention aimed to standardise care for a specific clinical problem, procedure or episode of healthcare in a specific population. After pilot testing it was decided that if an intervention met the first criteria (a structured multidisciplinary plan of care) plus three out of the other four criteria then it was included as a clinical pathway for the purposes of this review. In all, 27 studies were included in the final review. The authors of the included studies referred to these interventions as 'clinical pathways', 'protocols', 'care model', 'care map', 'multidisciplinary care', evidence-based care' and 'guideline'.

Conclusions

The criteria used for the identification of relevant studies for this Cochrane Review can be used as a foundation for the development of a standardised, internationally accepted definition of a clinical pathway.

### Person-centered care: a definition and essential elements [^114TtYnx]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Medium credibility.

Person-centered care — barriers to implementation include inconsistent terminology that limits system-wide delivery and cross-study work; persistence of traditional principal decision-maker roles; physician workload that necessitates interprofessional team support; misaligned incentives where those bearing costs may not benefit; unclear quality indicators where a person-centered care plan may be most significant; provider concerns when risky patient choices raise ethical and medico-legal issues; lack of advance care planning, especially in dementia; fragmented payment structures across healthcare and community-based services; and lack of interoperable health records that hinders coordination.

### Redefining palliative care – A new consensus-based definition [^112U6Lc9]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Developing a consensus-based definition of PC required extensive deliberation, rigorous examination, and thorough testing. It was challenging to find common ground among individuals with long-standing experience in the field of PC who had firmly held positions.

Although the consensus-based definition is not perfect, it creates practice and policy value beyond its intended purpose of defining PC comprehensively and clearly. It provides an opportunity to examine international developments in the conceptualization and practice of PC and to achieve an explicit and shared understanding of that practice across the global community. The new definition is inclusive, encompasses health-system advances, and reflects the opinions and perceptions among a global community of professional health care providers. The new definition is aligned with the recommendations of the Lancet Commission, allowing for future synergy with efforts to implement the recommendations of its report and future implementation activities.

Future research is needed to evaluate the uptake, benefits, and challenges faced by those who use this new definition. This consensus-based definition must be open to critical discussion that includes patients and caregivers as well as providers. To this end, IAHPC continues to collate all feedbacks in what will be a continuous process of adapting the definition of PC to the ever-changing realities of patient needs.

### Overdiagnosis in primary care: framing the problem and finding solutions [^1139AHkV]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Overdiagnosis, is defined as the diagnosis of a condition that, if unrecognized, would not cause symptoms or harm a patient during his or her lifetime, and it is increasingly acknowledged as a consequence of screening for cancer and other conditions. Because preventive care is a crucial component of primary care, which is delivered to the broad population, overdiagnosis in primary care is an important problem from a public health perspective and has far reaching implications. The scope of overdiagnosis as a result of services delivered in primary care is unclear, though overdiagnosis of indolent breast, prostate, thyroid, and lung cancers is well described and overdiagnosis of chronic kidney disease, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is also recognized. However, overdiagnosis is a known consequence of all screening and can be assumed to occur in many more clinical contexts. Overdiagnosis can harm patients by leading to overtreatment (with associated potential toxicities), diagnosis related anxiety or depression, and labeling, or through financial burden. Many entrenched factors facilitate overdiagnosis, including the growing use of advanced diagnostic technology, financial incentives, a medical culture that encourages greater use of tests and treatments, limitations in the evidence that obscure the understanding of diagnostic utility, use of non-beneficial screening tests, and the broadening of disease definitions. Efforts to reduce overdiagnosis are hindered by physicians' and patients' lack of awareness of the problem and by confusion about terminology, with overdiagnosis often conflated with related concepts. Clarity of terminology would facilitate physicians' understanding of the problem and the growth in evidence regarding its prevalence and downstream consequences in primary care. It is hoped that international coordination regarding diagnostic standards for disease definitions will also help minimize overdiagnosis in the future.

### Recognizing that evidence is made, not born [^114ujzA9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Understand stakeholder product needs

Following molecule discovery, structured, widely‐inclusive and interactive input from key decision‐makers (i.e. regulators, HTAs, payers, prescribers and patients), in conjunction with industry, would provide realistic establishment and clear definition of need at the very outset, as is currently done with adaptive/flexible approaches.

Stakeholders would first define disease management gaps and then identify the types of treatments needed, in light of those gaps. For example, where there is a treatment gap in management of chronic pain (including palliative, non‐palliative and neuropathic), specific characteristics of desired products would be identified among stakeholders in the larger healthcare context — such as nonopioid/non‐addictive product(s) best suited to the specific patient population(s) in need. 95

Next to be delineated would be the characteristics of the developed product that would be desired; for example: (1) specific positive attributes that the putative product should have, as well as the particular unwanted negative effects it should avoid; (2) its performance regarding overall effectiveness; (3) its value to patients and to the health system; and (4) any specific delivery requirements with respect to the healthcare system. These attributes would be set by stakeholders based on considerations of the disease/condition, the subgroups of patients with the disease/condition, stakeholders' experiences with available therapies and regimen optimization, if any. Larger, societal considerations and practical, context considerations would also be included in these discussions, so that realistic goals and expectations could be set regarding product indication scope to be developed, and performance and "effect size" with respect to alternative therapies if available. This is also the appropriate time to try to resolve any outstanding differences between stakeholders in their perceptions of product need and requisite attributes. Considerations, expectations and goals would be taken in anticipation of, and in context with, the activity domains to come, the next of which is to tackle stakeholders' evidence needs.

### Consistent definitions of clinical practice guidelines, consensus statements, position statements, and practice alerts [^1156xoPj]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

An evidence-based approach to clinical decision-making for optimizing patient care is desirable because it promotes quality of care, improves patient safety, decreases medical errors, and reduces health care costs. Clinical practice recommendations are systematically developed documents regarding best practice for specific clinical management issues, which can assist care providers in their clinical decision-making. However, there is currently wide variation in the terminology used for such clinical practice recommendations. The aim of this article is to provide guidance to authors, reviewers, and editors on the definitions of terms commonly used for clinical practice recommendations. This is intended to improve transparency and clarity regarding the definitions of these terminologies.

### Trends in maternal request cesarean delivery from 1991 to 2004 [^113wJx4w]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review definitions and terminology for and to estimate percentages of maternal request cesarean deliveries in the United States between 1991 and 2004.

Methods

National Hospital Discharge Survey data 1991–2004 (N = 458,767) were used to identify maternal request cesarean deliveries. After excluding women with a history of cesarean delivery, women who labored, and women with indicated risks against labor, 2,394 potential maternal request cesarean deliveries remained. Indicated risks were identified with a recognized protocol.

Results

Maternal request cesarean deliveries have two properties: 1) cesarean delivery before labor and 2) cesarean delivery in the absence of medical conditions presenting a risk for labor. Risk is either absolutely absent or it is relatively absent. In 1991–2004, 0.20% of women who delivered live infants and 1.34% of women who delivered by primary cesarean delivery did so without any medical conditions listed on their hospital discharge record. Estimates for maternal request cesarean deliveries without certain indicated risks were 0.75% for women who delivered live infants and 5.03% for women who delivered by primary cesarean delivery. Maternal request cesarean deliveries without any indicated risk peaked in 1999 for women who delivered live infants. Maternal request cesarean deliveries without certain indicated risks crested in 2004.

Conclusion

Our estimates were affected by three factors: 1) lack of agreement on a definition of maternal request cesarean deliveries, 2) changes in medical coding practices, and 3) changes in physician response to medical conditions. To validly and reliably estimate maternal request cesarean deliveries requires an empirically tractable, standard definition.

### Global health: evolving meanings [^113MNdqe]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Approaches to health, health care, and the terminology to describe global health have evolved over the past 70 years since the introduction of the Constitution of the World Health Organization and definition of health in broader terms. The early focus on individual care gradually shifted to community, population, and global approaches, with associated changes in the site of medical care, the personnel who provide it, and the education and training of those personnel. Concomitantly, goals changed from purely curative care to disease prevention and health promotion. Health was better understood to exist within the larger political, social, cultural, and ethical settings.

### The rise and rise of drug delivery [^114bghaD]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2005). Medium credibility.

Drug delivery has typically focused on optimizing marketed compounds, improving their effectiveness or tolerability, and simplifying their administration. This role now includes the first biopharmaceuticals as well as more conventional drugs. As drug-delivery technologies come into play earlier in the development cycle, however, they can also enhance the screening and evaluation of new compounds and 'rescue' failed compounds, such as those with low solubility. In this article, we look back at how the burgeoning field of drug delivery came into being and describe approaches for future discovery and development.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^113MqLsD]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Primary care roles, medical home, and specialist expertise — scope definitions: For the purpose of this CPG, pediatricians and other pediatric health care providers refers to a qualified primary or tertiary care medical provider operating within their scope of practice and providing clinical care to children and adolescents, with examples including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, and the document also refers to dietitians, licensed psychologists, exercise specialists, and other health care professionals who are not practicing medicine in the same manner. The "pediatric medical home" delivers accessible, continuous, comprehensive, patient- and family-centered, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally effective health care, with well-trained pediatric physicians known to the child and family delivering or directing primary medical care. Pediatric obesity specialists or clinicians with expertise are health care professionals with additional training in pediatric obesity medicine, with training that may occur via certification programs specific to obesity, fellowship, a focus during specialty training such as within endocrinology or gastroenterology specialty training, or via an informal apprenticeship combined with professional workshops within the context of recognized health care professional organizations.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^111Yy9Xw]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Primary care — definition, scope, and competencies for transgender and gender diverse (TGD) patients emphasize that primary care is the "provision of integrated, accessible health care services… in the context of family and community", that primary care providers (PCPs) include general and family medical practitioners, nurse practitioners, advanced practice nurses, physician associates/assistants, and internists, and that not all providers are trained or qualified to deliver the full breadth of transgender health care. The text notes limited formal training in TGD health and states that "if providers are competent to deliver similar care for cisgender patients, they should develop competency in caring for TGD patients", that these competencies are within licensure scope, and that "all PCPs should be able to manage the comprehensive health of TGD patients either directly or by appropriate referral". It adds, "There is no evidence competency in caring for TGD patients can only be achieved through a formal or certification process". Because of unique needs, "PCPs need distinct competencies in the care of TGD persons", and professional bodies have issued position statements and guidelines. Consistent with this, Wylie et al. state that "for the most part" general health "should be attended to within the primary care setting", with many examples of safe and effective services outside specialist care.

### A trust based framework for the envelopment of medical AI [^114LLxyu]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Reliance

Reliance is the belief in a disposition and the willingness to act on this belief.

For example: reliance on the correctness of a clock is the belief that this clock has the disposition to correctly tell the time and the willingness to use the clock to schedule one's activities; reliance on the postal service is the belief that the service has the disposition to safely deliver parcels and letters and the willingness to use it for the one's own mail; and reliance on the help of a volunteer is the belief that the volunteer has the disposition to carry out the assigned tasks and the willingness to schedule further work requiring those tasks to be completed. It is easy to see that reliance is an attitude that can be extended to a larger number of entities, including inanimate objects and organisations. Furthermore, the fact that it is common in colloquial language to use 'trust' and 'reliance' interchangeably (e.g. to say that one 'trusts the post service' or 'trusts a volunteer'), indicates that there is conceptual overlap between the two concepts.

For the purposes of considering trust in the context of healthcare and medical AI, we have found it sufficient to use one particular definition of the relationship between trust and reliance: trust is reliance on the good will of the trustor towards the trustee. Baier then further unpacks 'good will' as often involving 'caring' and, in particular, caring for (an aspect of) the trustee's wellbeing. Therefore, we can define trust as:

Trust

Trust is the reliance on the trustor's care for [an aspect of] the trustee's wellbeing.

In an attempt to avoid falling into a death spiral of definitions, we will take 'care' to have the intuitive meaning of an ascription of particularly high importance to the cared for entity, so that its preservation or improvement acts as a significant motivation for the carer's actions. In Trust and Reliance in Healthcare and Medical AI, we will see that this definition provides a very good description of trusting relationships in healthcare settings. However, it is also a good fit for other paradigmatic cases of trust: e.g. trusting a parent can be adequately described as a reliance on their particular care for the child's wellbeing; friendship can be described as mutual care for each other's wellbeing.

### Dapagliflozin in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction [^113NMkLX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study DELIVER was published by Scott D Solomon and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the DELIVER study, the trial question was: what is the role of dapagliflozin in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF? In the DELIVER study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the DELIVER study, the population was: 6263 patients (2747 female, 3516 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HF and a LVEF > 40%. The key exclusion criteria were T1DM mellitus; receipt of SGLT 2 inhibitor within 4 weeks of randomization; or previous intolerance to SGLT 2 inhibitor; impaired kidney function. In the DELIVER study, the interventions were: n = 3131 dapagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg/day plus usual therapy) n = 3132 placebo (matching placebo plus usual therapy). In the DELIVER study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in worsening HF or cardiovascular death (16.4% vs. 19.5%; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.92). In the DELIVER study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in the incidence of worsening HF events and cardiovascular deaths (11.8 events/100 person-year vs. 15.3 events/100 person-year; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.89) No significant difference in death from any cause (15.9% vs. 16.8%; HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07) No significant difference in cardiovascular death (7.4% vs. 8.3%; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05). In the DELIVER study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events and serious adverse events. In the DELIVER study, the conclusion was: in patients with HF and a LVEF > 40%, dapagliflozin was superior to placebo with respect to worsening HF or cardiovascular death.

### Standardizing definitions and reporting guidelines for the infertility core outcome set: an international consensus development study [^114rAjpr]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Question

Can consensus definitions for the core outcome set for infertility be identified in order to recommend a standardized approach to reporting?

Summary Answer

Consensus definitions for individual core outcomes, contextual statements, and a standardized reporting table have been developed.

What Is Known Already

Different definitions exist for individual core outcomes for infertility. This variation increases the opportunities for researchers to engage with selective outcome reporting, which undermines secondary research and compromises clinical practice guideline development.

Study Design, Size, Duration

Potential definitions were identified by a systematic review of definition development initiatives and clinical practice guidelines and by reviewing Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group guidelines. These definitions were discussed in a face-to-face consensus development meeting, which agreed consensus definitions. A standardized approach to reporting was also developed as part of the process.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods

Healthcare professionals, researchers, and people with fertility problems were brought together in an open and transparent process using formal consensus development methods.

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

Forty-four potential definitions were inventoried across four definition development initiatives, including the Harbin Consensus Conference Workshop Group and International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technologies, 12 clinical practice guidelines, and Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group guidelines. Twenty-seven participants, from 11 countries, contributed to the consensus development meeting. Consensus definitions were successfully developed for all core outcomes. Specific recommendations were made to improve reporting.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

We used consensus development methods, which have inherent limitations. There was limited representation from low- and middle-income countries.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

A minimum data set should assist researchers in populating protocols, case report forms, and other data collection tools. The generic reporting table should provide clear guidance to researchers and improve the reporting of their results within journal publications and conference presentations. Research funding bodies, the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials statement, and over 80 specialty journals have committed to implementing this core outcome set.

### Clinical implications of the universal definition for the prevention and treatment of heart failure [^112BKgdK]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of heart failure (HF) primarily relies on signs and symptoms that are neither sensitive nor specific. This impedes timely diagnosis and delays effective therapies or interventions, despite the availability of several evidence-based treatments for HF. Through monumental collaborative efforts from representatives of HF societies worldwide, the universal definition of HF was published in 2021, to provide the necessary standardized framework required for clinical management, clinical trials, and research. This review elaborates the key concepts of the new universal definition of HF, highlighting the key merits and potential avenues, which can be nuanced further in future iterations. We also discuss the key implications of the universal definition document from the perspectives of various stakeholders within the healthcare framework, including patients, care providers, system/payers and policymakers.

### Defining patient centricity with patients for patients and caregivers: a collaborative endeavour [^111Y3rd6]. BMJ Innovations (2017). Medium credibility.

This concept of 'patient centricity'and the opportunity to include patient-centred activities in drug development has been a key topic of interest in the past few years, with parallel advances made with key stakeholders including industry, regulators and healthcare professionals. Patients are also demanding that drug development becomes more patient centric and that more patient-centric relationships are developed. Indeed, this is a much discussed and written about topic, but as yet, a consistent definition of patient centricity as applied to drug development has not been published, and although definitions relating to other key stakeholders (eg, healthcare providers) have been developed, these are more specific to the delivery of healthcare by healthcare professionals and not necessarily transferable to the drug development process. Indeed, patients to date have not been asked to define how they want to engage in the scientific research and development for their medicines of the future. Research has also shown that patient centricity is a highly recognised term among life science executives in the biopharmaceutical industry, but a consistent definition is lacking.

Implementation of patient centricity within biopharmaceutical industry development programmes requires a consistent and coordinated approach, with a common definition and associated principles to ensure medicines deliver the optimal experience and outcome for patients and their loved ones. In this respect, it is important to ensure that the guiding principles of patient centricity are defined by patients for patients so that these can be used within industry as a point of reference and promote stronger unified commitment to patient engagement. Here, we describe the process leading to a consensus definition of patient centricity and its important principles impacting the biopharmaceutical industry as relates to the biopharmaceutical industry and the drug development process.

### Definition and recommendations for advance care planning: an international consensus supported by the European association for palliative care [^113HSXgP]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Advance care planning (ACP) is increasingly implemented in oncology and beyond, but a definition of ACP and recommendations concerning its use are lacking. We used a formal Delphi consensus process to help develop a definition of ACP and provide recommendations for its application. Of the 109 experts (82 from Europe, 16 from North America, and 11 from Australia) who rated the ACP definitions and its 41 recommendations, agreement for each definition or recommendation was between 68–100%. ACP was defined as the ability to enable individuals to define goals and preferences for future medical treatment and care, to discuss these goals and preferences with family and health-care providers, and to record and review these preferences if appropriate. Recommendations included the adaptation of ACP based on the readiness of the individual; targeting ACP content as the individual's health condition worsens; and, using trained non-physician facilitators to support the ACP process. We present a list of outcome measures to enable the pooling and comparison of results of ACP studies. We believe that our recommendations can provide guidance for clinical practice, ACP policy, and research.

Shared medical appointments (SMAs) are a new way to deliver woman-focused interdisciplinary care for midlife women. SMAs are a series of one physician to one patient encounters with other patient observers. The women's health physician addresses each woman's unique medical needs individually but in the context of a shared setting. The major focus is on delivering individual medical care with the benefits of additional time spent educating women patients and answering questions.

### Defining error in anatomic pathology [^1127uefM]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Although much has been said and written about medical error and about error in pathology since the publication of the Institute of Medicine's report on medical error in 1999, precise definitions of what constitutes error in anatomic pathology do not exist for the specialty. Without better definitions, it is impossible to accurately judge errors in pathology. The lack of standardized definitions has implications for patient care and for the legal judgment of malpractice.

Objectives

To review the goals of anatomic pathology, to discuss the problems inherent in applying these goals to the judgment of error in pathology, to offer definitions of major and minor errors in pathology, and to discuss error in anatomic pathology in relation to the classic laboratory test cycle.

Data Sources

Existing literature.

Conclusion

Definitions for major and minor error in anatomic pathology are proffered, and anatomic pathology error is characterized in the classic test cycle.

### Clinical obesity through the lens of context-aware large language models [^114rThZp]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore whether large language models can assist in refining complex medical definitions, this proof-of-concept study evaluated the capacity of three advanced systems, ChatGPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Grok 3, to interpret, critique, and build upon existing definitions of clinical obesity, with particular reference to the Lancet Commission on the Definition and Diagnosis of Clinical Obesity.

Materials and Methods

Five structured questions were used in a three-stage qualitative design: (1) baseline responses without external references, (2) context-informed responses incorporating the Lancet Commission report, and (3) generative redefinition of clinical obesity. Model outputs were reviewed by a medical expert for accuracy, originality, and concordance with established guidelines.

Results

Without contextual guidance, large language models produced generalized definitions largely reflecting public-domain sources. Supplying the Lancet Commission report yielded more precise, conceptually consistent, and clinically relevant outputs. In the generative phase, all models proposed refined definitions that addressed recognized gaps in existing frameworks, emphasizing functional impairment, psychosocial dimensions, and the limitations of body mass index as a diagnostic criterion.

Conclusion

When anchored to authoritative, domain-specific evidence, large language models can serve as adjunctive tools for knowledge synthesis, clarifying and strengthening complex medical constructs. Integrating human expertise with artificial intelligence under transparent and ethically governed conditions may enable the development of more inclusive, adaptive, and evidence-based clinical definitions.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for medical direction of search and rescue teams [^114V2jju]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Practitioner definition and first aid classification — The term practitioner refers to state-licensed clinicians who provide direct medical decision-making patient care with prescription-writing authority, including physicians (MDs and doctors of osteopathic medicine [DOs]), physician assistants (PAs), and advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs). All medical care delivered outside this framework, if delivered legally, is considered first aid; typical certificates such as wilderness first responder (WFRs), wilderness first aid (WFA), Stop the Bleed, and advanced wilderness first aid (AWFA) provide training but not licensure, and certificates or practice types lacking a state-issued license to practice medicine are considered first aid — level training regardless of name or scope. Some certificates vary by state: for example, Maryland identifies outdoor emergency care as a state-recognized license, whereas the vast majority do not and place it in the first aid category.

Person-centered care essential elements — realizing the definition involves an individualized, goal-oriented care plan based on the person's preferences supported by a thorough medical, functional, and social assessment, and for some people, the assessment should be conducted in their place of residence; ongoing review of the person's goals and care plan with reassessment on a regular basis; care supported by an interprofessional team in which the person is an integral team member, and the team must be flexible in composition and adaptable to changes; one primary or lead point of contact on the healthcare team, with one care provider serving as a point of contact to ease communication and facilitate continuity and transitions; active coordination among all healthcare and supportive service providers so services continue as seamlessly as possible, particularly when moving from one site of care (or residence) to another; continual information sharing and integrated communication, which may be accomplished through mechanisms such as the electronic health record and enhanced by careful listening and open communication between the person and everyone involved in his or her care; education and training for providers and, when appropriate, the person and those important to the person, including principles that contribute to consistent recognition and maintenance of the person's autonomy, and health education that supports informed decision-making and self-determination; and performance measurement and quality improvement using feedback from the person and caregivers, where measurable outcomes should focus on successful implementation of care plans, evidence that the person's goals are being met, and efforts to minimize difficulties during transitions between healthcare providers and across care settings.

### Developing and applying a' living guidelines' approach to WHO recommendations on maternal and perinatal health [^114Xnjzg]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Box 1
Decision rules for prioritisation by the Executive Guideline Steering Group (GSG)

There is a substantial number of new effectiveness or otherstudies or reports in relation to the question, and these studies have not yet been assessed or included in a systematic review, particularly if the new data may relate to priority outcomes and or harms/safety. These new data may lead to changes in: Estimates and CIs for specific outcomes. Certainty of the evidence for specific outcomes. Recommended dose or intensity of an intervention. Recommended timing of an intervention (eg, gestational age). Recommended subgroups for whom an intervention is effective (age groups, disease severity, etc). Recommended route through which the intervention is delivered/administered. Supporting interventions required. Level of care/type of providers for delivering/administering the intervention.
There is a substantial number of new efficacy studies/reports in relation to the question, and these studies have not yet been assessed or included in a systematic review. Not including these studies may undermine the credibility of the recommendation, even if this is already a strong recommendation.
There is a new drug or intervention in relation to a health issue, and data are now available.
The recommendation is 'general' in relation to a class of drugs (eg, antihypertensives) and does not specify the use of a particular drug. There is now new evidence that suggests that the recommendation needs to be narrowed to a particular drug/s or suggests that particular drug/s are not effective or are less effective.
The identification of definitional, consistency or interpretation issues in existing recommendations: The definition of a clinical condition (eg, definition of 'severe hypertension') or of other relevant issues, and/or how the clinical condition is diagnosedor diagnostic criteria, have changed substantially since the recommendation was made. The wording of the recommendation is ambiguous, unclear or could be improved substantially (eg, in relation to drug dosages). There are inconsistencies between recommendations (eg, in drug dosages, route of administration) that may lead to misunderstandings. Guideline users in service delivery settings have indicated that the recommendation is hard to understand or interpret.
There have been wide-scale changes in technologies (or access to technologies) that impact on clinical practice (eg, the viability of the fetus at particular gestational ages) and/or what life-saving interventions that can be delivered.
A related recommendation has changed or has been prioritised for updating.
New synthesis methods (such as network meta-analysis or individual patient data meta-analysis) may give new findings and/or allow comparisons and subgroup analyses that were not possible previously.
The Executive GSG is of the view that a recommendation should be viewed as a good practice statement (or vice versa).
The question underlying the recommendation needs to be revisited: It is not clear if the question is still relevant. The question is still relevant but needs to be unpacked or broken down further into subquestions. For example, a recommendation that health promotion is recommended needs to be broken down to consider which kinds of health promotion interventions are effective and can be recommended.
Where the development of an existing recommendation was driven strongly by evidence related to how people value outcomes, or the acceptability, feasibility, equity or cost-effectiveness of the intervention, and there are changes (or potential changes) in the supporting evidence regarding these criteria.

### Geriatric trauma management [^115qRnXN]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Deliver updates and prognostic information — communication steps — include asking permission and preferences for information, then proceeding with news and prognosis. When delivering bad news, it is recommended that the health professional provide an alert to the patient and family that bad news is coming, and it is a best practice to present the information succinctly and directly while avoiding medical jargon. Helpful questions include asking how much information the patient or family would like about what lies ahead with the injury, then information can be presented accordingly, and hope/worry statements are effective ways to convey prognostic information; normalizing the inherent uncertainty in future projections helps set realistic expectations while maintaining a sense of hope.

### Development of a generic working definition of' supportive care' [^117FAHhF]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2013). Medium credibility.

Context

The term 'supportive care', despite everyday and widespread use, remains an ambiguous concept that lacks clarity. A generic definition would underpin the development of services and provide a basis for disease specific approaches to care.

Objectives

To develop a generic working definition of supportive care that could be applied to a range of diseases and chronic illnesses.

Methods

An indepth review of the literature was carried out to identify existing generic and disease specific definitions and descriptions of supportive care. Following the review, a modified two-phase Delphi study was performed. Participants included experts in the area of supportive care identified during the review in addition to charities or their representatives. A draft definition was developed based upon the outcome of the Delphi study.

Results

The literature review identified one brief generic definition of supportive care with no explanation of its origin. A further 17 disease specific definitions were identified, all relating to cancer. The review led to the development of 100 statements for inclusion in phase I of the modified Delphi study. 26 responses were received to phase I of the Delphi study and 17 responses to phase II. General agreement was received during the second stage and a final draft definition subsequently developed.

Conclusions

The resulting definition of supportive care might provide a basis for service development and could be further adapted to disease specific contexts. It would benefit from broader consultation to determine acceptability among a wider range of health professionals and service users.

### Levels of maternal care: obstetric care consensus No, 9 [^111zJZo4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Personnel availability terminology — definitions clarify that physically present at all times means the specified person should be on site in the location where perinatal care is provided, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and readily available at all times means the specified person should be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for consultation and assistance, and able to be physically present on site within a time frame that incorporates maternal and fetal or neonatal risks and benefits with the provision of care; further defining this time frame should be individualized by facilities and regions, and if referring to the availability of a service, the service should be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, unless otherwise specified.

### The use of telemedicine to address access and physician workforce shortages [^11515P3y]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Telemedicine in pediatrics — definitions and scope — The term telemedicine is typically limited to direct patient health services, whereas telehealth is a broader term that includes telemedicine and other electronically delivered health-related services; in pediatrics, telemedicine is used in a variety of ways and is not a new type of care delivery but rather a set of tools to deliver the same or enhanced care over a distance, most commonly for subspecialty consultations (including mental and behavioral health) for children in rural communities but also when geographic distance is relatively small, and disparities and time‑distance barriers faced by families in suburban and urban communities could be partly alleviated by telehealth; although telemedicine can be used internationally, international telemedicine is beyond the scope of this statement, and the policy reviews impacts across patient access to care, physician capacity, quality of care, efficiencies, costs, graduate medical education (GME), continuing medical education (CME), payment/funding, research, and barriers to telemedicine.

### What is polypharmacy? A systematic review of definitions [^111zgtPp]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and search strategy

The reporting of this systematic review conforms to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist.

MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched between 1st January 2000 and 30th May 2016.

The following search terms (Medical Subject Headings or MESH and keywords) were used in EMBASE and MEDLINE (Ovid):

polypharmacy/ (MESH) OR multiple medication* OR multiple medicine* OR multiple drug* (key words) OR many medication* OR many medicine* OR many drug* (key words) (for all articles referring to polypharmacy) AND.

defin* (key word) or explan* (keyword) (for all articles defining or explaining polypharmacy).

For the review of the Cochrane database, the term "polypharmacy" was searched.

The search was limited to primary research articles which defined the term polypharmacy in any shape or form, conducted in humans and published in English between the years 2000 and 2016. Articles were considered if the abstracts were available in English and were published or in press. Reference lists of relevant articles and grey literature were screened to identify other relevant articles. The search strategy was developed in consultation with a librarian specialising in health databases, with a pre-determined protocol developed collaboratively with the authors for methods to search and select relevant articles.

### Comparison of a group-delivered and individually delivered lifestyle-integrated functional exercise (LiFE) program in older persons: a randomized noninferiority trial [^113Y6SYh]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Process evaluation

The MRC process evaluation framework emphasises the relations between implementation (what is implemented, and how?), mechanisms of impact (how does the intervention produce change?), and context (how does the context affect implementation and outcomes?). The process evaluation will complement evidence emerging from the trial. Quantitative measures used to assess these factors are marked in Table 4. Qualitative data will be gathered from focus groups which will be held within the study period. Implementation requires capturing whether the intervention was delivered as intended and in which quantity it was delivered. Mechanisms of impact will be explored using qualitative and quantitative outcome data related to the complex pathways leading to intervention-induced change. Context refers to external factors which may act as barriers or facilitators to intervention implementation, e.g. socioeconomic and social factors.

Participant timeline

Screening procedure includes a telephone screening and a subsequent inhouse screening to determine eligibility. Telephone screenings will be performed to pre-screen potential participants regarding those in- and exclusion criteria that are measurable via telephone interview (see Table 4 for all variables). Those still eligible for participation will then be invited to the inhouse screening. In the inhouse screening, remaining exclusion criteria (labelled in Table 4) will be assessed to determine definitive eligibility for participation in the study. In case of medical uncertainties, the study's medical advisor will be consulted; if the medical advisor is uncertain, the potential participant's general practitioner will have to provide consent. Persons with a positive overall screening will then be scheduled for baseline assessment. As part of this assessment, participants will be equipped with a fall calendar for 1 year, an activPAL to assess PA for 9 days, and an activity diary to complement sensor-assessed PA measurement. After baseline assessment, participants will be randomized into either gLiFE or LiFE. The intervention is delivered as presented above. Post-assessments will be performed 6 months (follow-up 1; ± 2 weeks) and 12 months (follow-up 2; ± 2 weeks) after intervention start. All three assessments will last about 2 h each. Figure 1 gives an overview of the flow of participants.

Reasons for study drop-out or intervention drop-out will be recorded. In case of withdrawal from intervention, patients will still be eligible to participate in follow-up assessments given their consent. Reasons and date of withdrawal will be recorded in the database management system. Data recorded prior to withdrawal will be used unless the participant makes use of her/his right to have all data deleted.

### Community health worker-led interventions for hypertension [^114fCJHA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

We will include any intervention led by CHWs with the goal of improving the management of hypertension. For the purposes of this review, we will define the term CHW as workers who:

perform functions related to healthcare delivery in the community,
are trained, in some way, in the context of the intervention, but have received no formal professional or paraprofessional certificate, or tertiary education degree.

According to the definition, we will exclude:

formally trained nurse aides, medical assistants, physician assistants, paramedical workers in emergency and fire services, and other self‐defined health professionals or health paraprofessionals. We will also exclude trainee health professionals, and trainees of the cadres listed above.
studies involving support groups of people with hypertension only. These interventions are considered different from CHW‐led interventions, since support groups only meet to provide each other with informal support, rather than to provide care or services, and seldom receive training in the context of the intervention.
CHWs who are trained to deliver care and provide support only to members of his or her own family.

We will include interventions if the description is adequate for us to establish that it is a CHW‐led intervention. When such details are unclear, we will contact study authors, whenever possible, to establish whether the personnel described are CHWs.

We will evaluate the following comparisons.

CHW care versus standard care for hypertension management without CHW involvement
CHW care versus multi‐faceted interventions that include CHWs and professionals working together
CHW versus no treatment

We will exclude multi‐faceted interventions that include CHWs and professionals working together, but do not include a comparison group that enables us to assess the effects of the CHW‐led intervention separately.

We will impose no restrictions on interventions. CHW‐led interventions of all types will be eligible, including but not limited to health education, blood pressure monitoring, lifestyle modification support, and treatment adherence promotion. Similarly, we will impose no restrictions on the type of CHW personnel, allowing for the inclusion of lay workers, community health educators, health coaches, or individuals with varying levels of medical background, provided they meet the CHW definition outlined.

### Taking account of context in systematic reviews and guidelines considering a complexity perspective [^116YMCZb]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Conclusion

Approaches to context within systematic reviews typically share the following limitations:

Tools typically capture context at a single timepoint and are barely able to capture prevailing trends.
Many tools derive from use in primary research and either have limited utility within synthesis or have not been fully evaluated.
Particular tools focus on a single specific level of context, particularly true of implementation tools that target the direct setting within which the intervention is delivered.

We have also identified a potential tension given that tools that are best equipped for considering context may, by their very nature, not prove practical as a structure or framework for data extraction or analysis. In the absence of empirical evidence on features of context that impact most on intervention success, we observe that tools tend to become increasingly expansive. This, in turn, makes data extraction and analysis more time consuming and resource intensive.

For reviewers and guideline developers, this paper emphasises the practical need to select from this toolkit judiciously. Context should be addressed early in guideline development and then revisited throughout the review process. Frameworks offer a useful structure for ensuring that data on context are extracted for the review. Checklists prompt decision-makers to consider important factors and reporting standards ensure that, where reported, requisite details are present in the report or in supplementary material accompanying each report. Knowledge translation tools such as vignettes, country profiles, calculators and spreadsheets can help in translating between the study contexts and the target context. With such diverse approaches, the current way forward requires composite use of different tools at appropriate stages of the process. Our brief scan of illustrative tools reveals a need for a coherent approach that runs throughout the review process and that underpins the individual tools used at each stage. Approaches to context to date suggests that the components already exist; the outstanding methodological challenge is to agree a coherent approach within which existing tools might be integrated.

Recent years have seen collective recognition of the importance of context when selecting, evaluating and implementing complex interventions. This paper consolidates collective learning in identifying and using tools for handling context and meeting the ever more complex demands of guideline developers and other decision-makers. This overview signals how context might possibly be addressed within systematic reviews and guidelines. For the present, review teams are encouraged to extract contextual details when available, elicit them when feasible and reconstruct them when available data allows. Review teams and guideline producers should seek to navigate a path that is parsimonious in terms of resource and data extraction and yet sensitive to their specific contexts and the values, preferences and needs of their target populations.

### Towards a practical definition of professional behaviour [^116kPpWV]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Professionalism remains a challenging part of the medical curriculum to define, teach and evaluate. We suggest that one way to meet these challenges is to clarify the definition of professionalism and distinguish this from medical ethics.

Methods

Our analysis is two staged. First, we reviewed influential definitions of professionalism and separated elements relating to (a) ethico-legal competencies, (b) clinical competence and (c) professionalism. In reference to professionalism, we then distinguished between aspirational virtues/values and specific behaviours. From these, we develop a working definition of medical professional behaviour consisting of six domains of behaviour: responsibility; relationships with and respect for patients; probity and honesty; self awareness and capacity for reflection; collaboration and team work; and care of colleagues. Second, we tested this working definition against empirical data concerning disciplinary action against practising doctors using (a) sources in the literature and (b) an original analysis of complaints received by the Medical Board of South Australia.

Conclusion

Our empirical analysis supports the relevance of four of the six potential domains: responsibility; relationships with and respect for patients; probity and honesty; self awareness and capacity for reflection. There are additional reasons for retaining 'collaboration and team work' in the medical professional behaviour curriculum but 'care of colleagues' may be better addressed in the ethico-legal curriculum. Our definition of professional behaviour is consistent with the theoretical literature, captures behaviours that predict future complaints against practitioners and is consistent with current complaints about professionalism in South Australian practitioners. This definition can further the teaching and assessing of professional behaviour in medical schools.

### What is polypharmacy? A systematic review of definitions [^114i5g1a]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Whilst the addition of duration of therapy or healthcare setting to a count of medicines in the definition of polypharmacy provided more specific definitions, it did not provide any further clarity or consistency. Five or more medications were again used in the definitions but with a period of time attached such as 90 days or more. The use of duration in the definitions appeared to be included to identify those patients with longer term or chronic use of medications, potentially identifying those patients who might be at greatest risk of medication-related problems. Definitions incorporating a healthcare setting commonly used five or more medications as the count, but using a setting such as at the time of hospital discharge. These definitions were largely based on the dispensing data available to assess prevalence and incidence of polypharmacy, rather than an evidence based approach of determining appropriateness of therapy; the setting provided little addition to existing definitions of polypharmacy in a clinical sense of medication rationalisation and minimisation of harm.

A recent commentary on polypharmacy stated that while a large body of literature confirms the fact that patients are increasingly taking large numbers of medications, numerical definitions of polypharmacy do not ascertain the clinical appropriateness of therapy and the process of rationalising those medications. The author argued that when each of the medications can be linked to practice guidelines for chronic conditions for a given patient, using a numerical cut-off to define polypharmacy becomes irrelevant. While the number of medications can be a starting point, medications should be assessed in terms of their indication, efficacy and potential for harm with each other (not in isolation) given pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics interactions, in order to facilitate deprescribing of inappropriate medications. Medications should be assessed for risks and benefits and the final combination of medications should be based on benefits outweighing the risks. Current literature is alluding to looking beyond single disease management guidelines and considering the patient's complete scenario by considering all comorbidities and medications being prescribed for a given patient to consider the patient as a whole and focusing on improving the overall health.

### Long COVID definitions and models of care: a scoping review [^112wthGB]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Definitions of long COVID are evolving, and optimal models of care are uncertain.

Purpose

To perform a scoping review on definitions of long COVID and provide an overview of care models, including a proposed framework to describe and distinguish models.

Data Sources

English-language articles from Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, SocINDEX, Scopus, Embase, and CINAHL published between January 2021 and November 2023; gray literature; and discussions with 18 key informants.

Study Selection

Publications describing long COVID definitions or models of care, supplemented by models described by key informants.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted by one reviewer and verified for accuracy by another reviewer.

Data Synthesis

Of 1960 screened citations, 38 were included. Five clinical definitions of long COVID varied with regard to timing since symptom onset and the minimum duration required for diagnosis; 1 additional definition was symptom score-based. Forty-nine long COVID care models were informed by 5 key principles: a core "lead" team, multidisciplinary expertise, comprehensive access to diagnostic and therapeutic services, a patient-centered approach, and providing capacity to meet demand. Seven characteristics provided a framework for distinguishing models: home department or clinical setting, clinical lead, collocation of other specialties, primary care role, population managed, use of teleservices, and whether the model was practice- or systems-based. Using this framework, 10 representative practice-based and 3 systems-based models of care were identified.

Limitations

Published literature often lacked key model details, data were insufficient to assess model outcomes, and there was overlap between and variability within models.

Conclusion

Definitions of long COVID and care models are evolving. Research is needed to optimize models and evaluate outcomes of different models.

### Extracellular vesicle-based therapeutics: natural versus engineered targeting and trafficking [^115UyoEH]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly being recognized as mediators of intercellular signaling via the delivery of effector molecules. Interestingly, certain types of EVs are also capable of inducing therapeutic responses. For these reasons, the therapeutic potential of EVs is a topic of intense research, both in the context of drug delivery and regenerative medicine. However, to fully utilize EVs for therapeutic purposes, an improved understanding of the mechanisms by which they function would be highly advantageous. Here, the current state of knowledge regarding the cellular uptake and trafficking of EVs is reviewed, along with a consideration of how these pathways potentially influence the functions of therapeutic EVs. Furthermore, the natural cell-targeting abilities, biodistribution profiles, and pharmacokinetics of exogenously administered EVs, along with the components responsible for these features are discussed. An overview of the potential clinical applications and preclinical examples of their successful use is also provided. Finally, examples of EV modifications that have successfully been employed to improve their therapeutic characteristics receive a particular focus. We suggest that, in addition to investigation of EV cell targeting and routes of uptake, future research into the routes of intracellular trafficking in recipient cells is required to optimally utilize EVs for therapeutic purposes.

### What is polypharmacy? A systematic review of definitions [^111PvBoP]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Multimorbidity and the associated use of multiple medicines (polypharmacy), is common in the older population. Despite this, there is no consensus definition for polypharmacy. A systematic review was conducted to identify and summarise polypharmacy definitions in existing literature.

Methods

The reporting of this systematic review conforms to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE and Cochrane were systematically searched, as well as grey literature, to identify articles which defined the term polypharmacy (without any limits on the types of definitions) and were in English, published between 1st January 2000 and 30th May 2016. Definitions were categorised as i. numerical only (using the number of medications to define polypharmacy), ii. numerical with an associated duration of therapy or healthcare setting (such as during hospital stay) or iii. Descriptive (using a brief description to define polypharmacy).

Results

A total of 1156 articles were identified and 110 articles met the inclusion criteria. Articles not only defined polypharmacy but associated terms such as minor and major polypharmacy. As a result, a total of 138 definitions of polypharmacy and associated terms were obtained. There were 111 numerical only definitions (80.4% of all definitions), 15 numerical definitions which incorporated a duration of therapy or healthcare setting (10.9%) and 12 descriptive definitions (8.7%). The most commonly reported definition of polypharmacy was the numerical definition of five or more medications daily (n = 51, 46.4% of articles), with definitions ranging from two or more to 11 or more medicines. Only 6.4% of articles classified the distinction between appropriate and inappropriate polypharmacy, using descriptive definitions to make this distinction.

Conclusions

Polypharmacy definitions were variable. Numerical definitions of polypharmacy did not account for specific comorbidities present and make it difficult to assess safety and appropriateness of therapy in the clinical setting.

### Recent advances in extracellular vesicles for therapeutic cargo delivery [^113B3uWf]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Exosomes, which are nanosized vesicles secreted by cells, are attracting increasing interest in the field of biomedical research due to their unique properties, including biocompatibility, cargo loading capacity, and deep tissue penetration. They serve as natural signaling agents in intercellular communication, and their inherent ability to carry proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids endows them with remarkable therapeutic potential. Thus, exosomes can be exploited for diverse therapeutic applications, including chemotherapy, gene therapy, and photothermal therapy. Moreover, their capacity for homotypic targeting and self-recognition provides opportunities for personalized medicine. Despite their advantages as novel therapeutic agents, there are several challenges in optimizing cargo loading efficiency and structural stability and in defining exosome origins. Future research should include the development of large-scale, quality-controllable production methods, the refinement of drug loading strategies, and extensive in vivo studies and clinical trials. Despite the unresolved difficulties, the use of exosomes as efficient, stable, and safe therapeutic delivery systems is an interesting area in biomedical research. Therefore, this review describes exosomes and summarizes cutting-edge studies published in high-impact journals that have introduced novel or enhanced therapeutic effects using exosomes as a drug delivery system in the past 2 years. We provide an informative overview of the current state of exosome research, highlighting the unique properties and therapeutic applications of exosomes. We also emphasize challenges and future directions, underscoring the importance of addressing key issues in the field. With this review, we encourage researchers to further develop exosome-based drugs for clinical application, as such drugs may be among the most promising next-generation therapeutics.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: the integrated care of the COPD patient [^115oWzKn]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Medium credibility.

Integrated care for COPD — definitions and core elements — A standard definition of integration is "to combine to form a whole", and the World Health Organization defines integrated care as "a concept bringing together inputs, delivery, management and organization of services related to diagnosis, treatment, care, rehabilitation and health promotion", while it can also be considered "an organizational process of coordination that seeks to achieve seamless and continuous care, tailored to the patient's needs, and based on a holistic view of the patient". The workshop notes that integrated care and the chronic care model of disease management may be considered interchangeable; chronic care integrates services and therapies across settings and providers and tailors therapy to the individual needs of the patient, and has six key components: (1) self-management support, (2) clinical information systems, (3) delivery system redesign, (4) decision support, (5) health system organization of care, and (6) community resources.

### Recommendations for the management of high-risk cardiac delivery: ACC cardiovascular disease in women committee panel [^114UvwyV]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

CVD is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. The optimal management of pregnant patients with CVD begins at preconception, continues through the duration of pregnancy, labor and delivery, and the postpartum period. Despite the vulnerabilities associated with labor and delivery for patients with CVD, there is presently no standardized approach to labor and delivery. Moreover, the systematic exclusion of pregnant patients from randomized trials further limits the pool of evidence available to guide the pregnancy care of these high-risk patients and existing recommendations are based on expert consensus and cohort studies. In this review, we offer a summary of the current practices for the management of labor and delivery for pregnant patients. Notably, our recommendations are most pertinent to tertiary care centers in high-income countries, and generalizability to lower resourced centers and/or countries may be limited. Much work remains to define the standard of care, develop guidelines, and increase consistency in care delivery for this high-risk population and to ultimately improve maternal outcomes.

Person-centered care — additional characteristics for effective implementation emphasize communication centered on person–provider interactions guided by an up-to-date care plan and accurate understanding of motivations and preferences, with discussions that set specific, measurable, realistic goals and education to achieve and periodically reevaluate them; team-based care is critical and requires organizational support with flexible team composition; coordination requires explicit efforts during transitions, clearly defined responsibility for the care plan, communication across settings, and simultaneous access to care plans; the environment should provide organizational culture, support, and training for person-centered care; and measurement should focus on patient and caregiver satisfaction while also capturing system-level, process, and individual-level outcomes such as mental health, caregiver strain, satisfaction with decision-making role, alignment of goals with received care, and goal attainment scaling.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 765: avoidance of nonmedically indicated early-term deliveries and associated neonatal morbidities [^1146Cpz9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

There are medical indications in pregnancy for which there is evidence or expert opinion to support delivery versus expectant management in the early-term period. However, the risk of adverse outcomes is greater for neonates delivered in the early-term period compared with neonates delivered at 39 weeks of gestation. In addition to immediate adverse perinatal outcomes, multiple studies have shown increased rates of adverse long-term infant outcomes associated with late-preterm and early-term delivery compared with full-term delivery. A recent systematic review found that late-preterm and early-term children have lower performance scores across a range of cognitive and educational measures compared with their full-term peers. Further research is needed to better understand if these differences are primarily based on gestational age at delivery versus medical indications for early delivery. Documentation of fetal pulmonary maturity alone does not necessarily indicate that other fetal physiologic processes are adequately developed. For this reason, amniocentesis for fetal lung maturity is not recommended to guide timing of delivery, even in suboptimally dated pregnancies. Avoidance of nonmedically indicated delivery before 39 0/7 weeks of gestation is distinct from, and should not result in, an increase in expectant management of patients with medical indications for delivery before 39 0/7 weeks of gestation. Management decisions, therefore, should balance the risks of pregnancy prolongation with the neonatal and infant risks associated with early-term delivery. Although there are specific indications for delivery before 39 weeks of gestation, a nonmedically indicated early-term delivery should be avoided. This document is being revised to reflect updated data on nonmedically indicated early-term deliveries.

### The definition of the intensivist in the era of global healthcare: 2024 consensus statement from the Society of Critical Care Medicine defining intensivist task force [^113giSg3]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this task force was to examine the 1992 definition of the intensivist, identify gaps, and initiate a path forward to define a concise and practical definition that could be applied globally.

Design

A modified Delphi technique was used to develop a revised definition and roles of the intensivist. We determined a priori that 75% or greater participant agreement for the definition and essential roles of the intensivist was required.

Setting

A task force consisting of physicians, a respiratory therapist, advanced practice providers, and a pharmacist that practice in critical/intensive care medicine, in various settings, was established with the goal of evaluating and revising the previous definition considering evolving healthcare.

Subjects

The task force participated in online questionnaires related to the definition and roles of the intensivist.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

The task force agreed on the following definition of an intensivist: "A physician who has successfully completed an accredited program or equivalent critical care/intensive care medicine training and maintains advanced certification (if available); and shows dedication to the area of critical/intensive care medicine in the way of professional work". Additionally, the task force determined a list of essential roles of the intensivist categorized into Direct Clinical Care, Unit Management/Unit Involvement, Responsibility to the Community, and Administration and Leadership.

Conclusions

The revised definition of the intensivist seeks to integrate the intensivist in the current realm of team-based healthcare. The intensivist is a physician who provides care to critically ill patients in collaboration with an interprofessional team. Establishment of a single, revised definition is intended to render clarity of an intensivist's role and responsibilities for patients, families, and the interprofessional team.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^115bVF2g]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Depression treatment — generalizability to settings and providers (provider perspective and collaborative care) — states that treatment providers (including administrators) should consider setting-specific factors that can limit transferability of efficacy and outlines a collaborative care option for atypical contexts. The guideline notes that treatment providers (including administrators) should consider similar issues and that the efficacy of a given approach as found in a research study may only reflect its efficacy based on the specific treatment circumstances, which might include outpatient versus inpatient delivery or additional resources unavailable in routine care, and that such circumstances may limit the transferability of treatment efficacy to real-world contexts. When implementing treatments in settings atypical from standard structures, an option for individualizing the treatment might include an emphasis on a collaborative model wherein patients become more active participants; certain general medical settings have adopted a collaborative care model whereby patients are provided an initial choice of psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy and, depending on one's progress, predetermined algorithms help determine further treatment choices; such protocols require involvement of various health care specialists and additional resources beyond typical outpatient services; and administrators and therapists need to consider the relevance of the literature, options for addressing gaps, and the applicability of the collaborative care model to their specific setting or context.

### Guidance for modifying the definition of diseases: a checklist [^117HLneT]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

No guidelines exist currently for guideline panels and others considering changes to disease definitions. Panels frequently widen disease definitions, increasing the proportion of the population labeled as unwell and potentially causing harm to patients. We set out to develop a checklist of issues, with guidance, for panels to consider prior to modifying a disease definition.

Observations

We assembled a multidisciplinary, multicontinent working group of 13 members, including members from the Guidelines International Network, Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group, and the World Health Organisation. We used a 5-step process to develop the checklist: (1) a literature review of issues, (2) a draft outline document, (3) a Delphi process of feedback on the list of issues, (4) a 1-day face-to-face meeting, and (5) further refinement of the checklist. The literature review identified 12 potential issues. From these, the group developed an 8-item checklist that consisted of definition changes, number of people affected, trigger, prognostic ability, disease definition precision and accuracy, potential benefits, potential harms, and the balance between potential harms and benefits. The checklist is accompanied by an explanation of each item and the types of evidence to assess each one. We used a panel's recent consideration of a proposed change in the definition of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) to illustrate use of the checklist.

Conclusions and Relevance

We propose that the checklist be piloted and validated by groups developing new guidelines. We anticipate that the use of the checklist will be a first step to guidance and better documentation of definition changes prior to introducing modified disease definitions.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 765: avoidance of nonmedically indicated early-term deliveries and associated neonatal morbidities [^112dakFM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 765 — risk rationale and timing guidance: The risk of adverse outcomes is greater for neonates delivered in the early-term period compared with neonates delivered at 39 weeks of gestation, and multiple studies have shown increased rates of adverse long-term infant outcomes associated with late-preterm and early-term delivery compared with full-term delivery. Amniocentesis for fetal lung maturity is not recommended to guide timing of delivery, even in suboptimally dated pregnancies. Avoidance of nonmedically indicated delivery before 39 0/7 weeks of gestation is distinct from, and should not result in, an increase in expectant management of patients with medical indications for delivery before 39 0/7 weeks of gestation.

### The AQUA-FONTIS study: protocol of a multidisciplinary, cross-sectional and prospective longitudinal study for developing standardized diagnostics and classification of non-thyroidal illness syndrome [^1121QFLV]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives of the AQUA FONTIS project

The AQUA FONTIS study (a pproach to a qua ntitative f ollow-up o f n on- t hyroidal i llness s yndrome) is primarily intended to develop a clear-cut definition and classification of NTIS (Table 1). Overall, this project is proposed to deliver a prognostic aid by providing a differentiated classification, to contribute to a standardised, rational and inexpensive diagnostic procedure in form of quantitative indices, and to lay the foundation for future therapeutic trials by identifying subgroups that may benefit from therapy.

Table 1
Proposed "HPD" classification

Example: H1P0D1: Thyrotropic insufficiency with reduced deiodation and normal protein binding.

Outcome measure of this primary objective is the comparison of different decision criteria as presented in Table 2. These criteria are assessed with regard to the prognosis of the patients. Additionally, the significance of an innovative physiological index approach (SPINA) is to be evaluated regarding its applicability for differential diagnosis between NTIS and latent thyrotoxicosis. It will therefore be evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios with ROC analysis.

Table 2
Decision criteria

As secondary objective, we plan to observe variables that quantify distinct components of NTIS in the context of independent predictors of evolution, survival or pathophysiological condition as well as influencing or disturbing factors like medication or medical procedures. Outcome measures are correlations between quantitatively described components and external factors as well as their distributions in the context of dichotomic influencing factors.

### APA guidelines for psychological assessment and evaluation [^1118YgiN]. APA (2020). High credibility.

APA Guidelines for Psychological Assessment and Evaluation — Guideline 4 emphasizes that psychologists strive to consider the multiple and global settings in which services are being provided, noting that psychological tests are used in a variety of settings for a variety of purposes and that validity evidence is evaluated within the context of these multiple settings and purposes. The psychologist considers these deviations when interpreting test results for a particular client and reporting its results in context; these deviations can include not only using a test in a setting for which it was not designed but also using a test designed, developed, and normed in one country or region of the world in a different country or region. In forensic practice, a psychologist is expected to be appropriately knowledgeable about the legal context in which results will be used and might be expected to know courtroom procedure, rules of evidence, rules of jury selection, or legal definitions such as insanity, dangerousness, and consciousness of guilt. In school settings, a psychologist not only strives to be competent in test selection, administration, and interpretation but also seeks to know and understand special education law requirements around eligibility for services, as well as the student's cultural and classroom contexts. In the employment/company area, the competent user of tests strives to understand the purpose of any evaluation, who is the client, who has a legal right to access results, and whether procedures provide sufficient reliability and validity for the context. With clinical service providers and in integrated care systems, psychologists strive to understand how assessment results will be used, ensure presentations are understandable to team members and clients, and note any cautions or limitations in reports. Psychologists also strive to be mindful of problems associated with the increasing global use of psychological tests, including delivering tests across legal boundaries of states, provinces, territories, or countries.

### The disposition dilemma: delivering holistic care for youths with autism in an acute care hospital… [^113hntSc]. publications.aap.org (2024). Medium credibility.

Jackson was a 10-year-old boy who, at a young age, already had an extensive list of diagnoses, including autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and speech delay. Like many others, Jackson was brought to the acute care children's hospital emergency department for increasingly aggressive behaviors toward his family and schoolmates, which emerged when he was prevented from overeating or watching his favorite television shows. His grandmother was at her wits' end; she knew he needed help but did not know how to get him the care he needed. Jackson's pediatrician tried to manage his behavior with referrals to outpatient psychiatry and applied behavior analysis. However, these services had years-long waitlists, and Jackson's family did not have the resources to obtain private intervention. As Jackson sat in his ED bed, rolling a toy truck across his lap, a social worker sent his clinical information to the local.

### Person-centered care: a definition and essential elements [^112Co4RF]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Medium credibility.

The American Geriatrics Society Expert Panel on Person-Centered Care — concept and project scope are described: Improving healthcare safety, quality, and coordination, as well as quality of life, are important aims of caring for older adults with multiple chronic conditions and/or functional limitations, and person-centered care is presented as an approach that assures the primacy of individuals' health and life goals in their care planning and in their actual care, yet there are no standardized, agreed-upon parameters and there is no standard, agreed-upon definition. The page notes a move toward using the term person-centered rather than patient-centered to encompass the entirety of a person's needs and preferences, beyond just the clinical or medical, and states that person-centered care can expand and shift a traditional healthcare model to support individual choice and autonomy in healthcare decisions. To provide the evidence base to support a definition of person-centered care and its essential elements, The SCAN Foundation charged a team from the American Geriatrics Society in collaboration with the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, and project components included a comprehensive literature review and an environmental scan.

### Rehabilitation definition for research purposes: a global stakeholders' initiative by cochrane rehabilitation [^111YPEAi]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2011, the WHO defined rehabilitation as "a set of measures that assist individuals who experience, or are likely to experience, disability to achieve and maintain optimal functioning in interaction with their environments". This definition slightly evolved in 2017 to "a set of interventions designed to optimize functioning and reduce disability in individuals with health conditions in interaction with their environment". The current definition includes these concepts, with one significant difference. Instead of "a set of measures", the focus is on the "process"; the understanding is that in rehabilitation, measures (interventions) can be combined in different ways (in terms of timing and quantity), not only adding but also multiplying or even subtracting/dividing the effect of each component. Furthermore, we considered that the term "process" better conveys that rehabilitation is dynamic and interactive. Finally, proces* is one of the five roots most used by stakeholders, researchers, and the public in their definitions.

In 2011, Meyer et al.developed a conceptual description of rehabilitation as "the health strategy which, based on WHO's integrative model of functioning, disability and health, applies and integrates approaches to assess functioning in light of health conditions; approaches to optimize a person's capacity; approaches that build on and strengthen the resources of the person; approaches that provide a facilitating environment; approaches that develop a person's performance; approaches that enhance a person's health-related quality of life in partnership between person and provider; and in appreciation of the person's perception of his or her position in life over the course of a health condition and in all age groups; along and across the continuum of care, including hospitals, rehabilitation facilities and the community, and across sectors, including health, education, labor and social affairs; with the goal to enable persons with health conditions experiencing or likely to experience disability to achieve and maintain optimal functioning". The current definition is limited to research in the health sector and focuses only on interventions, not assessments. Nevertheless, the current definition encompasses all the Meyer et al.definition elements. Furthermore, as indicated in our response to a commentary from Ebenbichler et al.we did not incorporate the term "health strategy" in the definition because defining rehabilitation as a strategy "would go beyond the operationalization aspect [that] we need for research purposes".

### ACOG committee opinion no. 394, December 2007. cesarean delivery on maternal request [^115Xzozk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Cesarean delivery on maternal request is defined as a primary cesarean delivery at maternal request in the absence of any medical or obstetric indication. A potential benefit of cesarean delivery on maternal request is decreased risk of hemorrhage for the mother. Potential risks of cesarean delivery on maternal request include a longer maternal hospital stay, an increased risk of respiratory problems for the baby, and greater complications in subsequent pregnancies, including uterine rupture and placental implantation problems. Cesarean delivery on maternal request should not be performed before gestational age of 39 weeks has been accurately determined unless there is documentation of lung maturity. Cesarean delivery on maternal request is not recommended for women desiring several children, given that the risks of placenta previa, placenta accreta, and the need for gravid hysterectomy increase with each cesarean delivery.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^114YFufo]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Individual and public implications of the myocardial infarction definition — Revision of the definition of MI has a number of implications for individuals, health professionals, and society at large. A tentative or final diagnosis guides advice about diagnostic testing, lifestyle changes, treatment, and prognosis, and the aggregate of patients with a particular diagnosis underpins healthcare planning and policy/resource allocation. One goal of good clinical practice is a definitive and specific diagnosis supported by current scientific knowledge, and the approach to the definition of myocardial injury and MI in this document meets this goal. In general, the conceptual meaning of myocardial infarction has not changed, although new sensitive methods have been developed; thus, the diagnosis of an acute MI is a clinical diagnosis based on patient symptoms, ECG changes, highly sensitive biochemical markers, and information from imaging techniques. The universal definition may have consequences for psychological status, insurance, professional career, and driving/pilot licenses, and it bears societal implications for diagnosis-related coding, reimbursement, public health statistics, sick leave, and disability attestation. To meet these challenges, physicians must be adequately informed of the diagnostic criteria.

### Taking account of context in systematic reviews and guidelines considering a complexity perspective [^112M7qDw]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Systematic review teams and guideline development groups face considerable challenges when considering context within the evidence production process. Many complex interventions are context-dependent and are frequently evaluated within considerable contextual variation and change. This paper considers the extent to which current tools used within systematic reviews and guideline development are suitable in meeting these challenges. The paper briefly reviews strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches to specifying context. Illustrative tools are mapped to corresponding stages of the systematic review process. Collectively, systematic review and guideline production reveals a rich diversity of frameworks and tools for handling context. However, current approaches address only specific elements of context, are derived from primary studies which lack information or have not been tested within systematic reviews. A hypothetical example is used to illustrate how context could be integrated throughout the guideline development process. Guideline developers and evidence synthesis organisations should select an appropriate level of contextual detail for their specific guideline that is parsimonious and yet sensitive to health systems contexts and the values, preferences and needs of their target populations.

### The definition of polytrauma: the need for international consensus [^112VJyow]. Injury (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Polytrauma patients represent the ultimate challenge to trauma care and the optimisation of their care is a major focus of clinical and basic science research. A universally accepted definition for polytrauma is vital for comparing datasets and conducting multicentre trials. The purpose of this review is to identify and evaluate the published definitions of the term "polytrauma".

Materials and Methods

A literature search was conducted for the time period January 1950-August 2008. The Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were searched using the keyword "polytrauma". Articles were evaluated without language exclusion for the occurrence of the word "polytrauma" in the text and the presence of a subsequent definition. Relevant online resources and medical dictionaries were also reviewed.

Results

A total of 1,665 publications used the term polytrauma, 47 of which included a definition of the term. The available definitions can be divided into eight groups according to the crux of the definition. No uniformly used consensus definition exists. None of the existing definitions were found to be validated or supported by evidence higher than Level 4.

Conclusion

This review identified the lack of a validated or consensus definition of the term polytrauma. The international trauma community should consider establishing a consensus definition for polytrauma, which could be validated prospectively and serve as a basis for future research.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 560: medically indicated late-preterm and early-term deliveries [^11648CPr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

The neonatal risks of late preterm (34 0/7–36 6/7 weeks of gestation) and early-term (37 0/7–38 6/7 weeks of gestation) births are well established. However, there are a number of maternal, fetal, and placental complications in which either a late-preterm or early-term delivery is warranted. The timing of delivery in such cases must balance the maternal and newborn risks of late-preterm and early-term delivery with the risks of further continuation of pregnancy. Decisions regarding timing of delivery must be individualized. Amniocentesis for the determination of fetal lung maturity in well-dated pregnancies generally should not be used to guide the timing of delivery.

### America's opioid crisis: the need for an integrated public health approach [^112dgxuX]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Addressing social context in settings of care engagement

Prevention interventions can be delivered in diverse settings, including schools, community, healthcare, justice, and other social service settings. Treatment for OUD has traditionally been delivered in the specialty behavioral health treatment system, which largely exists outside the rest of the medical system. Methadone is highly regulated and almost universally delivered in the specialty behavioral treatment system, where as buprenorphine and naltrexone, can be delivered in general medical settings. Increasingly, healthcare settings such as primary care and emergency departments are seen as a key touchpoint for both prevention and treatment services. In parallel, there is increasing recognition that justice settings offer a unique opportunity for providing OUD treatment. Promising approaches to treatment in justice settings include continuing or initiating of medications for opioid sue disorder (MOUDs) while people are incarcerated, or adapting drug court models to incorporate MOUDs. It is important to consider the role of social context across all of these settings for pregnant women, ethnic minorities, and sexual and gender minorities all have specific needs that relate to their social identity and context.

### Delivering the messenger: advances in technologies for therapeutic mRNA delivery [^111viWSb]. Molecular Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

mRNA has broad potential as a therapeutic. Current clinical efforts are focused on vaccination, protein replacement therapies, and treatment of genetic diseases. The clinical translation of mRNA therapeutics has been made possible through advances in the design of mRNA manufacturing and intracellular delivery methods. However, broad application of mRNA is still limited by the need for improved delivery systems. In this review, we discuss the challenges for clinical translation of mRNA-based therapeutics, with an emphasis on recent advances in biomaterials and delivery strategies, and we present an overview of the applications of mRNA-based delivery for protein therapy, gene editing, and vaccination.

### The global need for essential emergency and critical care [^111TXsBT]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Essential emergency and critical care

To improve the care of the critically ill, we propose a new focus on "essential emergency and critical care" (EECC). We define EECC as "care that all critically ill patients should receive in all hospitals in the world". EECC is a concept that should be a crucial part of universal health coverage; it is low-cost and appropriate for all countries in all settings in the world, and is intended for patients irrespective of age, gender, underlying diagnosis, medical specialty, or location. EECC is a set of actions and treatments plus the system-wide requirements for their provision. For simplicity of definition, we limit EECC to care in hospitals, rather than in primary care clinics or the pre-hospital environment.

As the critically ill are a heterogeneous group it is important to define what is not included in EECC. It is not the diagnosis and definitive treatment that focus on the pathophysiological cause of the critical illness — actions which are also important for the patient — and it is not the "advanced emergency and critical care" that may also be available in high-resource settings (Fig. 2). EECC is the low-cost, most basic level of emergency and critical care and should be provided in all settings. The available resources will determine what additional care is appropriate or possible. EECC is not the palliative care required for dying patients, or care when a patient's condition is so severe that recovery has been deemed impossible. While the decision to provide palliative care instead of EECC can be very challenging, it is nevertheless of great importance and the adoption of EECC must not be allowed to lead to increased suffering for patients for whom there is no hope of a good recovery.

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^116efiEL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for advanced maternal age pregnancy, more specifically with respect to indications for delivery, ACOG 2022 guidelines recommend to consider counseling patients that vaginal delivery is safe and appropriate if there are no other maternal or fetal indications for Cesarean delivery. Include a discussion of the risks of Cesarean delivery, the patient's comorbidities, and the patient's preferences and goals. Recognize that advancing patient age alone is not an indication for Cesarean delivery.

### Recognition and management of medical complexity [^116coi3h]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Recognizing medical complexity — conceptual definition and assessment approaches specify that "Medical complexity is conceptually regarded as a combination of multiorgan system involvement from chronic health condition(s), functional limitations, ongoing use of medical technology, and high resource need/use". Recognition is challenging because "different constructs of complexity may exist at the individual as well as the population level", and "Clinicians may subjectively identify complexity" using factors not available in population data. Accordingly, "Because no consensus yet exists on recognizing complexity on the population level, multiple tools, such as a diagnosis classification scheme and a questionnaire, may be needed to recognize the multiple attributes of complexity", while "Limiting the construct of complexity to high health care resource use or multiple diagnosed medical conditions… may hamper the development of resources and policies" and "does not embrace PFCC principles". For functional status, "Functional limitations are best understood by using the framework of the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF)", which clarifies that "when a specific body system or body part's functioning is affected, the person has an impairment;… the person has an activity limitation; and… he or she has a participation restriction", exemplified by "CMC who are unable to attend school because of their health have participation restrictions".

### Forensic and medical legal issues in addiction psychiatry [^116v5Jdy]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

There is a broad range of forensic issues in addiction psychiatry. For many psychiatrists, what is most challenging about addressing these issues is their origin in the law, which is a system and a way of thinking that may feel foreign to the medical practitioner. To address forensic issues, addiction psychiatrists should learn and understand the specific legal questions that arise in each forensic context. They should become familiar with the relevant definitions, criteria, and legal requirements that apply in each specific area of their practice, rather than assume that clinical definitions and reasoning will carry them. If they perform forensic evaluations, addiction psychiatrists must distance themselves from the wish to help the examinee, focusing on the role of neutral examiner. Comfort and effectiveness with forensic issues require familiarity with, knowledge of, and ultimately respect for the forensic contexts of addiction psychiatric practice.

### Introduction to entrustable professional activities for pediatric surgery [^115cp4kM]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) have emerged as a valuable tool in medical education, enabling the assessment of trainee competence in a real-world context. Despite its growing popularity in other medical specialties, the use of EPAs in pediatric surgery is still relatively new.

Methods

This article provides an overview of the development and application of EPAs in pediatric surgery. The key concepts and principles of EPAs, including the historical development and current implementation in other medical specialties, will also be reviewed. Definition of pediatric surgery EPAs, advantages, and challenges of implementing EPAs in pediatric surgery, and the evidence supporting the use of EPAs in pediatric surgical training will also be examined.

Results

The use of EPAs in pediatric surgery has shown promise in providing a comprehensive and standardized approach to assessing trainee competence. By focusing on the essential tasks and responsibilities of a pediatric surgeon, EPAs can provide a framework for measuring trainee progress and ensuring that they possess the necessary skills to perform their duties independently. Challenges in implementing EPAs in pediatric surgery include the need for consensus on the definition and scope of EPAs, as well as the establishment of appropriate assessment and evaluation tools.

Conclusion

The use of EPAs in pediatric surgery education and training has the potential to enhance the training and ultimately the quality of care delivered to pediatric surgical patients. The development of appropriate assessment and evaluation tools and frameworks will be crucial in implementing EPAs effectively in this field.
