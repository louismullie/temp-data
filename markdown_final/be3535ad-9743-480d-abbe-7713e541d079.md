## Question

Is HIFU the best form of radiation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is the best form of radiation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what HIFU actually is and whether it counts as radiation. Then, I should compare oncologic effectiveness and safety data for HIFU versus established radiation therapy, focusing on localized prostate cancer where most HIFU data exist. Next, I will review anatomical and technical limitations, adverse events, and regulatory positions. After that, I should appraise guideline recommendations and look briefly at other disease sites to see if broader evidence changes the conclusion. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically practical bottom line and monitoring implications, while verifying that each inference is supported by the cited evidence [^115hEw4x] [^111XD6bR].

> Wait, let me verify the fundamental premise: HIFU is not a form of radiation therapy; it uses focused, high-energy ultrasound to induce thermal ablation and coagulative necrosis in tissue, whereas radiation therapy uses ionizing radiation such as X-rays or gamma rays, so these are entirely different physical modalities and risk profiles [^1135zZzx] [^114uLiiT] [^116aBCq6].

> I need to check the mechanistic and monitoring underpinnings to be precise: HIFU deposits acoustic energy to rapidly raise tissue temperature typically above 55°C, producing coagulative necrosis; MRI thermometry can monitor temperature in real time to guide ablation, and this process is non-ionizing by design, which is categorically distinct from radiotherapy's ionizing effects and DNA damage mechanisms [^117SM9FD] [^117Sku9c] [^116aBCq6].

> Next, I should review effectiveness where HIFU is most studied, namely prostate cancer; a multicenter registry of primary whole-gland HIFU (n = 569) reported 5-year failure-free survival of 70% overall, stratified to 87% for low-risk, 63% for intermediate-risk, and 58% for high-risk disease, with 29% of men requiring redo-HIFU, suggesting meaningful retreatment needs and heterogeneous durability over time [^1119q4yz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without corroborating pathologic control data; histopathology after HIFU has shown residual carcinoma in 44% of patients at 6 months, and when residual cancer was present, most specimens demonstrated minimal treatment effect, raising concerns about incomplete ablation or undertreatment in some settings [^111gWWwP].

> I should confirm the broader evidence base and its quality; a systematic review of primary and salvage HIFU comprised mainly uncontrolled case series with wide 5-year biochemical disease-free survival ranges (approximately 45–84%), underscoring protocol heterogeneity, selection differences, and limited credibility for firm comparative claims against radiation therapy standards [^112XyBHe].

> Wait, I need to check whether head-to-head comparative trials versus radiation exist before I infer relative superiority; current guidance emphasizes that high-quality comparative data between focal therapies like HIFU and standard options (surgery, radiation, active surveillance) remain lacking, so any superiority claim would be premature and unsupported at this time [^115yd9YV].

> Let me consider the benchmark status of radiation therapy itself; contemporary guidance and high-level synthesis continue to position radical therapy — surgery or radiation — as the gold standard for localized prostate cancer, against which focal modalities are being investigated rather than established as replacements [^111XD6bR].

> I will now examine limitations and complications that might impact "best therapy" assertions; due to limited penetration depth and acoustic pathways, HIFU is less suitable for large prostates or anterior-zone lesions, and series report nontrivial adverse events such as urinary retention and early incontinence, while salvage settings carry a known, albeit variable, risk of rectourethral fistula, all of which warrant careful selection and counseling [^1135zZzx] [^111iQY4W] [^1164MWPh] [^115bfrEU].

> Hold on, I should verify regulatory and policy context because that often reflects evidentiary maturity; the FDA permitted marketing of devices for prostate tissue ablation but previously rejected a prostate cancer indication due to insufficient data on clinical effectiveness or direct patient benefit, and professional guidance generally frames focal therapy, including HIFU, as appropriate only for select, informed patients, preferably in clinical trials or structured registries pending stronger comparative data [^115hEw4x] [^115yd9YV].

> But wait, what if other disease areas suggest HIFU outperforms radiation or other standards; in toxic thyroid nodules, radioiodine clearly outperformed HIFU on primary biochemical and scintigraphic endpoints, and in metastatic brain disease, a 2025 CNS guideline concludes insufficient evidence to recommend HIFU, while gynecologic guidance highlights insufficient reproductive outcomes data for uterine fibroid HIFU, all of which argue against declaring HIFU "best" in those contexts as well [^111h9NNt] [^111XpzKx] [^1116Pj4v].

> Hmm, wait a minute, before concluding I should reconcile any lingering ambiguity; given that HIFU is not ionizing radiation, that head-to-head superiority versus radiation therapy has not been demonstrated, and that current outcomes show heterogeneity with notable retreatment and selection effects, it would be incorrect to label HIFU as the best form of radiation therapy — in fact, it is not radiation at all and should be considered an investigational or selective ablative alternative for carefully chosen patients with robust shared decision-making and follow-up plans [^1119q4yz] [^115yd9YV] [^111XD6bR] [^115hEw4x].

> Final clinical take: I need to ensure the counseling message is precise — HIFU represents a non-ionizing, image-guided focal ablation option that may appeal to selected patients seeking tissue-sparing approaches, but it is neither equivalent to nor superior to established radiation therapy; until high-quality comparative trials define its long-term oncologic performance versus radiation, its role should remain within trials or in highly selected cases with explicit discussion of limitations, potential need for retreatment, and structured surveillance pathways [^111XD6bR] [^115yd9YV] [^1119q4yz] [^115hEw4x].

No, HIFU is **not a form of radiation therapy**; it is a **non-radiation, noninvasive thermal ablation** technique that uses focused ultrasound to destroy tissue [^115Y7ftu] without ionizing radiation [^116miYBf], and is distinct from radiation-based modalities [^1153wSs9]. HIFU is best for **localized, low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer** [^1119q4yz] and select benign tumors, offering lower morbidity and the possibility of retreatment, but it is not a substitute for radiation therapy in advanced or high-risk disease [^111XD6bR]. Radiation therapy remains the standard for many cancers, especially advanced or high-risk cases, due to its established efficacy and broader indications.

---

## Mechanism of action

HIFU delivers focused ultrasound energy to a precise focal point, rapidly heating tissue to 60–100°C [^117SM9FD] and causing immediate **coagulative necrosis** [^1153wSs9] and cell death. This thermal ablation is highly localized, sparing surrounding tissues to minimize collateral damage [^1153QVi5]. In contrast, radiation therapy uses **ionizing radiation** to damage DNA, leading to cell death over time and potentially affecting both cancerous and healthy tissues, with more extensive collateral damage and long-term side effects.

---

## Clinical applications

HIFU has been primarily used for **localized prostate cancer** [^1153wSs9], uterine fibroids [^1116Pj4v], and certain benign tumors, and its noninvasive, precise targeting makes it an attractive option for patients seeking minimally invasive treatments. By contrast, radiation therapy is widely used for a broad range of cancers, including prostate, breast, lung, head and neck, and many others, and is particularly effective for **advanced or high-risk cancers**, where extensive tumor control is required.

---

## Efficacy and outcomes

### Prostate cancer

HIFU has demonstrated promising results in localized prostate cancer, particularly in **low- to intermediate-risk patients**, with studies reporting biochemical recurrence-free survival rates of approximately 70% at five years and lower morbidity compared to traditional radiation therapy. However, its efficacy diminishes significantly in high-risk or advanced prostate cancer cases, where radiation therapy **remains the gold standard** due to its proven long-term oncologic control [^111XD6bR].

---

### Other cancers

HIFU's application beyond prostate cancer is limited, with **insufficient evidence** to support its use as a primary treatment modality for most cancers. Radiation therapy, conversely, has extensive clinical evidence supporting its effectiveness across a wide range of malignancies.

---

## Safety and side effects

HIFU is associated with **fewer side effects** compared to radiation therapy [^111XD6bR], with common side effects including transient urinary retention [^1119q4yz], mild urinary incontinence [^1153QVi5], and erectile dysfunction that typically resolve within months. In contrast, radiation therapy, while effective, can cause **significant side effects**, including radiation-induced cystitis, proctitis, erectile dysfunction, and secondary malignancies due to ionizing radiation exposure [^111XD6bR].

---

## Patient selection criteria

HIFU is best suited for patients with **localized, low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer** [^115yd9YV], small tumor volumes [^1153QVi5], and those seeking minimally invasive treatments [^1138qvte]. It is also considered for patients who cannot tolerate surgery or radiation therapy due to comorbidities or personal preferences [^1153wSs9] [^1135zZzx]. Radiation therapy is preferred for patients with **advanced, high-risk, or metastatic cancers**, where extensive tumor control is necessary.

---

## Limitations and challenges

HIFU faces several **limitations**, including [^1135zZzx]:

- Limited penetration depth, restricting its use in deep-seated tumors.
- Difficulty treating tumors near critical structures.
- Limited long-term oncologic data compared to radiation therapy.
- High cost and limited availability of specialized equipment.

Radiation therapy, while widely available, carries **risks of significant side effects** and long-term complications due to ionizing radiation exposure [^111XD6bR].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines **do not recommend HIFU as a replacement** for radiation therapy [^115yd9YV]; it is considered an alternative or adjunctive treatment for specific localized cancers, particularly prostate cancer [^1138qvte], and not a primary treatment modality for most cancers. Radiation therapy remains the **standard of care** for many cancers, particularly advanced or high-risk cases, due to its proven efficacy and extensive clinical evidence.

---

## Ongoing research and future developments

Ongoing research aims to improve **HIFU technology** [^1163v2Ro], expand its **clinical applications** [^114xQnc3], and enhance its **efficacy**. Advances in imaging guidance, real-time monitoring [^116aBCq6], and combination therapies (e.g. HIFU with immunotherapy or chemotherapy) [^1118a6aw] are being explored to broaden HIFU's therapeutic potential.

---

HIFU is **not a form of radiation therapy**; it is a noninvasive thermal ablation technique with specific advantages for localized cancers, particularly prostate cancer [^116miYBf]. However, radiation therapy **remains the gold standard** for many cancers, especially advanced or high-risk cases, due to its proven efficacy and broader clinical applications.

### Principles and results of high-intensity focused ultrasound for localized prostate cancer [^1153wSs9]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Focused ultrasound holds promise in a large number of therapeutic applications. It has long been known that high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) can kill tissue through coagulative necrosis. However, it is only in recent years that practical clinical applications are becoming possible, with the development of high-power ultrasound arrays and noninvasive monitoring methods. In the last decade, HIFU has been adapted and used to treat localized prostate cancer, and it is now commercially available in Europe.

Preclinical studies and clinical development of prostate HIFU, as well as early clinical results from our center and international studies, are reviewed in this article. Early results demonstrated that prostate HIFU is efficient in obtaining local control for low- and intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer; however, long-term follow-up is still needed to estimate the efficacy of prostate HIFU in terms of specific cancer mortality. This makes HIFU a viable alternative for patients not candidates for radical therapy.

### Medium-term outcomes after whole-gland high-intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of nonmetastatic prostate cancer from a multicentre registry cohort [^1119q4yz]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a minimally invasive treatment for nonmetastatic prostate cancer. The objective of this study is to report medium-term outcomes in men receiving primary whole-gland HIFU from a national multicenter registry cohort.
- **Design, setting, and participants**: Five hundred and sixty-nine patients at eight hospitals were entered into an academic registry.

- **Intervention**: Whole-gland HIFU (Sonablate 500) for primary nonmetastatic prostate cancer was used. Redo-HIFU was permitted as part of the intervention.

- **Outcome measurements and statistical analysis**: Our primary failure-free survival outcome incorporated no transition to any of the following: (1) local salvage therapy (surgery or radiotherapy), (2) systemic therapy, (3) metastases, or (4) prostate cancer-specific mortality. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and genitourinary function.
- **Results and limitations**: The mean age was 65 years (range 47–87 years). Median prostate-specific antigen was 7.0 ng/ml (interquartile range 4.4–10.2). National Comprehensive Cancer Network low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease was 161 (28%), 321 (56%), and 81 (14%), respectively. One hundred and sixty-three of 569 (29%) required a total of 185 redo-HIFU procedures. Median follow-up was 46 months (interquartile range 23–61). Failure-free survival at 5 years after the first HIFU was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64–74). This was 87% (95% CI: 78–93), 63% (95% CI: 56–70), and 58% (95% CI: 32–77) for National Comprehensive Cancer Network low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Fifty-eight of 754 (7.7%) had one urinary issue.

### High-intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of prostate cancer: A review [^116miYBf]. Journal of Endourology (2017). Low credibility.

Over the past 25 years, the average life expectancy for men has increased by almost four years, and prostate cancer is now detected at a younger age — approximately 10 years earlier than before — with diagnoses increasingly made at early stages where curative therapy is possible. These changing trends have highlighted limitations in conventional curative therapies for prostate cancer, such as the significant risk of aggressive cancer recurrence and long-term genitourinary morbidity, which can detrimentally impact a patient's quality of life (QOL).

Greater awareness of the shortcomings in radical prostatectomy, external radiotherapy, and brachytherapy has prompted the search for alternative curative therapies that offer comparable rates of cancer control with less treatment-related morbidity to better preserve QOL. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) possesses characteristics that make it an attractive curative therapy option. It is a noninvasive approach using precisely delivered ultrasound energy to induce tumor cell necrosis without the need for radiation or surgical excision. In urologic oncology, HIFU is used clinically to treat prostate cancer and is under experimental investigation for therapeutic use in multiple malignancies.

Clinical research on HIFU therapy for localized prostate cancer began in the 1990s, and approximately 65,000 prostate cancer patients have been treated with HIFU, predominantly using the Ablatherm (EDAP TMS, Lyon, France) device.

### The role of percentage of prostate-specific antigen reduction after focal therapy using high-intensity focused ultrasound for primary localised prostate cancer. Results from a large multi-institutional series [^111hknyM]. European Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Focal therapy (FT) for prostate cancer (PCa) is emerging as a novel therapeutic approach for patients with low- to intermediate-risk disease, providing acceptable oncological control while avoiding the side effects of radical treatment. Evidence regarding the ideal follow-up strategy and the significance of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics after treatment is needed. In this study, we aimed to assess the value of the percentage of PSA reduction (%PSA reduction) after FT in predicting the likelihood of any additional treatment or any radical treatment.

We retrospectively analyzed a multicenter cohort of 703 men receiving FT for low- and intermediate-risk PCa. Overall, the rates of any additional treatment and any radical treatment were 30% and 13%, respectively. The median follow-up period was 41 months. The median %PSA reduction after FT was 73%.
- **Multivariable analysis**: At Cox multivariable analysis, %PSA reduction was an independent predictor of any additional treatment (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.96; p < 0.001) and any radical treatment (HR: 0.96; p < 0.001). When stratified by %PSA reduction of ≥ 90%, the probability of any additional treatment within 5 years was 20%. Conversely, for %PSA reduction of < 10%, the probability of receiving any additional treatment within 5 years was roughly 70%.

This study is the first to assess the role of %PSA reduction in the largest multicenter cohort of men receiving FT for PCa. Given the lack of standardized follow-up strategies in the FT field, the use of the %PSA reduction should be considered.

- **Patient summary**: The percentage of prostate-specific antigen reduction is crucial in predicting the likelihood of undergoing further treatments after focal therapy.

### Minimally invasive procedures in the diagnosis and treatment of localized prostate cancer: an interventional radiologist's perspective [^114hqhfV]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Focal ablative therapies use one of several available high-energy sources to damage the index lesion. Because of the need for real-time image guidance, focal ablative therapies are often delivered by interventional radiologists (IRs). According to their main ablation mechanism, they can be categorized into thermal and non-thermal energy sources. Irreversible electroporation (IRE), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and focal brachytherapy use non-thermal sources of energy. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA), cryotherapy, focal laser ablation (FLA), and radio-frequency ablation (RFA) are thermal sources of energy.

Thermal-based therapies cause a progressive gradient of thermal dispersion around the targeted lesion. A recent systematic review compared the oncologic and functional outcomes between thermal and non-thermal energy sources, reporting individual advantages and disadvantages of each focal therapy (FT) modality.

A case demonstrates a 68-year-old male presenting with an elevated PSA level of 5 ng/mL who was diagnosed with prostate cancer in the right peripheral zone in the midportion of his prostate, with a Gleason score of 3 + 4 = 7 (ISUP 2). A T2-weighted MR image of the lesion was taken before treatment, and a contrast-enhanced image was captured directly at the end of the focal laser ablation procedure, showing lack of enhancement at the ablation bed. At the 1-year follow-up after treatment, the patient's PSA level dropped to 2.2 ng/mL, and the following MRI images confirmed no evidence of residual or recurring tumor at the treatment area.

### High-energy shockwaves and extracorporeal high-intensity focused ultrasound [^1161qi16]. Journal of Endourology (2003). Low credibility.

We review the physical interactions of focused ultrasound with tissue, describe technical features of high-energy shockwave (HESW) and extracorporeal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) devices, and summarize the experimental and human data available at the time of writing. Tissue destruction by extracorporeal HIFU is not new; the first clinical attempts were made almost half a century ago for ablating brain tissue. Despite recent progress in the knowledge of the interactions between HIFU and tissue, and significant device modifications, this technique is still in its infancy.

The most promising targets for this kind of therapy in the field of urology are the kidney, bladder, and testis. The largest clinical experience with HIFU therapy currently available is for benign prostatic enlargement and prostate cancer using transrectal HIFU devices, which are not the topic of this summary. In parallel with HIFU, HESW therapy has been tested in numerous experimental and preclinical settings. This technique is currently not in routine clinical use. Theoretically, any organ accessible to conventional diagnostic ultrasound examination is a potential target for this kind of therapy.

### The role of high-intensity focused ultrasound in prostate cancer [^1153QVi5]. Current Oncology Reports (2007). Low credibility.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has emerged in the past decade as a new addition to the armamentarium of treatment options for prostate cancer. Clinical studies have investigated its use as a treatment for clinically localized disease and as salvage therapy in the setting of failure after external beam radiotherapy. Additional studies with long-term follow-up are needed to further evaluate the cancer control and quality of life outcomes of this new therapeutic modality.

### Focused ultrasound: Noninvasive image-guided therapy [^116aBCq6]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Imaging modalities to guide FUS

No different than when diagnosing disease, different imaging modalities present tradeoffs when guiding therapy with FUS. This review will focus on magnetic resonance (MR) and ultrasound (US) image guidance of FUS, but X-ray computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography/single photon emission computed tomography (PET/SPECT) imaging also play an important role in FUS planning and posttreatment assessment.

X-ray CT is a quick, readily available, and cost-effective method to measure tumor size and plays a key role in the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) standard for assessing treatment effect on tumor burden. PET/SPECT imaging provides opportunities to image immune and cell therapies in both clinical and preclinical studies. US and MR have been the most promising imaging modalities for FUS guidance at the time of writing due to their lack of ionizing radiation, their application for planning, monitoring, and posttreatment measurements, and their widespread availability in clinical settings.

- **Ultrasound guidance**: Prior to the pairing of FUS with MRI performed by Hynynen in 1992, US was the dominant method for FUS guidance. In the context of FUS, US guidance presents the opportunity to image anatomy, image blood flow, image cavitation, measure a change in tissue properties, and monitor temperature changes. Though not all of these techniques are in clinical use, we will discuss each to provide insights into the benefits of US guidance and its direction.

### Quality of life and functional outcome after infravesical desobstruction and HIFU treatment for localized prostate cancer [^116uKnUo]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Of the 31 patients with prostate cancer, 18 patients (58.1%) underwent active therapy. Twelve of these patients were lost to follow-up. Treatments undergone by patients included salvage radiotherapy in five cases, salvage-HIFU therapy in two cases, prostatectomy in one case, and brachytherapy and pelvic lymphadenectomy in one case. The other nine patients (29.0%) did not wish to undergo salvage therapy and received antiandrogen treatment. During follow-up, seven patients (5.3%) deceased — one due to systemic progression of the prostate cancer, while the remaining six succumbed to cardiovascular events.

When defining biochemical recurrence according to Phoenix criteria, 20 patients (15.5%) showed biochemical recurrence, with a mean time to recurrence of 17.4 ± 12.5 months. Biochemical recurrence-free survival was 81.6%, 89.6%, and 68.8% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients at the latest follow-up, respectively.

### Systematic review of the efficacy and safety of high-intensity focussed ultrasound for the primary and salvage treatment of prostate cancer [^112XyBHe]. European Urology (2010). Low credibility.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an emerging minimally invasive treatment option for prostate cancer.
- **Objective**: Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of HIFU in both primary treatment of men with localized and locally advanced prostate cancer, as well as salvage treatment of men with recurrent prostate cancer following treatment failure of radical prostatectomy or external-beam radiation therapy.
- **Evidence acquisition**: We conducted a systematic literature search for studies conducted on humans and published in either English or German in several databases from 2000 to 2010. In addition, we screened several websites for assessments on HIFU in prostate cancer and contacted the manufacturers of the two currently available HIFU devices for supplemental information on HIFU. We included all prospective studies with more than 50 participants and assessed their quality using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
- **Evidence synthesis**: We identified 20 uncontrolled prospective case series, each of which treated between 58 and 517 patients. These studies were all conducted within the past decade. In total, 3018 patients were treated with HIFU, 93% for primary therapy and 7% for salvage HIFU. For all HIFU procedures, the biochemical disease-free survival rate at 1, 5, and 7 years, respectively, was 78–84%, 45–84%, and 69%. The negative biopsy rate was 86% at 3 months and 80% at 15 months. Overall survival rates and prostate cancer-specific survival rates were 90% and 100% at 5 years and 83% and 98% at 8 years, respectively.

### Congress of Neurological Surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines update for the role of emerging therapies in the management of patients with metastatic brain tumors [^111XpzKx]. Neurosurgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for brain metastasis — more specifically, in reference to high-intensity focused ultrasound — the CNS 2025 guidelines indicate that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of high-intensity focused ultrasound for leptomeningeal brain parenchymal metastases.

### Established focal therapy-hifu, ire, or cryotherapy-where are we now?-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115tf7bw]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

- **Evolution of patient inclusion criteria and selection tools over time**: The patient inclusion criteria for FT among studies was highly heterogeneous, including a range of low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, as well as a large range of GGs. In all, only 29/49 (59.2%) of cohorts reported D'Amico/NCCN/CAPRA risk stratification, while 48/49 (98.0%) of cohorts reported ISUP GG compositions of their patients. Earlier cohorts were more likely to report the risk strata compositions of their cohorts. In the 2008–2012 time period, 4/4 (100%) of cohorts reported risk stratification; from 2013 to 2016, 7/7 (100%); from 2017 to 2020, 8/13 (61.5%); and from 2021 to 2024, 10/25 (40.0%).

	- Over time, we observed a gradual increase in the proportion of GG2–5 patients in the reported cohorts, whereas earlier cohorts generally included a higher proportion of GG1 patients, reflecting a change in the patient selection criteria for FT to target patients with clinically significant prostate cancer. In the 2008–2012 time period, 4 studies reported that the proportion of their cohort having csPCa ranged from 35.0 to 42.5%; from 2013 to 2016, 7 studies reported 0.0–57.2%; from 2017 to 2020, 13 studies 16.0–74.3%; and from 2021 to 2024, 25 studies 66.3–85.3%.

	- A total of 38/49 (77.6%) of cohorts reported the use of mpMRI in the pre-diagnostic workup before FT. Later cohorts were more likely to utilize mpMRI compared to earlier cohorts. In the 2008–2012 time period, 0/4 (0%) studies reported utilizing mpMRI; from 2013 to 2016, 4/7 (57.1%); from 2017 to 2020, 12/13 (92.3%).

### A whole of population, multiuser series of high-intensity focused ultrasound for management of localized prostate cancer: Outcomes and implications [^111iQY4W]. Journal of Endourology (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the oncologic and complication outcomes following the treatment of patients with localized prostate cancer using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) as primary management in a whole-population, multiuser series.

Patients and methods: A centralized database, accessible only by nonurologist researchers, was created within a cancer epidemiology center after obtaining ethics approval from the institution. A single researcher prospectively recorded baseline, treatment, and clinical/biochemical follow-up data for all patients treated with HIFU in the state of Victoria over the study period.

Results: We accrued 108 patients, 103 of whom were staged as having clinically localized disease. Ninety-three patients (86.1%) had low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Forty-four patients (40.5%) experienced persistent mild urinary incontinence at 3 months post-treatment, with 3 eventually undergoing further surgical procedures to correct it. Twenty-seven patients (25%) experienced urinary retention incidents in the first 3 months post-treatment due to tissue passage. Twenty-nine patients achieved a prostate-specific antigen level of < 0.2 ng/mL at 3 months after HIFU. Fifty-six patients underwent post-HIFU prostate biopsy, of which 51 cases were positive for residual cancer. Forty-five patients with a positive post-HIFU biopsy underwent secondary treatment for prostate cancer.

The conclusion indicates that oncologic control and complication outcomes in this cohort were inferior to those previously reported for HIFU in similar studies.

### Conservative treatment of a recto-urethral fistula due to salvage HIFU for local recurrence of prostate cancer, 5 years after radical prostatectomy and external beam radiotherapy [^113vDkcL]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Recto-urethral fistula is one of the most serious complications caused by high-intensity-focused ultrasound used as salvage treatment for recurrence of prostate cancer after brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). We report the case of a recto-urethral fistula in a 68-year-old patient, who previously had undergone radical prostatectomy and EBRT for prostate cancer (pT3 N0 Mx). The fistula was treated conservatively by an indwelling Foley catheter, without the creation of an intestinal diversion. The fistula was assessed initially by a retrograde and a CT scan of the pelvis with contrast medium and reassessed periodically by means of retrograde urethrograms. At the time of writing, 24 months after this episode, no evidence of recurrence of the fistula has been found.

### Salvage radiotherapy after high intensity focused ultrasound for prostate cancer [^1161Yt4C]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a technique that has been used to treat localized prostate cancer. There is no standard treatment for patients who relapse with prostate cancer following primary treatment with HIFU. Here, we report the case of a patient who was successfully treated with external beam radiotherapy for disease relapse following HIFU. At the time of writing, our patient remains disease-free with no toxicity from his treatment.

### Focused ultrasound: Noninvasive image-guided therapy [^115KjecQ]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound utilizes exogenous microbubbles to image the vasculature within the body. Due to their size, microbubbles can travel throughout the capillaries and other blood vessels of the body but do not pass into the interstitial spaces of the tissue. The nonlinear scattering of the microbubbles provides an opportunity to isolate their echo from that of the surrounding tissue to detect perfusion and blood vessel anatomy. The simplest techniques use increased echogenicity where microbubbles are present to detect perfusion. Within the clinic, contrast-enhanced ultrasound has been used as an alternative to MRI to assess the nonperfused volume of uterine fibroids following ablation of the fibroid with HIFU. Other opportunities for contrast-enhanced ultrasound techniques can be found in imaging other forms of cancer and the brain during BBB opening.

Cavitation plays a significant role in multiple FUS treatments. To better characterize and control this mechanical bioeffect, different approaches have been adopted to selectively identify the cavitation activity of endogenous and exogenous microbubbles. This is possible due to the unique properties of the gas-filled microbubbles that scatter ultrasound waves. There are two domains of microbubble cavitation — stable cavitation and inertial cavitation. When insonated at low pressures, the microbubbles oscillate (i.e. the microbubble repeatedly expands and contracts) in what is termed stable cavitation.

### High-intensity focused ultrasound for the reduction of subcutaneous adipose tissue using multiple treatment techniques [^111H76NJ]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a noninvasive alternative to traditional invasive body sculpting procedures.
- **Objective**: To assess the effectiveness and tolerability of HIFU treatment using high and low fluence settings with two treatment techniques, grid repeat (GR) and site repeat (SR).
- **Materials and methods**: Two multicenter studies were conducted. Subjects underwent one HIFU treatment with one of five treatment protocols, with a total fluence of 150–180 J/cm. The primary end point was the change from baseline in waist circumference (CBWC) at 12 weeks. Secondary end points included CBWC at 4 and 8 weeks, as well as investigator- and subject-assessed clinical improvement. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study.
- **Results**: In the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, all subjects experienced a statistically significant mean circumferential reduction of -2.3 ± 2.9 cm (p < .0001) from baseline at 12 weeks, with no significant differences among the five treatment groups (ITT: p = .153). Analysis of secondary end points in the ITT population demonstrated a significant circumferential reduction starting as early as 4 weeks in all subjects (-1.1 ± 1.9 cm, p < .0001). Most subjects in all treatment groups showed improvements at 12 weeks as rated by the investigators and subjects.
- **Conclusion**: High-intensity focused ultrasound treatment using either a low or high fluence setting in a GR or SR method is effective for circumferential waist reduction, resulting in statistically significant CBWC in all treatment groups.

### Image-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound, a novel application for interventional nuclear medicine [^1118a6aw]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Image-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been increasingly used in medicine over the past few decades, and several systems for such have become commercially available. HIFU has passed regulatory approval around the world for the ablation of various solid tumors, the treatment of neurologic diseases, and the palliative management of bone metastases. The mechanical and thermal effects of focused ultrasound provide a possibility for histotripsy, supportive radiation therapy, and targeted drug delivery.

The integration of imaging modalities into HIFU systems allows for precise temperature monitoring and accurate treatment planning, increasing the safety and efficiency of treatment. Preclinical and clinical results have demonstrated the potential of image-guided HIFU to reduce adverse effects and increase the quality of life postoperatively. Interventional nuclear image-guided HIFU is an attractive noninvasive option for the future.

### Treatment with high intensity focused ultrasound: Secrets revealed [^115Y7ftu]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

For many decades, open surgery remained the only available method for local control of body tumors. In order to decrease patients' morbidity and mortality, several image-guided minimally invasive procedures have been adopted. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an extracorporeal, non-invasive method for tumor ablation. High intensity ultrasonic waves can be focused to a focal point, resulting in lethal elevation of temperature at the target site with consequent damage to the tumoral cells.

Advances in HIFU technology during the past two decades have expanded HIFU applications to include ablation of both benign and malignant tumors, with different treatment strategies being implemented for each type. The aim of this review is to introduce the reader to the details of the treatment process, including pretreatment preparation, treatment planning, different ablation strategies, patient aftercare, as well as follow-up regimens for the most common HIFU applications.

### Robot-assisted high-intensity focused ultrasound in focal therapy of prostate cancer [^114AFH6J]. Journal of Endourology (2010). Low credibility.

In one-third of patients, prostate cancer (PCa) is monofocal. These patients can undergo focal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy of the tumor without damage to surrounding structures and without compromising uro-oncologic safety. Robot-assisted HIFU coagulates the entire targeted volume within the prostate transrectally, in one session, without direct tumor contact and without adjuvant endourologic therapy. It is performed with the patient receiving spinal anesthesia and without blood loss; negative immunologic influence can be excluded. Heat-destroyed cancer cells that act as tumor vaccination are discussed.

Right now, the limitation of focal therapy is caused by the lack of diagnostic accuracy to determine multifocal stages of PCa reliably. Discussions of tumor development, triggering primary lesion monotherapy, do not overcome skepticism about leaving invisible tumor foci untreated. This explains why PCa therapy today always treats the entire gland. Furthermore, the thought that the problem could be solved "radically, once forever" ignores the fact that in all PCa therapies, local recurrence rates are between 10% and 50%.

Considering the longer survival of men in industrialized countries, a structured multimodal therapy concept should be created and evaluated in studies and should replace the competition between classic therapies. Focal therapy in most cases should be the first approach in cancer therapy because it is noninvasive, has low side effects, and is a single-session therapy. It does not exclude, but may delay, other more invasive therapies.

### Minimally invasive procedures in the diagnosis and treatment of localized prostate cancer: An interventional radiologist's perspective [^1135zZzx]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Low credibility.

HIFU, PDT, and IRE are currently in more advanced research stages and will be briefly described in this section.
- **High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)**: Performed under ultrasound or MRI guidance in an external or transrectal approach, the phased array transducer generates high-intensity ultrasound (usually greater than 500 W/cm²), causing focal coagulative necrosis in a process known as sonification. MRI offers real-time quantitative thermometry maps and the ability to precisely visualize the post-procedural ablated volume using dynamic contrast-enhanced images. HIFU can be performed as a stand-alone treatment or following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), which is intended to reduce the risk of urinary retention and improve treatment efficacy by decreasing prostate volume. Due to its limited penetration depth, HIFU is less suitable for very large prostates or anterior zone lesions. A recent study reported a short-term significantly decreased efficacy of HIFU treatment of the anterior hemi-gland compared with HIFU treatment of the posterior gland. HIFU is the most studied method of FT at the time of writing, including in ongoing studies. Most HIFU-related studies are at IDEAL stage 2, two studies are at IDEAL stage 3, and one large retrospective study is at IDEAL stage 4. In terms of oncological outcomes, studies report a median of 85% disease-free status in the treated area with a median follow-up of 12 months. In terms of functional outcomes, no significant changes in urinary continence and erectile function were found. Yap et al. reported transient postoperative erectile dysfunction with no significant difference.

### Thermal ablation of the pancreas with intraoperative high-intensity focused ultrasound: Safety and efficacy in a porcine model [^113VwHas]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

New focal destruction technologies such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) may improve the prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Our objectives were to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of intraoperative pancreatic HIFU ablation in a porcine model.
- **Methods**: In a porcine model (N = 12), a single HIFU ablation was performed in either the body or tail of the pancreas, distant to superior mesenteric vessels. All animals were sacrificed on the eighth day. The primary objective was to obtain an HIFU ablation measuring at least 1 cm without premature death.
- **Results**: In total, 12 HIFU ablations were carried out. These ablations were performed within 160 seconds and on average measured 20 (15–27) × 16 (8–26) mm. The primary objective was fulfilled in all but 1 pig. There were no premature deaths or severe complications. High-intensity focused ultrasound treatment was associated with a transitory increase in amylase and lipase levels, and pseudocysts were observed in half of the pigs without being clinically apparent. All ablations were well delimited at both gross and histological examinations.
- **Conclusions**: Intraoperative thermal destruction of porcine pancreas with HIFU is feasible. Reproducibility and safety have to be confirmed when applied close to mesenteric vessels and in long-term preclinical studies.

### Focal therapy for prostate cancer: Revolution or evolution [^113v4J7E]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

As previously stated, successful adoption of focal therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer will hinge on several critical issues: 1) accurately identifying index lesions within the prostate, 2) reliably imaging cancers within the prostate, 3) long-term efficacy of the technology to eradicate cancer, 4) appropriate follow-up of patients treated with focal therapy, and 5) limitations of PSA following therapy and how to detect recurrent or persistent disease. Solving these critical issues will not only assist with pretreatment counseling of these patients but could also be used as effective monitors for ideal endpoints in cancer therapy. In addition, optimal patient selection using pretreatment risk stratification must be developed to ensure the treatment of subjects who would gain the most from focal therapy. Despite our limitations in identifying disease that can be treated by focal therapy, several clinical trials utilizing some of the promising therapeutic modalities mentioned above are on the horizon. Hopefully, with careful monitoring and critical review of these trials, we can better determine if focal therapy is an appropriate treatment option to offer patients with localized, low-grade prostate cancer.

### Phase I/II trial of high intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of previously untreated localized prostate cancer [^1156UmtJ]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

We examined the safety and potential efficacy of transrectally delivered high-intensity focused ultrasound for the full gland ablation of previously untreated localized prostate cancer.
- **Materials and methods**: A total of 20 patients with localized prostate cancer underwent 1 to 3 high-intensity focused ultrasound treatments of the prostate. The primary outcome was safety, and the secondary outcomes were prostate-specific antigen, prostate biopsy, and quality of life measures.
- **Results**: A total of 19 patients had complete follow-up. Serious adverse events related to treatment were limited, with the most common adverse event being transient urinary retention lasting more than 30 days in only 10% of patients. Rectal injury occurred in 1 patient. With 1 to 3 treatments, 42% of the patients achieved a prostate-specific antigen level of less than 0.5 ng/ml and a negative prostate biopsy.
- **Conclusions**: High-intensity focused ultrasound in patients with previously untreated prostate cancer is generally well-tolerated and has the potential to completely ablate the prostate gland. With further refinement of the optimal treatment dose and technique, this technology has the potential to be an effective form of therapy for localized prostate cancer.

### Prostate cancer: New treatments for localized tumours-what matters first [^115eA7gJ]. Nature Reviews Urology (2012). Low credibility.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) represents a relatively new treatment option for focal therapy of prostate cancer. However, studies evaluating its efficacy have not provided strong data to support the use of HIFU in the majority of patients. Thus, high-profile studies investigating the feasibility of the modality in terms of adverse effects seem premature.

### Focal therapy: Patients, interventions, and outcomes — a report from a consensus meeting [^1138qvte]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Prostate volume**: Acknowledging that some energy sources have limitations in their ability to treat certain anatomic regions (e.g. high-intensity focused ultrasound is limited to treating anterior lesions in small prostates only) while others do not, it was agreed that prostate volume should not be a primary determinant of eligibility for focal therapy.
- **Age and life expectancy**: It was agreed that age should not be a primary determinant of focal therapy, although the panel was uncertain about whether focal treatment should be recommended for patients aged 80 years. The panel was also asked to evaluate criteria other than age when selecting patients eligible for focal therapy. They agreed that patients with a World Health Organization performance status of 0 or 1 should be recommended for focal treatment and that patients with a performance status of 3 or 4 should not be recommended. There was uncertainty about treating patients with a performance status of 2. The group agreed that focal therapy was best suited to patients with a life expectancy of more than 10 years and should not be applied to patients with a life expectancy of 5 years or less.
- **Preintervention diagnostics**: The panel agreed that a confirmatory tissue diagnosis of cancer should be available prior to performing focal therapy. There was a lack of agreement on providing focal treatment without a biopsy, given that the true positive predictive value of mp-MRI is yet to be fully quantified. It was agreed that focal therapy can be performed in patients who have undergone an MRI-targeted prostate biopsy.

### A novel approach to shaping the lateral abdomen: Simultaneous application of high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) therapy and synchronized radiofrequency at the flanks: A multicenter MRI study [^1138va6X]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Noninvasive methods include cryolipolysis, RF, low-level laser therapy, and high-intensity focused ultrasound. Coleman et al. reported a 25.5% reduction in fat with cryolipolysis treatment at 6 months post-treatment. The energies from the opposite heat spectrum, such as standalone RF, achieved a 22% reduction in fat thickness at 12 weeks after treatment, with laser technology reducing fat thickness by 13%. The last modality, high-intensity focused ultrasound, triggers necrosis in the adipose tissue to achieve a 4.6-cm reduction in waist circumference 3 months after treating the abdomen and flanks.

All of these technologies focus only on the adipose tissue; HIFEM, however, targets muscle tissue. The weakened muscles of the lateral abdomen may lead to poor posture, low core stability, lower back pain, increased risk of injuries, and can impact breathing patterns and bowel movement. The results of the present study show the superiority of the combined HIFEM + RF treatment: both adipose and muscle tissues were positively affected, with MRI revealing a significant fat reduction of −30.5% in fat CSA and up to −28.8% in fat thickness.

### Focal therapy using high-intensity focused ultrasound with intraoperative prostate compression for patients with localized prostate cancer: a multi-center prospective study with 7 year experience [^113swwgV]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Focal therapy using HIFU with intraoperative prostate compression could improve medium-term oncological outcomes without the risk of functional deterioration. Future studies should include a comparison group to evaluate the contribution of this approach to improving both functional and oncological outcomes associated with standard treatments.

### Histopathological findings after treatment of prostate cancer using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) [^111gWWwP]. The Prostate (2010). Low credibility.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment is a novel, minimally invasive therapeutic option for patients with localized prostate cancer. Little is known about the histological findings in prostate biopsies following HIFU treatment.
- **Method**: We examined the spectrum of histological changes in prostate biopsies of 25 prostate cancer patients who were previously treated with HIFU. The biopsies were taken 180 days after HIFU treatment.
- **Results**: Seventy-two percent of cases showed necrosis, often accompanied by acute, chronic, or granulomatous inflammation. All biopsies presented mild or moderate fibrosis. In benign glands, histological examination revealed heterogeneous cellular damage and response, including cytologic atypia and basal cell hyperplasia. Eleven patients (44%) had residual prostatic carcinoma after treatment. In cases with residual adenocarcinoma, the majority (9/11, 88%) showed no apparent treatment effects. Two cases exhibited nuclear pyknosis. In summary, the histological findings in benign and malignant prostatic tissues after HIFU treatment include a spectrum of morphological changes ranging from apparent necrosis to more subtle cellular damage in benign tissue. There were minimal morphologic changes in residual adenocarcinoma after HIFU treatments.
- **Conclusion**: Pathologists should be aware of common histologic findings in prostatic biopsies after HIFU treatment. We recommend routine reporting of Gleason scores in post-HIFU needle biopsies.

### Focused ultrasound: Noninvasive image-guided therapy [^1113XZTM]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The enhancement of FUS by microbubbles, when HIFU is not sufficient, involves the transient formation of gas bodies during the action of HIFU within the biological tissues. This greatly improves energy deposition and the efficacy of bioeffects. In this process, bubbles in the tissue are formed due to the action of US itself during the passage of the rarefaction phase of the US pressure wave. They originate from the air dissolved in blood and tissues via inertial cavitation and rectified diffusion into the newly forming gas bodies. These newly formed gas bubbles rapidly compress and expand in the high-intensity US field, leading to localized energy deposition, both thermal and mechanical.

When the acoustic pressure is lower than the cavitation threshold, the passage of the US wave through the tissue occurs with minimal attenuation and energy loss, traditionally assumed as 0.3 dB/cm/MHz by the FDA. Externally added "seed" gas bubbles are even more efficient at enhancing US energy deposition, as they do not require higher acoustic pressure values. The bioeffects of the combined action of medical US and administered gas-filled bubbles were initially investigated in the context of the safety of intravascular microbubble materials for contrast US imaging, approximately a quarter-century ago.

Skyba et al. investigated US action on intravascular microbubbles in vivo, using a spinotrapezius muscle vasculature rat model. They varied the energy transmitted by the US clinical imaging system transducer within a range of peak negative acoustic pressures of 0.61 MPa and 1.53 MPa, also presented as a Mechanical Index (MI) between 0.4 and 1.0.

### Is MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound a feasible treatment modality for desmoid tumors [^1172oQe1]? Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a noninvasive treatment modality that uses focused ultrasound waves to thermally ablate tumors within the human body while minimizing side effects to surrounding healthy tissues. This technology is FDA-approved for certain tumors and has the potential to be a noninvasive treatment option for extremity soft tissue tumors. The development of treatment modalities that achieve tumor control, decrease morbidity, or both might be of great benefit for patients. We wanted to assess the potential use of this technology in the treatment of extremity desmoid tumors.
- **Questions/purposes**: (1) Can we use MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound to accurately ablate a predetermined target volume within a human cadaver extremity? (2) Does MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment stop progression and/or cause regression of extremity desmoid tumors?

- **Methods**: Simulated tumor volumes in four human cadavers, created by using plastic markers, were ablated using a commercially available focused ultrasound system. Accuracy was determined in accordance with the International Organization of Standards location error by measuring the farthest distance between the ablated tissue and the plane corresponding to the target. Between 2012 and 2014, we treated nine patients with desmoid tumors using focused ultrasound ablation. Indications for this were tumor-related symptoms or failure of conventional treatment. Of those, five were available for MRI follow-up at 12 months or longer (mean, 18.2 months; range, 12–23 months).

### Focal therapy for prostate cancer: An "à la carte" approach [^115Z98fW]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Personalizing focal ablation energy for prostate cancer based on cancer location is a novel concept. We propose using high-intensity focused ultrasound, cryotherapy, and brachytherapy for posterior, anterior, and apical tumors, respectively, to improve the overall outcome. This concept needs to be verified in prospective studies.

### Prostate ablation using high intensity focused ultrasound: A literature review of the potential role for patient preference information [^115hEw4x]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) recently allowed the marketing of two high intensity focused ultrasound devices for prostate tissue ablation indications after previous rejections for a prostate cancer indication due to insufficient data on clinical effectiveness or direct patient benefit. We reviewed the safety and effectiveness of high intensity focused ultrasound and knowledge regarding patient preferences, such as tolerance for adverse events associated with high intensity focused ultrasound ablation of tissue in men with prostate cancer. This may inform decision-making for device developers and the FDA.
- **Materials and methods**: We searched PubMed® and gray literature, including FDA reports for relevant data on (1) the safety and effectiveness of primary and salvage high intensity focused ultrasound of localized prostate cancer in studies performed in or outside the United States, and (2) patient preference information on high intensity focused ultrasound-related safety and effectiveness outcomes.
- **Results**: We found no high intensity focused ultrasound effectiveness data relevant to clinical decision-making, such as overall or prostate cancer-specific survival, in the United States. Long-term effectiveness data from outside the United States were sparse and outcomes varied. We also found no patient preference data on high intensity focused ultrasound treatment in men with prostate cancer.
- **Conclusions**: The lack of long-term high intensity focused ultrasound oncological data in an American population has brought new challenges to prostate cancer stakeholders.

### Minimally invasive image-guided therapy for inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma: What is the evidence today [^117SM9FD]. Insights into Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) involves the use of an extracorporeal transducer to produce high-energy ultrasound (US) beams that pass harmlessly through intact skin and focus tightly (1–3 mm) within the tumor. The rapid deposition of acoustic energy results in an instantaneous temperature increase of over 55°C within the tissue, leading to coagulation necrosis. As the first completely non-invasive approach to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HIFU is a promising technology. In practice, both conventional ultrasound and MRI are used to guide and monitor HIFU treatment, with MRI offering the advantage of accurately monitoring temperature during treatment.

There are only a few clinical reports on the application of HIFU for HCC treatment. The majority of work is published by two groups, both using real-time US guidance during treatment. Wu et al. report that HIFU treatment is effective, safe, and feasible in patients with large HCCs. They treated 55 patients with a mean tumor diameter of 8.14 cm ± 3.37 (range 4–14 cm). Overall survival rates at 6, 12, and 18 months were 86.1%, 61.5%, and 35.3%, respectively. Survival rates were higher in patients with less advanced disease, according to the TNM classification. However, it should be noted that pre-procedural transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was carried out in half of the patients, and rib resection was performed in 14 patients, which diminishes the non-invasive nature of the procedure. In another study by Zhu et al, rib resection was performed in all patients to create a better acoustic path.

### Comparison of high intensity focused ultrasound and radioiodine for treating toxic thyroid nodules [^111h9NNt]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

We compared the effectiveness of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and radioiodine (RAI) to treat patients with toxic thyroid nodules (TTN). Normalization of serum thyrotropin (TSH) one year after treatment was the primary endpoint; changes in nodules' volume and scintigraphic pattern were also evaluated as secondary endpoints.

Among patients aged 18 years or older with TTN observed at our center between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2016, we prospectively enrolled 17 patients treated with RAI and 15 age- and sex-matched patients treated with HIFU. Biochemical thyroid tests and nodules' volume were assessed before and 3, 6, and 12 months after treatments. A thyroid scintigraphy was performed before and one year after treatment.

The final series included 17 patients treated with RAI and 15 patients treated with HIFU. There were no demographic or clinical differences at baseline. One year after treatment, 14 of 17 RAI-treated and 4 of 15 HIFU-treated patients met the criteria for response to treatment (P = .0008). The median TSH value was 1.5 IU/mL in the HIFU group and 0.2 IU/mL in the RAI group (P < .0001). Despite a similar decrease in nodules' volume in both groups, a scintigraphic response was achieved in 16 of 17 (94%) RAI-treated patients compared to 8 of 15 (53%) HIFU-treated patients (P = .024).

In our series, RAI clearly outperforms HIFU in treating patients with TTN and remains the first-line noninvasive treatment in such cases.

### High-intensity focused ultrasound for focal therapy: Reality or pitfall [^112FGLSy]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The progress in imaging, fusion software, and ablative modalities has fostered the growth of the latest image-guided generation of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for focal treatment of prostate cancer. Although early reports are encouraging, important questions remain regarding candidate selection, treatment, and outcomes. We review contemporary considerations for the use of HIFU for focal treatment of primary and radio-recurrent prostate cancer.
- **Recent findings**: HIFU has been used to treat prostate cancer for over two decades. More recently, stage migration from screening and improvements in pelvic imaging and fusion technology have resulted in the wider clinical application of focal HIFU as a first-line treatment for localized prostate cancer. Advanced imaging has also improved targeting for focal salvage therapy of radio-recurrent disease. Proponents point to the minimally invasive nature, limited morbidity profile, and ability to perform retreatments in the future. Critics emphasize positive post-treatment biopsies, non-uniform treatment protocols, and the absence of long-term follow-up. Thus, a review of clinical considerations and recently published data is warranted.

Recent advances have strengthened support for the use of focal HIFU. Although HIFU has great potential, it must be applied judiciously, maintaining appropriate oncologic principles in the setting of standardized trials to determine its true clinical value.

### Focal therapy for localized prostate cancer: A critical appraisal of rationale and modalities [^111RaAmk]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Based on contemporary epidemiological and pathological characteristics of prostate cancer, we explain the rationale for and concerns about focal therapy for low-risk prostate cancer, review potential methods of delivery, and propose study design parameters.

Articles regarding the epidemiology, diagnosis, imaging, treatment, and pathology of localized prostate cancer were reviewed with a particular emphasis on technologies applicable for focal therapy. This therapy is defined as the targeted ablation of a limited area of the prostate expected to contain the dominant or only focus of cancer. A consensus summary was constructed by a multidisciplinary international task force of prostate cancer experts, forming the basis of the review.

In regions with a high prevalence of prostate-specific antigen screening, the over-detection and subsequent overtreatment of prostate cancer is common. The incidence of unifocal cancers in radical prostatectomy specimens is 13% to 38%. In many other cases, there is an index lesion with secondary foci containing pathological features similar to those found incidentally at autopsy. Because biopsy strategies and imaging techniques can provide more precise tumor localization and characterization, there is growing interest in focal therapy targeting unifocal or biologically unifocal tumors.

The major arguments against focal therapy are multifocality, limited accuracy of staging, the unpredictable aggressiveness of secondary foci, and the lack of established technology for focal ablation. Emerging technologies with the potential for focal therapy are being explored.

### A comparative study of fibroid ablation rates using radio frequency or high-intensity focused ultrasound [^113b596h]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

This study compared the technical success of fibroid devascularization using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and radio frequency (RF) to provide an experimental basis for the clinical selection of a suitable, minimally invasive method for treating uterine fibroids. Patients were randomly divided into two groups and treated with HIFU or RF accordingly.

- **Study design**: The two groups of patients were divided again into subgroups A, B, and C based on fibroid diameter, and subgroups A', B', and C' based on fibroid blood supply grades. The fibroid diameters in subgroups A, B, and C were categorized further, but this section appears incomplete and cannot be fully detailed.

- **Outcomes**: For subgroups with different blood supply grades, subgroup C' with RF treatment showed higher complete ablation rates compared to HIFU (p < 0.05). In other subgroups, the complete ablation rates of RF were better than those of HIFU (p < 0.05).

No severe complications were observed after these two treatments. RF can be applied for the majority of fibroids; as a noninvasive therapy, HIFU could be the preferred method for the treatment of small, hypovascular fibroids.

### An exploratory study of dose escalation standard focal high-intensity focused ultrasound for treating nonmetastatic prostate cancer [^113Ms9o4]. Journal of Endourology (2020). Low credibility.

Objective: Analysis of treatment success regarding oncological recurrence rate between standard and dose escalation focal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) of prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods: In this analysis of our prospectively maintained HIFU (Sonablate ® 500) database, 598 patients were identified who underwent a focal HIFU (Sonablate 500) between March 2007 and November 2016. Follow-up occurred with 3-monthly clinic visits and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in the first year. Thereafter, PSA was measured 6-monthly or annually at least. Routine and for-cause multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) was conducted with biopsy for MRI suspicion of recurrence. Treatments were delivered in a quadrant or hemiablation fashion depending on the gland volume as well as tumor volume and location.

Before mid-2015, standard focal HIFU was used (two HIFU blocks); after this date, some urologists conducted dose escalation focal HIFU (three overlapping HIFU blocks). Propensity matching was used to ensure two matched groups, leading to 162 cases for this analysis. Treatment failure was defined by any secondary treatment (systemic therapy, cryotherapy, radiotherapy, prostatectomy, or further HIFU), metastasis from prostate cancer without further treatment, tumor recurrence with Gleason score ≥ 7 (≥ 3+4) on prostate biopsy without further treatment, or prostate cancer-related mortality. Complications and side effects were also compared.

Results: Median age was 64.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] 60–73.5) in the standard focal-HIFU group and 64.5 years (IQR 60–69) in the dose-esc.

### Magnetic resonance guided focused high frequency ultrasound ablation for focal therapy in prostate cancer - phase 1 trial [^111Z8TjP]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility and safety of focal therapy for low-intermediate risk prostate cancer (PCa) using magnetic resonance-guided high-frequency focused ultrasound (MRgFUS). This IRB-approved phase 1 prospective study enrolled eight patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels ≤ 10 ng/ml, clinical stage ≤ cT2a, and Gleason score ≤ 7 (4 + 3) disease, following informed consent. Under MRI guidance, focused high-frequency ultrasound energy was delivered to ablate the target tissue. Treatment-related adverse events were recorded. Oncologic outcomes were evaluated with multiparametric MRI, PSA, and TRUS biopsy at 6 months following treatment.

The results indicated that ten target lesions [six Gleason 6 lesions, two Gleason 7 (3 + 4), and two Gleason 7 (4 + 3)] were treated in eight men. Prostate volume ranged from 25–50 cc, with a mean MRI time of 248 minutes per patient and a mean sonication duration of 65 minutes. The mean target volume was 2.7 cc, and the mean post-treatment non-perfused volume was 4.3 cc. Quality of life parameters were similar between baseline and 6 months in 6 out of 8 patients. All treated regions were negative on MRI; 60% of target lesions (6 out of 10) and 4 out of 8 patients were clear of disease on biopsy. One patient with 2-mm Gleason 8 disease in one of five cores from the treatment site (4 + 3 disease at baseline) subsequently underwent prostatectomy with negative surgical margins. Three patients with low volume (5–15%) Gleason 6 residual disease were offered active surveillance. Mean PSA decreased from 5.06 at baseline to 3.4 ng/ml at 6 months.

In conclusion, MRgFUS is a feasible and safe method of noninvasively ablating targeted prostate cancer tissue.

### Biomarkers and focused ultrasound: The future of liquid biopsy for brain tumor patients [^114xQnc3]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

The role of focused ultrasound in brain tumors is pivotal in advancing treatment methods. Focused ultrasound has been established as a blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption technique to ablate tissue or enhance drug delivery. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is employed for brain tumor ablation by significantly increasing tissue temperatures using ultrasound energy, which is passed through and distributed over the skull. The precise targeting of this energy to the tumor tissue is accomplished via stereotactic, steerable systems like MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS).

Conversely, low-intensity pulsed ultrasounds present a potentially safer and quicker method, using a lower intensity of ultrasound energy to prevent tissue damage. Biologically, low-intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) increases the permeability of the BBB through the strategic use of intravenous microbubbles. As ultrasound waves cause a physical cavitation effect, the microbubbles expand until inertial cavitation occurs and eventually collapse, mechanically disrupting the BBB through cellular membrane perforation or blood-tissue permeation.

Nevertheless, despite such promising effects, FUS must be precisely controlled. Parameters such as exposure frequency, microbubble diameter, pulse-repetition frequency, and burst duration can impact the extent of BBB disruption and the penetration of therapeutic agents into the brain. Thus, low-intensity FUS combined with microbubbles has emerged as an attractive approach to safely and focally induce mechanical disruptions in the BBB, improving therapeutic molecule delivery to the brain.

### Oncological outcomes after robotic salvage radical prostatectomy in patients primarily treated with focal versus radiation therapy: A junior ERUS/YAU collaborative study [^1131uFfJ]. The Prostate (2025). Low credibility.

- **Comparison of HIFU versus non-HIFU patients**: Of 201 focal therapy patients, 80% initially received high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) as primary treatment. The most common non-HIFU focal therapy was cryotherapy. Descriptive baseline, surgical, and postoperative comparisons between HIFU and non-HIFU are displayed in Table 2.

Table 2
Characteristics of 201 robotic salvage radical prostatectomy (sRP) patients stratified according to initial prostate cancer (PCa) treatment with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) versus other focal therapies (non-HIFU).

In BCR analyses (Figure 3), no significant difference was observed between patients with initial HIFU versus non-HIFU (HR: 0.9, p = 0.9) with 29 versus 8 BCR events. The 24-month and 48-month BCR-free survival rates were 79.3% and 64.4% versus 69.1% and 69.1% for HIFU versus non-HIFU s-RARP patients.

### Salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound for patients with recurrent prostate cancer after brachytherapy [^115bfrEU]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

To report our experience with salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in patients with local failure after brachytherapy for prostate cancer, whole-gland HIFU was administered to prospectively recruited patients with local histologic failure after brachytherapy at two institutions in the United Kingdom and Canada. Functional and oncologic outcomes of the procedure were analyzed.
- **Results**: Nineteen patients underwent the treatment; 12 had a Gleason sum of 7 and five had a Gleason sum of 8 at recurrence. Thirteen men had grade-3a or -3b complications by the Clavien system, with no grade-4 or -5 complications. The most common postoperative complication was dysuria, which was self-limited. Three men developed rectourethral fistulae. The overall continence rate was 68.4%. At a mean follow-up of 51.6 months, all men were alive. The overall biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was 66.7% and 73.3% using the "nadir prostate-specific antigen level" +1.3 ng/mL and +2 mg/mL criteria, respectively. This study is limited by the small cohort size, relatively short follow-up period, and heterogeneity of the patient population.
- **Conclusion**: In this, the largest prospective series at the time of writing, we demonstrate that salvage HIFU for locally recurrent prostate cancer after failed primary brachytherapy has encouraging disease control results, albeit with a relatively high complication rate.

### Three potential mechanisms for failure of high intensity focused ultrasound ablation in cardiac tissue [^115e2G2q]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2012). Low credibility.

High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been introduced for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias because it offers the ability to create rapid tissue modification in confined volumes without directly contacting the myocardium. In spite of the benefits of HIFU, a number of limitations have been reported, which have hindered its clinical adoption.
- **Methods and results**: In this study, we used a multimodal approach to evaluate thermal and nonthermal effects of HIFU in cardiac ablation. We designed a computer-controlled system capable of simultaneous fluorescence mapping and HIFU ablation. Using this system, linear lesions were created in isolated rabbit atria (n = 6), and point lesions were created in the ventricles of whole-heart (n = 6) preparations by applying HIFU at clinical doses (4–16 W). Additionally, we evaluated the gap size in ablation lines necessary for conduction in atrial preparations (n = 4). The voltage-sensitive dye di-4-ANEPPS was used to assess functional damage produced by HIFU. Optical coherence tomography and general histology were used to evaluate lesion extent. Conduction block was achieved in 1 (17%) of 6 atrial preparations with a single ablation line. Following 10 minutes of rest, 0 (0%) of 6 atrial preparations demonstrated sustained conduction block from a single ablation line. Tissue displacement of 1 to 3 mm was observed during HIFU application due to acoustic radiation force along the lesion line. Additionally, excessive acoustic pressure and high temperature from HIFU generated cavitation, causing macroscopic tissue damage.

A minimum gap size for effective ablation was needed, but the text is incomplete and ends abruptly.

### Identifying the best candidate for focal therapy: A comprehensive review [^115yd9YV]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Focal therapy (FT) has emerged as a viable treatment option in the management of patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa). The goal of FT is to mitigate the side effects commonly associated with more aggressive treatments without compromising cancer control. Numerous FT modalities are currently available, including high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), cryotherapy, irreversible electroporation (IRE), laser, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and brachytherapy (BT). Several single-center and multi-institutional studies have reported the outcomes of these novel therapies.

Currently, the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines consider FT in select, appropriately informed patients with intermediate-risk PCa, with an emphasis on prioritizing enrollment in clinical trials. However, patients should be informed that high-quality data comparing the outcomes of FT to other PCa management options, including radiation therapy, surgery, and active surveillance, are currently lacking.

Despite the evidence supporting the use of FT in patients with localized PCa, reported studies exhibit considerable variability in terms of patient selection criteria and treatment planning approaches. Precise selection of patients is a crucial step in achieving optimal outcomes following FT. The identification of the best candidate has evolved dynamically in the past two decades alongside the increasing comprehension and constraints of FT. Nevertheless, this process is still dependent on the available evidence, expert opinions, and international multidisciplinary guidelines.

### Focal therapy using high-intensity focused ultrasound with intraoperative prostate compression for patients with localized prostate cancer: A multi-center prospective study with 7 year experience [^11633Ghr]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Five-year treatment-free and overall survival outcomes of active surveillance in 672 patients with localized invisible and visible prostate cancer (PC) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels of 20 ng/mL, and Gleason scores of 3 + 3 or 3 + 4 were 83.4% and 72.3%, and 62.8% and 33.8%, respectively. On the other hand, radical treatments raise concerns such as the deterioration of urinary and sexual function after radical prostatectomy, as well as radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis and severe rectal bleeding after radiation therapy. Focal therapy has been studied to evaluate whether it is a credible treatment strategy to provide both cancer control and functional preservation.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) uses ultrasound waves generated by a spherical transducer to deliver ultrasonic energy to the target area, allowing for a distinct margin between the treated and adjacent normal tissue. The characteristics of HIFU are attractive as one of the modalities for focal therapy. However, clinically significant PC (CSPC) detection rates in the treated area with biopsies performed at different postoperative timings and with different methods to assess treatment efficacy were in the range of 8.2%, 17.2%, and 40% after focal therapy with HIFU. This variation is considered due to the use of non-uniform energy output settings in focal therapy.

The hyperechoic changes on B-mode of TRUS images indicate effective treatment during the PC treatment with HIFU. However, the diffuse appearance of hyperechoic changes is less likely to appear.

### Focused ultrasound: Noninvasive image-guided therapy [^117Sku9c]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Basic principles of MR temperature mapping with the water proton resonance frequency method are central to this field. The PRF methods typically employ rapid RF-spoiled gradient echo imaging. Following image processing, an MR signal is associated with each volume element as a complex number. Gray levels on anatomical images are proportional to the MR signal magnitude value, whereas their phase relates to the PRF. Temperature variation is calculated from phase changes for each voxel obtained at different times, where Δϕ is the phase difference and ΔT the temperature variation. Other factors include γ, the gyromagnetic ratio (~42.58 x 2π x 10^6 rad/T), α, the temperature coefficient (~0.01 ppm/K), T E, the echo time, and B 0, the main magnetic field.

The presence of lipids is a potential source of artifacts, since the temperature dependency of the resonance frequency of lipid hydrogen is near zero. In practice, lipid contribution to the MR signal can be conveniently suppressed in gradient echo imaging by frequency-selective slice excitation or alternative methods such as selective fat saturation or inversion recovery and multiecho methods combined with model-based reconstruction methods.

High temperatures lead to coagulation and immediate cell death. However, moderate temperature elevations may also lead to cell death, albeit with a delayed effect via biochemical pathways leading to apoptosis. Lethal effects of elevated temperatures have been studied by Sapareto and Dewey, who established an empirical relation among temperature, duration of exposure, and cell death. Using such relations, temperature measurements throughout the procedure can be effectively managed.

### High-intensity focused ultrasound surgery of the brain: Part 1 — a historical perspective with modern applications [^116bbDHR]. Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

The field of magnetic resonance imaging-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) is rapidly evolving, with many potential applications in neurosurgery. As the first of three articles on MRgFUS, this article focuses on the historical development of the technology and its potential applications in modern neurosurgery. The evolution of MRgFUS has occurred in parallel with modern neurological surgery, and the two seemingly distinct disciplines share many pioneering figures.

Early studies in the 1940s and 1950s demonstrated focused ultrasound treatment's ability to perform precise lesioning in the human brain, maintaining a favorable risk-benefit profile. However, the need for a craniotomy and the lack of sophisticated imaging technology limited the growth of high-intensity focused ultrasound for neurosurgery. More recently, technological advances have permitted the combination of high-intensity focused ultrasound with magnetic resonance imaging guidance, providing an opportunity to effectively treat various central nervous system disorders.

Although challenges remain, high-intensity focused ultrasound-mediated neurosurgery may offer the ability to target and treat central nervous system conditions that were previously extremely difficult to address. The remaining two articles in this series will focus on the physical principles of modern MRgFUS as well as future avenues for investigation.

### Focused ultrasound: Noninvasive image-guided therapy [^114uLiiT]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The US waves that are transmitted from the transducer, much like light, can be focused at a desired distance from the transducer by mechanical or electronic means. Mechanical focusing can be achieved by shaping the transducer (see Fig. 1A) or applying an acoustic lens to the transducer (see Fig. 1B). Shaping the transducer material (i.e. the piezoelectric ceramic) allows the acoustic waves generated along its surface to converge at a single point. An acoustic lens is a layer of varying thickness made of a material whose speed of sound is faster than in the interrogated tissue. The faster speed of sound at the edges of the lens allows the waves transmitted at those edges to reach the focus at the same time as the waves transmitted at the center of the lens. Adjusting the radius of the curvature of the lens changes this focal depth according to Snell's law. Both methods of mechanical focusing enable the use of low-cost, single-channel electronics, but the focus cannot be adjusted in depth or steered from side to side.

- **Figure 1**: Methods to focus ultrasound.
A. The transducer material (i.e. the piezoelectric ceramic) is arranged in a concave configuration to focus at the desired location.
B. A lens (gray) is applied with a speed of sound that is faster than the tissue and is applied to the transducer (black). Driving circuitry for (A) and (B) is simple because only one excitation signal is needed.
C. An array of transducers is created where each element is driven independently, allowing the transducers to be excited at different phases.

### Established focal therapy-HIFU, IRE, or cryotherapy-where are we now?-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111XD6bR]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Radical therapy with surgery or radiation is the gold standard for the treatment of localized prostate cancer (PCa). However, it is associated with significant treatment-related sexual, urinary, and bowel morbidity. Focal therapy (FT), where only the area of cancer within the prostate is targeted for destruction, could potentially spare the adjacent critical anatomical structures responsible for sexual, urinary, and bowel function from damage, and thus preserve quality of life. Though it was first proposed in the 2000s, physician adoption of FT was limited prior to the late 2010s.

The majority of prostate cancers are multifocal. However, it is now recognized that not every prostate cancer lesion may need to be treated, with the understanding that intermediate- and high-grade (Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4) prostate cancers are the ones that tend to progress and are clinically significant (csPCa). In contrast, low-grade cancers have low cancer-specific mortality and metastasis and can be safely monitored on active surveillance. Furthermore, when small, low-grade cancer foci are discounted, the proportion of unifocal csPCa increases substantially. The key to successful FT is thus the accurate identification of such unifocal csPCa lesions within the prostate.

Over the last decade, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has emerged as a key imaging tool of the prostate, being able to detect and locate csPCa lesions. The advent of mpMRI-fusion biopsy has allowed physicians to merge mpMRI data with accessible office prostate biopsies. These capabilities have significantly improved the identification of unifocal csPCa lesions, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of focal therapy.

### Real-time adaptive methods for treatment of mobile organs by MRI-controlled high-intensity focused ultrasound [^1163v2Ro]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Focused ultrasound (US) is a unique and noninvasive technique for the local deposition of thermal energy deep inside the body. MRI guidance offers the additional benefits of excellent target visualization and continuous temperature mapping. However, treating a moving target poses severe problems because: 1) motion-related thermometry artifacts must be corrected, and 2) the US focal point must be relocated according to target displacement. In this paper, a complete MRI-compatible, high-intensity focused US (HIFU) system is described together with adaptive methods that allow continuous MR thermometry and therapeutic US with real-time tracking of a moving target, online motion correction of the thermometry maps, and regional temperature control based on the proportional, integral, and derivative method.

The hardware is based on a 256-element phased-array transducer with rapid electronic displacement of the focal point. The exact location of the target during US firing is anticipated using automatic analysis of periodic motions. The methods were tested with moving phantoms undergoing either rigid body or elastic periodical motions. The results show accurate tracking of the focal point. Focal and regional temperature control is demonstrated with a performance similar to that obtained with stationary phantoms.

### Salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation for prostate cancer local recurrence after external-beam radiation therapy: prognostic value of prostate MRI [^115heJfB]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

To assess the prognostic value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for locally recurrent prostate cancer after external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT), a study was conducted.

Forty-six patients who underwent prostate MRI before salvage HIFU for locally recurrent prostate cancer after EBRT were retrospectively studied. HIFU failure was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value greater than nadir + 2 ng/ml (Phoenix criteria), positive follow-up biopsy, or initiation of any other salvage therapy. The following prognostic parameters were assessed: neoadjuvant hormone therapy, clinical stage and Gleason score of recurrence, PSA level and velocity at HIFU treatment, and six MRI-derived parameters (prostate volume, tumour volume, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, tumour extension into the apex, or anterior to the urethra).

Two factors were significant independent predictors of salvage HIFU failure: the PSA level at HIFU treatment (p < 0.012; risk ratio: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03–1.29) and the tumour extension anterior to the urethra, as assessed by MRI (p = 0.046, risk ratio: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.02–6.16).

The location of cancer recurrence anterior to the urethra on MRI is an independent significant predictor of salvage HIFU failure for locally recurrent prostate cancer after EBRT. Therefore, MRI may be useful for patient selection before post-EBRT salvage HIFU ablation.

### Locally recurrent prostate cancer after initial radiation therapy: Early salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound improves oncologic outcomes [^1164MWPh]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate pre-operative prognostic risk factors to predict the oncologic outcomes of Salvage High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (S-HIFU) for radiorecurrent prostate cancer (PCa).
- **Methods and materials**: A total of 290 men with biopsy-confirmed locally radiorecurrent PCa underwent S-HIFU. The D'Amico risk group before external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), estimated Gleason score prior to HIFU, and post-HIFU biopsies were analyzed for the predictive utility of local cancer control, cancer-specific, metastasis-free, and progression-free survival rates (PFSR).
- **Results**: Local cancer control with negative biopsy results was obtained in 81% of the 208 patients who underwent post-S-HIFU biopsies. The median PSA nadir was 0.14 ng/ml, and 127 patients did not require androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The mean follow-up was 48 months for cancer-specific survival rates. The cancer-specific and metastasis-free survival rates at 7 years were 80% and 79.6%, respectively. The PFSR was significantly influenced by: the pre-HIFU PSA level (hazard ratio (HR): 1.09, 95% CI 1.04–1.13), a Gleason score ≥ 8 versus ≤ 6 (HR: 1.17, 95% CI 1.03–1.3), and a previous ADT (HR: 1.28, 95% CI 1.09–1.46). The rates of recto-urethral fistula (0.4%) and grade II/III incontinence (19.5%) indicate a significant reduction in serious side effects with the use of dedicated post-radiation acoustic parameters compared with standard parameters.
- **Conclusion**: S-HIFU is an effective curative option for radiorecurrent PCa with acceptable morbidity for localized radiorecurrent PCa, but it should be initiated early.

### ASO author reflections: High-intensity focused ultrasound will become the routine practice for treatment of localized prostate cancer [^1178hkrX]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

- **Past**: Most prostate cancers are slow growing and are often diagnosed at an old age, which may result in treatment never being needed. However, definitive treatments such as radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy are often associated with many serious adverse effects, harming the physical and mental health of patients.
- **Present**: In recent years, different types of minimally invasive therapy have been developed to achieve cancer control, continence, and even potency preservation, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). HIFU has been proposed for prostate cancer patients to provide an equivalent oncologic result to definitive treatment, with a reduced adverse effect profile, thus increasing the interest in HIFU for the treatment of localized prostate cancer.
- **Future**: Sonablate® HIFU performed outstanding cancer control in treating localized prostate cancer, with low biochemical recurrence and complication rates. As further long-term follow-up data mature, we anticipate the routine application of HIFU for localized prostate cancer within the next few years.
