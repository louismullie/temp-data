## Question

What to do with hydronephrosis in patient on dialysis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do with hydronephrosis in a patient who is already on dialysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient is on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Then, I should verify the likely etiologies of hydronephrosis in dialysis patients and how that changes urgency. Next, I will assess whether there are immediate threats like infection, sepsis, or pain that require decompression. After that, I should weigh the risks and benefits of intervention versus observation, including infection, bleeding, and quality of life. Finally, I will outline a practical decision framework and follow-up plan, making sure I align with guidelines and evidence where available.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because management hinges on dialysis modality and the reason for hydronephrosis. In peritoneal dialysis, a massively distended hydronephrotic kidney can compress the peritoneal cavity and impair fill/drain dynamics, whereas in hemodialysis the main risks are infection, pain, and hemorrhage rather than further loss of renal function, since the kidneys are already nonfunctioning for clearance purposes [^notfound].

> I need to check the likely etiologies in dialysis patients, because this shapes urgency. Common causes include stones, ureteral strictures from prior surgery or radiation, retroperitoneal fibrosis, malignancy, and chronic reflux-related atrophy; importantly, many of these are indolent and may not require urgent decompression if the patient is asymptomatic and there is no infection or bleeding risk [^031230e5] [^2eabde25] [^11467320].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify immediate threats that mandate urgent decompression: sepsis or urosepsis, uncontrolled pain, active bleeding from the obstructed system, and, in PD patients, mechanical compromise of dialysis mechanics. In these scenarios, prompt drainage by ureteral stent or percutaneous nephrostomy is indicated to stabilize the patient and protect life or dialysis function [^f427727a] [^ba2f332b].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative merits of stent versus nephrostomy in this population. Historically, many favor internal stents to avoid external devices, but in dialysis patients with poor renal function, stent failure and encrustation are common, and repeated exchanges carry infection risk. Percutaneous nephrostomy offers reliable decompression, facilitates antegrade imaging to define the obstruction, and may be more comfortable long term in some patients, though it carries bleeding and infection risks and requires care of the tube [^04191350] [^de395240] [^39acf913].

> I should double-check the role of definitive therapy. If the cause is a stone, stricture, or tumor, definitive treatment such as stone removal, stricture repair, or tumor-directed therapy may be appropriate in selected patients to prevent recurrent obstruction, infection, or bleeding, but in frail dialysis patients with limited life expectancy, repeated drainage with periodic tube or stent exchanges may be the more pragmatic, palliative approach [^ba2f332b] [^65680ff7].

> Let me consider observation as a valid option when the patient is asymptomatic, there is no infection, and there is no mechanical interference with PD. In this scenario, serial ultrasound can monitor for progression, and intervention can be reserved for new symptoms, infection, or bleeding. Shared decision-making is essential given the limited life expectancy and procedural burdens in many dialysis patients [^517eb8db].

> But wait, what if the hydronephrosis is massive and causing early satiety, nausea, or respiratory compromise from mass effect. In that case, even without infection, decompression can meaningfully improve quality of life, so I should not withhold drainage solely on the basis of absent infection or pain if the mass effect is clinically significant [^notfound].

> I will now examine a practical decision framework: if there is sepsis, pain, bleeding, or PD compromise, proceed to urgent decompression. If asymptomatic and stable, observe with ultrasound surveillance. If symptomatic but not life-threatening, discuss stent versus nephrostomy trade-offs and patient preferences, and if a reversible cause is identified and the patient has reasonable functional status, consider definitive therapy. Throughout, coordinate with urology, interventional radiology, and nephrology for procedural planning and follow-up [^bb4c3290] [^ad931278].

> Next, I should review follow-up logistics. If a nephrostomy is placed, arrange routine tube care, flushing, and scheduled exchanges every 3 to 6 months to prevent encrustation and infection. If a stent is placed, plan for periodic exchanges given high encrustation risk in nonfunctioning kidneys. If observing, repeat ultrasound in 3 to 6 months and sooner if symptoms arise, with a low threshold to intervene if infection or bleeding risk emerges [^65680ff7].

> Hold on, I should verify that my approach aligns with the limited direct evidence. Much of the literature on malignant ureteral obstruction and complex urologic cases supports individualized, symptom-driven drainage decisions, and while dialysis-specific data are sparse, the principles of palliative risk–benefit analysis and shared decision-making remain applicable and consistent with high-quality CKD and urology guidance [^ba2f332b] [^517eb8db] [^bb4c3290].

> In summary, I need to ensure the plan is tailored: treat emergencies immediately, default to observation when safe, choose drainage modality based on anatomy, comorbidity, and patient preference, and reserve definitive therapy for carefully selected patients. The key is to avoid reflexive interventions that won't change outcomes while not missing life-threatening complications that warrant urgent decompression [^f427727a] [^517eb8db].

Hydronephrosis in dialysis patients is common and often reflects chronic, irreversible changes rather than acute obstruction [^e545e33d]. Management should be **individualized**: observe if asymptomatic, but intervene if there is infection, pain, bleeding, or mass effect [^notfound]. Decompression with nephrostomy or stent is indicated for **symptomatic relief** or to preserve residual renal function; routine drainage is not needed for stable, asymptomatic hydronephrosis. Persistent or new hydronephrosis warrants imaging (ultrasound or CT) to exclude stones, strictures, or malignancy, and urology input is essential for complex or refractory cases [^bb4c3290].

---

## Clinical significance of hydronephrosis in dialysis patients

Hydronephrosis in dialysis patients often reflects **chronic, irreversible changes** from prior obstruction, reflux, or atrophy, and is frequently incidental on imaging [^e545e33d]. However, it can also signal active pathology — such as stones, strictures, or malignancy — and may cause pain, infection, or mass effect that impair quality of life or dialysis delivery [^e143bc0c].

---

## Indications for intervention

Intervention is **not routine** and should be guided by symptoms, infection risk, and residual renal function. Indications include:

- **Symptomatic hydronephrosis**: Flank pain, discomfort, or mass effect.
- **Infection**: Pyelonephritis or urosepsis.
- **Bleeding**: Hematuria from obstructed or atrophic kidneys.
- **Mass effect**: Large hydronephrosis compressing adjacent structures or interfering with peritoneal dialysis.
- **Preservation of residual renal function**: When there is meaningful urine output or native kidney contribution.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When hydronephrosis is new, progressive, or symptomatic, **targeted imaging is warranted**:

- **Renal ultrasound**: First-line to assess severity, laterality, and complications (stones, infection, atrophy).
- **Non-contrast CT**: For suspected stones or strictures; avoids nephrotoxic contrast.
- **MRI**: Useful for soft-tissue characterization (e.g. malignancy, retroperitoneal fibrosis) without radiation.
- **Antegrade pyelography**: Via nephrostomy to define obstruction anatomy when planning intervention.

---

## Management strategies

Management is **individualized** based on symptoms, etiology, and goals of care:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Asymptomatic, stable hydronephrosis | Observation with periodic ultrasound |
| Symptomatic or infected hydronephrosis | - Decompression (nephrostomy or ureteral stent) <br/> - Treat infection <br/> - Address underlying cause |
| Stones causing obstruction | - Stone removal (URS, PCNL, or ESWL) <br/> - Drainage if acute infection or severe symptoms |
| Ureteral stricture or malignancy | - Stent or nephrostomy for palliation <br/> - Definitive therapy (e.g. ureterolysis, tumor resection) if feasible |
| Massive hydronephrosis with mass effect | - Decompression (nephrostomy or nephrectomy) for symptom relief |

---

## Role of decompression procedures

Decompression (nephrostomy or stent) provides **symptom relief** and infection control but does not restore renal function in atrophic kidneys. It is most appropriate for symptomatic patients, those with infection, or when residual function could be preserved. Routine prophylactic drainage is not recommended.

---

## Potential complications of untreated hydronephrosis

Untreated hydronephrosis can cause **pain, infection, and bleeding**, and large collections may compress adjacent structures or interfere with peritoneal dialysis. However, in atrophic, nonfunctioning kidneys, progression to further renal damage is unlikely.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Stable, asymptomatic hydronephrosis should be monitored with periodic ultrasound; new or progressive hydronephrosis warrants repeat imaging and urology consultation. After intervention, monitor for infection, tube/stent complications, and symptom recurrence [^ed0355fc].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

Coordinated care involving nephrology, urology, interventional radiology, and palliative care ensures **appropriate selection of interventions**, symptom control, and alignment with patient goals.

---

Hydronephrosis in dialysis patients is common and often benign; management should be **symptom-driven** and individualized. Observe stable cases, decompress when symptomatic or infected, and pursue definitive therapy only when it will improve quality of life or preserve residual function.

Chronic non-stone-related hydronephrosis from supravesical or bladder dysfunction in adults is often detected incidentally. This study aims to review the literature regarding supravesical obstruction or bladder dysfunction leading to bilateral hydronephrosis in adults and to develop an algorithm to identify patients at risk of renal failure. Cross-sectional studies, retrospective and prospective cohorts, clinical trials, and systematic reviews from 1980 to 2017 were included. From 8115 articles screened, 39 met the inclusion criteria. Despite the lack of studies addressing this issue, this review brings up a rational evidence-based algorithm to diagnose and manage adults with bilateral hydronephrosis due to supravesical or bladder disease or dysfunction.

Unilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is the most common prenatally detected disease leading to hydronephrosis. The obstructive anatomic lesion leads to varying degrees of hydronephrosis, ranging from no apparent effect on renal function to atrophy. Furthermore, the natural course of hydronephrosis varies from spontaneous resolution to progressive deterioration and may take upwards of 3 years for a kidney to declare itself. The objectives of this article are to update our knowledge regarding the evaluation and management of UPJO in depth and to discuss the emerging value of urinary proteome analysis to the clinical arena.

### Diagnosis and management of non-metastatic upper tract urothelial carcinoma: AUA / SUO guideline [^11467320]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) — preoperative renal function assessment and drainage strategy: Patients with UTUC should be assessed prior to surgery for the risk of post-NU chronic kidney disease (CKD) or dialysis (Expert Opinion), as perioperative decisions rely on baseline renal function and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); patients undergoing NU have diminished postoperative renal function due to loss of a renal unit, and a median decline in renal function after NU up to 32% has been reported. Patients with UTUC should undergo assessment of renal function, and for those scheduled for NU — especially if perioperative systemic treatment is contemplated — an estimation of post-operative renal function should be made, with recommended tests including serum creatinine to calculate eGFR and, at the clinician's discretion, split function testing such as differential renal scan or CT volumetric studies. Perioperative nephrology consultation can be considered, particularly with pre-existing kidney disease. Hydronephrosis from tumor obstruction may falsely under-estimate preoperative renal function; when indicated, renal decompression by indwelling ureteric stent or percutaneous nephrostomy in an uninvolved renal calyx along with oral fluid hydration for 7–14 days before re-checking eGFR will help establish a more accurate baseline, and ureteric stenting is the preferred method of drainage given the known risk of tract seeding with percutaneous nephrostomy tubes and quality of life considerations. Atrophy of the contralateral (unaffected) renal unit may lead to overestimates of postoperative renal function after NU. Results of renal function investigations can aid patient counseling, treatment sequencing, and determining downstream risks of CKD and potential dialysis; if NU could precipitate ESRD, a post operative plan for dialysis should be in place preoperatively including plans for access, and referral to nephrology for detailed evaluation and perioperative recommendations is warranted in such cases.

### Acute life-threatening hyperkalaemia in a patient with giant hydronephrosis: a case report [^e143bc0c]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 52-year-old man with a history of urolithiasis presents to the emergency department with a sudden, sharp, continuous right flank colicky pain. Laboratory workup demonstrates acute kidney injury with a mild hyperkalaemia. During the observation period, the patient develops an atypical broad complex sinus bradycardia and eventually short asystolic periods. This was caused by a severe therapy-resistant hyperkalaemia, wherefore emergency haemodialysis was necessary. Radiographic results showed a giant hydronephrosis with a blowout of the right kidney and an obstructing calculi of 21 mm in the distal ureter. We will discuss the mechanism of reversed intraperitoneal dialysis causing the refractory hyperkalaemia and the need of close ECG monitoring in patients where kidney blowout is considered.

### Urological aspects of HIV and AIDS [^8b4de3f3]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2013). Medium credibility.

The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected people has led to a dramatic decrease in the incidence of opportunistic infections and virus-related malignancies such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma, but not cervical or anal cancer. Advanced-stage cervical cancer is associated with a high incidence of urological complications such as hydronephrosis, renal failure, and vesicovaginal fistula. Adult male circumcison can significantly reduce the risk of male HIV acquisition. Although HAART does not completely eradicate HIV, compliance with medication increases life expectancy. HIV infection or treatment can result in renal failure, which can be managed with dialysis and transplantation (as for HIV-negative patients). Although treatment for erectile dysfunction — including phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, intracavernosal injection therapy, and penile prosthesis — can increase the risk of HIV transmission, treatment decisions for men with erectile dysfunction should not be determined by HIV status. The challenges faced when administering chemotherapy to HIV-infected patients with cancer include late presentation, immunodeficiency, drug interactions, and adverse effects associated with compounded medications. Nonetheless, HIV-infected patients should receive the same cancer treatment as HIV-negative patients. The urologist is increasingly likely to encounter HIV-positive patients who present with the same urological problems as the general population, because HAART confers a prolonged life expectancy. Performing surgery in an HIV-infected individual raises safety issues for both the patient (if severely immunocompromised) and the surgeon, but the risk of HIV transmission from patients on fully suppressive HAART is small.

The evaluation and management of fetuses/children with antenatal hydronephrosis (ANH) poses a significant dilemma for the practitioner. Which patients require evaluation, intervention or observation? Though the literature is quite extensive, it is plagued with bias and conflicting data, creating much confusion as to the optimal care of patients with ANH. In this article, we summarized the literature and proposed recommendations for the evaluation and management of ANH.

### Chronic kidney disease stage progression in patients undergoing repair of persistent cloaca [^ceecdbc6]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Children born with persistent cloaca undergo complex pelvic reconstruction early in life. Long-term risks of bladder dysfunction and chronic kidney disease are well described. We report upper urinary tract outcomes and the risk of chronic kidney disease stage progression in this patient population.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively studied a cohort of patients undergoing posterior sagittal anorecto-vagino-urethroplasty at a single institution from 2006 to 2013. Inclusion criteria consisted of complete urological care at our institution. Chronic kidney disease stage was calculated from cystatin C or nuclear medicine glomerular filtration rate.

Results

A total of 44 patients met inclusion criteria. Of the patients 12 had undergone vesicostomy or ureterostomy. A total of 19 patients had hydronephrosis, 19 had vesicoureteral reflux and 15 had a tethered spinal cord. Median length of the common channel was 3.5 cm. Median age at posterior sagittal anorecto-vagino-urethroplasty was 7.3 months. Median followup was 5.3 years. A total of 30 patients had neurogenic bladder, of whom 27 required clean intermittent catheterization and 3 had undergone vesicostomy. Of the patients 38 had stage I or II, 5 had stage III and 1 had stage IV chronic kidney disease. During followup no patient with initial stage I to III chronic kidney disease had stage progression. The patient with stage IV chronic kidney disease had a renal allograft placed at age 34 months before needing dialysis.

Conclusions

Early outcomes in patients with stage I to III chronic kidney disease demonstrate that renal function can be maintained despite a high rate of lower urinary tract dysfunction. Aggressive bladder management may help prevent progressive renal injury in this population.

### Neonatal and early infancy management of prenatally detected hydronephrosis [^64862a72]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Hydronephrosis discovered during prenatal ultrasound will often resolve spontaneously; however, it should be evaluated in the postnatal period in a manner commensurate with its risk of renal injury. Early intervention is appropriate in cases of bladder outlet obstruction or the severely obstructed solitary kidney. In most other cases, it is both safe and reasonable to allow the possibility of spontaneous improvement with the intensity of follow-up based on the severity of the hydronephrosis. Clinical decision making should be a shared process between families and caregivers.

### Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones: AUA guideline (2026) part III: evaluation and treatment of patients with kidney and / or ureteral stones [^ed0355fc]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA guideline — post-treatment imaging after surgical intervention for kidney and/or ureteral stones directs that clinicians should order follow-up imaging to assess residual stone burden and to identify hydronephrosis or other procedure-related complications (Expert Opinion); timing is not established, but 4 to 12 weeks after surgical intervention is a common and reasonable practice, CT has the highest sensitivity and specificity for detecting residual fragments though it involves ionizing radiation, low dose and ultra-low dose CT protocols can be utilized consistent with the ALARA principle, a multi-center retrospective analysis found CT had the highest frequency of detecting stone fragments associated with stone events and reintervention compared to KUB or KUB/US, and only US and CT — not KUB — can determine postoperative hydronephrosis, which, though rare, can lead to permanent loss of renal function if prolonged, making assessment of post-operative renal drainage essential.

### Stent-change therapy in advanced malignancies with ureteral obstruction [^65680ff7]. Journal of Endourology (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

To determine if patients with advanced malignancies and resultant ureteral obstruction who are managed with chronic ureteral stent changes have adequate preservation of renal function and an acceptable rate of complications.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective review was conducted on 28 patients who had a stent to relieve ureteral obstruction caused by cancer.

Results

During the study period, 201 stents were placed, a median of 4 (range 1–34) per patient. The mean time from cancer diagnosis to first stent placement was 34 months (range 1–109 months). The median survival after the first stent insertion was 15.3 months (95% CI 15.1, 15.6). Seven patients had worsening renal function and hydronephrosis despite indwelling stents. In these patients, the median time from the first stent to a rising serum creatinine concentration was 17 months (range 1–66 months). No patient required dialysis. Eighteen patients developed a total of 69 urinary tract infections (mean 2.5). Eight patients had a total of 13 episodes of urosepsis. The median infection-free survival was 11.9 months (range 7.7–16.9 months). The median urosepsis-free survival was 28.5 months (range 9.7–47.1 months). Fourteen patients died from their malignancies during the study.

Conclusions

Stent-change therapy is an efficacious way to treat patients with advanced malignancies and ureteral obstruction, many of whom have a short life expectancy. All patients maintained adequate renal function to obviate dialysis. Most patients with stents in place will die before their renal function deteriorates. They may also benefit from treatment strategies designed to avoid the occurrence of frequent urinary infections.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hydronephrosis on prior imaging-unknown cause [^dcbae1ca]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Initial imaging evaluation of hydronephrosis of unknown etiology is a complex subject and is dependent on clinical context. In asymptomatic patients, it is often best conducted via CT urography (CTU) without and with contrast, MR urography (MRU) without and with contrast, or scintigraphic evaluation with mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) imaging. For symptomatic patients, CTU without and with contrast, MRU without and with contrast, MAG3 scintigraphy, or ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder with Doppler imaging are all viable initial imaging studies. In asymptomatic pregnant patients, nonionizing imaging with US of the kidneys and bladder with Doppler imaging is preferred. Similarly, in symptomatic pregnant patients, US of the kidneys and bladder with Doppler imaging or MRU without contrast is the imaging study of choice, as both ionizing radiation and gadolinium contrast are avoided in pregnancy. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### AUA white paper on nonneurogenic chronic urinary retention: consensus definition, treatment algorithm, and outcome end points [^c2d66840]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The AUA (American Urological Association) QIPS (Quality Improvement and Patient Safety) committee created a white paper on the diagnosis and management of nonneurogenic chronic urinary retention.

Materials and Methods

Recommendations for the white paper were based on a review of the literature and consensus expert opinion from the workgroup.

Results

The workgroup defined nonneurogenic chronic urinary retention as an elevated post-void residual of greater than 300 mL that persisted for at least 6 months and documented on 2 or more separate occasions. It is proposed that chronic urinary retention should be categorized by risk (high vs low) and symptomatology (symptomatic versus asymptomatic). High risk chronic urinary retention was defined as hydronephrosis on imaging, stage 3 chronic kidney disease or recurrent culture proven urinary tract infection or urosepsis. Symptomatic chronic urinary retention was defined as subjectively moderate to severe urinary symptoms impacting quality of life and/or a recent history of catheterization. A treatment algorithm was developed predicated on stratifying patients with chronic urinary retention first by risk and then by symptoms. The proposed 4 primary outcomes that should be assessed to determine effectiveness of retention treatment are 1) symptom improvement, 2) risk reduction, 3) successful trial of voiding without catheterization, and 4) stability of symptoms and risk over time.

Conclusions

Defining and categorizing nonneurogenic chronic urinary retention, creating a treatment algorithm and proposing treatment end points will hopefully spur comparative research that will ultimately lead to a better understanding of this challenging condition.

### Obstructive nephropathy without hydronephrosis: suspicion is the key [^5737ab87]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract obstruction leading to acute kidney injury is usually associated with bilateral hydroureters and hydronephrosis, often accompanied by oliguria. We present an atypical case of obstructive uropathy without these features that presented with severe acute kidney injury. A 64-year-old male with no known medical history has presented with a 2-week history of nausea, decreased appetite, flank pain, and lower extremity edema, and was found to have an elevated creatinine of 10.5mg/dL. Renal ultrasound showed mild prominence of the bilateral renal collecting systems with no evidence of hydronephrosis. Computed tomography scan showed findings suggestive of retroperitoneal fibrosis involving ureteral region and bilateral ureteral stent placement has led to dramatic improvement of creatinine to 1.3mg/dL over the next 4 days.

### Renal complications in pediatric Crohn's disease: a rare case of bilateral hydronephrosis and review of the literature [^d2342c41]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Gupta et al. found that 14.7% of pediatric CD patients showed renal symptoms. Johnson et al. and Lee et al. have also reported pediatric renal manifestations in recent years.

This growing body of literature supports the notion that acalculous hydronephrosis in CD is not limited to adult patients or historical contexts, but remains a relevant and potentially underdiagnosed complication in modern pediatric practice. Updated awareness among clinicians, aided by advanced imaging and integrated gastroenterology-nephrology care, is essential for improving detection and outcomes in this patient population (Table 1).

### Requirements for accurately diagnosing chronic partial upper urinary tract obstruction in children with hydronephrosis [^e836337e]. Pediatric Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Successful management of hydronephrosis in the newborn requires early accurate diagnosis to identify or exclude ureteropelvic junction obstruction. However, the presence of hydronephrosis does not define obstruction and displays unique behavior in the newborn. The hydronephrotic kidney usually has nearly normal differential renal function at birth, has not been subjected to progressive dilation and except for pelvocaliectasis does not often show signs of high-grade obstruction. Furthermore, severe hydronephrosis resolves spontaneously in more than 65% of newborns with differential renal function stable or improving. The diagnosis of obstruction in newborn hydronephrosis is challenging because the currently available diagnostic tests, ultrasonography and diuretic renography have demonstrated inaccuracy in diagnosing obstruction and predicting which hydronephrotic kidney will undergo deterioration if untreated. Accurate diagnosis of obstruction is possible but it requires an understanding of the uniqueness of both the pathophysiology of obstruction and the biology of the kidney and renal collecting system in this age group. We examine here the requirements for making an accurate diagnosis of obstruction in the young child with hydronephrosis.

### Parents refusing dialysis for a 3-month-old with renal failure [^acfb58c5]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

A 3-month-old boy with failure to thrive was referred to a nephrology clinic after a diagnostic workup for failure to thrive revealed a serum urea nitrogen level of 95 mg/dL and creatinine level of 3.6 mg/dL. A renal ultrasound revealed marked bilateral hydronephrosis with little remaining renal cortex in either kidney. A voiding cystourethrogram revealed evidence of posterior urethral valves. The child had no evident comorbidities. Fulguration of the valves was successfully performed but did not lead to improvement in kidney function. The nephrologists recommended the initiation of dialysis with the hope that the child would be able to receive a kidney transplant in the future. After careful consideration, the family stated that they did not want this child to suffer with a lifetime of dialysis and transplant care. They were also concerned about the impact of this child's illness on their other 2 children and their family. They requested that their son be provided with palliative care only. Experts in nephrology, bioethics, and critical care discuss the ethical issues raised by this parental request.

### Causes and outcome of acute kidney injury amongst adults patients in two hospitals of different category in Cameroon; a 5 year retrospective comparative study [^1222de16]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Study design

This was a hospital based retrospective analytic cohort study. Over 3 months, data from files of patients admitted for AKI from 1st January 2016 to 31st December 2020 were collected. Two hospitals at different levels of care in the health pyramid and serving different type of population were randomly selected: the Douala general hospital a tertiary hospital that served as reference hospital at the national level and is situated in the economic capital of the country and the Buea regional hospital a secondary hospital situated at the intermediate of the Cameroon health pyramid, that served as reference hospital for the region, and is situated in a semi-urban town. Both hospitals have nephrologists and a dialysis centre.

Data collection

AKI was defined in this study as an increase or decrease in serum creatinine of 0.3 mg/dl or more with a baseline serum creatinine < 1.5 mg/dl or a percentage increase or decrease in the serum creatinine concentration of ≥ 50% within 7 days. For the baseline creatinine, whenever available, prehospitalisation Scr (community acquired AKI) or the sCr on admission (hospital acquired AKI) were used. When baseline Scr was missing, we considered absolute increase in the serum creatinine of 0.3 mg/l within 48 hours or observed 1.5 fold increase in creatinine in 7 days knowing that lack of baseline creatinine when defining AKI have shown to led to underestimation of AKI and Higher mortalit y. The following data were collected from patients files; age, gender, profession, comorbidity, past history of AKI, drug history, and physical examination, and laboratory investigations that included urinalysis, blood urea, serum creatinine and serum electrolytes. Ultra-sonography of the kidneys and bladder were performed when needed for the size and the structures of the kidneys and the presence of hydronephrosis. The mechanism of AKI was determined using clinical reasoning (kidney biopsy were not performed) and the outcome studied were the hospital length of stay, kidney recovery (total or partial), need for dialysis and death.

### Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones: AUA guideline (2026) part II: evaluation and treatment of patients with kidney and / or ureteral stones [^f427727a]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA guideline — mortality risk and timing of decompression — Data from the National Inpatient Sample showed that among patients with a kidney or ureteral stone with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and hydronephrosis, the highest mortality rate occurred in patients presenting with septic shock who did not undergo renal decompression (13.6%) compared to the lowest mortality rate in non-septic patients who underwent drainage (0.2%); on multivariable analysis, delaying renal decompression by two or more days was associated with a 29% increase in the odds of death (OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.63; p = 0.032).

### Serum creatinine trajectory after drainage of kidneys with bilateral malignant ureteral obstruction: a prospective non-randomized comparative study [^181eae92]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

A prospective study was carried out at our hospital from August 2019 to March 2022. This study targeted patients with bilateral obstructed kidneys due to MUO. It was conducted according to the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Nonrandomized Designs (TREND) statement. It included patients with age > 18 years, high SCr > 2 mg/dL, and bilateral MUO with grades 1–3 hydronephrosis according to the Onen grading system of hydronephrosis. Exclusion criteria were bleeding tendency, severe comorbidity preventing intervention, non-simultaneous bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN), dialysis after drainage of obstruction, lost-to-follow-up patients, and refusal of participation in the study.

The sample size was calculated using EasyMedStat version 3.17, considering the power of the study 80%, a margin of error 10%, a confidence level of 95%, and a probability value of 0.5. A sample size of 96 patients was estimated. However, considering the percentage of patients with lost-to-follow-up, we enrolled 106 eligible patients. The number of patients who completed follow-up was 102 patients (Fig. 1). This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments. It was approved by the local ethical committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University and the institutional review board number is 17100860/2019, as a part of a study of bilaterally obstructed kidneys due to different etiologies. The latter was registered in ClinicalTrials: NCT04077008, 04/09/2019.

### Percutaneous nephrostomy versus ureteral stents for diversion of hydronephrosis caused by stones: a prospective, randomized clinical trial [^39acf913]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Urinary diversion with percutaneous nephrostomy or ureteral stent is indicated by symptoms, such as persistent colic, high temperature and uremia, of hydronephrosis caused by stones. We evaluate which of these 2 methods is superior concerning the course of procedure, relief of accompanying symptoms and quality of life in regard to patient age and sex.

Materials and Methods

A total of 40 patients with stone induced hydronephrosis were randomized into either percutaneous nephrostomy or stent insertion groups. These patients were then evaluated by procedure (use of analgesics, x-ray exposure, success of insertion), relief of accompanying symptoms (duration of diversion, intravenous administration of antibiotics for high temperature) and quality of life (questionnaire immediately and 2 to 4 weeks postoperatively).

Results

Two comparable groups of patients were formed, with an average age of 55 versus 49 years and a male-to-female ratio of 12:8 versus 9:11 for those who underwent percutaneous nephrostomy versus those who received a stent, respectively. Percutaneous nephrostomy was successfully completed in 100% of patients and stents were successful in 80%, with a 20% conversion to percutaneous nephrostomy. The x-ray exposure was shorter in the percutaneous nephrostomy group (p = 0.052). Administration of analgesics was more frequent in the stent group (p = 0.061). Percutaneous nephrostomy indwelling time was shorter (50% less than 2 weeks) than that of stents (25% less than 2 weeks, p = 0.043). Antibiotics were administered for greater than 5 days in 0% of patients who underwent percutaneous nephrostomy versus 64% in those with stents (p = 0.174). Reduction in quality of life was moderate but more pronounced in patients with stents compared to those who underwent percutaneous nephrostomy, and was more distinct in males and younger patients. The quality of life progressively improved in the course of diversion with percutaneous nephrostomy but deteriorated with stents.

Conclusions

Our results demonstrated that percutaneous nephrostomy is superior to ureteral stents for diversion of hydronephrosis caused by stones, especially in patients with a high temperature, as well as in males and juveniles.

### Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones: AUA guideline (2026) part I: evaluation and treatment of patients with kidney and / or ureteral stones [^4863ffb8]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Cross-sectional imaging to guide treatment selection — adult patients with kidney and/or ureteral stones: clinicians may obtain cross-sectional imaging to guide surgical treatment selection (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Non-contrast abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) is the most reliable imaging modality for evaluating stone size and volume, location, number, and density and also allows assessment of anatomic variations, relational anatomy of the kidney, intrarenal geometry including infundibular angle, hydronephrosis, the presence of distal obstruction, and patient factors such as body habitus and stone-to-skin distance that may affect procedural choice and outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) may provide some relational and intrarenal anatomic detail that can guide treatment selection; however, neither MR nor US reliably measures stone density and MR does not reliably visualize upper urinary tract stones.

### Retrograde ureteric stent insertion from percutaneous suprapubic access to the bladder in renal transplant recipients with ureteric stenosis: a novel minimally invasive technique [^e9774b92]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Renal transplantation is the definitive treatment for patients with ESRD. However, ureteroneocystostomy stenosis and allograft lithiasis are potentially devastating complications. According to recent reports, ureteroneocystostomy stenosis is the most common urologic complication during renal transplantation, while allograft lithiasis is another uncommon but difficult-to-treat complication. These complications can lead to renal damage resulting from urinary obstruction and mortality due to infection. Several studies have demonstrated that most cases can be endoscopically managed if patients with hydronephrosis after renal transplantation do not prefer active surveillance or surgery. The timely and effective decompression of obstructed ureters is frequently challenging due to the un-physiologic location of the ureteroneocystostomy. For patients with significant hydronephrosis with renal function decline and sepsis, the prompt insertion of PCN can minimize the morbidity through immediate drainage and decompression, allowing for the diagnosis of the site of obstruction based on antegrade pyelography. However, PCN is associated with a risk of infection, bleeding and graft injuries, causing greater difficulty during the removal and exchange of an indwelling stent. Therefore, it appears more reasonable to use the retrograde ureteral stent placement as a first-line treatment for relieving upper urinary obstruction. Once the retrograde approach fails, the antegrade one can be applied.

### Renal ultrasound [^9246b68b]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Renal US is one of several imaging modalities available to the EP in the evaluation of patients with acute urologic disorders. It offers excellent anatomic detail without exposure to radiation or contrast agents but is limited in its assessment of renal function. It is an important alternative to helical CT scanning for evaluating renal colic, especially in children and pregnant women. It has an important role in excluding bilateral renal obstruction as the cause of acute renal failure. It is likely that Doppler renal US also will take on a prominent role in the evaluation of renal vascular disorders. It already has become the standard of care in the management of renal transplant patients. Bedside emergency renal US performed and interpreted by EPs with limited training and experience is increasing in use and gaining acceptance. At present, the primary role of renal US is to identify hydronephrosis in patients with renal colic or acute renal failure but, in the future, its role likely will expand as technology advances and its use increases. In many patients, bedside renal US may obviate the need for further diagnostic workup and speed the diagnosis and treatment of an emergency patient.

### Renal failure caused by severe pelvic organ prolapse [^3bf10242]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP), the transvaginal descent of pelvic organs, can cause mild hydronephrosis but rarely leads to a deterioration in kidney function. We present a case of severe uterovaginal prolapse that caused bilateral ureteral obstruction and led to renal failure and urinary tract infection. During outpatient follow-up, kidney function had already been deteriorating, but POP was not recognised as a causal factor. A longer duration of ureteral obstruction can lead to irreversible kidney damage, and therefore, timely recognition and intervention is of essence. Even in complex cases with various causative factors for kidney injury, the presence of severe POP and kidney injury should prompt the clinician to exclude this cause.

### Summary of the AUA guideline on management of primary vesicoureteral reflux in children [^bff8bedc]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — Topic 5: Screening of the neonate/infant with prenatal hydronephrosis defines the index patient as a healthy neonate with unilateral mild Society for Fetal Urology (SFU) grade 1 to moderate SFU grades 2–3 hydronephrosis identified on screening prenatal ultrasound at 30 weeks gestation. Postnatal evaluation of prenatal hydronephrosis (PNH) offers the opportunity to diagnose and manage vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) before secondary damage occurs from urinary tract infection (UTI), and prior studies recognize that maldevelopment in the absence of infection can contribute to the clinical picture of "reflux nephropathy". Evaluation of affected infants could additionally provide insights into the benefits, if any, of early identification of VUR and institution of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent UTI, pyelonephritis and renal scarring.

### Renal ultrasound to detect hydronephrosis: a need for routine imaging after radical hysterectomy? [^e2e1fb4b]. Gynecologic Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hydronephrosis can be a side effect of radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer. The incidence of clinically relevant hydronephrosis has not been studied in a large sample and the benefit of early detection of hydronephrosis is not clear.

Objective

To assess the incidence of hydronephrosis, following radical hysterectomy and evaluate the usefulness of routine renal ultrasound (RH).

Methods

Retrospective study, January 1998 and December 2008. Cervical cancer patients (FIGO stage IBI-IIA), treated with radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection with or without adjuvant radiotherapy, without surgical lesion of the ureter, followed-up 6 months in the Academic Medical Center Amsterdam. Routine renal ultrasound was performed four weeks after RH, and in some on indication before or after the routine ultrasound. We documented which interventions for hydronephrosis were performed and evaluated the profile of patients at risk for hydronephrosis.

Results

281 patients were included: 252 (90%) underwent routine renal ultrasound and 29 (10%) underwent imaging on indication before routine ultrasound. The overall incidence of hydronephrosis was 12%. In symptomatic patients, the incidence was 21% and 9% in asymptomatic women undergoing routine ultrasound. Four patients were invasively treated for hydronephrosis (1% of the total group) after imaging for clinical suspicion of hydronephrosis. Patients with hydronephrosis were significantly more often treated with radiotherapy than patients without (43% versus 25% (p = 0.03).

Conclusion

There is no place for routine renal ultrasound following radical hysterectomy. Patients should be instructed about the symptoms that may be related to hydronephrosis, to allow for renal ultrasound on indication.

### Chronic kidney disease with genitourinary tuberculosis: old disease but ongoing complication [^20345da8]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) is an important unresolved public health issue, affecting millions of people each year. In 2015, TB was one of the top 10 infectious causes of death worldwide; there were 10.4 million new TB cases, equivalent to 142 cases per 100,000 population, and 1.4 million deaths due to TB, with an additional 0.4 million deaths resulting from TB among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive persons. South Korea has an intermediate burden of TB; according to the Korea Center for Disease Control, the estimated TB incidence is 63.2 cases per 100,000 population (in 2015, n = 32,181). Extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) accounted for 13.0% of all new cases reported in 2015 (n = 6631). Genitourinary TB (GUTB) is a type of EPTB that infected 199 individuals in South Korea in 2015, accounting for 3.0% of all EPTB cases.

Although GUTB is a rare form of EPTB, it is an important cause of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). The kidneys are the most common site of GUTB, with bacteria spreading haematogenously. Tuberculous bacilli can lead to granuloma formation in glomeruli and entry into the medullary interstitium. Subsequently, renal papilla destruction can develop due to calyceal ulceration and involvement of the collecting system. This destruction may extend towards the urothelium and induce stricture formation, resulting in hydroureter and hydronephrosis. Renal calcification in GUTB is common, and patients with renal TB can develop bladder contracture. In addition, TB can affect the male and female genital tracts. GUTB induces end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in 5.7% of patients. According to the European Dialysis and Transplant Association registry, 0.65% of new dialysis cases are caused by renal TB. In Korea, there were 14,756 new dialysis patients in 2015, of whom 0.1% required dialysis because of GUTB.

### Newly developed hydronephrosis in patients following ureteroscopy: who is at risk? [^4a2dcb47]. Journal of Endourology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Objective: Imaging rates are low after ureteroscopy in the United States. Detecting postoperative hydronephrosis is important to minimize patient morbidity, and predicting patients at greatest risk for new postoperative hydronephrosis could inform imaging guidelines. We used data from a clinical registry to understand new-onset postoperative hydronephrosis and associated risk factors after ureteroscopy and stone intervention. Methods: Using the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative registry, we retrospectively identified all ureteroscopy for urolithiasis between July 2020 and June 2023. We included patients without hydronephrosis on preoperative CT or ultrasound. New postoperative hydronephrosis was defined as hydronephrosis seen between postoperative days 29 and 60 following ureteroscopy. We compared demographic and clinical variables from patients with new postoperative hydronephrosis with patients who did not develop hydronephrosis. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate risk factors for new postoperative hydronephrosis. Results: Preoperative imaging was available for 4742 patients across 31 urology practices, of which 1066 also had postoperative imaging within 29 to 60 days of surgery. New postoperative hydronephrosis was seen in 87 (8.2%) patients. Among them, 51 patients (58.6%) had transient hydronephrosis, 6 (6.9%) strictures, 5 (5.7%) residual stones, 2 (2.3%) hematomas, and 23 (26.4%) did not have information available. Silent hydronephrosis was present in seven patients (0.66%). Factors associated with new postoperative hydronephrosis included location of the stone (kidney vs ureter), greater stone size, use of ureteral access sheath, ureteral stent placement after surgery, longer stent dwell time, and the presence of residual stones. After adjustment, renal location of the largest stone was found to be an independent predictor of developing postoperative hydronephrosis. Conclusions: Postoperative hydronephrosis in patients without preoperative hydronephrosis occurs 1 in 13 patients who had both pre and postoperative studies after ureteroscopy. More than half of these cases are transient, and silent postoperative hydronephrosis is rare. These data support a goal-directed approach to imaging rather than routine imaging for all patients.

### Associated findings and complications of retroperitoneal fibrosis in 204 patients: results of a urological registry [^031230e5]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

We studied the frequency of associated findings and complications of retroperitoneal fibrosis in a large clinical collective of urological patients.

Materials and Methods

All urology departments in Germany were invited to participate in a registry of patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis, for which a data sheet with more than 200 questions was developed.

Results

As of March 2010 a total of 204 patients were registered. The male-to-female ratio was 2.1:1 and the average age at onset was 55.6 years. In 123 cases (60.3%) the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology. Coexisting autoimmune diseases were found in 9.8% of patients, consisting mainly of thyroid disorders. Coexisting fibrosis was detected in 3.4% of the patients and 73.9% of those queried were active smokers. Of 176 patients for whom data on therapy were available 123 received monotherapy and 41 received combination therapy for a mean of 12.1 months (12 received none), while 87 underwent a total of 103 operative procedures. Hydronephrosis was the most frequent complication in 95.6% of patients. Atrophic kidney from undetected hydronephrosis appeared in 46 patients (22.5%) and in 4 bilateral damage necessitated dialysis. Complications from vascular obstruction were observed in 27.5% of patients. Large bowel obstruction requiring colostomy occurred in 4 patients (2.0%).

Conclusions

Patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis often first present to urology departments upon referral for hydronephrosis. In this series at least 1 kidney appeared to be irreversibly damaged in more than 20% of patients. Urologists should be mindful of the role of smoking role as a risk factor, complications arising from vascular and large bowel obstructions, and the possible association of retroperitoneal fibrosis with autoimmune disease.

### Simultaneous primary posterior urethral valves ablation and bladder neck incision may decrease kidney and bladder failure in long-term follow-up in patients with bladder neck hypertrophy and poor bladder function at presentation: report of 301 cases [^ac60652f]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcome measurement

All the patients included in this study had regular post-operative follow-ups including every 3 months in the first year of post-operation, every 6 months in the second post-operative year, and then every year. If in-person follow-up visits were not possible, the remote follow-up visits occurred via phone interviews. Moreover, in the case of patients who were unable to perform their in-person post-surgical follow-ups. They referred to the pediatric urologists/nephrologists of their province of residence and the study's co-authors were informed of the post-surgical follow-up findings, to decrease the number of patients with loss of post-surgical follow-ups. Urinary tract ultrasonographic studies and renal function tests were also performed according to patients' history. Chronic renal failure was defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine of 2 mg/dL or, according to the CKD classification and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), was defined as the need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis and kidney transplantation) in the follow-up period due to a significant decrease in renal function to the point that the kidneys can no longer work on their own. Ultrasound was used to evaluate the severity of hydronephrosis, which was graded according to the SFU guidelines.

### Imaging of medical patients with acute kidney injury: patterns of ultrasound use and the role of point-of-care ultrasound at a tertiary care center [^bda4f7c4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The etiology of acute kidney injury (AKI) can be divided into pre-renal, renal, and post-renal causes. Ultrasound is the test of choice to identify post-renal AKI. While ultrasound is routinely used in the assessment of AKI, obstructive AKI is rare, leading to concerns of potential test overutilization.

Objective

Our primary aim is to describe patterns of use of imaging in patients admitted to hospital with AKI and to determine whether imaging patterns reflect risk of obstruction. Our secondary aim is to identify the role of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) when assessing patients with AKI.

Design

This is a retrospective cohort study.

Participants

Patients admitted to internal medicine with AKI over a 12-month period at a large tertiary care academic center.

Main Measures

Our outcome variables were radiology-performed ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), presence or absence of hydronephrosis and urological intervention.

Key Results

The proportion of patients with imaging was highest among those with a high-risk score and lowest in patients with a low-risk score (66.0% versus 52.2%). For radiology ultrasound specifically, the rate was 19.5% in low-risk patients and 17.7% in high-risk patients. The prevalence of hydronephrosis among patients at low, moderate and high risk for hydronephrosis was 7.1%, 8.5% and 19.7%, respectively and the rate of urological intervention was 1.4%, 1.2% and 3.8%, respectively. In moderate to high-risk patients, POCUS had a sensitivity of 86.7% and specificity of 90.0% for the identification of hydronephrosis.

Conclusions

In our cohort, nearly 20% of radiology ultrasounds are ordered in patients with a low risk of obstructive uropathy, despite low rates of hydronephrosis and hydronephrosis requiring intervention in this group. With a sensitivity of 86.7% and specificity of 90.0% in patients at moderate to high risk of obstruction, POCUS may support clinical decision making in patients with AKI.

### Risk factors associated with chronic kidney disease in patients with posterior urethral valves without prenatal hydronephrosis [^8b27a373]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Postnatal diagnosis of posterior urethral valves continues despite the prevalence of prenatal ultrasound. We identified risk factors associated with chronic kidney disease in these children.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of boys with posterior urethral valves with clinical presentations other than prenatal hydronephrosis. We recorded presenting symptoms, age at presentation, and preoperative hydronephrosis and/or vesicoureteral reflux. Chronic kidney disease was defined as previous renal transplantation, dialysis dependence or glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL per minute/1.73 m(2) at last followup. We used univariate survival analysis with the log rank test of equality for categorical variables and Cox proportional hazard regression for continuous variables to identify risk factors associated with progression to chronic kidney disease.

Results

We identified 141 boys with posterior urethral valves with a postnatal presentation. Median age at presentation was 46 months (range 0.3 to 174). Febrile urinary tract infection in 28% of patients and voiding complaints in 50% were the most common presentations. A total of 12 patients (9%) progressed to chronic kidney disease up to 23 years after initial presentation. Preoperative bilateral hydronephrosis, increased hydronephrosis severity and bilateral vesicoureteral reflux were associated with progression to chronic kidney disease.

Conclusions

Approximately 10% of cases with postnatal presentation of posterior urethral valves progress to chronic kidney disease, sometimes decades after the initial presentations. Although all patients with posterior urethral valves should be counseled on the potential loss of renal function, children with risk factors warrant close followup into adulthood.

### Risk factors for catheter-related infections in patients receiving permanent dialysis catheter [^0a8fa2aa]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Patients

A total of 150 patients underwent the implantation of permanent central venous hemodialysis catheters over a period of 10 years. Thirteen of 130 patients were excluded due to active cancer disease, 7 patients because of a missing CRP value at the time of catheter implantation. Overall we investigated 151 permanent central venous hemodialysis catheters implanted in 130 patients, 97 into the subclavian and 54 into the intern jugular vein. In 25 cases of catheter implant there was incomplete information relating to the endpoints. Prior dialysis dependency preexisted in 24 patients (median time on dialysis: 33 [IQR 14–63] months).

The mean age of the 130 included patients was 68.8 ± 12.8 (range 25–87 years). Eighty-three of 151 catheters were implanted in male patients. In 68.9% of the cases the cause of hemodialysis was an acute or an acute on chronic kidney injury. 47.7% of the patients suffered from diabetes mellitus. The median/mean CRP value at the time of catheter implantation was 24.7[IQR 9.4–38.3]/29.3 + 26.8 mg/l (normal value < 5.0 mg/l). Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

### Treatment of end-stage renal disease with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis in rural Guatemala [^0f1ed8a8]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

For the patient in this case, the aetiology of CKD remains unknown, and a wide differential includes diabetic nephropathy, nephrotoxic exposure, chronic nephrolithiasis, chronic UTIs and other causes. The patient has a 6-year history of uncontrolled diabetes and has experienced diabetes complications such as hyperglycaemic crisis and severe peripheral neuropathy. However, he does not meet criteria for diabetic kidney disease given that he had no history of diabetic retinopathy, did not have severely increased albuminuria (previously known as macroalbuminuria, ACR > 300 mg/g) and had a more rapid progression of renal disease than would typically be expected from diabetes alone. He also did not have a history or laboratory evidence suggestive of other common causes of ESRD — including hypertension, UTIs or nephrotoxic ingestion. Although echogenic foci were found on renal ultrasound, the pattern was not consistent with nephrocalcinosis, and the presence of non-obstructing kidney stones without hydronephrosis in a patient denying a history of symptoms of renal colic makes chronic nephrolithiasis seem less likely as the primary aetiology for his CKD.

In recent decades, there has been an increasing incidence of renal disease of uncertain aetiology in Central America observed in male agricultural workers in coastal areas. This entity has been termed 'CKD of non-traditional aetiology' (CKDnT) and is a source of active research throughout the region. The Pan American Health Association (PAHO) recently released a report on CKDnT epidemiology, consensus case definitions and methods for surveillance. In Guatemala, dialysis enrolment rates may be higher along the southwestern coast. However, epidemiological studies using dialysis registries are susceptible to confounding as indigenous Maya people, like this patient, tend to live in highland rather than coastal towns and also face barriers to accessing dialysis. The patient described in this case does not meet PAHO technical criteria for a 'confirmed clinical case of CKDnT' given the presence of diabetes with diabetic neuropathy.

### Do current scientific reports of hydronephrosis make the grade? [^8d530976]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In December 2014, Nguyen et al. introduced the Upper Tract Dilation (UTD) classification scheme, hoping to unify multiple disciplines when describing ultrasound imaging of congenital hydronephrosis. We hypothesized that the academic community has been slow to adopt its use in publications.

Primary Aim

To evaluate which hydronephrosis grading systems were currently preferred in publications.

Study Design

A PubMed® search for hydronephrosis was performed, and abstracts between May 2017 and May 2019 were reviewed. The following data points were collected from the 197 manuscripts meeting inclusion criteria: journal, first and senior author specialty, country, type of article, primary pathology, and classification of hydronephrosis when present. Differences between use of classification system, and author specialty, manuscript type, and pathology were evaluated.

Results

First and/or senior author specialties were most commonly pediatric urology, urology, pediatric surgery, and pediatric nephrology. The manuscripts were comprised of retrospective studies (48.2%), prospective studies (25.4%), case reports (15.7%), review articles (9.1%), and systematic reviews (1.5%). The most common pathologies were hydronephrosis (36.5%) and ureteropelvic junction obstruction (21.3%). Over 20% of manuscripts did not categorize hydronephrosis at all. The UTD classification was used by 5.6%, while Society for Fetal Urology (SFU) grading was used by 37.1% and Anterior-Posterior Diameter (APD) measurements by 32.5%. The Summary Table presents grading system by manuscript type, specialty, and pathology.

Discussion

There is great variability in hydronephrosis grading. One potential weakness of our study is that sufficient time may not have passed for the UTD system to be adopted. Researchers may need more time to complete and publish their studies, or could be awaiting further validation of UTD utility. They could also be hesitant to change systems when it is unknown if one classification schema is superior to another, either in general or for specific diagnoses. Another weakness is that this study does not quantify what, if any, systems are used clinically. Some attempt to provide objective classification would help clarify the implications of the manuscript for research or clinical applications. Reviewers should ensure that where possible, adequate descriptions of hydronephrosis are included. Education outreach to other specialties may help increase objective grading in research.

Conclusions

The UTD system is not commonly utilized in the literature. SFU grading is applied most commonly, followed by APD measurements. Over one third of manuscripts used no classification system or descriptive terminology.

### Mitomycin (Jelmyto) [^393f0954]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Ureteric Obstruction

Ureteric obstruction, including ureteral stenosis and hydronephrosis, occurred in patients receiving JELMYTO.

In the Olympus study, ureteric obstruction was reported in 58% (n = 41) of patients receiving JELMYTO, including 17% (n = 12) of patients who experienced Grade 3 obstruction. The median time to first onset was 72 days (range: 15–462). Interventions in the 41 patients experiencing ureteric obstruction included ureteral stent placement (88%), balloon dilatation (29%), and nephroureterectomy (4.9%). In the 36 patients who required ureteral stent placement, the median duration of indwelling stents was 52 days (range: 1–292). Ureteric obstruction did not resolve or resolved with sequelae in 44% (n = 18) of these patients. Of the 41 patients who experienced ureteric obstruction, 17% (n = 7) experienced Grades 1–2 increase in serum creatinine.

In the 42 patients who only received JELMYTO during the treatment phase (no maintenance therapy), ureteric obstruction was reported in 40% (n = 17).

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ureteric obstruction, including flank pain, and fever, and for changes in renal function. Patients who experience obstruction may require transient or long-term ureteral stents or alternative procedures. Withhold or permanently discontinue JELMYTO based on the severity of ureteric obstruction.

5.2	Bone Marrow Suppression

The use of JELMYTO can result in bone marrow suppression, particularly thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. In the Olympus study, Grade 3 thrombocytopenia occurred in three patients, Grade 3 anemia in one patient, and Grade 3 neutropenia in one patient. Gross extravasation of JELMYTO via urinary tract perforation or impaired mucosa was not observed in these patients. The following tests should be obtained prior to each treatment: Platelet count, white blood cell count differential and hemoglobin. Withhold JELMYTO for Grade 2 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia. Permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or greater thrombocytopenia or neutropenia.

### Including medical management in the urologic approach to idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis [^abb81a41]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To characterize the timing and effectiveness of medical management in resolving stent-dependent ureteral compression secondary to idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF), the long-term relevant outcomes, and the side effects of treatment.

Methods

A retrospective review of RPF patients diagnosed from 2002–2018 was performed. Patients with hydronephrosis due to ureteral involvement that were managed with medication and with temporary stenting as needed, but without initial ureterolysis, were included. Patient demographics and RPF management details were obtained, including the following subsequent events: ureterolysis, nephrectomy, recurrent upper tract obstruction, and medication side effects.

Results

Fifty-two patients met inclusion criteria. Resolution of ureteral obstruction with medical management and temporary renal drainage as needed occurred in 36 (69%) patients with a median stent duration of 16 months, and median clinical and radiographic follow up of 4.2 and 3.3 years, respectively. Recurrent obstruction after a stent-free period occurred in 9 (18%) patients. Ureterolysis was performed in 8 (15%) patients at a median of 2.2 years for medication intolerance, lack of radiographic response to medication, or persisting pain. Potential medication side effects occurred in 6 (12%) patients.

Conclusions

Medical management supported successful resolution of ureteral obstruction in 69% of patients without the need for ureterolysis after temporary renal drainage using stents, with rare incidence of worsening renal dysfunction or medication side effect. To date, this is the largest reported series of systematically managed RPF patients with obstructive uropathy receiving initial medical therapy and serves to counsel patients and advise urologists and nephrologists of the expected course and advantages and disadvantages of medical versus surgical management.

### Association between severity of prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis and receipt of surgical intervention postnatally among patients seen at a fetal-maternal center [^01a351da]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Demographic and prenatal factors among patients prenatally diagnosed with hydronephrosis at fetal-maternal center and followed post-birth from 2004–2019 (n = 101)

Table 2
Number and rate of kidneys requiring surgical intervention among 131 kidneys diagnosed prenatally with mild, moderate, and severe hydronephrosis

The likelihood of requiring surgery varied significantly by prenatal HN severity. Additionally, among those patients who required surgery, age at surgery varied by HN severity; patients with moderate and severe HN generally underwent surgery at younger ages than patients with mild HN (Fig. 1). Patients with severe HN were 12.2 times more likely to require surgery than patients with mild HN (95% CI 6.1–24.4; p < 0.001), and 2.9 times more likely to require surgery than patients with moderate HN (95% CI 1.5–5.3; p = 0.003). Additionally, patients with moderate HN were 4.3 times more likely to require surgery than patients with mild HN (95% CI 1.5–12.9; p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in probability of receiving surgery by patient gender, race/ethnicity, primary language, or medical insurance type. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the probability of surgical intervention among patients with evidence of VUR, compared to those with no evidence of VUR (45.5% vs. 43.8%; X 2 p = 0.72).

### Ureteric stent versus percutaneous nephrostomy for acute ureteral obstruction-clinical outcome and quality of life: a bi-center prospective study [^04191350]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to our study. The "tube symptoms" questionnaire was based on a validated DJS symptoms questionnaire, adjusted to be relevant for both DJS and PCN groups, but was not validated in itself or to local language, and might induce recall bias. As both hospitals are public, at no cost to the patient, procedural or hospitalization cost did not introduce bias. However, selection bias may have been introduced through choice of drainage procedure according to surgeon's preference, recruitment rate, possibly influenced by severity of eGFR, hydronephrosis, or other unmeasured parameters. Therefore patients suspected of long standing impaction probably had a higher chance of receiving a PCN, thus explaining the lower GFR in this group. Furthermore, as different imaging modalities were used, we could not assess hydronephrosis severity as a possible confounder. Finally, we did not assess a third time point, after tube removal, to confirm symptoms resolution. Nevertheless, we believe our study, supported by other past reports, demonstrate an overlooked truth. To quote Dr. Louis R Kavoussi, "Traditionally, urologists have placed stents because… that's what we do", but his experience is that "patients are more comfortable with a nephrostomy than a stent". Interestingly, superior QoL of PCN over DJS placed after PCNL was also recently reported. The results of this study support superior QoL of nephrostomy tube over time, and may cause some urologists to reconsider their choice of renal drainage, especially in health systems in which definitive treatment might be delayed. Undoubtedly, the specific tube symptoms, and their influence of the patient over time, should be given a serious consideration in the deliberation for the right drainage method for a specific patient.

### Semiautomatic three-dimensional ultrasound renal volume segmentation in pediatric hydronephrosis: interrater agreement and correlation to conventional hydronephrosis grading [^8a42149e]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

As the anteroposterior diameter is commonly used as a proxy for hydronephrosis severity, our data suggest that parenchymal volume could serve as a complementary indicator, particularly in borderline cases where anteroposterior diameter alone may not be conclusive. In line with findings from Onen et al. who correlated hydronephrosis grades with surgical indications, we propose that integrating volumetric analysis could improve the accuracy of assessing intervention needs and timing. While our study was not designed to predict surgical outcomes, it highlights the potential of volumetric assessment in refining prognostic evaluation. Future research should explore its role in clinical decision-making, particularly by correlating 3-D US-derived parenchymal volumes with split renal function, as measured by diuretic scintigraphy or MR urography.

A recent study recommended 3-D US over MRI for renal volume assessment in the follow-up of children with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. In contrast to our study, it excluded hydronephrotic kidneys and included only older patients (> 8 years). In contrast, our cohort included a large proportion of young patients (51% under 5 years, including seven infants), who are especially prone to movement during 3-D acquisition. This highlights the advantage of fast volume capture using a matrix array transducer in this age group. In the comparative study of Fritz et al. infants younger than 6 months were included; however, six were excluded from the analysis because of increased motion, resulting in unusable images. Riccabona et al. similarly reported that 3-D US was impossible in some uncooperative infants. In our prospective study, no child was excluded, and the software evaluated at least one of the three acquired datasets for all patients.

### Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome: brain death following hemodialysis for metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure – a case report [^cbc6a3a7]. BMC Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Table 1
Laboratory values at prior to and following initiation of hemodialysis in the intensive care unit.

Chest radiograph revealed right middle lobe and lingular patchy opacification. An abdomino-pelvic CT scan demonstrated moderate to severe bilateral hydronephrosis, bladder wall thickening with multiple diverticuli, and retroperitoneal streaking consistent with acute infection. A provisional diagnosis of severe sepsis was made with multiple potential foci of infection. The patient was given empiric ceftriaxone, metronidazole and vancomycin. Sputum specimen cultured heavy methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, blood cultures were positive for S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and Group B Streptococcus. Urine cultured greater than 10 8 CFU/L of multiple gram positive and negative organisms.

The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The metabolic acidosis persisted (pH 7.00) a despite 100 mEq of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate bolus and infusion of three liters of normal bicarbonate solution (150 mEq of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate in 1000 mL D5W). The patient had a suprapubic bladder catheter inserted by angiography. However, due to concern the patient remained oliguric following 4 L crystalloid resuscitation, hemodialysis was organized. Hemodialysis parameters included: F160 membrane (surface area 1.5 m 2 and KUf 50 mL/hr/mmHg), dialysate sodium 136 mmol/L, potassium 3 mmol/L, calcium 1.25 mmol/L, bicarbonate 40 mmol/L, and Q D 500 mL/min, Q B 250–300 mL/min via a 25 cm left femoral double-lumen Uldall catheter. The patient had 71.5 L of blood processed over four hours with no fluid removal. Although the patient was alert and appropriate (Glasgow Coma Scale 15) with tachycardia and stable normal range blood pressure before the initiation of dialysis, he was demonstrating an increased work of breathing and oxygen requirements suggestive of worsening sepsis syndrome. Approximately 2.5 hrs after start of dialysis the patient became rapidly unresponsive prompting intubation for airway protection. At completion of HD and over the subsequent 4 hours the patient's neurologic status deteriorated with evidence of loss of all brainstem reflexes. Head CT-scan is shown in Figure 1.

### Bilateral purely laparoscopic nephrectomy for renal masses using five ports without repositioning: a case report [^4210f92b]. Journal of Endourology (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Bilateral nephrectomy is an infrequently performed procedure. The indications include bilateral masses too large for nephron-sparing surgery, recalcitrant hypertension in dialysis patients, pain, infection, reflux, or large symptomatic polycystic kidneys. Bilateral pretransplant purely laparoscopic nephrectomy for bilateral renal masses has not been reported previously. We present our experience with this procedure using five transabdominal trocars without having to reposition the patient.

Methods

We employed a five-port technique in a middle-aged woman with end-stage renal disease who presented with an infected peritoneal dialysis catheter. On abdominal CT, she had bilateral enhancing renal masses. Six weeks after removal of the catheter, she underwent bilateral transperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy. The technique is described, and recommendations are made regarding potential obstacles.

Results

The procedure was performed in 185 minutes, and the total hospital time was 41 hours. The estimated blood loss was 50 mL. Final pathology examination revealed a 5.5-cm right renal-cell carcinoma stage T1N0M0 and left hydronephrosis, atrophy, nephrosclerosis, and thick-walled renal cysts without malignancy. On 3-month follow-up she is well, without complaints.

Conclusion

Bilateral pretransplant purely laparoscopic nephrectomy can be performed without significant repositioning, redraping, and resterilization. In this case, operative time and cosmesis were acceptable, and surgical morbidity was low.

### Can plain film radiography improve the emergency department detection of clinically important urinary stones? [^87f5263a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Physicians frequently use ultrasound to assess hydronephrosis in patients with suspected renal colic, but ultrasound has limited diagnostic sensitivity and rarely clarifies stone size or location. Consequently, up to 80% of emergency department (ED) renal colic patients undergo confirmatory CT imaging. Our goal was to estimate x-ray sensitivity for urinary stones and determine whether x-ray substantially improves stone detection (sensitivity) compared to hydronephrosis assessment alone.

Methods

We reviewed imaging reports from all renal colic patients who underwent x-ray and CT at four EDs. For each patient, we documented stone size, location and hydronephrosis severity on CT and whether stones were identified on x-ray. We considered moderate and severe hydronephrosis (MS-Hydro) as significant positive findings, then calculated the sensitivity (detection rate) of MS-Hydro and x-ray for large stones ≥ 5 mm and for stones likely to require intervention (all ureteral stones > 7 mm and proximal or middle stones > 5 mm). We then tested a diagnostic algorithm adding x-ray to hydronephrosis assessment.

Results

Among 1026 patients with 1527 stones, MS-Hydro sensitivity was 39% for large stones and 60% for interventional stones. X-ray sensitivity was 46% for large stones and 52% for interventional stones. Adding x-ray to hydronephrosis assessment increased sensitivity in all stone categories, specifically from 39% to 68% for large stones (gain = 29%; 95%CI, 23% to 35%) and from 60% to 82% for interventional stones (gain = 22%; 95%CI, 13% to 30%). Because CT and ultrasound show strong agreement for MS-Hydro identification, physicians who depend on ultrasound-based hydronephrosis assessment could achieve similar gains by adding x-ray.

Conclusions

Adding x-ray to hydronephrosis assessment substantially improves diagnostic sensitivity, enabling the detection of nearly 70% of large stones and over 80% of interventional stones. This level of sensitivity may be sufficient to reassure physicians about a renal colic diagnosis without CT imaging for many patients.

### Treatment of end-stage renal disease with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis in rural Guatemala [^e545e33d]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Approximately 18 months after his initial presentation, the patient reported persistent difficulty gaining weight, as well as interval development of severe nausea and anorexia. An evaluation for failure to thrive was initiated at a higher-level laboratory in the regional capital. Results were notable for a serum creatinine of 7.57 mg/dL (glomerular filtration rate 8.5 mL/min/1.732) and blood urea nitrogen of 68.0 mg/dL (normal range 6.0–21 mg/dL), which were confirmed on repeat. Serum potassium, liver function tests, C reactive protein, thyrotropin, HIV, viral hepatitis antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, serum protein electrophoresis and urinalysis (with the exception of the presence of glycosuria) were normal. Haemoglobin was 7.3 mg/dL (normal range 12–16 mg/dL) with normal mean corpuscular volume. A renal ultrasound showed bilateral atrophic kidneys with increased echogenicity, two small non-obstructive echogenic foci suggestive of kidney stones and no significant hydronephrosis. Additional information obtained at this time confirmed that the patient had no known history of hypertension, urinary tract infections (UTIs), nephrolithiasis or exposure to nephrotoxic agents.

The patient was referred to the National Centre for Chronic Renal Disease (UNAERC), an institution in Guatemala City serving as the public nephrology centre. At UNAERC, the aetiology of his end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was not definitively elucidated, and a kidney biopsy was not pursued given the chronic and irreversible nature of his renal disease. Renal replacement therapy was recommended, and the patient was presented two options: twice-weekly haemodialysis at UNAERC, or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) multiple times daily in his home. He chose CAPD, as limited mobility and finances precluded him from travelling to Guatemala City, a 3-hour bus trip each way. The patient initiated home CAPD after an abdominal catheter was placed and a sterile dialysis room was constructed in his home.

### Sacral neuromodulation for organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: a case report [^86317455]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 27-year-old male, presented with intermittent low back pain and fever persisting for six days. Six days earlier, the patient had undergone a CT scan of the upper abdomen, along with routine blood and urine tests at a local hospital, due to back pain and fever. The results indicated severe hydronephrosis with ureteral dilatation in both kidneys, alongside elevated leukocyte counts. The diagnosis was bilateral hydronephrosis accompanied by a urinary tract infection. Despite receiving anti-infection treatment, the patient's symptoms persisted, necessitating admission to our hospital. Upon admission, the patient was administered anti-inflammatory treatment and fitted with an indwelling catheter for one week. One week later, a follow-up urologic CT examination revealed persistent hydronephrosis in both kidneys and the bilateral ureters, along with bladder wall thickening (Fig. 1). Further urodynamic evaluation revealed several issues: increased bladder sensitivity, decreased compliance, and reduced detrusor muscle contraction, which required abdominal pressure to aid urination. During the storage phase, the bladder's initial sensation was noted at 36 ml, with a strong urge at 54 mL and a maximum infusion volume of 140 ml. The patient was instructed to void, but no urine was produced. After the removal of the pressure catheter, the maximum urine flow rate was 8 ml/s, and the voided volume was 50 ml. Following catheter insertion, 300 mL of urine was drained, likely due to ureteral expansion (Fig. 2 A). Urethrocystography revealed a characteristic "pear-shaped" bladder pattern (Fig. 3). The physical examination did not reveal any specific signs. The patient's medical history was not reported. At age 14, the patient accidentally ingested a poison known as Dimethoate and underwent dialysis treatment at a local hospital. Currently, the patient's renal function is normal.

6–9 As a result, findings from RUS do not initiate a change in clinical management in the majority of patients with AKI who undergo the test. It has also been suggested that RUS might yield additional clinically useful information, yet little is known about how frequently this occurs. 8, 10. Additional exclusion criteria included pregnancy, history of renal transplant, and previous diagnosis of HN within 30 days prior to RUS. The study outcomes were HN and HN requiring intervention. Any RUS report that described "hydronephrosis" in the findings section was considered an outcome event. HNRI was defined as a RUS-diagnosed HN followed by either placement of a urologic stent or nephrostomy tube after the RUS date. In addition to considering all cases of HN, we also assessed those requiring an intervention.

These cases are most important to identify because they represent patients for whom RUS affected their management. We defined HNRI as an immediate surgical intervention most likely to be performed in the setting of HN, which 27 of the patients with HN received in our validation sample.

### Impact of radiation on the incidence and management of ureteroenteric strictures: a contemporary single center analysis [^2eabde25]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ureteroenteric anastomotic stricture is a well-known complication of urinary diversion which occurs in 4–20% of patients. Patients with strictures present clinically with flank pain, decreased renal function, pyelonephritis, or may be asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally with progressive hydronephrosis and renal impairment. Strictures are a cause of significant morbidity and health care expenditure, as treatment necessitates procedural intervention and often several repeat admissions. Numerous studies have sought to identify risk factors for development of ureteroenteric strictures, as well as opportunities for technical approaches to reduce stricture risk. Stricture is traditionally more common on the left side, in patients with elevated BMI, longer operative time, and those with Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3 complication, however these studies have not identified radiation therapy as a significant risk factor. Increased stricture risk of the left side has been attributed to the need for greater ureteral mobilization in order to transpose it to the right side for anastomosis. This extended dissection is likely to compromise distal ureteral vasculature. Operative time and high-grade complications are associated with stricture development likely in part due to fluid shifts, hypoperfusion of the ureteroenteric anastomosis. These as well as increased risk with elevated BMI are suggestive of the risks seen with difficult urinary diversion surgeries.

### Evaluation of postoperative renal function in infants with congenital hydronephrosis using ROI from ultrasound technique in renography [^8c178d6b]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Urinary tract dilation (UTD), including its most prevalent form, hydronephrosis (HN), is a commonly observed condition during pregnancy. The prevalence of prenatal hydronephrosis is approximately twofold higher in males compared to females. Spontaneous resolution of HN occurs in about 75% ~ 80% of children within a few years following birth, while a small number exhibit progressive deterioration necessitating surgical intervention to alleviate urinary obstruction. Congenital anomalies, particularly ureteropelvic stenosis, are primary etiologies of hydronephrosis and significant contributors to chronic renal failure development in children. Early differential diagnosis and timely therapeutic intervention play pivotal roles in mitigating the progression of renal function impairment. Abdominal ultrasound monitors hydronephrosis progression by evaluating changes in pelvicalyceal dilation and quantifying morphological parameters related to the kidneys such as renal cortical length, width, and thickness to infer alterations in renal function. Diuretic renography assesses changes in renal function due to hydronephrosis offering superior advantages for enhancing individual renal function assessment. Due to the severe degree of hydronephrosis in infants with moderate and severe hydronephrosis, caused by significant urinary tract obstruction, the renal cortex is visibly compressed and atrophied. The impairment of renal function is relatively serious, with a large amount of radioactive scattering in the hydronephrotic area. This, combined with surrounding background interference and limitations in resolution of the radioactive imaging equipment, makes it difficult to distinguish the kidney contour, resulting in significant errors.

### Posterior urethral valves: 10 years audit of epidemiologic, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects in yaoundégynaeco-obstetric and paediatric hospital [^ad292734]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Posterior urethral valve (PUV) is the most common lower urinary tract congenital anomaly in boys with an incidence of 1: 5000–1:8000 males. It is the leading cause of bladder outlet obstruction and renal insufficiency in male children. The incidence is unknown in our sub-region. In Nigeria, Uba et al. in Jos, reported 3–8 cases per annum and Jaja et al. in Port Harcourt observed that it accounted for 1 in 2447 children seen in their hospital.

This disease was first described by Morgagni in 1717 and later by Langenbeck in 1802. The exact embryology and aetiology of this condition are not known.

PUV has detrimental and wide-ranging effects on the global development of the kidney, bladder and the entire urinary system. This result from persistent and unrelieved pressure on the bladder leading to bladder diverticular, hydronephrosis and chronic to end-stage renal diseases (ESRD). The anomaly is associated with high mortality and morbidity including urosepsis, overflow urinary incontinence, chronic kidney diseases (CKD), hypertension, chronic anaemia, failure to thrive, poor quality of life and even death.

Early diagnosis can be made prenatally by regular and routine prenatal ultrasounds. The routine use of this modality has significantly increased early diagnosis and management of this pathology in most developed countries. As prenatal hydronephrosis usually prompts an early and complete work up at birth with a voiding cysto-urethrogram (VCUG) leading to early postnatal diagnosis. Prenatal ultrasound uptakes are still at low levels in our environment.

Initial continuous catheter drainage and or vesicostomy and eventual management by endoscopic valve resection, usually ameliorate the obstructive uropathy. However, it has been noted that even after surgical treatment of valves and relief of obstruction, about 70% of older children and adolescents continue to have persistent bladder dysfunction, poor quality of life, and worsening CKD and ESRD. Long-term management of PUV constitutes a challenge in the practice of pediatric urology in our environment due to lack of specialized centers as well as the paucity of trained pediatric urologists and nephrologists to evaluate and monitor these children. In the few highly specialized centers where valve ablation is done, most patients fail to turn up for follow-up visits due to an erroneous belief that it has been cured following the initial relief of the obstruction.

### Summary of the AUA guideline on management of primary vesicoureteral reflux in children [^2fd7b4ab]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — evidence summary for prenatally noted hydronephrosis (PNH) reports that approximately 16% of neonates and infants with PNH have reflux, that this incidence was independent of prenatal RPD with reflux also detected in non-dilated renal units, and that the incidence of VUR was similar when postnatal urinary tract ultrasonography was normal. Reflux grade was III or greater in two-thirds of patients, with renal abnormalities occurring in nearly 50% of those with grades IV–V, and given that VUR occurs in only approximately 1% of otherwise normal infants, those with PNH represent a group at increased risk for reflux. Together these considerations potentially support postnatal cystography in all neonates with PNH; however, the lack of a prospective study demonstrating benefit and recent data questioning efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent UTI make screening cystography an option, rather than a recommendation.

### Nephrovesical subcutaneous ureteric bypass: long-term results in patients with advanced metastatic disease-improvement of renal function and quality of life [^e9191980]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Placing a percutaneous nephrostomy often is the only and final solution for patients with metastatic disease, where internal ureteral stenting proved to be impossible.

Methods

Between August 1999 and June 2005, 31 nephrovesical ureteric bypasses were implanted in 28 patients with advanced metastatic disease. The ureteric bypass consists of two subcutaneously connected 12F polyurethane tubes, placed as a nephrostomy and cystostomy. Urinary culture, serum creatinine, quality of life score, and renal ultrasonography were evaluated at follow-up.

Results

Mean follow-up was 11.9 mo (range, 2–54 mo). Preoperative hydronephrosis was eliminated in 27 cases (87.1%) and reduced in the remaining four kidneys (12.9%). Preoperative serum creatinine levels (5.9 ± 3.2 mg%) decreased significantly postoperatively (1.4 ± 0.9 mg%). Mean quality of life score was 3.4 ± 1.4 preoperatively and 7.6 ± 1.0 postoperatively. In five patients (17.9%) the system had to be replaced due to occlusion at a mean follow-up of 10.2 mo.

Conclusion

This nephrovesical ureteric bypass is a simple, minimally invasive, and highly effective treatment for patients with hydronephrosis resulting from advanced oncologic disease. Patients gain a better quality of life due to increased independence and mobility during their final stages of life.

### Management of malignant ureteric obstruction with ureteric stenting or percutaneous nephrostomy [^ba2f332b]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Decision-making in this area is complex, and a rationale for intervention for palliation remains in certain patients even when survival is expected to be poor. Potential immediately life-threatening indications, including sepsis and AKI, were present in 9.4 and 57.6% of the patients respectively, where intervention may be justified in the face of imminent death, even with the prospect of poor oncological outcomes. Indeed, although most patients did not have a significant improvement in renal function, there was a sizeable proportion of patients in this cohort with an arguably life-threatening eGFR of less than 15 mL per min per 1.73 m 2 who showed an improvement to over 45 mL per min per 1.73 m 2. However, an understanding of the survival benefit with intervention is important. Understanding potential benefits allows patient-centred discussion of the balance of risks and benefits, particularly in view of the morbidity associated with intervention. Even among teams unfamiliar with the individual patient, the Scottish MUO Score can aid this discussion. Although the proportion of patients in this cohort who received further oncological treatment is similar to that in previous reports, the data do not allow assessment of quality-of-life or outcomes without intervention, which is the subject of an ongoing prospective study.

### Practical considerations when providing palliative care to patients with neuroendocrine tumors in the context of routine disease management or hospice care [^ff95ef55]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Indications for palliative surgery

For many patients suffering from NETs, surgical intervention is by definition, palliative (i.e. to improve symptoms and quality of life, but not necessarily effect a cure). Although surgical eradication of the disease is possible, many patients present with stage IV disease and as such, surgical cure is not possible. Depending on the health and well-being of the patient at the time of presentation, many patients with unresectable diseases are suitable for non-curative surgery to treat symptoms. The issue of surgery near the end of life for patients with NETs is complex and highly selective. As with all palliative measures, the utilization of surgical intervention for improvement in symptoms must be balanced against the biological aggressiveness of disease and quality of remaining life. In a recent study, Hallet et al found moderate to serve symptoms of tiredness, loss of appetite, shortness of breath, nausea, and pain in NET patients during their last 6 months of life. Many of these symptoms steeply increased, especially in the last 8 weeks of life, providing for the first time some insight into what we as caregivers need to address in the terminal months of a NET patient's life.

Although NETs are diverse in their biological aggressiveness and symptom presentations, there are a few generalizable rules for the role of palliative procedures by interventional radiology, gastroenterology, and surgery near the end of life.

Symptomatic relief from fluid accumulation with percutaneous thoracentesis and paracentesis of pleural effusions and ascites should be utilized whenever possible.
Surgical resection, bypass, or diversion (ostomy formation) or endoscopic stenting of intraluminal tumors causing obstruction can be considered. These interventions, however, are highly selective and should not be utilized in the face of diffuse peritoneal disease or multiple sites of obstruction.
Biliary stenting for common bile duct obstruction can provide relief of symptoms arising from jaundice. Although commonly utilized for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, there is limited data on pancreatic NETs.
Potential relief of intestinal ischemia and venous stasis of the intestine with Superior Mesenteric Vein (SMV) stenting has been reported, yet it is highly selective. In a small series of 20 patients with SMV occlusion, the authors utilized endovascular SMV stents in 12 patients with a third reporting resolution of their symptoms.
In the case of obstructive uropathy causing hydronephrosis from MF, percutaneous J-stents can provide excellent palliation.

### An uncommon mimicker of renal malignancy: IgG4-related disease [^54d63abd]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 49-year-old gentleman from Korea was referred by his GP for further assessment and management when a CT scan performed for investigation of chronic back pain and fatigue demonstrated an incidental finding of a right renal pelvis mass causing compression of the proximal ureter and resultant hydronephrosis and renal atrophy (Fig. 1 A). He was otherwise well, with past medical history including obstructive sleep apnoea, hypertension and being a current smoker. Further investigation with a ureteroscopy did not yield results as a dense proximal ureteric stricture precluded proper examination of the renal pelvis, with urine cytology collected being atypical and inconclusive.

Fig. 1
A CT imaging demonstrating the renal pelvic mass lesion, associated poor drainage and atrophy of the ipsilateral kidney. B PET imaging demonstrating intense FDG avidity of lesion in question

With a PET scan demonstrating that the lesion was FDG-avid, and concerns regarding invasion of the tumour into the inferior vena cava and encasing the contralateral renal vein, a difficult decision was made to proceed with an open right radical nephroureterectomy, caval exploration and tumour removal, as well as resection of the left renal vessels with graft reconstruction (Fig. 1 B). The local vascular team was invited into the operation as a combined surgical intervention.

The surgery was difficult, with tumour densely adherent to other retroperitoneal structures, and multiple abnormal lymph nodes removed along with the specimen. Recovery of the patient was slow, complicated by ileus, wound infection and clot urinary retention requiring blood transfusion and bladder washouts. During the initial phase, the patient was also suffering from oliguria and a severe renal failure that thankfully did not require intermittent dialysis. Serial ultrasound doppler of the contralateral kidney demonstrated patent grafted renal vessels with no impediment to renal blood flow. All in all, the patient spent a month in hospital and was discharged home when well. His subsequent recovery was uneventful.

### Retrograde ureteric stent insertion from percutaneous suprapubic access to the bladder in renal transplant recipients with ureteric stenosis: a novel minimally invasive technique [^97764b31]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Urological complications occupy 2–14% of all complications during renal transplantation. The incidence of ureteric stricture after kidney transplantation can reach up to 3%. Among all ureteric stricture cases, 73% occur at the distal end, involving the ureteroneocystostomy. When patients who received a kidney present with hydronephrosis due to obstructing stones or ureteric stricture, they should undergo the insertion of either a nephrostomy or a ureteral stent as soon as possible. Conventionally, ureteral catheterization under a cystoscope has been considered an initial approach before percutaneous renal puncture with drainage. Several reports have suggested that nephrostomy placement is cost-saving and safe. However, in the experience of the investigators, most candidates are reluctant to undergo percutaneous renal drainage due to hidden risks. A randomized study revealed that there was no significant difference between nephrostomy and ureteral stenting. Furthermore, retrograde ureteral stent placement in transplant recipients can be time-consuming and technically difficult. In the present study, we report our experience in using retrograde ureteral stent insertion through percutaneous suprapubic access to the bladder (RUS-PSAB) to successfully relieve ureteral obstruction in three patients with confirmed allograft hydronephrosis.

### Does ureteral stent drainage prior to cystectomy increase the risk of subsequent upper tract urothelial carcinoma and ureteral complications? [^6b9b3e85]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To guide management of preoperative hydronephrosis prior to radical cystectomy (RC), we compared post-RC risks of upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) and ureteroenteric anastomotic complications between ureteral stent and percutaneous nephrostomy tube drainage.

Methods

Patients who underwent RC for urothelial carcinoma without a prior diagnosis of UTUC at our institution between 2000 and 2015 were included and divided into 4 patient groups: (1) no hydronephrosis (75%, N = 787); (2) hydronephrosis without preoperative upper tract drainage (13%, N = 132); (3) hydronephrosis treated with nephrostomy tube (3%, N = 36); (4) hydronephrosis treated with ureteral stent (9%, N = 94). The incidence of post-RC UTUC and ureteral complications was compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling.

Results

We identified a total of 1049 patients who underwent RC (median postoperative follow-up 4.3 years). Five-year post-RC UTUC incidence was 6.6%, 10.2%, 17%, 18.7% for groups 1–4, respectively (P = 0.13). On multivariable analysis, nephrostomy tube drainage (hazard ratio [HR] 4.10, P = 0.02) and preoperative ureteral stenting (HR 2.35, P = 0.04) were both associated with UTUC after RC, but ureteral stenting did not have a significantly higher association with UTUC than nephrostomy tube drainage. Severe hydronephrosis was also associated with development of UTUC (HR 4.03, P = 0.02). The incidence of ureteroenteric anastomotic complications did not vary by drainage modality.

Conclusion

Preoperative hydronephrosis was associated with UTUC after RC, but ureteral stent placement did not increase the risk of UTUC or ureteral complications relative to nephrostomy tube placement. The choice of hydronephrosis drainage pre-RC should not be guided by concern for UTUC risk.

### Intermittent hydronephrosis… [^aa16996a]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Intermittent hydronephrosis may appear as acute abdominal pain. Between episodes of pain, the patient may be asymptomatic, and the intravenous urogram usually will be normal. The condition is diagnosed from intravenous urograms taken either during an episode of pain or after hydronephrosis has been precipitated by hydration. There are many causes of intermittent hydronephrosis; however, the closed renal pelvis and nondistensible ureteropelvic junction are important factors in nearly all cases. Pyeloplasty is the best treatment and is usually curative. Dunn DH, Williams RD, Gonzalez R. Intermittent Hydronephrosis: A Cause of Abdominal Pain. Arch Surg. 1978; 113: 329–330.

### Case report: full recovery from dialysis-requiring renal failure after surgical repair of a completely occluded renal artery in a patient with a single kidney [^a9c6eb15]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Based on the patient's medical history, an acute occlusion of the graft was suspected. Further diagnostic evaluation included a renal ultrasound, which showed a normal-sized left kidney measuring 12 cm, with no parenchymal changes or hydronephrosis. The Doppler ultrasound revealed post-stenotic waveforms, known as "tardus parvus", and low resistive indices (RI) ranging from 0.52–0.58 (as shown in Fig. 1 A), which were significantly lower than expected for the patient's age. CT angiography confirmed a total occlusion of the left renal artery graft, likely due to thrombosis. Additionally, well-developed collateral vasculature was noted, as illustrated in Fig. 2 A. Given the patient's history, echocardiography was performed to exclude cardioembolic sources of renal graft thrombosis. The left ventricle and left atrium were normal in size, measuring 50 mm and 37 mm, respectively, with no evidence of interventricular septal hypertrophy. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 66% assessed by Simpson method, consistent with normal systolic function. No functional abnormalities of heart valves were identified.

Fig. 1
Renal doppler ultrasound before and after treatment for acute left aorta-renal bypass occlusion. A – both images represent the renal doppler ultrasound taken during the patient's presentation. The left renal artery was not identifiable; however, a post-stenotic waveform was detected in renal parenchyma. Resistive indices (RI) ranged from 0.52 to 0.58, which is below that is expected for the 40-year-old male with a history of arterial hypertension. Additionally, prolonged acceleration time in Doppler waveforms was identified. B – after the graft placement between the aorta and the renal artery, doppler ultrasound showed an improved perfusion profile of the left kidney. RI´s exhibited a systolic peak, ranging from 0.64 to 0.66. Moreover, blood flow in the renal artery was measured with a maximal value of 195 cm/s
