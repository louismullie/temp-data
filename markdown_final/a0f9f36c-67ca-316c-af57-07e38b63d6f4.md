## Question

3. A pentagram has five vertices. Draw straight lines through these five vertices so that each line must pass through two of them. Then, the total number of lines that can be drawn is:
(A) 5
(B) 10
(C) 15
(D) 20

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many distinct straight lines can be drawn through five vertices of a pentagram, with the condition that each line must pass through exactly two vertices. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the combinatorics of choosing pairs of vertices. Then, I should verify whether any three or more vertices are collinear in a pentagram, because collinearity would reduce the count. Next, I will compute the total number of lines assuming no three are collinear. Finally, I will reconcile the result with the provided options and confirm the answer.

> Let me first confirm the combinatorial foundation: with n vertices, the number of distinct lines determined by pairs of vertices is the number of ways to choose 2 vertices from n, which is C(n, 2) = n(n−1)/2, provided no three vertices are collinear. For n = 5, that gives C(5, 2) = 5×4/2 = 10 lines, so a preliminary estimate is 10 lines [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the collinearity assumption in a pentagram. A regular pentagram's vertices lie on a circle, and in a regular pentagon/pentagram, no three vertices are collinear, so each pair defines a unique line. Therefore, the count should indeed be 10 distinct lines under the "two vertices per line" rule, and I should not subtract for collinear triples in this case [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check that the problem is purely combinatorial and not asking for something geometrically special about the pentagram's edges or diagonals. The phrasing "draw straight lines through these five vertices so that each line must pass through two of them" maps directly to counting all unique lines defined by pairs of vertices, which is the C(5, 2) calculation, independent of whether those lines coincide with the pentagram's own edges or internal chords [^notfound].

> I will now examine the options against this result: 5 is too low and would imply only the outer edges, ignoring diagonals; 15 and 20 exceed the maximum possible pairs; 10 matches C(5, 2) and aligns with the no-three-collinear property of a pentagram's vertices, so the correct choice is B) 10 [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **10**. This is because a pentagram has 5 vertices, and the number of straight lines that can be drawn through any two vertices is given by the combination formula C(5, 2) = 10. Each line is uniquely determined by a pair of vertices, and no three vertices are collinear in a regular pentagram, so no lines are redundant.

---

## Combinatorial analysis

The problem is a classic **combinatorics** question: given 5 vertices, how many unique straight lines can be drawn such that each line passes through exactly two vertices? The solution is the number of ways to choose 2 vertices out of 5, which is C(5, 2).

---

## Calculation

The combination formula is:

C(n, k) = [n!/(k!(n − k)!)]

For n = 5 and k = 2:

C(5, 2) = [5!/(2!(5−2)!)] = [(5 × 4 × 3!)/(2 × 1 × 3!)] = [20/2] = 10

Thus, **10 unique lines** can be drawn.

---

## Geometric verification

In a regular pentagram, no three vertices are collinear, so each pair of vertices defines a unique line. This confirms that the combinatorial count matches the geometric reality.

---

## Conclusion

The total number of straight lines that can be drawn through the five vertices of a pentagram, with each line passing through exactly two vertices, is **10**. The correct option is **B) 10**.

### Self-assembly of a supramolecular hexagram and a supramolecular pentagram [^b3e8af7b]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The formation of pentagram instead of hexagram is most likely attributed to the slight flexibility of the extended terpyridines and deviation from typical coordination with the metal ions. The different side lengths of each individual dinuclear triangle in the pentagram may play a vital role in determination of the formation of the five- versus six-pointed star's supramolecular architecture. LA reacted as an asymmetrical piece in which the edge lengths (< tpy–Ru–tpy >, < tpy–Cd–tpy > or < tpy–Fe–tpy >) in each identical triangle (Fig. 2) should have a slight variation. This is confirmed through the molecular modelling or reported crystal structures (18.004, 18.672 and 17.821 Å for < tpy–Ru 2+ –tpy >, < tpy–Cd 2+ –tpy > and < tpy–Fe 2+ –tpy >, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 57). Nevertheless, this subtle difference of lengths between < tpy–Ru 2+ –tpy > and < tpy–Fe 2+ –tpy > or < tpy–Cd 2+ –tpy > could generate different structural outcomes.

Data sampling and definition of inness I. a Thirty-six origin–destination (OD) pairs (spaced out at intervals of 10°) are assigned along the circumference of circles at a distance of 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 km from the city center C. b For each OD pair, we query the Open Source Map API and collect the shortest routes (red) and the fastest routes (blue) (shown here for a representative OD pair in Paris). c A typical OD pair with the straight line connecting them representing the geodesic distance s; r is the radial distance from the center and θ is the angular separation relative to the center. We define the inness (I) to be the difference between the inner travel area (polygon delineated by red inner point and straight line) and the outer travel area (polygon delineated by blue outer point and straight line). d Three possible route configurations between multiple OD pairs. One with an exclusively outer travel area (blue), one with an exclusively inner travel area (red), and one where there is some combination of both

The inness of a node in the road network is a result of aggregating characteristics of all possible routes that pass through that point. Indeed, it reflects the structure of the network since it is a metric influenced by topology and network connectivity. However, in addition to this, it captures the geometric aspects of the network since it is a measure based on the curvature of the roads along a route and encodes structural information at both the global and local scales. In that sense, one can consider it to contain elements of various standard structural network metrics (see Supplementary Note 2 for details and comparison with a series of network metrics). We note that such metrics — particularly those that are global measures such as the betweenness centrality — have been previously used to classify cities. Recent results, however, cast doubt on the efficacy of centrality measures to distinguish between cities. On the other hand, as we will demonstrate, the inness, in addition to being a relatively simple measure, encodes the geometric, infrastructural, geographical, and socioeconomic aspects of urban systems.

The 1 H NMR spectra of [Fe 10 LA 5) 30+ in Fig. 4b and [Cd 10 LA 5) 30+ (Supplementary Figs 41–44) were complicated due to multiple overlaping polyterpyridine environments. In the 1 H NMR spectrum of LA (Fig. 4a), two singlets of [Fe 10 LA 5] 30+ ∼9.25 and 9.30 p.p.m. were assigned to the tpy H 3′,5′ protons for the < tpy–Ru 2+ –tpy > moieties, which only showed the small shifts; the tpy H 3′,5′ of newly formed < tpy–Fe 2+ –tpy > linkages exhibited the expected large downfield shifts, as a result of the lower electron density upon complexation. Furthermore, the upfield shift in the tpy H 6,6″ protons is attributed to the shielding effect of the metal centres. These observed chemical shifts and ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) measurements (Supplementary Fig. 56) indicated the expected < tpy–Fe 2+ –tpy > linkages were formed. UV–vis spectroscopies of [Cd 10 LA 5] 30+, [Fe 10 LA 5] 30+ and [Fe 12 V 3 (LB) 3] 36+ in CH 3 CN (for PF 6 – as the anions) showed the expected absorbance patterns at ca. 495 and 575 nm for the tpy–Ru 2+ –tpy and tpy–Fe 2+ –tpy units, respectively. Moreover, six signals of tpy H 3′,5′ were consistent with the desired structure. Peak assignments were confirmed using two-dimensional 2D-NOESY NMR spectra (Supplementary Figure 47) NMR spectra. The diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) was further applied to confirm the structure, which showed [Fe 10 LA 5] 30+ as a single component with the diffusion coefficients of 1.99 × 10 −10 m 2 s −1 at 298 K (Fig. 4c). The experimental hydrodynamic radius (r H = 2.99 nm) was calculated and it agrees well with the diameter of molecular modelling.

A, Gray dots depict part of the hexagonal grid in a transverse section of a stack of spirals or echo‐planar readouts. Blue dots mark the revolutions acquired within a shot for N = 1, 2, and 3 shots per k‐space plane. B, The hexagonal grid is described by oblique coordinates. All existing distances between grid points are represented in distances of the origin to points in one dodecant (yellow wedge), including its edges. Blue rings mark the distances reflected in (A), and the red ring highlights a distance not available with integer N. C, This distance is used when tilting the grid with respect to the rotational axis of the stack. The FE lines or spiral revolutions acquired in three subsequent shots are highlighted in red, orange, and yellow. D, The hexagonal grid is tilted as shown in (C). Red and yellow dots mark the points of the hexagonal grid that are covered by two subsequent shots. Green lines in the background show that all points of the hexagonal grid lie on nodes of a finer, rectilinear lattice, from which the starting angle of each spiral shot can be derived. Subsequent shots start with linearly progressing angles. The pattern is repetitive. E, Background: An entire mono‐planar T‐Hex stack of spirals cut open. The uppermost shot and the sites of puncture of the spirals are marked in dark gray. The resulting hexagonal grid shows the tilt as visualized in (C) and (D). In a representative patch, grid points that belong to spiral shots with the same phasing are colored the same. Foreground: Cross‐section corresponding to the stack in the upper panel, the acquisition time point is color‐coded, indicating a smoothfilter. Owing to the cross‐sectional depiction, "holes" appear on the central k‐space axis. In fact, this region is equally uniformly sampled, since all spirals start from the rotational axis of the cylinder

Fig. 1
Biasing forces found in urban morphology. Three schematic urban street arrangements share similar topological structure, but different geometric layouts resulting in varying dynamics. a A grid structure where the shortest paths between points at the same radius show no directional bias. b Repulsive forces relative to the origin (marked in blue) emerge as we break the grid symmetry by relocating the four outer points on the inner equidistant ring line. Paths lying on this ring now have the shortest paths that traverse the periphery and avoid the center. c Further perturbing the topology by increasing connectivity to the center (marked as four green lines) now leads to shortest paths that go through the center as if an attractive force is present (marked in red)

To capture whether such an effect manifests itself at the scale of the city, or is indeed neutral due to the "detuning" at smaller scales, we define a metric called the inness I. Figure 2c illustrates how a typical route between any origin–destination (OD) pair can be divided into segments that are directionally biased toward or away from the city center as measured relative to the geodesic distance s between the pair. We label points lying closer to the center than the geodesic inner points while those lying further away are outer points. For example, in the schematic shown in Fig. 2c, points located in the pink shaded area are inner points, and those on the opposite side (shaded blue) are outer points. We define an inner travel area delineated by the polygon of inner points and the geodesic line, to which we assign a positive sign. Conversely, an outer travel area is defined by the geodesic line and the collection of outer points, whose sign is negative. Having adopted this convention, I is the difference between the inner area and outer travel areas:which can be calculated using the shoelace formula for polygons (see Methods). In Fig. 2d, we show three possible idealizations of a route; one with only outer travel area (blue), one with only inner travel area (red), and one with a mixture of both outer and inner travel areas (combination of blue and red).

### Visual perceptive functioning in Japanese schoolchildren born with very low birth weight [^29de7a01]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

WAVES

WAVES is a newly developed visual perception test designed to assess visual perception and eye-hand coordination skills and was published in Japan. A unique aspect of WAVES is that it measures visual perceptual speed in addition to accuracy. Participants were instructed to complete each item as quickly as possible and time limitations were set for completing most of the subtests. Approximately 40 to 50 min are required to complete all the basic subtests for 6- to 12-year-old children.

WAVES has the following 10 basic subtests (Fig. 1): (1) line tracing (success score and rate score): drawing precise straight lines as accurately and quickly as possible within one minute. The success score is the number of line tracings accurately drawn within one minute, which indicates the drawing speed with accuracy. The rate score is the ratio of the number of line tracings accurately drawn divided by the number of total line tracings drawn (regardless of whether they were successfully drawn or not), which indicates accurate drawing; (2) form tracing (success score and rate score): drawing small circles, triangles, and squares as accurately and quickly as possible within one minute. The success and rate scores are calculated in the same way as above and indicate drawing speed with accuracy and accurate drawing, respectively; (3) number comparisons I; (4) number comparisons II: answering whether two digits strings (split bilaterally) are the same, different by one digit, or different by two digits. The difference between subtests I and II is based on whether digit strings are arranged at regular or irregular intervals; (5) discrimination speed: finding the same figure within similar figures as quickly as possible within the time limit; (6) figure-ground speed: finding a figure within four overlapped figures as quickly as possible within the time limit; (7) visual closure speed: finding the target figure within four incomplete fragmented figures as quickly as possible; (8) discrimination accuracy: accurately finding the same figure among similar figures in time; (9) visual memory: choosing 5 target figures from 20 figures after memorizing the target figures in 30 s; and (10) copying: drawing simple figures as accurately as possible inside the grid box.

### Effective use of tables and figures in abstracts, presentations, and papers [^9d553efc]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

In some situations, tables, graphs, and figures can present certain types of information (including complicated relationships and sequences of events) more clearly and in less space than the same information would require in sentence form. However, do not use tables, graphs, and figures for small amounts of data that could be conveyed clearly and succinctly in a sentence. Also, do not reiterate in sentences the data that are shown in a table, graph, or figure: the point of creating a table or graph or figure is to eliminate that type of sentence from your manuscript. In building a data table you must balance the necessity that the table be complete with the equally important necessity that it not be too complex. Sometimes it is helpful to break a large table into several smaller ones to allow the reader to identify important information easily, but, conversely, it is a common mistake of novice authors to split up into several tables data that belong in one table. In almost all cases, only one table or graph or figure should be included in an abstract, and then only if it can convey essential information in less space and in a more easily interpretable way than the sentence form. For a poster, in almost all instances you should use only one typeface and one font in a table, graph, or figure. In general, do not use bold, italics, or color unless you are presenting a great deal of data and you need to highlight certain data values and you are certain that using bold, italics, or color will improve readability, which is rare. Do not include identical information in a table and a graph/figure. In reporting a clinical trial you will need to include a patient flow chart that identifies the number of patients initially screened for the study, the number of patients who were excluded (and why) after initial screening or in the final analysis, and how many patients entered, exited early, and completed each arm of the study. A treatment protocol should also be described with a flow chart. In preparing a graph the most common error is to include a line that suggests an unsubstantiated extrapolation between or beyond the data points. In selecting the graph's axes, avoid truncating, enlarging, or compressing the axes in ways that might make the graph confusing or misleading. To prepare clear, accurate, easily interpretable tables, graphs, and figures, rely on the rules described in authoritative guides such as the Council of Science Editors' Scientific Style and Format and the American Medical Association's Manual of Style.

### Lines and stripes: where did they go? – from conventional radiography to CT [^bbc884b4]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

Frontal and lateral radiography has traditionally been used to evaluate the chest, although computed tomography (CT) and high-resolution CT are increasingly being used as an adjunct to conventional radiography for the evaluation of parenchymal and mediastinal disease. Nevertheless, radiography remains a very important modality in this context, and use of chest radiography alone can provide a vast amount of useful information. This information is derived from the configurations and interrelationships of the anatomic structures in the lung, mediastinum, and pleura and forms the basis of the "lines and stripes" concept, which plays a valuable role in establishing a diagnosis before proceeding to CT. The inability to recognize that a chest radiograph is abnormal owing to displacement of one of these lines or stripes may lead to failure to request a potentially valuable CT examination. Radiologists must be familiar with the anatomic basis of these mediastinal lines and stripes and be able to recognize their normal and abnormal appearances. In this way, they can develop an appropriate differential diagnosis prior to obtaining additional information with chest CT.

### Pediatric eye evaluations preferred practice pattern [^b9cc1185]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Table A2-1 — visual acuity testing charts (pediatrics) describes LEA Symbols and Sloan Letters as having optotypes of similar legibility and an inverted pyramid design with five optotypes per line, proportional spacing between optotypes, and 0.1 logMAR decrements in optotype size; for LEA Symbols this five-per-line design applies at visual acuities better than 20/100.

### Pediatric eye evaluations preferred practice pattern [^2bfda1b2]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Visual acuity chart arrangement and amblyopia considerations — line presentation, spacing, and crowding — note that the arrangement of optotypes on a visual acuity test is important and optotypes should be presented in a full line of five whenever possible; if a child needs assistance knowing which optotype to identify, the screener may point to the optotype and immediately remove the pointer, the majority of optotypes must be correctly identified to "pass" a line, and a similar number of optotypes on each line with equal spacing is preferred. In the setting of amblyopia, visual acuity testing with single optotypes is likely to overestimate visual acuity because of the crowding phenomenon; therefore, a more accurate assessment of monocular visual acuity is obtained in amblyopia with a line of optotypes, optotypes should not be covered or masked as the examiner points to each successive optotype, and if a single optotype must be used the single optotype should be surrounded (crowded) by bars placed above, below, and on either side of the optotype to account for the crowding phenomenon and to avoid overestimating visual acuity; an age-appropriate and consistent testing strategy on every examination is needed.

### A 5-step simplification of the fisher anatomical subunit cleft lip repair [^e4adbf9d]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Unilateral cleft lip repair methods have evolved from straight-line repairs to geometric procedures, rotation-advancement, and contemporary hybrid techniques. The Fisher anatomical subunit repair is a versatile, effective, and highly reproducible technique. It utilizes mathematical precision in design, avoids multi-point closure, minimizes scar burden, and does not compromise horizontal lip length for vertical height in various deformities. Despite these benefits, the repair has been criticized for its complexity. We describe a five-step distillation of the repair intended to clarify the procedure and provide adoptees an entry point to the benefits of the technique.

### SparkMaster 2: a new software for automatic analysis of calcium spark data [^765e31f5]. Circulation Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Generation of Pseudo-Line Scans From 2D Spark Imaging Data

The steps below can be used to generate line scans from videos of Ca sparks in vascular smooth muscle cells, using Fiji:

A tif stack with the recording is loaded in Fiji.
Denoising is applied using Process/Filters/Gaussian blur. We used the value of 1 for the sigma parameter, subsequently confirming the filtering is to be applied to all frames.
Additional smoothing is carried out by Process/Smooth.
The line tool is selected (on the main Fiji panel, below the menus); right-clicking the button enables the user to select whether a straight or segmented line will be drawn. For smooth muscle myocytes that are typically curved, the segmented line helps to create a pseudo-line scan that is analogous to longitudinal line scans in the more orthogonally shaped ventricular myocytes.
Background subtraction is performed by Process/Subtract Background, using a rolling ball radius of 25 pixels, making sure that the checkbox Light background is not checked.
With the line drawn, a line-scan can be generated via Image/Stacks/Reslice (using the default parameters).
A line-scan image is opened and can be saved via File/Save as.

We note that using the segmented line has the advantage of being able to capture more cellular locations within the generated line-scan, and obtain more sparks in the recording than when using a straight line. However, care must be taken to not have segments that pass a single spark or wave (overrepresenting that event), and be consistent in segmenting among cells that are to be compared (full cell length, active zone(s), similar number of linear segments), to minimize biasing interpretations.

### Shaping micro-clusters via inverse jamming and topographic close-packing of microbombs [^7662020f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Programming the degrees of freedom in topographic clusters

Empirically, the final clusters can be programmed by the number of seeds (N = 1, 2, 3,…) and the number of vertices of the well (V = 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for circles, triangles, squares, pentagons, and hexagons, respectively) providing topographic confinement. As shown in Fig. 5a, we analyzed over 2000 clusters. In the confinement of N = 1, single-cell particles could be created by filling the microwell, imitating the shape of the confinement. For N > 1, the differentiated cleavages were symmetric when k = V / N yielded an integer k, i.e. (V, N) = (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 3), (4, 2), (6, 2), and (6, 3). Otherwise, clusters with random microbomb assembly were observed. Regarding the orientation of the constituent cells, the (6, 2) combination, for example, could program two types of symmetric clusters: one with a cleavage wall normal to one of the 6 edges where the interior angle of a unit is 3 π (marked as a black line), and the other containing two isosceles trapezoids (internal angle is 2 π) shares the space diagonally (marked as a blue line). In addition, it is important to note that since there are no predictable cues for the cleavage orientation in the case of the singularity (V = 0), the perfect programming of clusters (100%) for all cases of N is warranted from the non-pinning mobility in confinement. The SEM images in Fig. 5b, c reveal the hollow nature of the clusters from a triangular prism (Fig. 5b) and a cube with a cleavage connecting four cells (Fig. 5c) after focused ion beam (FIB) milling. At room temperature, the shell became glassy again, and thus the microbombs could maintain the packed shape permanently.

### Accurate high throughput alignment via line sweep-based seed processing [^26f5da73]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Basic notions and planar alignment representation

We consider alignments as a path that follows a sequence of pointsin a two-dimensional plane, where | A | shall denote the alignment length. With this plane, the reference R is on the x-axis and the query Q is on the y-axis, with | Q | < | R |. Please note: The sequences r 0, r 1,…, r | A | and q 0, q 1,…, q | A | are both monotonically increasing. Two consecutive points (r n, q n) and (r n +1, q n +1) are always associated in one of the following four ways:
Deletion: r n +1 = r n + 1, q n +1 = q n; visually this is equal to a horizontal path extension.
Insertion: r n +1 = r n, q n +1 = q n + 1; visually this is equal to a vertical path extension.
Match or Mismatch: r n +1 = r n + 1, q n +1 = q n + 1; visually both appear as diagonal path extensions.

For example, in Fig. 5 a complete alignment via the orange path follows the sequence: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (9, 4), (10, 5), (11, 6), (11, 7), (12, 8), (13, 9)]

The alignment process is decomposed into three separated stages: seeding, seed processing and dynamic programming (DP). In the following three sections, we will explain our approaches for all three stages in detail.

### Congruency between publicly available pictorial displays of medial temporal lobe atrophy [^ecf175f6]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Measurements

The height of the hippocampal formation (defined as the dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, and subiculum together with parahippocampal gyrus) was measured in each image according to the original description by Scheltens, as well as the height of the hippocampus by itself. This was accomplished by measuring the respective largest vertical heights of both the hippocampal formation and the hippocampus. In addition, areas of the HC, TH, and PHG were manually delineated. All measurements were made using free-hand tools in the open-access image analysis program ImageJ.

In the area measurement of the HPC, all but the most distal part, the "tail", was included in the area. The PHG was delineated using the corner of the collateral sulcus as a lateral end point where a line was drawn straight across the gyrus. The TH was defined as limited by the choroid fissure. The choroid plexus located inside the TH was sometimes visible and used as a marker to confirm the TH space. See Fig. 1 for a representative image.

Fig. 1
The method for normalized measurements. A reference line was drawn from the midline to the most lateral border of the temporal lobe (Y). The height of the hippocampus (X 1) and the hippocampal formation (X 2) was divided by the reference line to get normalized heights for each image. Areas delineating the temporal horn, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus (X 3,4,5) were normalized by dividing their respective areas by the squared length of the reference line

Since full information about image size and dimensions was not available, it was necessary to normalize the measurements. First, a straight vertical line was drawn through the midline, using the falx cerebri, septum pellucidum, and the center of the pons as landmarks. A line parallel to this was drawn tangentially to the most lateral part of the temporal lobe. Finally, a horizontal line perpendicular to the two prior lines was drawn to measure the distance between them, which was set as a reference line (Fig. 1).

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^031312fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### Monitoring hand hygiene via human observers: how should we be sampling? [^75095be6]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore how hand hygiene observer scheduling influences the number of events and unique individuals observed.

Design

We deployed a mobile sensor network to capture detailed movement data for 6 categories of healthcare workers over a 2-week period.

Setting

University of Iowa Hospital and Clinic medical intensive care unit (ICU).

Methods

We recorded 33,721 time-stamped healthcare worker entries to and exits from patient rooms and considered each entry or exit to be an opportunity for hand hygiene. Architectural drawings were used to derive 4 optimal line-of-sight placements for observers. We ran simulations for different observer movement schedules, all with a budget of 1 hour of total observation time. We considered observation times of 1–15, 15–30, 30, and 60 minutes per station. We stochastically generated healthcare worker hand hygiene compliance on the basis of all data and recorded the total unit compliance as it would be reported by each simulated observer.

Results

Considering a 60-minute total observation period, aggregate simulated observers captured 1.7% of the average total number of opportunities per day at best and 0.5% at worst. The 1-15-minute schedule captures, on average, 16% fewer events than does the 60-minute (ie, static) schedule, but it samples 17% more unique individuals. The 1-15-minute schedule also provides the best estimator of compliance for the duration of the shift, with a mean standard deviation of 17%, compared with 23% for the 60-minute schedule.

Conclusions

Our results show that observations are sensitive to different observers' schedules and suggest the importance of using data-driven approaches to schedule hand hygiene audits.

### Procedures for the evaluation of the visual system by pediatricians [^1190a45e]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Critical line evaluation — age-specific visual acuity screening uses the age-dependent "critical line" and does not require testing below it. Most eye charts present 4 to 6 optotypes per line, and passing requires a simple majority on that line. Age thresholds are: ages 36 through 47 months — the 20/50 line; ages 48 through 59 months — the 20/40 line; ages 60 months and older — the 20/30 line (or 20/32 on some charts). Critical line screening is an effective alternative to threshold testing and can be more quickly administered.

### Assembly theory explains and quantifies selection and evolution [^219e4f50]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Assembly theory

The concept of an object in AT is simple and rigorously defined. An object is finite, is distinguishable, persists over time and is breakable such that the set of constraints to construct it from elementary building blocks is quantifiable. This definition is, in some sense, opposite to standard physics, which treats objects of interest as fundamental and unbreakable (for example, the concept of 'atoms' as indivisible, which now applies to elementary particles). In AT, we recognize that the smallest unit of matter is typically defined by the limits of observational measurements and may not itself be fundamental. A more universal concept is to treat objects as anything that can be broken and built. This allows us to naturally account for the emergent objects produced by evolution and selection as fundamental to the theory. The concept of copy number is of foundational importance in defining a theory that accounts for selection. The more complex a given object, the less likely an identical copy can exist without selection of some information-driven mechanism that generates that object. An object that exists in multiple copies allows the signatures describing the set of constraints that built it to be measured experimentally. For example, mass spectrometry can be used to measure assembly for molecules, because it can measure how molecules are built by making bonds.

### Building a fast virtual fractional flow reserve: reductionists or dreamers? [^d7dbe96d]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2017). Low credibility.

Before addressing the strengths and weaknesses of the study by Morris et al. we wanted to provide the perspective of a clinician on the role of JACC: Basic to Translational Science as a translational journal. In presenting basic science concepts and extending their applications into clinical practice, JACC: Basic to Translational Science is assisting clinicians in interpreting and understanding basic science, while at the same time helping the basic scientist to make sense of clinical syndromes, obscure physiologic conditions, and outcomes. To this end, the study by Morris et al.falls exactly on the continuum of basic to translational work. However, we also realized that, as clinicians, some of the descriptions of technical concepts and mathematical methods are uninterpretable without considerable study and the construction of a glossary (Table 1).

### Assembly theory explains and quantifies selection and evolution [^19c3a38f]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Selection within assembly spaces

The concept of the assembly space allows us to understand how selection and historical contingency impose constraints on what can be made in the future. By aiming to detect 'selection', we mean a process similar to selection in Darwinian evolution. We do not, however, model functional differences that selection might act on. Instead, we account only for the specificity of selection — that some objects are more likely to be used to make new things and some are less likely. The only functionality we want to detect or describe is in the memory of the process to generate the object, with examples including a metabolic reaction network or a genome. This allows the three Lewontin conditions for evolution to hold. A key feature of assembly spaces is that they are combinatorial, with objects combined at every step. Combinatorial spaces do not play a prominent role in current physics, because their objects are modelled as point particles and not as combinatorial objects (with limited exceptions). However, combinatorial objects are important in chemistry, biology and technology, in which most objects of interest (if not all) are hierarchical modular structures. More objects exist in assembly space than can be built in finite time with finite resources because the space of possibilities grows super-exponentially with the assembly index. To tame this explosive growth, in AT historical contingency is intrinsic with the space built compositionally, where items are combined recursively (accounting for hierarchical modularity) and this substantially constrains the number of possible objects. It is the combination of this compositionality with combinatorics that allows us to describe selection (Fig. 3).

### Changes in semantic memory structure support successful problem-solving and analogical transfer [^5231072f]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In our daily life, we constantly deal with problems, ranging from the most mundane (e.g. what to cook for dinner given the ingredients at our disposal), to professional activities (e.g. how to reorganize our current plans to meet a new deadline), up to major societal challenges (e.g. how to find innovative solutions against global warming). How do we find new solutions to problems? While the ability to solve problems is a critical skill for adapting to new situations and innovating, the mechanisms underlying the problem-solving process remain largely unknown.

Among the new problems we face each day, some are well-defined (e.g. playing a jigsaw puzzle). The initial state (i.e. the number of independent pieces) and goal state (i.e. assembling the pieces so it looks like the picture model) are clear, and the solver can apply a set of operations (i.e. interlocking the pieces as a function of their shape) to reach the goal. However, for many of our problems (e.g. organizing work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic), the problem space is ambiguous. No heuristics or existing rules could be applied to transform the initial state into the goal state. Such "ill-defined" problemsthus require additional mental processes, which have been tightly linked to creative thinking –. Ill-defined problem-solving (or creative problem-solving) is often referred to as insight solving, where the solution comes to mind suddenly and effortlessly, with a "Eureka" phenomenon –. According to the Representational Change Theory, solving such problems involves restructuring the initial problem mental representational space, which presumably entails combining elements related to the problem in a new way. In theory, restructuring allows one to change perspective, reframe the problem, or escape its implicitly imposed constraints, leading to creative associations. For instance, consider the following problem: "A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender points a shotgun at the man. The man says, 'Thank you', and walks out". The problem is ill-defined because the path to finding the solution is to be discovered, and the goal state is vague. Solving this problem first requires asking the right question: in which context would a shotgun and a glass of water help somebody? Rather than relying on obvious associations (e.g. a glass of water is related to thirst), solvers must fill the missing link between the relevant elements of the problem (a shotgun induces fear, and fear can be a remedy for hiccups, as can drinking a glass of water). Hence, restructuring the initial representation of a given problem would allow one to see this link and find its solution.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### Amblyopia preferred practice pattern [^b5aefb3e]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Amblyopia Preferred Practice Pattern — optotype selection and layout for pediatric VA emphasize that an age-appropriate and consistent testing strategy on every examination is essential, and that optotypes should be high-contrast, standardized, and not reflect a cultural bias. LEA SYMBOLS, a set of four symbol optotypes, and HOTV optotypes include only four possible responses; these acuity tests are easier for younger children, and children who cannot match the LEA SYMBOLS or HOTV letters may be able to match them using a hand-held card, while for older children, Sloan letters are preferred. Several other symbol tests have serious limitations in testing VA of young children, and Allen pictures, Lighthouse symbols, and the Kindergarten (Sailboat) Eye Chart are less useful. For older children and teenagers, the desirable optotypes are Sloan letters with consistent logMAR-size progression and proportional spacing of letters and lines as in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) tests, whereas Snellen charts are less desirable because the design is typically not standardized, letters are not of equal legibility, and spacing does not always meet World Health Organization standards. Optotypes should be presented in a full line of five whenever possible, the majority of optotypes must be correctly identified to "pass" a line, and in amblyopia single optotype testing is likely to overestimate VA; therefore, a more accurate assessment of monocular VA is obtained in amblyopia with the presentation of a line of optotypes, and in order to preserve the crowding effect of adjacent optotypes, they should not be covered or masked as the examiner points to each successive optotype.

### The role of fibers in the femoral attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament in resisting tibial displacement [^01eae7ec]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Partition of Femoral Attachment of ACL

Two transverse holes were created across the distal femur, avoiding the collateral ligament attachments and other stabilizing structures. The medial femoral condyle was separated with a reciprocating saw, starting between the cruciate ligaments and cutting proximally in the sagittal plane for 60 mm and then medially.

The morphology and dimensions of the femoral ACL attachment were assessed on the lateral intercondylar surface. The outline of the attachment with the fan-like extensions was marked (Fig 1), on the basis of visual observation of the extent of the ACL fiber attachment area. The narrow, central, direct attachment area of the ACL midsubstance was identified by flexing and extending the knee with the ACL tensed. The directly attaching fibers remained tight when the knee was flexed and extended, passing straight to the bone attachment. The posterior fan-like extension fibers were tight when the knee was near extension but remained adherent to the surface of the femur when the knee flexed, causing a distinct folding of the ACL fibers at the boundary between the posterior fan-like extension and the central direct attachment areas, as illustrated in prior anatomic studies. A similar process identified the boundary between the central direct fiber attachment area and the anterior fan-like extension area, in a deep fold between the bulk of the ACL and the wall of the intercondylar notch. These boundary lines were marked and were found to be straight and parallel, so another line could be drawn midway between them, along the central axis of the direct attachment area. Two more lines were drawn parallel to the central line, tangent to the outer edges of the attachment. Five parallel lines were drawn parallel to Blumensaat's line: 2 were tangent to the outer edges of ACL attachment, and then the other 3 were equally spaced between them so that the length of the central direct fiber attachment area was divided into 4 equal parts. For the geometry and position of these divisions, we used a ruler and sharp-pointed dividers, so the dimensions of the sub-areas were known within ± 0.5 mm. This method divided the femoral attachment of the ACL into 12 partitions — 4 central, 4 anterior, and 4 posterior — so that the femoral attachment of the ACL had been partitioned in a manner akin to a 12-square checkerboard (Fig 1). The lines defining these areas had ink rubbed into them for easy identification during the fiber-cutting surgical procedure.

### Clustering knowledge and dispersing abilities enhances collective problem solving in a network [^9f543c96]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The severity of this problem's complexity is not additive or linear in nature, but interdependent on all of the sub-problems that need to be solved for this to work. Furthermore, adopting a solution might have unintended, if not non-linear, consequences to the system's overall outcome that were not obvious or foreseeable. For instance, allowing students to use their mobile phones in schools might seem like a good idea to improve class engagement through other media, but an unintended consequence might be distraction or discouraging deeper critical thinking. The objective of the NK space is to capture the complex interaction among activities that yield performance. The NK problem space's popularity in modeling human decision-making stems from its verisimilitude with the complex and multidimensional problems that face problem-solving tasks, and because researchers can easily generate a large number of statistically similar problem spaces for robustness checks. (We note, however, in order to make sure our results are not an artifact of the idiosyncrasies of the NK problem space, we replicated all of our results in another rugged problem space, the Traveling Salesperson Problem — findings available in Supplemental Methods in Supplementary Fig. 2 through 9 and 11).

### Rigorous location of phase transitions in hard optimization problems [^d98ebea5]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

It is widely believed that for many optimization problems, no algorithm is substantially more efficient than exhaustive search. This means that finding optimal solutions for many practical problems is completely beyond any current or projected computational capacity. To understand the origin of this extreme 'hardness', computer scientists, mathematicians and physicists have been investigating for two decades a connection between computational complexity and phase transitions in random instances of constraint satisfaction problems. Here we present a mathematically rigorous method for locating such phase transitions. Our method works by analysing the distribution of distances between pairs of solutions as constraints are added. By identifying critical behaviour in the evolution of this distribution, we can pinpoint the threshold location for a number of problems, including the two most-studied ones: random k-SAT and random graph colouring. Our results prove that the heuristic predictions of statistical physics in this context are essentially correct. Moreover, we establish that random instances of constraint satisfaction problems have solutions well beyond the reach of any analysed algorithm.

### The lines of blaschko on the head and neck [^00ee205a]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The system of Blaschko's lines has been insufficiently documented on the head and neck.

Objective

The aim of the study was to elaborate this pattern in a comprehensive way.

Method

One hundred eighty-six figures showing skin lesions following Blaschko's lines on the head and neck were collected from literature and patient files, transposed into drawings, and subsequently categorized according to 3 standard perspectives. Transparent sheets were superimposed to delineate an archetypical pattern.

Results

The definite lines are presented in a frontal, lateral, and dorsal view. On the face they show an hourglass-like configuration converging on the nasal root. However, in several areas these lines intersect at an angle of almost 90 degrees. On the scalp they form a spiral configuration.

Conclusion

The system of Blaschko's lines on the head and neck as elaborated by this study is more precise than previously published diagrams. Remarkably, this archetypical pattern shows definite crossing of lines.

### Pediatric eye evaluations preferred practice pattern [^42f3bef6]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Visual acuity testing charts — The World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Vision have made similar recommendations about optotype choice and arrangement on visual acuity testing charts, specifying that optotypes should be clear, standardized, and of similar characteristics, and they should not reflect a cultural bias; each line should contain five optotypes; spacing between the optotypes should be proportional: the horizontal spacing between individual optotypes should be equal to the size of the optotype and the vertical spacing between lines should be the height of the optotypes in the lower line; and optotype sizes should generally be presented in 0.1 logMAR decrements, which leads to an inverted pyramid design for wall charts. Visual acuity testing charts used with children that meet these recommendations include LEA Symbols (Good-Lite Co, Elgin, IL), Sloan letters, Sloan numerals, Tumbling E, and HOTV, whereas the Snellen chart is less desirable because the individual letters are not of equal legibility and the spacing of the letters does not meet WHO/Committee on Vision standards. Several symbol charts have serious limitations for young children, including Allen figures, the Lighthouse chart, and the Kindergarten (Sailboat) Eye Chart, in which the optotypes are not standardized and are presented in a culturally biased fashion. Although the Tumbling E chart meets WHO/Committee on Vision recommendations, it is less desirable because it requires spatial orientation skills not mastered by all children. Other visual acuity charts are being developed to overcome these limitations, including the Handy Eye Chart and the Compact Reduced logMAR chart, and Table A2-1 provides details about the visual acuity testing charts that are commonly used.

Tactile decision-making task

Trials were presented through a plexiglass tablet that was placed on the chest or abdomen of the participant (Fig. 1A). Each tablet was bisected horizontally into an easy section and a hard section through three raised lines running through the middle. This helped participants to discern the boundary between the two sections via touch. Each section was further divided into five cells by four vertical lines spaced 3 cm apart. These cells represented individual trials and contained a pair of vertically aligned shapes drawn by raised lines. A tablet thus had an easy block and a hard block, each consisting of five trials. Participants executed a total of 10 easy and 10 hard blocks through 10 tablets.

The pair of shapes presented as part of one trial were always identical but differed in size and were drawn 2 cm apart. Shapes varied across different trials. In each trial, participants had to decide which of the two was larger in size and convey their answer with a button press (index finger for top shape; middle finger for bottom shape). They were then cued to move on to the next trial. After a block of five trials, a jittered rest period of 5–15 s followed. Participants were then asked to locate the tactile reference point of the next block (see later) and press a button. Given that a plexiglass tablet had two blocks, it had to be changed after every two blocks. This was done after the jittered rest period at the end of every second block.

The decision difficulty was manipulated by the difference in size between the shapes of a pair and the extent to which their margins were raised. For easy trials, the difference in size between the shapes of a pair was between 0.8 and 1 cm 2. For hard trials, this difference was between 0.3 and 0.5 cm 2. The extent to which the margins of the shapes were raised was lower in hard blocks, hence it was more difficult to discern them. The terms 'easy' and 'difficult' were embossed on the upper left edge of their respective sections in Braille for blind participants (below the Braille markers, numerical indicators were also embossed for deaf and control participants). These not only informed the participants about the nature of the ensuing block, but also served as a tactile reference point and oriented the participants about where to start their block of trials.

### The topological requirements for robust perfect adaptation in networks of any size [^3c0073ba]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Crucially, such ad-hoc or high-throughput strategies are impractical for most networks in living and evolving systems, which can contain huge numbers of interacting molecules, and for which we have limited or no a priori knowledge of component and pathway interconnections, reaction kinetics, or system parameters. If computational search strategies could be extended to networks with more than three nodes, would this reveal any RPA network topologies that are distinct from the two basic network designs already discovered for three-node RPA networks? Do the topological requirements for RPA in large systems increase in complexity, or change qualitatively, along with the growth of the system, or must larger systems simply replicate the same basic design principles used by smaller systems? Could there exist universal topological principles that characterize all RPA-capable network designs?

In the present study we provide definitive answers to these questions. In stark contrast to previous work on the RPA problem (see, for recent reviews), we develop a topological framework, and a new set of unifying definitions, that is able to interpret and account for the flow and control of biochemical signals through a network. This global and top-down methodology allows us to describe the full set of possible network topologies for achieving RPA in arbitrarily large and complex networks, involving any number of interacting components, with no prior assumptions as to how the components are interconnected, or the kinetics of any reactions. Remarkably, we show that all networks, no matter how large or interconnected, have just two distinct mechanisms at their disposal, corresponding to two distinct types of integral control, in order to implement RPA. Each of these two mechanisms generates a rich class of well-defined network topologies — 'modules' — containing previously unrecognized architectural features that are too complex to be observed in three- or four-node networks. Most importantly, we show that these two rich and distinct classes of modules represent a topological basis for the solution to the RPA problem: that is, the full set of all possible RPA-capable networks can be expressed via the interconnections of these special modules, subject to well-defined modular connectivity rules.

At each stopping point, the direct distance to the starting point had to be estimated verbally in meters and centimeters, and participants turned their body on the spot to indicate the orientation to the starting point. c Three different virtual environments (left panel) used in the path integration task. Each environment comprised a ground plane and distant landmark cues. Landmark cues were rendered at infinity, in order to allow participants to determine their heading direction, but not position or distance information. One tile of each environment's ground plane is shown in the right panel. These tiles were textured to provide optic flow during movement, but were seamless (no visible border between adjacent tiles) and provided no fixed cues with positional information. d Overview of the 10 different paths used in the experiment. Each path contained three turns, and turn directions (i.e. left "L" and right "R" turns) were counter-balanced between paths. e Participants performed three blocks of the path integration task. Each block consisted of 16 paths (paths #1–10, and paths #1–6 repeated without intermediate stopping at stopping points 1–3). In addition, after the 4th and 12th path of each block, participants performed so-called "standardization-paths" (i.e. straight lines with a length of 2, 6, and 10 m), which were used to correct for each participant's bias in converting their internal location estimate to a verbal response. Text in bold in panel e indicates the phases used for data analyses. See "Methods" section for more details.

Step 3: Prepare the syringe

Remove the cap from the RELISTOR vial (See Figure F).

Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab (See Figure G).

Firmly hold the barrel of the syringe with one hand. With your other hand, pull the needle cap straight off (See Figure H). Do not touch the needle or allow it to touch anything.

Carefully pull back on the plunger to the line that matches the dose prescribed by your healthcare provider (See Figures I and J). For most people, this will be the 0.4 mL mark which is an 8 mg dose or the 0.6 mL mark which is a 12 mg dose.

Use one hand to hold the vial steady. Use your other hand to insert the needle straight down into the rubber top of the vial (See Figure K). Do not insert it at an angle. This may cause the needle to bend or break. You will feel some resistance as the needle passes through the rubber top.

Gently push down the plunger until all of the air has gone from the syringe into the vial (See Figure L).

With the needle still in the vial, turn the vial and syringe upside down. Hold the syringe at eye level. Make sure the tip of the needle is in the fluid. Slowly pull back on the plunger (See Figure M) until the top of the plunger lines up with the mark that matches your prescribed dose. For most people, this will be the 0.4 mL mark which is an 8 mg dose or the 0.6 mL mark which is a 12 mg dose.

Results

Acquisition methodology

In our setup, the measurement rate at the n th spatial pixel in the k th time bin is Poisson distributedwhereis the rates due to stationary scenery, is the response of the foreground object, andis the response of the occluded background region, before the object enters. We assume that b is approximately known through a reference measurement acquired before moving objects enter the hidden scene or through other means. Conceptually, this measurement of b allows us to subtract the counts due to an arbitrary and unknown stationary environment; the actual computations are more statistically sound than simple subtraction. Vectors ψ fg and ψ oc contain parameters that describe the foreground objects and corresponding occluded background regions. We seek to recover the parameters ψ fg and ψ oc from the measurement x, for each measurement frame.

As shown in Fig. 2 A for a single moving object, we model moving objects and their occluded background regions each as a single vertical, planar, rectangular facet resting on the ground. We assume there are M moving objects with parameters. Marked in Fig. 2 A, is the albedo, is range, and h m is height of the m th object. Anglesare the minimum and maximum polar angles of the foreground facet, measured around the occluding edge in the plane of the floor. The m th occluded region is described by rangeand albedoparameters. The height of the occluded region is not a separate parameter; it depends upon its range r oc and the corresponding moving object's range r fg and height h. When parameters ψ fg and ψ oc have been estimated for a sequence of measurement frames, each processed separately, the vertical lines running through the centers of estimated occluded background regions (light red) are joined by planar facets (blue) to form a contiguous map of the background, as shown in Fig. 2 B.

Fig. 2
Foreground and background facet parametrization.

Our facet-based model describes moving objects and the occluded background regions behind them as edge-facing, rectangular, planar facets characterized by the parameters shown in (A). When parameters have been estimated for a sequence of frames, estimates are post-processed together to form a map reconstruction (B). The vertical lines going through the centers of estimated occluded regions (light red) are connected to form the map reconstruction (blue).

### Principles and open questions in functional brain network reconstruction [^00fcbd4b]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

To evaluate the extent to which a network representation genuinely documents the way the brain carries out the functions it is supposed to fulfil is ultimately tantamount to determining whether the topological properties are intrinsic or extrinsic, leading to a better understanding of emergence of functional dynamics (Atmanspacher, 2012). To do so, implies steps at various levels.

At a network representation level, this involves constructing a structure which is able to document, and ideally, to generate, these properties. On the one hand, although several aspects of edge (and node) definition are largely independent of the space in which the network is constructed, and much of what has been said here equally applies to structures such as multi‐layer graphs, hypergraphs, or simplices (Battiston et al. 2020), constructs alternative to the standard network structure may modify microscopic network scale properties and introduce new ones. For instance, in a simplex, not only nodes but also edges have non‐trivial degree. Thus, these structures may affect topology, geometry and underlying physics of the reconstructed network. On the other hand, revisiting the basics of functional network reconstruction and its main goal leads to reconsidering the very identity and role of the structure to be used in pursuit of that goal. Can a structure of time dependent, possibly spatially overlapping nodes still be called a network and analysed as such? In the same vein, network neuroscience will likely undergo a trajectory wherein nodes and connections will be thought of in a different way, possibly integrating different known properties of neural activity such as inhibition or complex feedback loops. Their specification will as a consequence change from its current one. While network features have historically been predicated upon dynamical system and information theory, to render representations more context‐independent, network neuroscience will possibly increasingly summon constructs from disciplines such as computational topology (Carlsson, 2009; Edelsbrunner & Harer, 2010; Petri et al. 2014; Reimann et al. 2017; Stolz, 2014; Zomorodian, 2005) or statistical physics (Bianconi & Rahmede, 2016), and explanations at various levels (Marr, 1982) and of different types (Illari & Williamson, 2012; Tozzi & Papo, 2020). New constructs may include neurophysiological properties, such as inherent disorder and lack of translational invariance, and may result in representations with non‐trivial emergent geometry (Bianconi & Rahmede, 2017) accounting for phenomenology as yet poorly documented, at least in network terms, for example, topological phase transitions (Santos et al. 2019) or frustration (Gollo & Breakspear, 2014). Ultimately, this may help changing representations of brain function not just by producing constructs more robust to the specification of the space in which they are embedded as well as inter‐subject variability and noise, but also by changing the underlying vision of brain function in the first place.

### Assembly theory explains and quantifies selection and evolution [^2e1c5fac]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Scientists have grappled with reconciling biological evolution 1,2 with the immutable laws of the Universe defined by physics. These laws underpin life's origin, evolution and the development of human culture and technology, yet they do not predict the emergence of these phenomena. Evolutionary theory explains why some things exist and others do not through the lens of selection. To comprehend how diverse, open-ended forms can emerge from physics without an inherent design blueprint, a new approach to understanding and quantifying selection is necessary 3–5. We present assembly theory (AT) as a framework that does not alter the laws of physics, but redefines the concept of an 'object' on which these laws act. AT conceptualizes objects not as point particles, but as entities defined by their possible formation histories. This allows objects to show evidence of selection, within well-defined boundaries of individuals or selected units. We introduce a measure called assembly (A), capturing the degree of causation required to produce a given ensemble of objects. This approach enables us to incorporate novelty generation and selection into the physics of complex objects. It explains how these objects can be characterized through a forward dynamical process considering their assembly. By reimagining the concept of matter within assembly spaces, AT provides a powerful interface between physics and biology. It discloses a new aspect of physics emerging at the chemical scale, whereby history and causal contingency influence what exists.

Histology

Coronal sections of renal tissue were immersion-fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections 5 μm thick were stained with periodic acid–Schiff or trichrome. To quantitate tubular atrophy, the tubule cell height of individual cortical tubules was measured using line morphometry (magnification × 200) by computer image analysis software (ImageJ, Rockville, MD). The tubular diameter was defined as the length of a straight line that passed through the center of a symmetrically sectioned tubule and joining two points on the tubular circumference. A total of 50 randomly selected cortical tubules in 10 nonoverlapping fields (magnification × 200) were measured, and the mean cross-sectional tubule cell height was determined for each section. The cortical interstitial volume included the tubular basement membrane and peritubular capillaries. To quantitate this area, cortical fields (magnification × 200) were viewed on a video screen, and the area of interstitial space was determined with image analysis software and was expressed as a percentage of the total area of the field. The mean percentage area of five non-overlapping cortical fields was calculated for each section. Interstitial fibrosis was assessed and quantified on trichrome-stained sections by point counting using ImageJ software in each of 10 non-overlapping randomly selected cortical fields. Points falling within blue areas (fibrosis) were considered as positive. Scores derived from 10 fields per kidney section (3 sections/per mouse) were collected for the analyses.
