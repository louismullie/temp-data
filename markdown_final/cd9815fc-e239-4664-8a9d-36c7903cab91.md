## Question

can low Vit D cause fatigue

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether low vitamin D can cause fatigue and how to interpret the evidence for clinical decision-making. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how fatigue is defined and measured across studies. Then, I should verify the biological plausibility linking vitamin D to fatigue mechanisms. Next, I will examine observational associations, followed by randomized controlled trial data. After that, I need to check for subgroup effects and dose-response patterns. I should also consider reverse causation and confounding. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and outline practical next steps for evaluation and supplementation if indicated.

> Let me first confirm the construct of fatigue so I don't conflate constructs. Fatigue in clinical and research contexts spans subjective tiredness, reduced vitality, and objective decrements in physical performance or endurance; instruments vary from single-item scales to multidimensional inventories like the MFI-20, FACIT-Fatigue, and Kids Fatigue Severity Scale, and many studies also capture related constructs such as sleepiness, asthenia, and reduced exercise tolerance, which can complicate interpretation if not explicitly defined [^113kyQT4] [^112UDsHs].

> Now, I need to check biological plausibility. Vitamin D signals through the vitamin D receptor in skeletal muscle, influencing protein synthesis, calcium handling, and fiber-type composition. Deficiency is associated with proximal myopathy, reduced force production, and impaired contractile function, which could manifest as fatigue and low energy, particularly in older adults or those with chronic disease [^112HPHPU] [^116EC2rD] [^1144Ymwq]. Wait, let me verify the directionality here. Mechanistic data suggest vitamin D supports muscle integrity, but that does not automatically prove that low vitamin D causes clinically meaningful fatigue in all populations, so I should be careful not to overstate causality from mechanistic plausibility alone [^114x75cj].

> Next, I should review observational associations. Multiple cohorts and cross-sectional studies link low 25-hydroxyvitamin D with fatigue or related constructs: older men with low vitamin D have higher odds of frailty, which includes fatigue; chronic pain cohorts show higher symptom severity with lower vitamin D; and in COVID-19 survivors, lower vitamin D correlates with asthenia and constitutional symptoms, though these designs cannot establish causation [^113GVjMo] [^114pX1FF] [^114mVncV]. Hold on, I should also note counterexamples: in a cohort of Portuguese Navy personnel, vitamin D status did not differ between those with and without fatigue, underscoring heterogeneity across populations and settings [^1142EiMU].

> I will now examine randomized controlled trials, because these are most informative for causality. The signal is mixed overall: some trials and meta-analyses show no benefit of vitamin D on fatigue in general populations, whereas others suggest improvements in specific subgroups or symptom composites. For example, in adults with vitamin D deficiency, daily 800–1000 IU improved lower-extremity strength and reduced fatigue risk in one RCT, yet broader reviews conclude that evidence for fatigue improvement is insufficient in general populations; similarly, in SLE, vitamin D supplementation improved fatigue in a pediatric RCT, but in RA, systematic reviews show no clinically relevant fatigue benefit despite small functional gains [^114frPan] [^115iKZP4] [^112UDsHs] [^117VVWJc]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the RA meta-analysis definitively showed no fatigue effect, but I should double-check; the cited review notes no clinically relevant improvement in RA with vitamin D, even though function and inflammatory markers can improve modestly, which aligns with a lack of robust fatigue benefit in RA [^117VVWJc].

> Let me consider subgroup effects and dose-response, because benefits may concentrate in the truly deficient. Mendelian randomization and stratified analyses suggest that any benefit of higher vitamin D on mood or fatigue is small at the population level but may be more apparent in those with very low baseline levels; likewise, fall-prevention benefits from vitamin D are clearest when starting levels are below 50–75 nmol/L, reinforcing a threshold effect rather than a universal benefit [^113VxUoR] [^112HPHPU]. I should confirm that this pattern fits with clinical experience; indeed, case series and small trials in profoundly deficient individuals sometimes show rapid symptom shifts after repletion, though these remain low-quality evidence [^115gT73v] [^115MJgFV] [^116tHfz8].

> But wait, what if low vitamin D is a marker of illness rather than a cause of fatigue? The large Lancet systematic review argues that low 25(OH)D frequently reflects inflammatory or chronic disease states and lifestyle confounders, with randomized trials often failing to reproduce observational associations, supporting reverse causation and confounding as key explanations for many non-skeletal links, including fatigue in some contexts [^114x75cj]. I need to ensure I integrate this caveat when counseling patients, especially when fatigue is multifactorial or disease-activity driven [^114x75cj].

> Next, I should review special populations where the signal may differ. In COPD, vitamin D did not improve physical performance or fatigue in RCTs, likely because inactivity and systemic inflammation dominate muscle dysfunction. In CKD, high-dose cholecalciferol corrected secondary hyperparathyroidism but did not improve fatigue or grip strength. And in post-acute COVID-19, interventional trials have largely failed to show fatigue benefits from vitamin D, despite observational links, again arguing against broad efficacy [^114UDcaY] [^112CN5Vd] [^117FTC6L]. Hold on, I should verify that these negative trials included sufficient numbers of deficient participants; several did not enrich for deficiency, which could blunt the ability to detect a true effect in the subgroup most likely to benefit [^114UDcaY] [^112CN5Vd].

> I should double-check safety and dosing considerations, because inappropriate supplementation can cause harm. High bolus dosing has been associated with increased falls in some older adults, and case reports document hypercalcemia and kidney injury from dispensing errors. Conversely, modest daily dosing of 700–1000 IU is generally safe and effective for musculoskeletal endpoints in deficient individuals, with endocrine guidance recommending routine intakes of 600–800 IU and higher therapeutic doses to correct deficiency under supervision [^111d17mH] [^114frPan] [^116xRaAH] [^111cYEcX]. Let me reconsider whether routine high-dose repletion helps fatigue; current evidence does not support high-dose strategies for fatigue alone outside of correcting documented deficiency [^115iKZP4].

> Synthesis and clinical take: Yes, low vitamin D can contribute to fatigue, particularly via muscle weakness and possibly via inflammatory or neurocognitive pathways, but the effect is modest on average and not universal. Benefits appear most plausible when vitamin D deficiency is present and may be negligible or absent in replete individuals or in settings where other drivers of fatigue predominate, so causality is context dependent rather than absolute [^116xRaAH] [^113VxUoR] [^114x75cj]. I should confirm that this aligns with guideline positions; contemporary endocrine guidance acknowledges associations between low vitamin D and fatigue while cautioning against empiric supplementation beyond population intake recommendations in non-deficient adults, reinforcing a targeted approach [^116xRaAH].

> Practically, I need to ensure a structured evaluation before attributing fatigue to vitamin D. I should check 25(OH)D in patients with compatible risk factors or symptoms, define deficiency as less than 20 ng/mL and insufficiency as 21–29 ng/mL, and concurrently screen for more common and high-yield causes of fatigue such as anemia, thyroid dysfunction, sleep apnea, depression, medication effects, and disease activity in inflammatory conditions. If deficiency is confirmed, replete with cholecalciferol using evidence-based regimens and reassess symptoms over 8–12 weeks, recognizing that correction of deficiency is reasonable for bone and muscle health even if fatigue does not fully resolve [^115TEChd] [^111tuGQW] [^114Lxtxc]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not implying supplementation will reliably treat fatigue; I need to emphasize that while some patients improve, others will not, and expectations should be calibrated accordingly [^115iKZP4] [^114frPan].

Low vitamin D is associated with fatigue, especially in older adults and those with chronic disease, via effects on muscle function and inflammation [^112HPHPU] [^1138M2Re]. However, **RCTs show no consistent fatigue benefit** from vitamin D in the general population, suggesting fatigue is often multifactorial [^115iKZP4] [^111Snh9m]. Supplementation may help when deficiency is severe or in specific conditions (e.g. SLE, myasthenia gravis), but routine use for fatigue is not supported [^112UDsHs] [^115MJgFV]. Evaluate and treat other causes first, and reserve vitamin D for confirmed deficiency or guideline-supported indications [^116xRaAH].

## Biological mechanisms linking vitamin D deficiency to fatigue

Vitamin D influences fatigue through several **biological mechanisms**:

- **Muscle function**: Vitamin D regulates calcium homeostasis and muscle protein synthesis; deficiency can cause muscle weakness, atrophy, and impaired contraction, contributing to fatigue [^115MUqu6].

- **Inflammation**: Low vitamin D is linked to higher inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-6), which can cause fatigue and malaise [^1138M2Re].

- **Neurological effects**: Vitamin D modulates neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors; deficiency may alter CNS function and increase fatigue perception [^notfound].

---

## Epidemiological evidence linking vitamin D deficiency to fatigue

Observational studies consistently associate low vitamin D with fatigue:

- **General population**: Low 25(OH)D correlates with fatigue and impaired physical function in older adults and chronic disease cohorts [^113GVjMo] [^114x75cj].

- **Specific populations**: Fatigue is common in IBD, CKD, and chronic liver disease, where vitamin D deficiency is prevalent [^111tuGQW] [^111dL2Nx] [^114VVxwA].

- **COVID-19**: Lower vitamin D is associated with long COVID fatigue and asthenia [^114mVncV].

## Clinical evidence on vitamin D supplementation and fatigue

Randomized controlled trials show **mixed results**:

| **Study population** | **Intervention** | **Outcome on fatigue** |
|-|-|-|
| General population | Vitamin D supplementation | No consistent improvement in fatigue [^115iKZP4] [^114frPan] |
| Older adults with deficiency | Vitamin D supplementation | Improved muscle strength and physical function; fatigue benefits inconsistent [^112HPHPU] [^114frPan] |
| Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) | High-dose vitamin D | Significant improvement in fatigue scores [^112UDsHs] |
| Myasthenia gravis | Vitamin D supplementation | Reduced fatigue severity [^115MJgFV] |
| Chronic kidney disease (CKD) | High-dose cholecalciferol | No significant fatigue improvement despite biochemical correction [^112CN5Vd] |

---

These data indicate that **supplementation may help when deficiency is severe** or in specific diseases, but routine use for fatigue is not supported [^115iKZP4].

---

## Factors influencing the relationship between vitamin D and fatigue

Several factors **modulate this relationship**:

- **Severity of deficiency**: Greater deficiency may cause more pronounced fatigue and respond better to supplementation [^114frPan].

- **Underlying health conditions**: Chronic diseases, inflammation, and medications can independently cause fatigue, confounding the association [^111tuGQW].

- **Demographic factors**: Age, sex, and ethnicity influence vitamin D status and fatigue prevalence [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines advise against routine vitamin D screening or supplementation for fatigue in the general population. Instead, clinicians should **evaluate and treat other causes** (e.g. anemia, thyroid dysfunction, sleep disorders, depression) and consider vitamin D testing only when deficiency is suspected or guideline-supported indications exist (e.g. osteoporosis, malabsorption, chronic liver/kidney disease) [^111tuGQW] [^114Lxtxc] [^113U9f6x] [^111dL2Nx].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Low vitamin D is associated with fatigue, particularly in older adults and those with chronic disease, but **causality is not established** in the general population. Supplementation may benefit patients with confirmed deficiency or specific conditions (e.g. SLE, myasthenia gravis), but routine use for fatigue is not supported. Clinicians should prioritize identifying and treating other fatigue causes and reserve vitamin D for confirmed deficiency or guideline-supported indications [^115iKZP4] [^113BUvGs] [^114frPan] [^111V8zkC] [^115MJgFV] [^111tuGQW] [^116xRaAH].

Vitamins and supplements

In RA patients who are vitamin D deficient, there does not appear to be clinically relevant improvements in RA with vitamin D supplementation, even though function and inflammatory markers slightly improved. A systematic review showed that vitamin D had no improvement in fatigue. This is contrary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where data suggest that vitamin D supplementation may improve fatigue.

Omega 3 supplementation or fish oil has some positive RCTs in active RA improving disease activity when added to standard of care. However, the effects on fatigue are uncertain.

It seems that social support, hope, optimism and resilience improve fatigue. Perhaps ways at improving resilience and social support can also help people with RA who have significant fatigue. There are no RCTs.

Ineffective strategies for improving fatigue in RA

Tight control alone does not fully improve fatigue. At 12 months, 43% of RA patients experienced ongoing fatigue in a treat to target strategy study. Nearly one in four who were fatigued at the onset of the study showed lower levels of fatigue by 1 year, but one in six of the patients who were not initially fatigued recorded increased fatigue.

Treatment of anaemia should theoretically improve fatigue. RA can cause anaemia of chronic disease. A Cochrane review of erythropoietin for anaemia in RA did improve patient global assessment, but the results for fatigue were not provided or inconsistent.

An RCT of morphine and naloxone studied pain in various conditions including RA. Active treatment was comparable with placebo. An RCT of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) for treating chronic pain in RA and ankylosing spondylitis is ongoing, and outcomes will include pain and fatigue. The design is innovative as cannabidiol (CBD) nonresponders will have THC added to their treatment after 12 weeks.

The overall frequency of protocol-specified AEs of interest was low, with no significant between-group differences in the incidence of the first occurrence of the following protocol-specified adverse events of interest: hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, low eGFR, metallic taste, fatigue / weakness, insomnia, polyuria, or nephrolithiasis (Table 2). There were 36 cases of participants with new-onset hypercalcemia on initial testing; on repeat testing, only 10 cases were confirmed, 6 in the vitamin D 3 and 4 in the placebo group (incidence rate ratio [IRR] for vitamin D 3 vs. placebo = 1.49; 95% CI 0.42, 5.27). There were 21 participants with new-onset hypercalciuria on initial testing; on repeat testing, only 2 cases were confirmed, 1 in each group (IRR for vitamin D 3 vs. placebo = 0.99; 95% CI 0.06, 15.86). There were 3 cases of confirmed low eGFR, 1 in the vitamin D 3 group and 2 in the placebo group (IRR for vitamin D 3 vs. placebo = 0.50; 95% CI 0.04, 5.47). There were 52 self-reported cases of nephrolithiasis, 28 in the vitamin D 3 and 24 in the placebo group (IRR for vitamin D 3 vs. placebo = 1.16; 95% CI 0.67, 2.00) (Table 3). While the number of adverse events related to nausea/vomiting or poor appetite was low (n = 29), there were more cases reported among persons taking vitamin D 3 compared to placebo, 20 vs 9 respectively (IRR for vitamin D 3 vs. placebo = 2.20; 95% CI 1.00, 4.84). Supplementary Table 1 provides additional information on the total frequency of protocol-specified AEs of interest among persons who were taking their study pills at the time of the event.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116xRaAH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D use in nonpregnant adults aged < 50 years — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against empiric vitamin D supplementation beyond the recommended Dietary Reference Intake for this population. Technical remark: This recommendation relates to empiric vitamin D supplementation that exceeds the DRIs established by the IOM, and adults in this age group should follow the Recommended Daily Allowance established by the IOM (600 IU [15 μg] daily). Background notes that levels of 25(OH)D lower than 12 ng/mL (30 nmol/L) were seen in 14% of Europeans and lower than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) in 40%, and in the United States, 24% and 6% of adults have 25(OH)D levels lower than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) and 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L), respectively; numerous studies have found associations between low 25(OH)D levels, low BMD, and fractures, low 25(OH)D levels have also been associated with fatigue and higher risks for respiratory infections, and the age span of 18 to 50 years is when peak bone mass occurs.

### Recommendations abstracted from the American Geriatrics Society consensus statement on vitamin D for prevention of falls and their consequences [^113E7Qdo]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Medium credibility.

American Geriatrics Society Workgroup on Vitamin D Supplementation for Older Adults — serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) targets for fall prevention emphasize that a serum 25(OH)D concentration of 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) should be a minimum goal to achieve in older adults, particularly in frail adults, who are at higher risk of falls, injuries, and fractures, and that this goal could be achieved safely and would not require practitioners to measure serum 25(OH)D concentrations in older adults in the absence of underlying conditions that increase the risk of hypercalcemia (e.g., advanced renal disease, certain malignancies, sarcoidosis). Serum concentrations less than 30 ng/mL (< 75 nmol/L) have been associated with balance problems, impaired lower extremity function, high fall rates, low bone mineral density (BMD), and muscle weakness, and significantly fewer falls and their consequences has been reported in association with greater vitamin D input; the document's stated aim is to help primary care practitioners achieve adequate vitamin D intake from all sources in their older patients, with the goal of reducing falls and fall-related injuries.

### A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing the efficacy of high doses of vitamin D on functional disability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^116E1jPe]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the short-term efficacy of vitamin D (cholecalciferol) supplementation on functional disability in RA patients.

Methods

1) Patients: RA (ACR 1987 revised criteria) in non-remission (DAS28 > 2.6) whose treatment was not expected to be changed over a 3-month period following inclusion and presenting with vitD deficits (serum 25OHD < 30ng/mL). 2) Study design: prospective randomised placebo-controlled trial (NCT02243800). 3) Study arms: either vitD ampoules (cholecalciferol 100,000IU) or placebo. 4) Outcome measures: primary: improvement in patients' functional disability using the Health Assessment questionnaire (HAQ); secondary: improvement in DAS28ESR, DAS28CRP, ESR, CRP, RAID score, fatigue (EVA and FACIT), and SF36.

Results

Overall, 59 patients were included, 83.1% females, aged 59.8 ± 10.9 years on average, with RA for 17.0 ± 9.7 years. Thirty patients received placebo and 29 vitD. At 6 months, HAQ scores tended to be increased in the placebo group (+0.08 ± 0.25), while slightly numerically decreased in the vitD group (-0.03 ± 0.23) (p = 0.11). After adjusting for age, gender, season, and initial vitD status, the between-group difference achieved statistically significance (p = 0.046). After adjusting for age, gender, season, and initial vitD status, there was no significant difference in the secondary criteria between the 2 groups except for ESR and CRP (p = 0.002 and 0.04, respectively).

Conclusions

In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with RA and VitD deficiency, high doses of cholecalciferol resulted in a statistically significant improvement in functional disability at month 6, which, however, was clinically not relevant.

### Unmet needs in the pathogenesis and treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^112UDsHs]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of Fatigue in Patients with SLE

As has already been outlined, there is no reliable treatment for fatigue in patients with lupus. Fatigue and quality of life outcomes are often measured in clinical trials in lupus. The BLISS trial investigated the use of belimumab (a B lymphocyte stimulator-specific inhibitor) in lupus. This trial reported an improvement in fatigue (measured by FACIT Fatigue score) as a secondary outcome.

Vitamin D deficiency is a common finding in both the general population and in patients with lupus. Previously, low level of vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D3) has been found to correlate with increased lupus disease activity (although did not correlate with complement levels or damage scores). A recent randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of weekly high dose (50,000 I/U) oral vitamin D supplementation in patients with juvenile-onset lupus was noted to show a significant improvement in terms of both disease activity (measured by SLEDAI) and fatigue levels (measured by the Kids Fatigue Severity Scale), which suggests that the treatment of low vitamin D levels may be useful in the management of patients with lupus.

Non-pharmacological treatment of fatigue in lupus has previously been investigated by Tench et al. in a trial that compared graded exercise, relaxation therapy and no intervention. The exercise group was asked to complete three 30–50 min exercise sessions a week for a period of 12 weeks. Exercise predominantly included walking, cycling and swimming. By comparison, the group assigned to relaxation therapy was asked to listen to a 30-min relaxation tape three times a week. The final group was asked to continue with their usual daily routines. Fatigue levels were noted to significantly improve in the patient group undergoing graded exercise when compared with the other two groups at 12 weeks. However, these improvements were not maintained at 3-month follow-up. This was believed to be due to the fact that not all patients continued with the regular exercise regime.

Overall, recommendations for management of fatigue in patients with SLE are summarised in Table 2.

Table 2
Recommendations for the management of fatigue in lupus

In conclusion, fatigue is a prevalent problem faced by many patients with lupus. This is often independent of disease activity and remains problematic even in those with well-controlled disease. Escalation of standard immunosuppressive therapy is often ineffective in the treatment of fatigue. The causes of fatigue in lupus are poorly understood and likely to be multifactorial.

### Correlation of symptoms with vitamin D deficiency and symptom response to cholecalciferol treatment: a randomized controlled trial [^116tHfz8]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the association of symptoms with vitamin D deficiency and symptom response to cholecalciferol treatment in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Methods

Adult primary care patients in Duluth, Minnesota, were screened for vitamin D deficiency in February 2007. Participants completed questionnaires pertaining to a variety of symptoms, vitamin D intake, and selected medical conditions. Patients with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], 10–25 ng/mL) participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of vitamin D replacement and its effect on symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 50 000 units of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) weekly or placebo for 8 weeks. Patients with severe vitamin D deficiency (25[OH]D < 10 ng/mL) were treated in an unblinded fashion, and symptoms were reevaluated post treatment.

Results

A total of 610 patients underwent initial screening, and 100 patients with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency participated in the RCT. Thirty-eight severely deficient patients were treated in an unblinded fashion. On initial screening, 46.2% of participants were deficient in vitamin D. Self-reported vitamin D supplementation, milk intake, celiac disease, gastric bypass, and chronic pancreatitis were predictive of vitamin D status. Severely deficient participants reported increased musculoskeletal symptoms, depression (including seasonal), and higher (worse) scores on a fibromyalgia assessment questionnaire. In the RCT, the treated group showed significant improvement in fibromyalgia assessment scores (P = 0.03), whereas the placebo-treated participants did not. Severely deficient patients did not show symptom improvement over the 8-week trial period or when followed up 1 year later.

Conclusions

Compared with participants in the placebo group, patients in the treatment group showed mild short-term improvement in the overall fibromyalgia impact score, but did not show significant improvement in most musculoskeletal symptoms or in activities of daily living.

### Low vitamin D levels are associated with long COVID syndrome in COVID-19 survivors [^117J351T]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D is well-known to regulate the immune response and immunocompetence regarding both innate and adaptive immunity, supporting antimicrobial and antiviral immune responses. Furthermore, among the consistently reported extraskeletal effects of vitamin D, this hormone is also characterized to, firstly, influence musculoskeletal health and function, improving muscle recovery and cellular turnover and reducing muscle cells atrophy; secondly, reduce nonspecific musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, and arthralgia; thirdly, influence neurocognitive functions and disorders; and, finally, promote respiratory recovery after pneumonia. However, despite these findings and the negative influence of hypovitaminosis D on the acute clinical course of patients affected by COVID-19, very little is known regarding the role of vitamin D in recovery from symptoms and signs often present in COVID-19 survivors after the acute disease. To date, only a few studies have investigated the role of vitamin D in risk the of long COVID occurrence, reporting conflicting results principally due the inclusion of different cohorts of patients (ie, including those with different grades of acute disease severity), different timing of follow-up evaluations (ie, mostly up to only 3 months after the acute infection), and different health areas of symptoms and signs collected (ie, some studies evaluated only muscle and physical performances).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of circulating 25(OH) vitamin D levels on risk of long COVID occurrence in a cohort of patients previously hospitalized for acute COVID-19 and reassessed 6 months after hospital discharge.

### The association between serum vitamin D and obstructive sleep apnea: an updated meta-analysis [^114v5Ljp]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Some studies have reported that sleep fragmentation in patients with OSA due to nocturnal hypoxia can lead to daytime drowsiness, fatigue and other symptoms. Sleep fragmentation can lead to a decrease in outdoor activity and a decrease in vitamin D synthesis. In addition, due to the repeated aggravation of upper airway obstruction and hypopnea in patients with OSA, autonomic nerve function is mainly increased in terms of sympathetic nerve activity at night, and there is abnormal tension of the vagus nerve. Excitation of the sympathetic nervous system could partly inhibit vagus nerve activity, while abnormal vagus nerve activity affects gastrointestinal motility and the secretion of gastrointestinal hormones, in turn affecting the absorption and metabolism of vitamin D. At the same time, OSA patients suffer from sleep disturbances, intermittent hypoxia, upper airway obstruction and increased abdominal pressure for a long time. All of these disorders could result in gastroesophageal reflux and gastric ischemia, which also affect the absorption of vitamin D. Therefore, the level of serum vitamin D in patients with severe OSA is significantly lower than that in healthy controls.

Among the included studies, the study by Liu et al. demonstrated that tonsillar hypertrophy was related to low serum vitamin D and that tonsillar hypertrophy is one of the main causes of OSA in children. The mechanism may be that vitamin D could be related to immune regulation. A normal serum 25(OH)D level can enhance innate immunity, and a low level of vitamin D can significantly decrease the total number of peripheral T lymphocytes and the percentage of T cells, causing reduced cellular immunity and humoral immune function. Moreover, a low vitamin D level gives rise to dysfunctional upper airway immune regulation. Lower levels of vitamin D promote the production of inflammatory transmitters, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1, which increase the risk of respiratory tract infection. This leads to tonsillar hypertrophy, chronic rhinitis and nonspecific myopathy, which may aggravate OSA in children.

### Missed diagnoses and health problems in adults with Prader-Willi syndrome: recommendations for screening and treatment [^114cjxtQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Age and BMI.

Thirteen patients had BMI < 25kg/m 2 and age < 25 years. None of these patients had DM2, 1 patient had hypertension, and 2 had hypercholesterolemia (of which 1 case was undiagnosed before screening).

Fatigue and daytime sleepiness

Fatigue and daytime sleepiness were common. One-third of the patients (40/115) had clinically relevant daytime sleepiness (score of 3 or higher on a 5-point Likert scale). All of these 40 patients had either untreated vitamin D deficiency, untreated male hypogonadism (Table 5), or another treatable cause such as sleep apnea, narcolepsia, nycturia, or use of drugs that can cause sleepiness (antiepileptic drugs, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, or antihistamines). Daytime sleepiness was present in 62% of the patients with untreated vitamin D deficiency versus 36% of the patients with normal vitamin D levels (P = 0.02). It was also related to the severity of the deficieny: daytime sleepiness was present in 80% of patients with untreated severe vitamin D defiency, 57% of patients with untreated mild vitamin D defiency, and 36% of patients with normal vitamin D levels.

Table 5.
Fatigue and daytime sleepiness and potential underlying causes

Biochemical analysis

Liver panel was normal in most patients. However, 19 patients had alkaline phosphatase levels above the upper limit of normal. The vast majority of them had potential underlying causes such as vitamin D deficiency (63%) and/or obesity (58%). Normocytic anemia was common in males, but not in females. There were no cases of micro- or macrocytic anemia. Of the 17 males with anemia, 13 (76%) had untreated hypogonadism. Creatinine levels were generally low: 35 males (63%) and 28 females (47%) had creatinine levels below the lower limit of normal, and this was independent of BMI and age. Of all males, 95% had creatinine levels between 46 and 93µmol/L and eGFR levels between 93 and 149ml/min/1.73m 2. Of all females, 95% had creatinine levels between 37 and 76 µmol/L and eGFR levels between 98 and 140 ml/min/1.73m 2.

### Effect of monthly vitamin D3 supplementation in healthy adults on adverse effects of earthquakes: randomised controlled trial [^111Snh9m]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine whether supplementation with vitamin D improves resilience to the adverse effects of earthquakes.

Design

Opportunistic addition to an established randomised double blind placebo controlled trial.

Setting

Christchurch, New Zealand, where a prolonged series of catastrophic earthquakes beginning on 4 September 2010 occurred, which caused widespread destruction, fatalities, and extensive psychological damage.

Participants

322 healthy adults (241 women; 81 men) aged 18–67 who were already participating in the vitamin D and acute respiratory infections study (VIDARIS) between February 2010 and November 2011.

Intervention

Participants were randomised to receive an oral dose of either 200,000 IU vitamin D3 monthly for two months then 100,000 IU monthly (n = 161) or placebo (n = 161) for a total of 18 months.

Main Outcome Measure

This is a post hoc analysis from the previously published VIDARIS trial. The primary endpoint in the current analysis was the self reported effects and overall adverse impact of the Christchurch earthquakes as assessed by questionnaire four months after the most destructive earthquake on 22 February 2011, which was used as the index event. The secondary end point was the number of "psychological" adverse events that participants reported at their usual monthly appointments as part of the original VIDARIS trial.

Results

308 participants completed the earthquake impact questionnaire (n = 152 in the vitamin D group and 156 in the placebo group). There was no significant difference in the number of self reported adverse effects between those receiving vitamin D supplementation and those receiving placebo. There was also no difference in the overall adverse impact score between treatment groups (χ² P = 0.44). The exception was that those in the vitamin D group experienced more adverse effects on family relationships (22% v 13%; χ(2) P = 0.03). The number of psychological adverse events-such as fatigue, stress, anxiety, and insomnia-that participants reported at their usual monthly appointments was significantly higher after the earthquake (χ² P = 0.007) but did not differ between treatment groups.

Conclusion

In this trial, vitamin D supplementation did not reduce the adverse impact of earthquakes in healthy adults. Trial registration Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (anzctr.org.au) ACTRN12609000486224.

### Mechanical factors and vitamin D deficiency in schoolchildren with low back pain: biochemical and cross-sectional survey analysis [^1159hUbX]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Regarding the role of muscle fatigue in the progression of LBP among schoolchildren, muscle fatigue markers, CK and LDH, and pain rating scores were estimated in all schoolchildren. Schoolchildren with moderate and severe LBP showed a significant (P = 0.001) increase in the serum levels of CK and LDH along with higher pain rating scores compared to those with no or minimal LBP.

Vitamin D is essential for the development and maintenance of musculoskeletal system for the best function of the muscles and nervous system throughout the life of a human body. The reduction in muscle performance, which leads to LBP, was shown to be associated with vitamin D deficiency and physical inability in adolescents, especially girls. Whereas muscle power and force are linked with vitamin D levels, these may produce a significant myopathy that leads to muscle fatigue and reduced motivation to daily activities. The severity of LBP in our study population may be related to physiological change in the behavior of musculoskeletal system as a result of change in normal levels of Ca, CK, and LDH, whereas muscle membrane, contraction, and energy metabolism depend on ionic regulation of certain minerals and enzymes. The irregularity in the levels of muscle lactate, hydrogen (H +), and calcium (Ca 2+) ions was shown to be linked with muscle fatigue. In addition, the release of intramuscular enzymes, such as CK and LDH, may be related to collagen fiber degradation either by overuse or strained muscle damage.–

In relation to vitamin D status, the deficiency in the levels of vitamin 25(OH)D reported in schoolchildren with moderate and severe LBP correlated negatively with LBP disability scores, BMI, pain rating score, CK, LDH, and wearing black clothes made of synthetic fabrics and positively with PA, longer sun exposure, areas of skin exposed, serum Ca, and sBAP in all groups. This correlation was confirmed with previous studies that reported that the deficiency in vitamin D may be related to poor PA, adiposity, minimal sun exposure,–and insufficient dietary intake or impairments in metabolic activation of the vitamin.–In addition, vitamin 25(OH) D deficiency was significantly reported in healthy growing children and adolescents in many countries,–and it was significantly correlated with higher levels of serum sBAP, which may contribute to both optimizing bone mass and muscle strength.

5.10.3.1 Investigations and treatment in IBD patients with fatigue

Good Practice Recommendation 25. IBD patients experiencing fatigue should be investigated for subclinical disease activity and other potentially modifiable factors considered such as sleep pattern, medication side effects, anaemia, iron deficiency, electrolyte disturbance, thyroid dysfunction, vitamin D and B12 deficiency and psychological symptoms (Agreement: 93.5%).

A questionnaire study of 631 patients in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific showed that daily fatigue was reported by 53% of IBD patients with anaemia. Anaemia in IBD can be multifactorial including poor oral intake, malabsorption, chronic blood loss or due to chronic inflammation. Vitamin B12 and iron therapy are easily administered treatments that may correct anaemia in IBD patients. A Canadian population-based study found iron deficiency in the absence of anaemia did not contribute to fatigue. However, a recent European study identified iron deficiency as a risk factor for fatigue (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.1). Muscle fatigue has been associated with low serum vitamin D and magnesium. Other contributing factors should also be considered including pain, sleep disturbance, alcohol misuse and emotional stress. Medications should be reviewed for those that may contribute to fatigue. Corticosteroids have been demonstrated as a determinant of fatigue, although this may be a reflection of disease severity as opposed to a medication side effect. Avoidance of steroids and cessation of immunomodulatory therapy in Crohn's disease were predictors of improved physical and cognitive fatigue, respectively, in a longitudinal study. Recent data have demonstrated higher circulating frequencies of memory T-cells in fatigued patients with IBD. Whole blood stimulation demonstrated higher production of the Th1 cytokines TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Anti-TNF therapy with either infliximab or adalimumab has been shown to reduce the symptoms of fatigue.

### Editorial commentary: is vitamin D the new wheaties? Preventing muscle fatigue could keep athletes in the game [^114zq2mS]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is an oft overlooked and underevaluated condition that is widespread in patient-athletes, including the elite and professional. Although the symptomatology of this deficiency is well known in the general population (osteoporosis and increased risk of fracture), the symptom of muscle fatigue is not. It is only recently that the association between vitamin D deficiency and muscle fatigue in professional athletes has been placed in the spotlight. However, vitamin D deficiency should be of increasing concern for orthopaedists in regard to all athletes. In the elite collegiate/professional ranks, this condition may lead to detrimental injuries with career-altering effects. Although this condition may not affect career and financial well-being for most patients, modifications in athletic performance and lifestyle are still of utmost value to any athlete. Although I do not condone ordering vitamin D levels as a screening tool, nor broadly prescribing supplements to all patient-athletes, I do believe that it is warranted if certain "high-risk" criteria are met.

### Hypervitaminosis D associated with a vitamin D dispensing error [^111d17mH]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of hypervitaminosis D resulting in hypercalcemia and acute kidney injury in a 70-year-old female who was prescribed a standard dose of vitamin D but given a toxic dose of vitamin D 50,000 IU (1.25 mg) daily resulting from a dispensing error.

Case Summary

A 70-year-old female in her usual state of health was instructed to begin supplementation with vitamin D 1000 IU daily. Three months later she developed confusion, slurred speech, unstable gait, and increased fatigue. She was hospitalized for hypercalcemia and acute kidney injury secondary to hypervitaminosis D. All vitamin D supplementation was discontinued and 5 months after discharge, the patient's serum calcium and vitamin D concentrations, as well as renal function, had returned to baseline values. Upon review of the patient's records, it was discovered that she had been taking vitamin D 50,000 IU daily.

Discussion

There is an increased interest in vitamin D, resulting in more health care providers recommending — and patients taking — supplemental vitamin D. Hypervitaminosis D is rarely reported and generally only in the setting of gross excess of vitamin D. This report highlights a case of hypervitaminosis D in the setting of a prescribed standard dose of vitamin D that resulted in toxic ingestion of vitamin D 50,000 IU daily due to a dispensing error. As more and more people use vitamin D supplements, it is important to recognize that, while rare, hypervitaminosis D is a possibility and dosage conversion of vitamin D units can result in errors.

Conclusions

Health care providers and patients should be educated on the advantages and risks associated with vitamin D supplementation and be informed of safety measures to avoid hypervitaminosis D. In addition, health care providers should understand dosage conversion regarding vitamin D and electronic prescribing and dispensing software should be designed to detect such errors.

Secondary and other endpoints

After 6 weeks there was a difference in mean change in PTH between groups (P = 0.036). There was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects reaching a 30% decrease in PTH at 6 weeks (14.9 versus 6.3%, P = 0.32) or 12 weeks (10.6 versus 4.2%, P = 0.27). Eight patients in the treatment group experienced an iPTH level < 6.8 pmol/L. Seven of these patients were in CKD Stage 3.

The serum concentration of 25(OH)D increased from 57.5 ± 22 to 161.6 ± 49 nmol/L after 12 weeks in the treatment group but remained unchanged in the placebo group. All subjects in the treatment arm were 25(OH)D sufficient (> 75 nmol/L) after 12 weeks (Figure 2).

FIGURE 2
Individual observations of 25(OH)D before and after 12 weeks on cholecalciferol treatment.

The 1,25(OH)D increased from 64.5 ± 43 to 101.5 ± 54 pmol/L in the cholecalciferol group.

The calcium concentration remained constant on 2.2 mmol/L in the cholecalciferol group, but decreased from 2.3 ± 0.12 to 2.2 ± 0.13 mmol/L in the placebo group. The difference in mean change was significant (P < 0.01).

There were no differences in mean change between the groups in FGF23 or FE of phosphate.

Additionally, there were no differences at 12 weeks between groups in fatigue scores: for physical fatigue score (P = 0.11), for mental fatigue score (P = 0.25), and for the visual analogue scale (P = 0.96) or hand grip strength (P = 0.98).

After eliminating duplicates, we initially screened titles and abstracts, excluding review articles, editorials/comments, articles that were out of the scope of the review or contained no relevant information.

We then performed a secondary screening, of full-text articles, eliminating reports based on the following criteria:
The primary measure was prevalence, incidence or risk of MS symptom, including fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, neuropathic or musculoskeletal pain, sleeping disorders, or sexual dysfunction.
Treatment goals were the primary objective (e.g. vitamin D, goal adjustment in MS-associated depression).
The comorbidity was investigated as an association or the output measure was given as a mean severity score (instead of cut-off incidence/prevalence measure or risk ratio).

### Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and the risk of frailty syndrome: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^1138M2Re]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The last pathway through which low vitamin D may affect frailty is related to its hypothesized anti-inflammatory properties. Several studies have demonstrated a heightened inflammatory state among frail older adults marked by high serum levels of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and acute phase proteins, supporting the existence of a dysregulated immune system in frailty. An increased susceptibility to infection and risk of autoimmune disease has been shown in 25OHD deficiency. Illness may be the beginning of a vicious cycle between 25OHD deficiency and frailty. Individuals with illness tend to exhibit poor nutritional status, go outside less frequently and experience less sun exposure, which are underlying causes of low serum 25OHD concentrations. A recent study suggested that 1,25OHD may be an important regulator of the inflammatory response during bacterial infection. Active vitamin D metabolites can downregulate inflammatory markers via the nuclear VDR expressed in antigen-presenting cells, and vitamin D deficiency may result in increased pro-inflammatory cytokines that impact muscle strength and performance.

### Effect of monthly vitamin D3 supplementation in healthy adults on adverse effects of earthquakes: randomised controlled trial [^111zmueX]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine whether supplementation with vitamin D improves resilience to the adverse effects of earthquakes.

Design Opportunistic addition to an established randomised double blind placebo controlled trial.

Setting Christchurch, New Zealand, where a prolonged series of catastrophic earthquakes beginning on 4 September 2010 occurred, which caused widespread destruction, fatalities, and extensive psychological damage.

Participants 322 healthy adults (241 women; 81 men) aged 18–67 who were already participating in the vitamin D and acute respiratory infections study (VIDARIS) between February 2010 and November 2011.

Intervention Participants were randomised to receive an oral dose of either 200 000 IU vitamin D 3 monthly for two months then 100 000 IU monthly (n = 161) or placebo (n = 161) for a total of 18 months.

Main outcome measure This is a post hoc analysis from the previously published VIDARIS trial. The primary endpoint in the current analysis was the self reported effects and overall adverse impact of the Christchurch earthquakes as assessed by questionnaire four months after the most destructive earthquake on 22 February 2011, which was used as the index event. The secondary end point was the number of "psychological" adverse events that participants reported at their usual monthly appointments as part of the original VIDARIS trial.

Results 308 participants completed the earthquake impact questionnaire (n = 152 in the vitamin D group and 156 in the placebo group). There was no significant difference in the number of self reported adverse effects between those receiving vitamin D supplementation and those receiving placebo. There was also no difference in the overall adverse impact score between treatment groups (χ² P = 0.44). The exception was that those in the vitamin D group experienced more adverse effects on family relationships (22% v 13%; χ 2 P = 0.03). The number of psychological adverse events — such as fatigue, stress, anxiety, and insomnia — that participants reported at their usual monthly appointments was significantly higher after the earthquake (χ² P = 0.007) but did not differ between treatment groups.

Conclusion In this trial, vitamin D supplementation did not reduce the adverse impact of earthquakes in healthy adults.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^112HPHPU]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Based on an extensive meta-analysis, muscle (especially proximal muscle) strength may modestly improve with vitamin D supplementation of elderly subjects with serum 25OHD levels < 30 nmol/L. Consistent with this concept, the same RCT from Brazil found that supplementation with 1000 IU of vitamin D 3 per day for 9 months significantly reduced first fallers by nearly 50% and all falls by even more.

Several trials have examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on incident fallers and fall rate. A meta-analysis of nine RCTs showed that daily supplementation of < IU of vitamin D was ineffective whereas 700 to 1000 IU significantly decreased the fall risk. A Cochrane review concluded that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of falls in institutionalized care patients (highly likely to be vitamin D deficient) [relative risk (RR), 0.63 (0.46 to 0.85)]. In ambulatory subjects, vitamin D supplementation did not decrease the risk of falls in a meta-analysis of all RCTs combined, but it decreased the risk of falls and fallers [RR, 0.57 (0.37 to 0.89) and RR, 0.70 (0.56 to 0.87), respectively] in subjects with a baseline serum 25OHD concentration < 50 nmol/L. A more recent meta-analysis of RCTs found that supplementation with vitamin D reduced the fall rate only in subjects with a starting serum 25OHD concentration < 75 nmol/L.

### Association between serum 25 (OH) D concentrations and bone stress fractures in Finnish young men [^1173ZKXj]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Low vitamin D level may predict rickets, osteomalacia, or osteoporosis. We examined serum 25(OH)D concentration as a predisposing factor for bone stress fracture in 756 military recruits. The average serum 25(OH)D concentration was significantly lower in the group with fracture, suggesting a relationship between vitamin D and fatigue bone stress fracture.

Introduction

Low vitamin D level may predict rickets, osteomalacia, or osteoporosis. Fatigue bone stress fracture is one of the most frequently seen types of overuse injuries in athletes and military recruits. An association was recently shown between vitamin D and BMC. A correlation has also been found between low femoral BMD and stress fractures. We measured serum 25(OH)D concentration in a population sample of military recruits to determine if vitamin D is a predisposing factor for fatigue bone stress fracture.

Materials and Methods

We prospectively followed 800 randomly selected, healthy Finnish military recruits with a mean age of 19 years for developing stress fractures in homogenous circumstances. Blood for serum 25(OH)D concentration was drawn at entry into military service, and the weight, height, body mass index (BMI), muscle strength, and 12-minute running were measured for all subjects. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured with enzyme immunoassay. At end of the 90-day follow-up, 756 subjects completed the study. Subjects without fracture constituted controls.

Results

Twenty-two recruits with stress fracture were identified (2.9%), the incidence being 11.6 (95% CI: 6.8–16.5) per 100 person-years. In the final multivariate analysis, the significant risk factor for stress fracture in conscripts was a below median serum 25(OH)D level (75.8 nM), OR being 3.6 (95% CI: 1.2–11.1). No significant associations between BMI (p = 0.255), age (p = 0.216), or smoking (p = 0.851) and bone stress fracture were found in this study population.

Conclusions

A lower level of serum 25(OH)D concentration may be a generally predisposing element for bone stress fractures. Considering the obvious need of additional vitamin D in prevention of stress fractures, the effects of vitamin D fortification of foods and supplementation will be subjects of interest for future research.

### Water-soluble vitamins in people with low glomerular filtration rate or on dialysis: a review [^113QbSno]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Ongoing Studies

In hemodialysis patients, trials of vitamin C to reduce hyperpigmentation, and to alleviate restless legs syndrome, are ongoing. One trial in patients with chronic kidney disease will examine antioxidant properties by comparing vitamin C with N-acetylcysteine for prevention of contrast nephrotoxicity.

Summary

Vitamin C deficiency is prevalent in unsupplemented patients on dialysis, with perhaps 10% having severe deficiency, below the scorbutic threshold. It is also possible that most dialysis patients, or even most humans, eating a typical western diet, have intakes and levels that are far from optimal. Pending rigorous randomized trials in dialysis patients, powered to examine cardiovascular and infectious outcomes and the possibility of harm from calcium oxalate, it seems reasonable to administer low-dose vitamin C supplementation, perhaps 60–100 mg daily, to patients on hemodialysis, and to consider the diagnosis of vitamin C deficiency in patients whose anemia or fatigue is disproportionate to their known comorbidities, in patients on extended-hours hemodialysis treatments, and in those who have difficulty in maintaining a balanced diet within the restrictions imposed by dialysis. Short-term use of parenteral vitamin C can be considered for patients with functional iron deficiency, but strong evidence of the efficacy of this approach is lacking, and there are no long-term safety data.

Vitamin D and statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) — insufficient vitamin D stores are associated with muscle discomfort and have been associated with SAMS, but a causal relationship is unproven. Data investigating a link between vitamin D levels and SAMS, as well as supplementation with vitamin D to treat SAMS represents low level evidence with several limitations. The majority of data suggest an association between low vitamin D and SAMS, with risk increasing at vitamin D plasma levels < 30 ng/mL, and more strongly at < 20 ng/mL.

### Changes in vitamin D levels in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: effects on fatigue, disease activity, and damage [^111V8zkC]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze whether changes in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels affect activity, irreversible organ damage, and fatigue in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods

We performed an observational study of 80 patients with SLE included in a previous cross-sectional study of 25(OH)D, reassessed 2 years later. Oral vitamin D(3) was recommended in those with low baseline 25(OH)D levels. The relationship between changes in 25(OH)D levels from baseline and changes in fatigue (measured by a 0–10 visual analog scale [VAS]), SLE activity (measured by the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index [SLEDAI]), and irreversible organ damage (measured by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index [SDI]) were analyzed.

Results

Sixty patients took vitamin D(3). Mean 25(OH)D levels increased among all treated patients (P = 0.044), in those with baseline vitamin D levels < 30 ng/ml (P < 0.001), and in those with baseline vitamin D levels < 10 ng/ml (P = 0.005). Fifty-seven patients (71%) still had 25(OH)D levels < 30 ng/ml and 5 (6%) had 25(OH)D levels < 10 ng/ml. Inverse significant correlations between 25(OH)D levels and the VAS (P = 0.001) and between changes in 25(OH)D levels and changes in the VAS in patients with baseline 25(OH)D levels < 30 ng/ml (P = 0.017) were found. No significant correlations were seen between the variation of the SLEDAI or SDI values and the variation in 25(OH)D levels (P = 0.87 and P = 0.63, respectively).

Conclusion

Increasing 25(OH)D levels may have a beneficial effect on fatigue. Our results do not support any effects of increasing 25(OH)D levels on SLE severity, although they are limited by the insufficient 25(OH)D response to the recommended regimen of oral vitamin D(3) replacement.

### Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and the risk of frailty syndrome: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^115MUqu6]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Our results suggest that high 25OHD levels are associated with a lower risk of frailty in elderly people. Conversely, frailty itself may contribute to lower 25OHD by reducing the levels of outdoor activity and sunlight exposure. Elderly individuals with frailty are at a high risk of developing vitamin D deficiency due to decreased dietary intake, less sun exposure, and a decreased capacity to produce sufficient amounts of calcitriol due to an age-related decline in hydroxylation by the kidney. The causality of the association between low vitamin D levels and the frailty syndrome has not been completely elucidated. Nevertheless, there are several potential biological mechanisms that could explain the inverse association between vitamin D and frailty.

Considerable overlap exists between sarcopenia and frailty, especially in terms of the physical aspects of the frailty phenotype: low grip strength, gait speed and muscle mass. While the underlying mechanisms and pathophysiology of sarcopenia remain to be clarified, inadequate nutritional intake in older individuals may contribute to the multifactorial pathogenesis of sarcopenia. In particular, vitamin D, one of the most popular micronutrients, was reported to play important roles in muscle differentiation, stimulation of calcium and phosphorus transport and muscle contraction. A muscle biopsy study revealed atrophy of type II muscle fibers in subjects with profound vitamin D deficiency. During sudden movement, the fast and strong type II muscle fibers are the first to be recruited to avoid falling. A meta-analysis observed that daily vitamin D doses in the range of 700 to 1000 IU or achieving serum concentrations between 60 and 95 nmol/L reduced the risk of falling by 19% in older individuals. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25OHD) can act on muscle fibers by binding to its nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) and thereby increasing the de novo synthesis of protein, which regulates muscle strength. VDR number decreases with aging in several organs involved in calcium metabolism, and 1alpha-hydroxylase activity decreases mainly due to a decrease in renal function, reducing vitamin D activation. An age-related decline in VDR expression is supported by studies in rats in which VDR expression declined with advancing age in both the intestine and bone. When 25OHD levels are low, active metabolite 1,25OHD levels and calcium absorption decrease. This reduced serum calcium led to an increase in parathyroid hormone levels to stimulate 1,25OHD production, resulting in an increased risk of bone turnover and bone loss. Consequently, a decline in muscle function and strength caused by vitamin D could explain slowness, low physical activity and weakness.

### Vitamin D, chronic pain, and depression: linear and non-linear mendelian randomization analyses [^113VxUoR]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We conducted one-sample Mendelian randomization analyses in UK Biobank using both linear and non-linear methods. In analyses using the focused genetic score, we did not observe associations between genetically-predicted 25(OH)D and various outcomes in the population as a whole, suggesting that population shifts in vitamin D levels are unlikely to substantially decrease risk of fibromyalgia, clinical fatigue, chronic widespread pain, or probable lifetime major depression. However, we did observe a suggestive association with probable lifetime major depression in the stratum of the population with the lowest levels of 25(OH)D. This suggests that vitamin D supplementation may reduce risk of depression for those with low vitamin D levels.

Our findings may clarify evidence found in clinical trials for the effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression. While recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation have found evidence for reductions in depression and depressive symptoms, the VITAL trial did not observe any reduction in risk. However, few individuals in the VITAL trial had deficient levels of vitamin D. Additionally, VITAL trial participants were allowed to continue taking low dose vitamin D supplements, even if they were assigned to the placebo arm of the trial. Our findings suggest that any benefit of vitamin D supplementation may be limited to those with low vitamin D levels and that supplementation beyond a threshold level may provide limited additional benefit. This corresponds to what has been seen in supplementation trials for acute respiratory tract infections, which have reported stronger evidence of risk reduction in those with 25(OH)D concentrations below 25 nmol/L. Similarly, a previous systematic review of trials found that evidence of an inverse effect of vitamin D supplementation was limited to studies in those with deficient vitamin D levels at baseline. This is also supported by research suggesting that vitamin D deficiency precedes the development of depression rather than being associated with its effects.

### Vitamin D supplementation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with low serum vitamin D: a randomized controlled trial [^114UDcaY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Several factors could have contributed to these different results. In contrast to other studies we decided not to include participants with serum 25(OH)D concentrations < 15 nmol/L. Random assignment to the placebo arm of these participants might have led to other vitamin D–related health issues such as osteomalacia. This resulted in a higher median serum 25(OH)D concentration in the severely deficient group in our study population, than in the population included in the IPD meta-analyses (median [IQR]: 22 nmol/L [18–24 nmol/L] and 19 nmol/L [14–22 nmol/L], respectively, based on DA Jolliffe, AR Martineau, Queen Mary University of London, personal communication, 2020). It seems plausible that effects of vitamin D supplementation are largest in the most deficient participants. Another explanation for different results may be the inclusion of participants with more severe COPD in the other studies, particularly in the first published RCT of Lehouck et al. than in our study. Our study participants had a higher mean FEV 1 at baseline than those in the study of Lehouck et al. However, we do not find these explanations to be very likely, because we did not find a difference in effect size in the IPD meta-analysis between participants with GOLD-stage 1–2 as opposed to GOLD-stage 3–4. In addition, in the study of Martineau et al. the exacerbation rate was smaller than in our study (1.04–1.11/patient-year).

The absence of an effect of vitamin D supplementation on exacerbations in our study is in contrast with findings from many observational studies showing associations between (characteristics of) COPD and low vitamin D concentrations. Reverse causation (low vitamin D concentrations as a consequence rather than cause of the disease) and (residual) confounding may be explanations for this apparent discrepancy.

Our finding of the absence of an effect of vitamin D supplementation on physical performance is in line with previous clinical trials in COPD patients. In the general population, positive effects of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength are small but present, particularly in older individuals and in persons with 25(OH)D concentrations ˂25 nmol/L. The absence of an effect in COPD patients may be related to the fact that other contributory mechanisms such as inactivity and the chronic inflammatory state may override potential small negative effects of vitamin D deficiency on muscle strength.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1144Ymwq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on vitamin D deficiency:

- **Definition**: Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 20 ng/mL and 21–29 ng/mL is considered insufficiency.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of vitamin D deficiency primarily involves inadequate cutaneous synthesis due to decreased exposure to sunlight, leading to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium and secondary hyperparathyroidism. This can result in increased bone turnover and defective mineralization of the collagenous matrix. Other mechanisms of deficiency include inadequate dietary intake, reduced gastrointestinal absorption in gastrointestinal disorders, impaired hepatic 25-hydroxylation due to certain medications or liver disease, increased metabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in cancer, granulomatous diseases, or primary hyperparathyroidism, and rarely, loss of vitamin D-binding protein due to nephrotic syndrome or peritoneal dialysis.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varies significantly by geographic region, population group, and age. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the US is estimated at 24.6%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include inadequate sunlight exposure, malabsorption syndromes, bariatric procedures, renal or hepatic disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and certain medications such as anticonvulsants and glucocorticoids. People with dark skin, residing at higher latitudes (> 33° north or south), older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with obesity are at higher risk.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of vitamin D deficiency can range from asymptomatic to severe, depending on the extent of the deficiency and the presence of comorbid conditions. Symptoms can include diffuse musculoskeletal pain, bone pain, and muscle weakness. In severe cases, it can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, osteopenia, osteomalacia, and bone fractures in adults and rickets in children. Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with an increased risk of CVDs, T2DM, preeclampsia, infections, and cognitive impairment.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of vitamin D deficiency is generally good with appropriate treatment, which typically involves supplementation with vitamin D3. However, untreated deficiency can result in long-term skeletal and extra-skeletal consequences and has been linked to an increased risk of mortality.

### Comparative effects of vitamin D and vitamin C supplementations with and without endurance physical activity on metabolic syndrome patients: a randomized controlled trial [^117Ax4gL]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of abnormal cardio metabolic factors that increase risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. MetS is a major health problem worldwide; based on the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) appreciation about one quarter of the world's adult population have MetS. MetS is among dangerous syndromes, which increases the danger of being overtaken by various diseases including CVD, diabetes, dyslipidemia, stroke, osteoarthritis, some type of cancers and mortality. MetS imposes heavy expenses to sanitary therapeutic system and it generally reduces life quality. In fact, insulin resistance and central obesity are considered the main causes of MetS. In addition, its appear that demographic, lifestyle, and social factors are affecting MetS. Indeed, it has been reported that cigarette consumption and high body mass view are among independent and amendable risk factors for MetS. Nowadays, recognition of considerable challenges related to obesity and its therapeutic solutions all over the lifetime have resulted in great efforts spent toward obesity inhibition. Furthermore, doing regular athletic activities and consuming the antioxidants are among the advised solutions, which are not only affecting the total safety of body, but also affect brain performance. Some of previous studies have reported that people who experience delayed performance physically showed improvement with supervised physical fitness exercises, and the health of people suffering from metabolic diseases improved with an increase in antioxidant intake into their system. Antioxidant supplementations especially vitamin C relieve the body off the stress associated with MetS and vitamin D increase the antioxidant capacity. Some of previous studies show a significant relationship between the amount of vitamin D intake and muscle fatigue; supplements are likely to improve the muscle fatigue through the biological roles that these nutrients play. A change in vitamin D from the normal range alters the muscle performance and activity significantly, especially when exercises of different intensities are involved. Elsewhere studies have reported a reduction of death with frequent intake of vitamin D as well as engaging in aerobic exercises. Regarding the relation between serum level of vitamin D and MetS components, different studies have been accomplished in some of which this relation has been confirmed. It has been shown that low level of serum vitamin D has inverse relation with weight gain, body mass index (BMI), but it does not have significant relation with other components of MetS. Accumulating literature also link vitamin D studies with bones while comparing BMI and general weight gains. On the other hand, vitamin C however, has completely different functions in an in vitro experiments and in humans; some previous studies show that, the metabolism of glucose in the insulin resistant people was improved, and the blood pressure was lowered in patients who took vitamin C supplementation. Furthermore, vitamin C and vitamin E supplementation are shown to prevent molecular regulators that trigger the sensitivity of insulin as well antioxidant defense mechanisms through physical activities. Moreover, endurance exercises produce reactive nitrogen and oxygen through the mitochondria. Physical exercises on a regular basis promote the health of the individuals and its play a vital role in treating MetS patients. In conclusion, the prevalence of MetS is raising worldwide. In addition, vitamin D and vitamin C levels have inverse relation with some of the MetS components such as (BMI, insulin resistant, and high blood pressure), and they are used as antioxidant supplements during enduring metabolic activities. Therefore, understanding the association between the effects of vitamin D and vitamin C supplementations with and without endurance physical activity (PA) on various components of MetS may be helpful in reducing MetS-related premature mortality and improve life quality among MetS patients. Our study was conducted to examine the effects of vitamin D and vitamin C supplementations with and without endurance PA on various components of MetS among MetS patients.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113jFo4a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Committee conclusions

Our systematic review suggests that serum hypercalcemia will be detected in 6% of patients with sarcoidosis who undergo routine serum calcium testing; nearly half will develop renal failure. Our systematic review did not target treatment of sarcoidosis-related hypercalcemia, and, therefore, better evidence about treatment may exist. However, according to the committee's clinical experience and our systematic review, hypercalcemia improves or resolves in more than 90% of patients who are treated with immune suppression. In contrast, once hypercalcemia-induced renal failure is established, chronic renal impairment is common, despite immune suppression. The committee concluded that, despite the low prevalence of hypercalcemia, the accessibility of a nonburdensome test, coupled with the opportunity to intervene before the development of irreversible consequences, warrants baseline testing, and annual screening thereafter (Table 5). In addition, the committee determined that a strong recommendation for initial screening was indicated, despite the very low quality of evidence, because the importance of the potential benefits of early detection of hypercalcemia (i.e. the prevention of irreversible kidney disease) substantially outweighs the harms, burdens, and costs of testing.

The committee noted that data to support 1,25-(OH) 2 vitamin D testing for abnormal calcium metabolism was neither extensively studied nor supported by the systematic review, although it was recognized that there may be other reasons for 1,25-(OH) 2 vitamin D testing in patients with sarcoidosis. For example, it has been hypothesized that 1,25-(OH) 2 vitamin D may be a biomarker of granulomatous burden, with one study reporting an association between disease chronicity and 1,25-(OH) 2 vitamin D levels. A comprehensive discussion of alternative reasons for 1,25-(OH) 2 vitamin D testing is beyond the scope of this guideline, but is provided elsewhere. Testing of 25-(OH) vitamin D levels is often undertaken in the primary care setting, and may be useful in conjunction with 1,25-(OH) 2 vitamin D levels in a subset of patients with sarcoidosis, such as those with severe fatigue or exposed to chronic corticosteroids, for whom vitamin D repletion may be beneficial.

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with myasthenia gravis and improvement of fatigue after supplementation of vitamin D3: a pilot study [^115MJgFV]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorder. Vitamin D has important roles both in the autoimmune response and in skeletal muscles. We determined the levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] in patients with MG and in healthy subjects to determine whether vitamin D deficiency is present in MG and whether vitamin D supplementation has beneficial effects on fatigue.

Methods

Plasma levels of 25(OH)D were analyzed in 33 patients with MG (22 males; mean age, 58 years) and in 50 healthy age- and sex-matched blood donors, without vitamin D3 medication. MG composite (MGC) score assessed fatigue. Thirteen patients with MG without previous vitamin D3 supplementation were started on vitamin D3 supplementation (cholecalciferol) 800 IU/day, with a follow-up examination after 2.5–10 months (mean, 6 months).

Results

Patients with MG without pre-existing vitamin D3 supplementation (N = 16) had a mean MGC of 4.5 and lower plasma 25(OH)D levels (mean, 51 ± 19 nM) than healthy controls (69 ± 21 nM) (P = 0.017). Seventeen patients had pre-existing vitamin D3 supplementation, because of corticosteroid treatment, and their mean 25(OH)D was 79 ± 22 nM and mean MGC was 5.5. In the 13 patients who received cholecalciferol, 25(OH)D was overall increased at follow-up with 22% (P = 0.033) and MGC score improved by 38% (P = 0.05).

Conclusions

Plasma 25(OH)D levels are significantly lower in patients with MG compared with healthy controls. As vitamin D has beneficial effects on the autoimmune response and on fatigue score in patients with MG, we suggest monitoring this parameter in patients with MG and supplementation with vitamin D3 when 25(OH)D levels are low.

### Effects of diet on the outcomes of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs): systematic review and meta-analyses informing the 2021 EULAR recommendations for lifestyle improvements in people with RMDs [^117EjCEW]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Vitamins

One meta-analysis, six RCTs, one non-randomised trialand two single arm studiesassessed vitamin supplementation in RA. One meta-analysisreported no significant effect of vitamin D supplementation on pain (MD 2.79, 95% CI −1.87 to 7.44) and disease activity (MD −0.31, 95% CI −0.86 to 0.25). Two RCTs reported inconsistent effects on pain, function and disease activity. Two RCTs studied vitamin B6, with onereporting no significant effect on disease activity, swollen/tender joint count and acute phase reactants, and the otherreporting no effect on CRP. One RCTassessing vitamin E reported a large effect on pain, but no effect on swollen/tender joint counts and morning stiffness. Another RCTreported no effect of vitamin E on acute phase reactants (online supplemental tables 99–104).

Summary

The evidence for most dietary exposures in RA was graded as low or very low (table 2), primarily due to small numbers of studies with small sample sizes. The dietary exposures with moderate quality evidence (probiotics, vitamin D, fish oil/omega-3) showed either no effect or effect sizes that are probably not clinically significant.

Animal products

One systematic review, six RCTsand one non-randomised trialassessed fish oil/omega-3 for SLE. Two out of three studies included in the systematic reviewreported reductions in disease activity following omega-3 intervention. The largest RCT reported no difference in disease activity between omega-3 and placebo. Another RCT reported reductions in disease activity in the fish group from baseline and no reduction in the placebo group, but did not compare the two groups. One other RCTreported large effects on pain and function following omega-3 intervention, but no effect on fatigue. Two RCTs reported no effect of omega-3 on CRP(online supplemental tables 105–107).

Experimental diets

Three systematic reviewsidentified one RCTcomparing a low glycaemic diet with a low calorie diet, concluding no effect on disease activity or fatigue. An RCTreported a large effect of a cholesterol lowering educational programme on QoL compared with no advice (online supplemental tables 108–110).

### Indications for the evaluation and supplementation of hypophosphatemia: an umbrella systematic review of reviews and guidelines [^1174xKUL]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, the most common causes of acute hypophosphatemia are transient and rarely need treatment, except for severe or moderate symptomatic hypophosphatemia. In patients at risk of refeeding syndrome and nutrition initiation, supplementation is warranted at higher phosphate levels to prevent symptomatic hypophosphatemia.

Several drugs can cause hypophosphatemia, most commonly through renal phosphate loss. Notably, the iron infusion preparation FCM has been shown to cause hypophosphatemia, ranging from acute life-threatening symptoms to osteomalacia. FCM leads to a 3–sixfold increase in FGF-23, which in turn leads to an increase in urinary phosphate excretion, thus potentially causing acute hypophosphatemia. Especially with repeat infusions and undetected hypophosphatemia, the risk for chronic hypophosphatemia and, accordingly, osteomalacia increases. It is currently unknown why other iron preparations do not lead to the same extent of increase in FGF-23, although it is important to note that other iron infusions such as ferric derisomaltose and ferrumoxytol can also lead to hypophosphatemia, albeit less commonly and less severely. In the included works, recommendations for phosphate testing differ from universal screening before FCM infusions to screening in those with repeat infusions and those with musculoskeletal symptoms and ongoing fatigue after infusion. Due to the described data and recent emerging data from clinical trials, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has adjusted its warning label for FCM infusions in November 2024 to recommend testing for hypophosphatemia in patients at risk for low serum phosphate who require a repeat course of treatment or for any patient who receives a repeat course of treatment within 3 months. Risk factors for low serum phosphate include a history of gastrointestinal disorders associated with malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins or phosphate, concurrent or prior use of medications that affect proximal renal tubular function, hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, and malnutrition. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also includes a warning on hypophosphatemic osteomalacia in their Summary of Product Characteristics for FMC infusions, stating the need for phosphate testing in patients with multiple administrations at higher doses or long-term treatment, and those with existing risk factors for hypophosphatemia, as well as patients with worsening fatigue, myalgias, or bone pain. Since elevated FGF-23 underlies the disorder, phosphate supplementation is not expected to sustainably correct hypophosphatemia, thus the most common treatment recommendation was to discontinue or, if not possible, switch iron preparations. TDF, which is used to treat hepatitis B and HIV, can cause tubular kidney dysfunction and thus lead to hypophosphatemia, which is why older reviews recommend regular phosphate testing for all patients treated with TDF. However, studies, mainly in patients with HIV, have shown that it is a rare complication, and in newer HIV guidelines, testing is recommended only in the case of certain prompts, such as preexisting CKD, worsening GFR, or proteinuria. These recommendations can probably be used for patients with hepatitis B as well. Notably, these conditions disproportionately affect low-income countries, where resources can influence monitoring strategies. Other drugs known to cause hypophosphatemia include mTOR inhibitors, aluminum-based antacids (if taken in large quantities over a longer period of time, as they bind to phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (particularly imatinib) and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors. However, we found no recommendations on when to evaluate for hypophosphatemia in these medications.

### Chronic fatigue in cancer survivorship: psychiatry versus oncology or psychiatry with oncology? [^114egYS6]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Another area of interest has been anti-inflammatory therapies. Given the link between inflammation and CRF, some studies have explored whether anti-inflammatory drugs or cytokine inhibitors could alleviate fatigue. Small trials of NSAIDs or Cox-2 inhibitors have not shown clear benefits for CRF specifically. More targeted approaches, like blocking IL-1 or TNF-alpha, are still experimental. One pilot trial tested an etanercept (TNF blocker) in cancer patients with fatigue, but results were limited to patients actively receiving chemotherapy. Ongoing research is examining if agents like exercise mimetics or metabolic modulators (for example, a trial of the metabolic drug DCA – dichloroacetate – was investigated in a mouse model and showed reduced fatigue behaviour​) could play a role in the future, though none are clinically available yet for fatigue. Nutritional supplements have also been studied – notably L-carnitine (an amino acid involved in mitochondrial energy production) was hypothesized to help, but a large placebo-controlled trial found no improvement in fatigue with L-carnitine supplementation. Vitamin D correction is important for bone health, but high-dose vitamin D did not show a fatigue benefit beyond treating deficiency. Herbal therapies like American ginseng have shown some efficacy in trials (a Mayo Clinic-led RCT found 2000 mg daily of Wisconsin ginseng improved fatigue over placebo), and a meta-analysis suggested ginseng can yield modest fatigue reduction. However, results are inconsistent (another trial of Asian ginseng was negative), and herbal supplements vary in quality; thus, they are not part of mainstream guidelines.

### The effects of vitamin D supplementation on frailty in older adults at risk for falls [^114frPan]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

There are several potential mechanisms that may underly the relationship between vitamin D and frailty. Muscle function may be one of the pathways linking vitamin D to frailty. A number of clinical trials have found that older adults undergoing vitamin D3 treatment, particularly with daily doses of 800 to1000IU, had increased lower extremity muscle strength. Another potential pathway from vitamin D to frailty might be fatigue. Although there was insufficient evidence pointing to the beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation on preventing tiredness or fatigue in general populations, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) found that vitamin D treatment significantly reduced the risk of fatigue in adults with vitamin D deficiency. However, we did not find similar significant associations between 1000 IU/d dose of vitamin D supplementation and frailty or its individual criteria among those with vitamin D deficiency. It is possible that vitamin D deficiency is a symptom of a state of physiologic dysregulation requiring more than supplementation to correct. In addition, the small number of participants with vitamin D deficiency at baseline makes it difficult to disentangle the association between serum vitamin D and frailty and its individual criteria.

Several studies have raised the concern of the potential harmful effects of high vitamin D doses. Consistent with the STURDY main findings, where greater fall rates and fall-related factures were noted in the 2000 IU/d dose group, our data showed an unfavorable effect of 2000 IU/d dose on risk of worsening frailty status. Some evidence suggests a U-shaped relationship between serum 25(OH)D level and risk of adverse health outcomes such as cardiovascular diseases. A clinical trial reported decreased lower extremity muscle strength among community-dwelling postmenopausal women with low serum 25(OH)D level (< 50 nmol/L) taking 2800 IU/d of vitamin D3 supplementation compared to placebo. Our study only recruited participants with low serum 25(OH)D level (< 30 ng/mL) at baseline. The main reasons for low vitamin D levels could be low dietary intake of vitamin D or lack of exposure to natural sunlight. Other factors such as health conditions that affect absorption or metabolism of vitamin D or certain medication use may also contribute to this diminished state. Further, these participants represent a group of older persons with low functioning and high risk for falls, who may likely remain at high risk of negative health outcomes regardless of vitamin D supplementation.

### Safety and tolerability of high-dose daily vitamin dsupplementation in the vitamin D and type 2 diabetes (D2d) study-a randomized trial in persons with prediabetes [^116QBsek]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Participants were asked to contact site staff to report the occurrence of a kidney stone and were additionally specifically queried about kidney stones at each contact (phone or in-person visit). All reports of kidney stone were included in the nephrolithiasis outcome and participants reporting a kidney stone were instructed to discontinue study pills. If available, medical records related to nephrolithiasis were collected and then adjudicated by the study's safety and outcomes subcommittee. For all of the above key protocol-specified AEs of interest where study pills were stopped per protocol, the pills were discontinued without unmasking participants or study staff, and participants continued in the study and completed all subsequent planned visits and measurements including collection of the primary outcome and safety assessment.

The D2d study did not specifically query the participants regarding falls using a validated questionnaire, but injuries and musculoskeletal events were self-reported by participants and were included in the overall assessment of safety.

Additional protocol-specified AEs of interest reported in this analysis were potentially related to the study pills and included polyuria, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, metallic taste, hyperphosphatemia, anemia, weakness, fatigue, insomnia, and headache (all self-reported).

Participants could request to discontinue study pills at any point and for any reason. Participants who discontinued the study pills regardless of reason (AE or personal choice) were followed for the efficacy outcome per intent-to-treat principle.

Laboratory testing

Serum calcium and creatinine were analyzed locally at each site, and eGFR was calculated centrally using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation adjusted for race, as the formula was commonly applied when the study was conducted. Other blood and urine specimens (including for calcium-to-creatinine ratio) were shipped to the central laboratory at baseline and during follow up. Serum total 25(OH)D, which includes total 25(OH)D 3 and total 25(OH)D 2, from stored frozen fasting serum samples from the baseline and annual visits, was measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry with calibrators that are traceable to the National Bureau of Standards and Technology and validated by quarterly proficiency testing program administered by the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment scheme (DEQAS, United Kingdom). The D2d study did not measure free 25(OH)D 3 or free 25(OH)D 2 levels.

### Evaluation of vitamin-D status and its association with clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients in Pakistan [^115buwyy]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Majority of our study population had insufficient 25(OH)D levels. Overall 25(OH)D mean (SD) concentrations of all patients in this study were 21.4 (10.3) ng/mL with 20% (18/91) had deficient levels, 57% (52/91) had insufficient levels, while 23% (21/91) had sufficient levels. The study population comprised 68.1% males (N = 62). The mean (SD) age was 52.6 (15.7) years. Of the cases 69.2% were managed in isolation wards and the remaining in intensive care units (ICUs). In addition, 20.9% of patients died during hospital stay as demonstrated in Table 1. Based on cox univariate analysis, vitamin D deficient patients were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (HR: 3.20; P = 0.048), invasive ventilation (HR: 2.78; P = 0.043), persistent pulmonary infiltrates (HR: 7.58; P < 0.001), and death (HR: 2.98; P < 0.001) as shown in Table 2. On multivariate cox regression, only death (HR: 2.13; P = 0.046) and persistent pulmonary infiltrates (HR: 6.78; P = 0.009) remain significant after adjustment of confounding factors. The majority of the population presented with fever 79.12% (N = 72) and dry cough 75.82% (N = 69) as shown in. There was a higher prevalence of symptoms among patients with 25(OH)D < 10 ng/mL in comparison to those with 25(OH)D ≥ 10 ng/mL, including cough with sputum (38.9% [N = 7/18] versus 13.7% [N = 10/73]; P = 0.022), dyspnea/shortness of breath (72.2% [13/18] versus 35.6% [26/73]; P = 0.005), fatigue (55.6% [10/18] versus 26.0% [19/73]; P = 0.016), nasal congestion/rhinorrhea (38.9% [7/18] versus 13.7% [10/73]; P = 0.022), diarrhea (38.9% [7/18] versus 15.1% [11/73]; P = 0.043), anosmia (22.2% [4/18] versus 5.5% [4/73]; P = 0.046), and malaise (50% [9/18] versus 17.8% [13/73]; P = 0.007). Patients with 25(OH)D < 10 ng/mL also exhibited increased length of hospital stay (10.61 ± 6.06 versus 7.36 ± 5.71 days; P = 0.040), were more likely to be intubated (33.3% [6/18] versus 6.8% [5/73]; P = 0.007), suffered from ARDS (22.2% [4/18] versus 4.1% [3/73]; P = 0.026) than those with 25(OH)D ≥ 10 ng/mL.

### Vitamin D improves selected metabolic parameters but not neuropsychological or quality of life indices in OSA: a pilot study [^116bDJQj]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Our group and others have reported a high rate of vitamin D deficiency in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), where vitamin D levels (25(OH) D) correlate negatively with OSA severity and some of its associated metabolic alterations. Data regarding vitamin D supplementation in OSA are lacking. We wanted to evaluate the effect of vitamin D 3 supplementation on OSA symptoms and metabolic parameters.

Methods

We conducted a pilot, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of daily supplementation with 4,000 IU vitamin D 3 (D3) or placebo (PL). We studied 19 Caucasian adults (14 male, mean age 55 y, mean body mass index [BMI] 30.4 kg/m 2) with OSA. Fifteen patients were stable on continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) therapy, whereas four were CPAP naïve. Assessments were completed at baseline and after 15 weeks of supplementation. Outcomes included sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), quality of life (Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Inventory), fatigue (fatigue severity scale) and neuropsychological function (trail making test and Connor's Continuous Performance Test II). In addition, we assessed biochemical indices of vitamin D status (25(OH)D, calcium), inflammation (high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2), lipids (total cholesterol [low-density and high-density lipoprotein]) and glycemic indices (fasting glucose, oral glucose tolerance test).

Results

There was no change in BMI, medication, or CPAP usage. Although there was no change in neuropsychological or quality of life indices, we observed a significant increase in 25(OH)D (p = 0.00001) and significant decreases in both low-density lipoprotein (p = 0.04) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (p = 0.037) as well as trends toward decreased fasting glucose (p = 0.09) and increased high-density lipoprotein (p = 0.07) in the D 3 group compared to PL.

Conclusions

Vitamin D 3 supplementation increased vitamin D levels and decreased metabolic markers compared to placebo. Larger trials are required.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^113WGXTh]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Treatment: case 1

She tried various alternative treatments with little improvement. She improved slightly while taking antibiotic combinations including phenoxymethylpenicillin and azithromycin for a year in 2006 but relapsed rapidly on stopping them. She was started on oral vitamin D supplementation in 2009, although this did not improve her symptoms of fatigue. As she has had polymorphic light eruption since her midteens, she remains on colecalciferol 20 000 IU every 2 weeks and now has normal vitamin D levels.

In 2010, she was prescribed LDN, initially at 1.5 mg, slowly increasing the dose over 2 years. She noticed slightly increased energy and reduced food intolerances while taking 4.5 mg/day but needed to reduce the dose to 3 mg due to increased headaches. Ten months later, she started increasing the dose again without recurrence of symptoms, and subsequent stepped dose increases coincided with further improvements in energy, mood and pain. At 9 mg, the frequent episodes of abdominal pain subsided, and she started eating a full diet, including wheat and dairy. Her prescribing doctor suggested experimenting to find the optimum dose of LDN, and after increasing to 7.5 mg two times per day, she settled on 6 mg two times per day, which she has taken for the past 7 years.

### Low vitamin D status is an independent predictor of increased frailty and all-cause mortality in older men: the health in men study [^113GVjMo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context and Objective

Hypovitaminosis D and frailty are common in the older population. We aimed to determine whether 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations are associated with frailty and mortality.

Design

We conducted a prospective cohort study.

Setting and Participants

Participants included 4203 older men aged 70–88 years in Perth, Western Australia.

Main Outcome Measures

25(OH)D was measured by immunoassay. Frailty was assessed with the 5-point FRAIL (fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness, and loss of weight) scale. Mortality was determined from the death registry via the Western Australian Data Linkage System.

Results

At baseline, 676 (16.1%) men were frail, as defined by having ≥ 3 deficits (FRAIL scale ≥ 3). In multivariate cross-sectional analysis, low vitamin D status, defined by the lowest quartile of 25(OH)D values (< 52.9 nmol/L), was associated with increased prevalent frailty (odds ratio, 1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.52 to 2.52) in comparison to the highest quartile of 25(OH)D values (> 81.6 nmol/L). After a mean period of 5.3 years, the adjusted odds ratio of being frail at follow-up for men with low vitamin D and having zero deficit at baseline (FRAIL scale = 0) was 1.56 (95% CI, 1.07 to 2.27). Low vitamin D also predicted all-cause mortality over a period of up to 9.2 years (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.42), independent of baseline frailty and other covariates.

Conclusion

Hypovitaminosis D is associated with prevalent and incident frailty in older men. Hypovitaminosis D also predicts all-cause mortality, independent of frailty. The association between vitamin D and mortality is not solely dependent on the occurrence of frailty.

### Status of vitamin D and parameters of calcium homeostasis in renal transplant recipients in Nepal: a cross sectional study [^111kT3Eh]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Hypovitaminosis D and its correction might be very relevant to RTRs for several reasons. The deficiency status may causeclinical symptoms such as myopathy, fatigue, muscle and bone pain. The recipients may be exposed to higher risk of bone resorption and fractures, which are further complicated by glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. A follow up study evaluating the long term implications of vitamin D deficiency in 435 stable RTRs showed low 25(OH) D levels independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and severe deficiency, in particular, associated with a rapid annual eGFR decline. Preclinical researches have shown promising outcome of VDR agonists, promoting innate immunity (thereby improving the ability of the host to combat invading pathogens) and preventing chronic allograft rejection by facilitating tolerance induction, which so far, remains an important unmet problem in RTRs. Recently, vitamin D supplementation has been suggested in the treatment of kidney transplant bone disease and also in post-transplant fatigue, that might improve their quality of life.

Hypovitaminosis D tends to be overlooked, in both CKD patients and RTRs, who are treated only with alphacalcidiol by a lot of physicians. It has to be borne in mind that adequate serum 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 is not a substitute for inadequate serum 25(OH) D as it has negative effect on the extra-renal, locally regulated synthesis of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3. Effective dietary vitamin D sources are very scarce and therefore, prudent exposure to sunlight and vitamin D supplementation (taking into consideration the difference in biological potency between available vitamin D 2 and D 3 supplements) seems to be the only feasible means to improve and correct vitamin D deficiency status in Nepalese RTRs. The optimization of supplementation however should be guided by serum 25(OH) D and other calcemic parameters because vitamin D excess may lead to hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and hypercalciuria, all of which has inverse relationship with graft function. A recent study in UK has concluded vitamin D repletion (using a 6 month bolus intermediate dose schedule) to be safe and effective in stable RTRs, however the post-repletion fall in vitamin D status in the absence of maintenance supplementation was intriguing. Further interventional studies are warranted to explore the implications of low vitamin D status in Nepalese RTR population and whether supplementation is really beneficial and is able to sustain the vitamin D status when coupled with sensible sun exposure.

### Oncogenic osteomalacia from a primary phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor of the toe: a case report [^112xZXyZ]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Oncogenic osteomalacia is an acquired, rare paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by renal phosphate wasting and subsequent hypophosphatemic osteomalacia. The condition is usually associated with a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor, which produces fibroblast growth factor 23, the primary circulating factor responsible for reduced tubular phosphate reabsorption. Clinically, adult patients typically present with bone pain, myalgia, recurrent and/or multiple stress fractures, and fatigue, with serum levels typified by low 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3, increased alkaline phosphatase, and normal calcium, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, 25-OH-vitamin D3, and 25,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 levels. The tumor in question is typically benign and can be of little clinical significance apart from its role in causing hypophosphatemic osteomalacia. Detection of the tumor, therefore, can often be delayed and requires an astute index of suspicion.

### Gastric cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1139aXp5]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Gastric Cancer Version 3.2025 — survivorship symptom management — common issues include weight loss, diarrhea, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, and fatigue. Weight loss and fatigue can be effectively managed by monitoring patients' weight regularly, encouraging more frequent consumption of smaller meals without fluid intake, and encouraging physical activity and energy conservation measures. Anti-diarrheal medications, bulk-forming agents, or diet manipulation can be considered to treat diarrhea. Duloxetine can be considered to treat painful chemotherapy-induced neuropathy but is ineffective for numbness or tingling, and referral to occupational, rehabilitation, and/or physical therapy should be considered for patients with chemotherapy-induced neuropathy who are at risk for falls. Osteopenia/osteoporosis caused by deficiencies in vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, and other vitamins and minerals is another common long-term sequelae; supplementation with vitamin D has been shown to improve bone health, and bone density should be screened at regular intervals with low bone density managed as per established national guidelines.

### Obesity affects disease activity and progression, cognitive functioning, and quality of life in people with multiple sclerosis [^117D55Z3]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Obesity in participants with MS was associated with higher disease activity, worse health-related quality of life, and lower cognitive functioning. Both overweight and obesity were associated with higher MRI activity. Furthermore, obesity was associated with lower general health and a higher degree of fatigue and pain.

Previous studies on the influence of BMI on MS-specific outcomes have been conflicting. The inconclusive findings may be due to small sample sizes, short follow-up durations, and variation between studies regarding methodology and outcome measures. Our study comprised incident cases of MS from a large population-based case-control study. We followed the patients for up to 15 years after baseline and had the opportunity to take several potential confounding variables into consideration, such as physical activity, sun exposure habits, vitamin D levels, and smoking.

How obesity may affect disease progression and cognitive functioning in MS is not well understood; however, several hypothesized interrelated mechanisms have been identified. Obesity induces a state of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and local inflammation in the brain, which may contribute to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Epigenetic modifications induced by obesity may also adversely affect disability and progression in MS.

Total body fat is inversely related to circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and obesity leads to decreased bioavailability of vitamin D. An inverse correlation between BMI and vitamin D levels was also observed in our study. Low vitamin D levels have been associated with both disability and cognitive impairment in patients with MS. Supplementation with vitamin D has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties after traumatic brain injury, and a recent study indicated that vitamin D supplementation might have a beneficial influence on cognitive function in MS.

### Resolution of hypersomnia following identification and treatment of vitamin D deficiency [^115gT73v]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

A 28-year-old woman was evaluated for 4 months of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), after an overnight polysomnogram (PSG) revealed neither sleep disordered breathing nor a sleep related movement disorder. A full sleep evaluation revealed the presence of heavy daytime napping and pervasive fatigue. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Score was 10/24. No features characteristic for depression or narcolepsy were present. Chronic pain in the low back and thighs, as well as chronic daily headaches were identified as potential sleep-disrupting forces. Risk factors for hypovitaminosis D included limited natural sun exposure, dark skin tone, and obesity. A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was low, at 5.9 ng/mL. Vitamin D supplementation was initiated at a dose of 50,000 IU once weekly, and EDS improved within 2 weeks. One week later, a PSG with next-day multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) failed to show significant pathology. At follow-up, she reported resolution of thigh pain and headaches, with a significant improvement in her low back pain syndrome. EDS had resolved, and her ESS score was 1/24. Follow-up 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was normal at 39 ng/mL. Mechanisms for her clinical improvement could include enhanced sleep quality due to resolution of hypovitaminosis D-associated noninflammatory myopathy, or a possible immunomodulatory effect of vitamin D decreasing central nervous system (CNS) homeostatic sleep pressure via its effects on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and/or prostaglandin D2. More research is needed to determine if patients presenting with EDS should be more broadly screened for vitamin D deficiency.

### Low vitamin D levels are associated with long COVID syndrome in COVID-19 survivors [^117FTC6L]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Due to the well-known extraskeletal role of vitamin D in regulating immune response and immunocompetence and the consistently reported positive effects on musculoskeletal, neurocognitive, metabolic, and cardiorespiratory health areas, a possible role of vitamin D in recovery of COVID-19 survivors was also hypothesized.

This hypothesis is firstly supported by the observed lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels reported among 120 not-hospitalized young COVID-19 survivors 3 months after acute disease compared with matched healthy participants. COVID-19 survivors were also characterized by higher inflammatory markers and therefore reverse causality could not be excluded. Later studies have subsequently investigated the effect of vitamin D on the risk of the presence of persistent symptoms in these patients, reporting, to date, contrasting results.

Townsend et al investigated the relationship between vitamin D and fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance in a total of 149 patients recruited at a median of 79 days after COVID-19 illness. The median vitamin D level was 62 nmol/L (about 24 ng/dL), higher than the levels observed in our cohort in which, differently from the study conducted by Townsend et al, we excluded those with vitamin D supplementation, and fatigue was very common (58%), possibly related to the short-term follow-up visits and to the inclusion in the study also of those who were previously admitted to the ICU. The authors reported no significant relationships between vitamin D status and any of the physical performance outcomes assessed. A later pilot clinical trial aimed at analyzing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on muscle fitness in 30 elderly patients during the recovery phase after SARS-CoV-2 infection has reported that treatment with cholecalciferol (2000 IU/day) vs placebo carried out for 6 weeks was associated with a reduction of serum creatine kinase levels and with slight nonsignificant improvements in physical tests. An Egyptian cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in post-COVID-19 patients and its relation to persistent symptoms included 219 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses in the previous 3 months and who were mostly managed at home during the acute clinical course. The authors evaluated different symptom categories, including constitutional, respiratory, neuropsychiatric, and gastrointestinal areas, and reported no differences among vitamin D status and these symptoms, although only 16% of the entire cohort presented with not-deficient vitamin D levels. A recent study conducted in an Italian center aimed to determine the relationship between vitamin D status and physical performance including a sample of recovered patients, both hospitalized and not hospitalized, with a mean age of 53 years and re-evaluated in a post-acute outpatient service about 3 months after COVID-19 diagnosis. Vitamin D deficiency was detected in 35.6% of participants, with a higher prevalence in men than in women, similarly to our data. The authors reported that patients with vitamin D deficiency performed worse on the 6-minute walking test, particularly in those older than 65 years. Finally, in a very recent interventional clinical trial including patients receiving a single dose of 200 000 IU of vitamin D3 or placebo at the time of hospital admission for acute COVID-19 and re-evaluated by telephone interviews at 6 months and 1 year after hospital discharge, no significant differences between vitamin D-treated and placebo groups were observed for the different constitutional and respiratory post-COVID-19 symptoms. The authors concluded that the use of vitamin D supplementation was not useful for the management of post-COVID-19 symptoms. In this study, no data regarding 25(OH) vitamin D levels after supplementation was reported, both during hospitalization and during follow-up; moreover, at baseline, both vitamin D–treated and placebo groups presented median vitamin D levels around 21 ng/mL, reducing the potential beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation in a population yet to be characterized by a not-deficient vitamin D status; finally, the study did not rule out the possibility that intermediate doses of vitamin D administered during follow-up, and not tested, could modify the clinical course of these patients.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^116eMV9u]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Vitamin D supplementation in statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) is discussed with proposed repletion targets but limited trial support, noting that higher doses (50,000–100,000 units per week) aim for on-treatment levels of 50–80 ng/mL; however, to date there has not been evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that vitamin D prevents SAMS or reduces symptom severity, and while it may be reasonable to check vitamin D levels and initiate supplementation if deficiency is identified, a well-designed RCT is still needed before any recommendations can be made about routine vitamin D measurement or treatment in those with SAMS and low vitamin D levels.

Endocrine Practice (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, AACE/ACE/OS 2013 guidelines recommend to prescribe vitamin D supplementation of at least 1,000–2,000 IU of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 daily in most patients, to keep the plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D level > 30 ng/mL.

### Athletic performance and vitamin D [^116RbCCU]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Activated vitamin D (calcitriol) is a pluripotent pleiotropic secosteroid hormone. As a steroid hormone, which regulates more than 1000 vitamin D-responsive human genes, calcitriol may influence athletic performance. Recent research indicates that intracellular calcitriol levels in numerous human tissues, including nerve and muscle tissue, are increased when inputs of its substrate, the prehormone vitamin D, are increased.

Methods

We reviewed the world's literature for evidence that vitamin D affects physical and athletic performance.

Results

Numerous studies, particularly in the German literature in the 1950s, show vitamin D-producing ultraviolet light improves athletic performance. Furthermore, a consistent literature indicates physical and athletic performance is seasonal; it peaks when 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels peak, declines as they decline, and reaches its nadir when 25(OH)D levels are at their lowest. Vitamin D also increases the size and number of Type II (fast twitch) muscle fibers. Most cross-sectional studies show that 25(OH)D levels are directly associated with musculoskeletal performance in older individuals. Most randomized controlled trials, again mostly in older individuals, show that vitamin D improves physical performance.

Conclusions

Vitamin D may improve athletic performance in vitamin D-deficient athletes. Peak athletic performance may occur when 25(OH)D levels approach those obtained by natural, full-body, summer sun exposure, which is at least 50 ng x mL(-1). Such 25(OH)D levels may also protect the athlete from several acute and chronic medical conditions.

### The influence of vitamin D on postpartum relapse and quality of life in pregnant multiple sclerosis patients [^115yi2M9]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

In relapsing-remitting MS patients, lower serum vitamin D concentrations are associated with higher relapse risk. In a number of conditions, low vitamin D has been associated with fatigue. Pregnant women are at particular risk for vitamin D insufficiency. Our objective was to investigate whether vitamin D status is associated with postpartum relapse and quality of life during pregnancy.

Methods

Forty-three pregnant relapsing-remitting MS patients and 21 pregnant controls were seen at regular times before, during and after pregnancy. At every clinical assessment visit, samples for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) measurements and quality of life questionnaires were taken.

Results

Lower 25(OH)D concentrations were not associated with postpartum relapse risk. Pregnancy 25(OH)D levels of patients and controls were not significantly different. In controls, but not patients, higher 25(OH)D concentrations were correlated with better general health, social functioning and mental health, but not with vitality.

Conclusion

Low vitamin D levels are not associated with postpartum relapse. In pregnant MS patients, vitamin D levels are similar to levels in healthy women and are not associated with quality of life. Therefore, with regard to quality of life and postpartum relapse, no arguments were found for advising pregnant MS patients to take more vitamin D supplements than healthy women.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines for management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^114ec7fq]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — supplement-based prophylaxis: Riboflavin has "moderate certainty evidence largely from pediatric migraine for a net health benefit" and its "balance of moderate effects and trivial harm along with low costs warrants a time-limited trial (e.g., 3–6 months), followed by re-evaluation of efficacy", while magnesium has "very low certainty evidence" but "the trivial harm and small desirable effects may warrant a time-limited trial (e.g., 3–6 months), considering the type of magnesium formulation". Vitamin D has "very low certainty evidence" and "the panel suggests the use of vitamin D mainly as an adjunct to other therapies", whereas for L-carnitine "there is insufficient evidence for formal EtD ratings… The panel noted a theoretical concern for atherosclerosis with long-term L-carnitine supplementation". Subgroup considerations specify coenzyme Q10 "may benefit patients with specific comorbidities such as chronic fatigue/poor stamina and coenzyme Q10 blood concentrations lower or those not tolerating or accepting pharmacotherapy", riboflavin that "patients with migraine-associated CVS may have greater benefit", magnesium that "patients with migraine-associated CVS may have some benefit", and vitamin D that "patients with reduced blood levels and migraine-associated CVS may benefit". Implementation suggests riboflavin "Suggested dosing: 100 mg (< 40 kg), 200 mg (≥ 40 kg) PO q 12 h" and magnesium "Suggested dosing: 9 mg/kg/day (adolescents 400 mg) PO nightly", with an emphasis that "periodic re-evaluation of the efficacy of long-term prophylactic therapies is critical" and that "the panel cautioned for variability in the quality of supplements… recommended referring to quality control programs such as the United States Pharmacopeia".

### Vitamin D and central hypersensitivity in patients with chronic pain [^114pX1FF]. Pain Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Low vitamin D is implicated in various chronic pain conditions with, however, inconclusive findings. Vitamin D might play an important role in mechanisms being involved in central processing of evoked pain stimuli but less so for spontaneous clinical pain.

Objective

This study aims to examine the relation between low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OH D) and mechanical pain sensitivity.

Design

We studied 174 patients (mean age 48 years, 53% women) with chronic pain. A standardized pain provocation test was applied, and pain intensity was rated on a numerical analogue scale (0–10). The widespread pain index and symptom severity score (including fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive symptoms) following the 2010 American College of Rheumatology preliminary diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia were also assessed. Serum 25-OH D levels were measured with a chemiluminescent immunoassay.

Results

Vitamin deficiency (25-OH D < 50 nmol/L) was present in 71% of chronic pain patients; another 21% had insufficient vitamin D (25-OH D < 75 nmol/L). After adjustment for demographic and clinical variables, there was a mean ± standard error of the mean increase in pain intensity of 0.61 ± 0.25 for each 25 nmol/L decrease in 25-OH D (P = 0.011). Lower 25-OH D levels were also related to greater symptom severity (r = -0.21, P = 0.008) but not to the widespread pain index (P = 0.83) and fibromyalgia (P = 0.51).

Conclusions

The findings suggest a role of low vitamin D levels for heightened central sensitivity, particularly augmented pain processing upon mechanical stimulation in chronic pain patients. Vitamin D seems comparably less important for self-reports of spontaneous chronic pain.

### Bone health in juvenile idiopathic arthritis compared with controls based on a Norwegian observational study [^115MxYRS]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Many sociodemographic factors have been associated with low BMD in the general population. In contrast to our study, a Mexican study from 2022 found that the BMD in obese children was higher than in normal-weight children, possibly due to their increased lean mass. This conclusion aligns with a systematic review from 2017. Like the tendency seen worldwide and in line with WHO concerns, both children with JIA and controls in our study had a relatively high fat percentage. A higher body fat percentage in children with JIA compared with controls has previously been reported. In accordance with our results, it is well known that underweight is a risk factor for reduced BMD.

Although we found only weak associations between vitamin D, ionised calcium serum levels, inadequate intake and BMD, other studies have demonstrated more pronounced associations. A study from 2023 demonstrated a positive relationship between serum vitamin D levels and total body BMD Z-scores. An Italian study from 2014 found that children with JIA and vitamin D deficiency had lower BMD than those with normal serum vitamin D levels. In contrast to our results, they also found that children with JIA had significantly reduced vitamin D levels compared with controls. In an Indian study, low bone mass was associated with decreased dietary intake of vitamin D and calcium. The minor associations between vitamin D and BMD levels observed between JIA and controls in our study may be explained by the high prevalence of children in Norway taking cod liver oil or other vitamin D supplements.

The striking association between BMD and levels of physical activity found in our study was not unexpected. However, it was both surprising and reassuring to find that children with JIA were as physically active as children in the control group. In contrast, related studies have reported that children with JIA are less physically active than controls. In a Tunisian study from 2020, children and adolescents with JIA were less physically active than recommended from a general health perspective and less physically active than their age-matched and sex-matched controls. Physical activity restrictions were traditionally recommended for children with JIA and other rheumatic diseases. In contrast, there is now increasing evidence that physical activity can reduce pain, fatigue, muscle weakness and improve bone health. Studies also demonstrate that the benefit of physical activity clearly outweighs the risks. It has also been shown that specific exercise programmes may increase the BMD in children with JIA.

### Can clinicians and scientists explain and prevent unexplained underperformance syndrome in elite athletes: an interdisciplinary perspective and 2016 update [^116G8Yxe]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Inflammation, oxidative stress (OS) and alterations in redox homoeostasis (ARH) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of OTS, with ARH reported in athletes diagnosed with OTS. In chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS; a conditioned likened to OTS), OS is associated with the degree of fatigue at rest and postexercise, with several studies demonstrating increased OS in CFS versus healthy controls.CFS can be said to represent the extreme end of the OTS continuum. In well-trained athletes, the short-term (2 weeks) restriction of fruit and vegetable intake (ie, low antioxidant diet), to just one-two servings per day, results in increased OS, exercise RPE and inflammation, albeit with no change in performance. However, the lack of a significant change in performance may merely reflect the short-term nature of the studies. Polyphenols, constituents of fruit and vegetables, have been shown to attenuate OS in athletes and reduce the inflammatory response to exercise, including IL-6, improve sleep duration and quality, and enhance skeletal muscle regeneration. It is interesting to speculate that a chronic lack of sufficient dietary fruits and vegetables (recognising the vast array of different chemicals present) may lead to slower rates of skeletal muscle regeneration in the athlete, thus placing the athlete at greater risk of UUPS. It is known that the skeletal muscles of healthy endurance athletes display evidence of structural damage, while those endurance athletes diagnosed with acquired training intolerance (ie, UUPS) display significantly greater evidence still of skeletal muscle pathology. Vitamin E (α-tocopherol) is integral to skeletal muscle membrane repairwith serum vitamin E inversely associated with muscle pain thresholds generated via electrical stimulation and fatigue in CFS and healthy controls. Low dietary intakes of vitamin E are reported in some athletesbut not others, with increased postexercise red blood cell haemolysis observed in female athletes with low fat intakes and reduced serum vitamin E concentrations. A relationship with red blood cell fragility and serum vitamin E was also reported in elite male swimmers. Increased skeletal muscle uptake of vitamin E and the carotenoid β-carotene occurs with exercise, and there is evidence for specific training methodologies (ie, 18 days of live-high-train-low) impacting negatively on elite athletes antioxidant status (eg, serum vitamin E and carotenoids) in some studies, but not others; for a review see Lewis et al.

### Functional dentition is a modifier of the association between vitamin D and the frailty index among Chinese older adults: a population-based longitudinal study [^113Eu3R9]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Natural tooth number is a risk indicator of frailty as well as vitamin D. A prospective study found that one more tooth was associated with 5.0% lower odds of frailty in 237 older Mexican adults during 3 year-follow up. A longitudinal cohort study of older British men with a 3-year follow-up demonstrated that edentulous was associated with high risks of developing frailty (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.03 to 3.52). We extended previous research by examining the role of dentition status in the association between vitamin D and frailty. Our study found that participants with low plasma 25(OH) D concentrations and non-functional dentition were at a much greater risk of frailty. In addition, this joint effect was significant on the multiplicative level. Interestingly, the shape of the curve for the association between plasma vitamin D levels and frailty was significantly modified by dentition status, and vitamin D levels were not significantly associated with frailty among participants with functional dentition. Our findings suggest that dentition status may be a good marker in identifying subgroups of older adults with low vitamin D levels that are potentially more harmful. However, the causal pathway remains unclear. In this study, albumin concentrations were significantly higher in participants with functional dentition than in those with non-functional dentition (42.1 ± 4.6 g/L vs. 40.9 ± 4.4 g/L). One possible mechanism is that tooth loss leads to difficulty in chewing and fatigue, which might result in reduced consumption of fruits, vegetables, protein, and micronutrients, and increased carbohydrate intake. These changes in dietary patterns could lead to an increased risk of malnutrition that is strongly associated with frailty. An additional consideration is that the lower number of teeth may be associated with an adaptation of the diet of older people. This adaptation may represent an inadequate consumption of vitamin-D rich food. However, we did not find a significant association between vitamin D and dentition status. It is also plausible that tooth loss has adverse effects on social interaction and self-esteem, leading to frailty. Furthermore, the inverse association between plasma 25(OH) D concentration and frailty was only found in participants who had no functional dentition, is it highly possible that low plasma 25(OH) D concentration is a biomarker of deficits of other nutrients as a result of impaired functional dentition. Meanwhile, the potential influence of residual confounding could not be excluded. Taken together, functional dentition may help reduce the risk of frailty. Our results provide evidence to support simultaneous screening for vitamin D levels and dentition status in older adults.

### High doses of cholecalciferol alleviate the progression of hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD stages 3–4: results of a 12-week double-blind, randomized, controlled study [^111HtFNC]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study in CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients with SHPT, we showed that a daily high dose of oral cholecalciferol alleviates a further increase in PTH. We also demonstrate that all cholecalciferol-treated subjects become 25(OH)D sufficient after 3 months. Despite a substantial increase in 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)D there were no cases of hypercalcaemia in the treatment group. Furthermore, no differences in changes in FGF23 or urinary phosphate excretion between the groups were observed. On the other hand, we saw no effect on the patient-pertinent symptoms fatigue or hand grip strength.

At least to our knowledge, this is the first sufficiently powered study of high-dose cholecalciferol in CKD to show an effect on SHPT. Earlier smaller studies have consistently demonstrated a dose-related increase in 25(OH)D and a trend to lower PTH.

Chandra et al. performed a randomized study of 50 000 IU cholecalciferol weekly (n = 10) versus placebo (n = 10) in CKD Stages 3 and 4 subjects and reached 25(OH)D sufficiency: median (range) 124 (85–180) nmol/L, while median PTH decreased from 30 to 21 pmol/L, but there were no differences in PTH change compared with the placebo group (P = 0.14).

Rucker et al. treated 128 CKD Stages 3–5 patients, not on dialysis, with 1000 IU cholecalciferol daily or placebo for 12 weeks, and found that 25(OH)D increased significantly. Though > 50% of treated subjects reached a 25(OH)D exceeding 75 nmol/L after 12 weeks, there were no differences in PTH between groups.

### Vitamin D levels in Portuguese navy military personnel: a cross-sectional study [^1142EiMU]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Evaluate vitamin D levels in Portuguese active-duty Navy military personnel during winter and explore the relationship between Navy occupational settings and vitamin D levels, as well as between vitamin D levels and fatigue, sleep health, and burnout.

Methods

All active-duty Navy military personnel who collected a blood sample at the Naval Medicine Centre during the winter of 2023–2024 were included in a cross-sectional study. Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D), calcium, phosphorus and parathyroid hormone were added to their analysis request. They were asked to complete a questionnaire that included questions about work, sun exposure, vitamin D-rich foods and/or vitamin D supplements or medication intake, fatigue, sleep health and burnout. Blood samples were processed at the Clinical Pathology Service of the Portuguese Armed Forces Hospital. T-test/median test and z-test were applied to compare homologous means/medians and prevalences, respectively.

Results

Of the 735 participants, 42.2%, 41.1% and 16.7% were vitamin D deficient, insufficient and sufficient, respectively. The median serum 25(OH)D level was significantly lower (p < 0.001), and vitamin D deficiency prevalence was significantly higher (p = 0.000) in 'onboard' and 'indoors' groups, as well as in the 'mixed shifts' group (p = 0.030; p = 0.004). Median serum 25(OH)D level was not statistically different between groups with and without fatigue, poor sleep health, and personal or work-related burnout.

Conclusions

The high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in a sample of Portuguese active-duty Navy military personnel, during winter, especially those working onboard, indoors and with mixed shifts, must be addressed by Navy occupational health services. Future research should include submariners.

### Fibromyalgia symptom severity and psychosocial outcomes in fibromyalgia patients with hypovitaminosis D: a prospective questionnaire study [^115woRPp]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the association between hypovitaminosis D and outcomes of symptom severity, mood disorders, fatigue, and quality of life in fibromyalgia (FM) patients.

Methods

Five hundred ninety-three FM patients were surveyed from May 2012 to November 2013. Patients with serum vitamin D < 25ng/mL were considered to have hypovitaminosis D. The primary outcome was FM symptom severity (FIQ-R questionnaire). Secondary outcomes included quality of life (SF-36), fatigue (MFI-20), anxiety (GAD-7), and depression (PHQ-9). Independent t tests and chi-square tests were performed for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Regression analysis was performed adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, ethnicity, and season. A post hoc analysis examined for correlation between outcomes and serum vitamin D (ng/mL) as a continuous variable.

Results

One hundred twenty-two patients (20.6%) had hypovitaminosis D. In our adjusted regression analysis, the total FIQ-R score in patients with hypovitaminosis D was higher compared with control patients with adequate serum vitamin D (57.85 ± 18.09 vs 62.79 ± 18.10, P = 0.04). Adjusted regression analysis revealed higher total GAD-7 (P = 0.01) and higher total PHQ-9 scores (P = 0.04) in patients with hypovitaminosis D compared with control patients. There were no differences based on severity of depression or anxiety. No differences in fatigue or quality of life were identified. Unadjusted post hoc analysis revealed that as serum vitamin D increased, there was an association with lower total FIQ-R (β coefficient = -0.11, P = 0.02) and lower SF-36 subscale scores of role-physical (β coefficient = -0.10, P = 0.03). Adjusted post hoc analysis revealed no significant associations.

Conclusions

Hypovitaminosis D may be a risk factor for worse symptom severity, anxiety, and depression in FM patients.

### Vitamin D, chronic pain, and depression: linear and non-linear mendelian randomization analyses [^116FGdEz]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

We did not observe evidence suggesting any effect of vitamin D supplementation on fibromyalgia, clinical fatigue, or chronic widespread pain, beyond a slight protective association in one stratum that may represent a chance finding. This may be due to lack of power, as the number of cases for these outcomes was less than that for depression. Another challenge is defining these outcomes, as these conditions are not always accurately captured in routinely-collected healthcare records. Our results concur with results from two clinical trials demonstrating no convincing benefit of vitamin D supplementation on pain.

While our findings suggest that population-wide vitamin D supplementation will not substantially reduce risk of depression, they suggest vitamin D supplementation may reduce risk of depression for those with insufficient vitamin D levels. For any future clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation, this reinforces the importance of recruiting enough patients with vitamin D deficiency at baseline, so the trial has enough statistical power to detect an effect in deficient individuals. However, recruiting enough vitamin D deficient individuals into such a trial to attain adequate power, and ensuring that those assigned to the placebo group do not self-medicate, may prove challenging in practice.

A number of different biological mechanisms might explain the direct relationship observed between low levels of circulating 25(OH)D and probable lifetime major depression. Inflammation is proposed to play a causal role in the development of depression, and vitamin D has been observed to play an anti-inflammatory role in neurological functioning by preventing oxidative damage to nervous tissue. It has also been suggested in several randomized controlled trials that higher vitamin D levels result in lower levels of systemic inflammatory cytokines. Mechanisms underpinning the inflammatory hypothesis for depression are an area of ongoing research. Recent studies in mice also indicate that a lack of vitamin D might influence microbiome diversity related to mood disorders, in line with recent research into the role of gut microbiome in depression. Finally, in vitro, work has also suggested a connection between vitamin D and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis via influence on the glucocorticoid receptors, which has a known role in the development of depression. Given the number of biological pathways through which vitamin D levels might play a role in risk of depression, this may explain the associations we found between lower genetically-predicted 25(OH)D levels and probable lifetime major depression but not chronic pain conditions.

### Low vitamin D levels are associated with long COVID syndrome in COVID-19 survivors [^114mVncV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 4.
Demographic characteristics and concomitant comorbidities prevalence in patients with and without neurocognitive symptoms at follow-up visits

In patients presenting vitamin D deficiency both at admission and at follow-up visits (n = 42), we observed lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels, evaluated at follow-up visits, in those with constitutional symptoms at the 6-month follow-up (n = 9) compared with those without (n = 33) (11.7 [10.9–13.4] ng/mL vs 15.2 [12.2–17.7] ng/mL, P = 0.025) and in those with asthenia (n = 8) compared with those without (n = 34) (11.6 [10.7–12.7] ng/mL vs 15.2 [12.3–17.5] ng/mL, P = 0.009).

Multiple logistic regression analyses including demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and 25(OH) vitamin D levels were performed for long COVID occurrence risk. Lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels, evaluated at follow-up visits, were the only factor significantly and independently associated with the long COVID occurrence (P = 0.008, OR 1.09, CI 1.01–1.16) in our cohort (Table 5).

### Vitamin D status and ill health: a systematic review [^114x75cj]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Low serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) have been associated with many non-skeletal disorders. However, whether low 25(OH)D is the cause or result of ill health is not known. We did a systematic search of prospective and intervention studies that assessed the effect of 25(OH)D concentrations on non-skeletal health outcomes in individuals aged 18 years or older. We identified 290 prospective cohort studies (279 on disease occurrence or mortality, and 11 on cancer characteristics or survival), and 172 randomised trials of major health outcomes and of physiological parameters related to disease risk or inflammatory status. Investigators of most prospective studies reported moderate to strong inverse associations between 25(OH)D concentrations and cardiovascular diseases, serum lipid concentrations, inflammation, glucose metabolism disorders, weight gain, infectious diseases, multiple sclerosis, mood disorders, declining cognitive function, impaired physical functioning, and all-cause mortality. High 25(OH)D concentrations were not associated with a lower risk of cancer, except colorectal cancer. Results from intervention studies did not show an effect of vitamin D supplementation on disease occurrence, including colorectal cancer. In 34 intervention studies including 2805 individuals with mean 25(OH)D concentration lower than 50 nmol/L at baseline supplementation with 50 μg per day or more did not show better results. Supplementation in elderly people (mainly women) with 20 μg vitamin D per day seemed to slightly reduce all-cause mortality. The discrepancy between observational and intervention studies suggests that low 25(OH)D is a marker of ill health. Inflammatory processes involved in disease occurrence and clinical course would reduce 25(OH)D, which would explain why low vitamin D status is reported in a wide range of disorders. In elderly people, restoration of vitamin D deficits due to ageing and lifestyle changes induced by ill health could explain why low-dose supplementation leads to slight gains in survival.

### British society of gastroenterology and UK-PSC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^114VVxwA]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Poor nutrition and fat soluble vitamin deficiency

Poor nutrition is common in chronic liver disease and should be considered and treated appropriately in patients with PSC. Advanced cholestasis can result in malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins. In advanced disease before transplantation, deficiency of vitamin A, D and E in 82%, 57% and 43%, respectively, are reported, but much lower levels of deficiency are seen earlier in the disease process. Evidence of deficiency of any measurable vitamin should lead to consideration of empirical replacement with multivitamins.

Recommendation 20: Poor nutrition and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency are relatively common in advanced PSC and we suggest that clinicians should have a low threshold for empirical replacement (strength of recommendation: WEAK; quality of evidence: MODERATE).

Fatigue and depression

Fatigue is a common symptom of patients with chronic liver disease, but no treatments have been proved to be beneficial. Depression is also common in people with chronic illnesses, and there are mixed reports of the association between depression and fatigue in PSC. One study directly assessing quality of life and fatigue scores in PSC, reported a lower incidence of fatigue than in the general population and when present, symptoms were associated with depression rather than severity of liver disease. There does not appear to be a role for the treatment of fatigue using antidepressants without clear symptoms of depression.

Recommendation 21: We recommend that in patients with fatigue, alternative causes should be actively sought and treated (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: LOW).

### High doses of cholecalciferol alleviate the progression of hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD stages 3–4: results of a 12-week double-blind, randomized, controlled study [^111dL2Nx]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

A plasma concentration of calcidiol [25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D)] below 75 nmol/L is associated with an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) in healthy subjects. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are prone to develop 25(OH)D deficiency and clinical guidelines recommend replenishment with nutritional vitamin D, as ergo- or cholecalciferol, to attain a 25(OH)D plasma concentration above 75 nmol/L. Furthermore, low 25(OH)D levels have been suggested to be associated with impaired muscle and bone function. As various tissues express the ability to internalize, metabolize and elicit responses to vitamin D, it has been hypothesized that 25(OH)D may have multiple beneficial pleiotropic effects apart from being a substrate for the formation of calcitriol {1,25(dihydroxy) vitamin D [1,25(OH 2) vitamin D]}.

The primary aim of this study was to determine if treatment with high-dose cholecalciferol (8000 IU/day as oral drops) for 12 weeks in CKD Stages 3–4 patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) resulted in differences in change in PTH levels as compared with placebo. Secondary outcomes were differences in mean change in PTH after 6 weeks and evaluation of fatigue, hand grip strength and different biochemical variables.

### Reducing fatigue in pediatric rheumatic conditions: a systematic review [^111mYhio]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although fatigue is a prevalent distressing symptom in children and adolescents with Pediatric Rheumatic Conditions (PRCs), intervention studies designed for reducing fatigue in PRCs are limited.

Aim

To systematically review evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions intended to reduce fatigue in patients with PRCs.

Methods

Comprehensive electronic searches were performed in PubMed/ MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Cinahl. The risk of bias was assessed using the ' Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials' and 'Quality Assessment Tool for Before-After Studies With No Control Group ' for respectively studies with and without a control group.

Results

Ten out of 418 studies were included with a total of 240 participants (age range 5–23 years). Interventions included land-based and aquatic-based exercise therapy, prednisolone, vitamin-D and creatine supplementation, psychological therapy and a transition program into an adult rheumatology program. Fatigue was assessed with self-reported questionnaires in all included studies. Land-based exercise therapy was effective in one pre-post intervention study, whereas not effective in two randomized controlled trials. Aquatic-based exercise therapy was found more effective than land-based exercise therapy. Two placebo-controlled studies showed a significant positive effect in reducing subjective fatigue with prednisolone and vitamin-D. Creatine was not found effective. Cognitive therapy was effective in one pre-post intervention study, while one RCT did not show an effect in reducing fatigue. A transition program based on health education showed a small reducing effect, however, it was not clear if this was a significant effect. Six studies showed a high risk of bias, three studies a moderate risk, and one study had a low risk of bias.

Conclusions

Insufficient evidence is provided to substantiate the efficacy of current interventions to reduce fatigue in PRCs. The low number of studies, non-comparable interventions, risk of bias, and inconclusive outcomes of the included studies denote future research should focus on intervention studies aimed at the treatment of fatigue in children and adolescents with PRCs. Identification of possible underlying biological and psychosocial mechanisms as possible treatment targets to reduce complaints of fatigue in children and adolescents with PRCs is warranted.

### Vitamin D, chronic pain, and depression: linear and non-linear mendelian randomization analyses [^113BUvGs]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to various chronic pain conditions. However, randomized trials of vitamin D supplementation have had mixed results. In contrast, systematic reviews of randomized trials indicate a protective effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression. We undertake a Mendelian randomization investigation in UK Biobank, a study of UK residents aged 40–65 at recruitment. We perform linear and non-linear Mendelian randomization analyses for four outcomes: fibromyalgia, clinical fatigue, chronic widespread pain, and probable lifetime major depression. We use genetic variants from four gene regions with known links to vitamin D biology as instruments. In linear analyses, genetically-predicted levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], a clinical marker of vitamin D status, were not associated with fibromyalgia (odds ratio [OR] per 10 nmol/L higher 25(OH)D 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93, 1.12), clinical fatigue (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94, 1.05), chronic widespread pain (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89, 1.02), or probable lifetime major depression (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.93, 1.01). In non-linear analyses, an association was observed between genetically-predicted 25(OH)D levels and depression in the quintile of the population with the lowest 25(OH)D levels (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59, 0.94); associations were null in other strata. Our findings suggest that population-wide vitamin D supplementation will not substantially reduce pain or depression; however, targeted supplementation of deficient individuals may reduce risk of depression.

### Vitamin D levels and menopause-related symptoms [^113nkcw1]. Menopause (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aims to determine whether vitamin D levels are associated with menopause-related symptoms in older women.

Methods

A randomly selected subset of 1,407 women, among 26,104 potentially eligible participants of the Women's Health Initiative Calcium and Vitamin D trial of postmenopausal women aged 51 to 80 years, had 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels measured at the Women's Health Initiative Calcium and Vitamin D trial baseline visit. Information about menopause-related symptoms at baseline was obtained by questionnaire and included overall number of symptoms and composite measures of sleep disturbance, emotional well-being, and energy/fatigue, as well as individual symptoms. After exclusions for missing data, 530 women (mean [SD] age, 66.2 [6.8] y) were included in these analyses.

Results

Borderline significant associations between 25(OH)D levels and total number of menopausal symptoms were observed (with P values ranging from 0.05 to 0.06 for fully adjusted models); however, the effect was clinically insignificant and disappeared with correction for multiple testing. No associations between 25(OH)D levels and composite measures of sleep disturbance, emotional well-being, or energy/fatigue were observed (P's > 0.10 for fully adjusted models).

Conclusions

There is no evidence for a clinically important association between serum 25(OH)D levels and menopause-related symptoms in postmenopausal women.

### Associations between fatigue and endocrine and non-endocrine health problems in Turner syndrome: cohort study and review [^111Yrx7t]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Health problems

We collected data on the following endocrine and non-endocrine health problems: thyroid disease, DM, obesity, vitamin D deficiency, cardiac disorders, hypertension, renal disease, liver disease, celiac disease, electrolyte disorders, and anemia.

Thyroid disease was classified as overt hypothyroidism (low free thyroxine [fT4] with high thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) subclinical hypothyroidism (normal fT4 with increased TSH), overt hyperthyroidism (high fT4 with decreased TSH) or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal fT4 with decreased TSH). Women who used thyroid medication were also classified as having thyroid disease (category depending on the diagnosis). DM was considered present when the patient had a diagnosis of DM, used medication for DM, or when nonfasting glucose levels were repeatedly above the upper limit of normal. Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m 2, overweight as BMI between 25.0 and 29.9 kg/m 2 and underweight as BMI < 18.5 kg/m 2. Vitamin D deficiency was diagnosed when 25-OH vitamin D levels were repeatedly below the reference range. Women who used vitamin D supplementation were separately analyzed. Cardiac disorders were considered present when the patient had at least one cardiac abnormality. Hypertension was not considered a cardiac disorder but was separately analyzed. High blood pressure was defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg. Patients were considered as having renal disease when they had a clinical diagnosis of renal disease and/or when the estimated glomerular filtration rate was repeatedly below the reference range. For liver disease, 5 categories were distinguished based on biochemical measurements: (i) liver enzymes suggestive of steatosis (high gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT] and high alkaline phosphatase [ALP]); (ii) liver enzymes suggestive of obstruction (high total bilirubin, often accompanied with high GGT and ALP); (iii) isolated ALP elevation; (iv) isolated GGT elevation; and (v) other liver enzyme disturbances. For electrolyte disorders, we screened for calcium, sodium, and potassium levels outside the reference range. Anemia was considered present when hemoglobin (Hb) levels were below the reference range. Additionally, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) levels were used to distinguish microcytic anemia (MCV < 80 fL), normocytic anemia (MCV 80–100 fL), and macrocytic anemia (MCV > 100 fL). Patients were classified as having celiac disease when a diagnosis was present in the electronic health record.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114Hfpqn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider advising intake of at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D in adults aged 19–50 years to maximize bone health and muscle function. Insufficient evidence whether 600 IU/day is enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. Recognize that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consistently > 30 ng/mL.

### Fatigue characteristics on dialysis and non-dialysis days in patients with chronic kidney failure on maintenance hemodialysis [^112va4GU]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

The reason for pronounced fatigue severity and fatigue interference and overwhelming global fatigue burden on a dialysis day relative to a non-dialysis day has not been well investigated. One can postulate a number of factors (sociodemographic, lifestyle, physiological, and psychological) to explain such day-to-day fatigue variations. We noted a positive association of fatigue with age and inverse association with education which were not consistent across dialysis and non-dialysis days (Table 3). In accordance with prior studies, we did not find any association of select biochemical parameters (serum albumin, blood hemoglobin, and vitamin D) or any dialysis-related variables (changes in body weight and blood pressure) on a dialysis day with fatigue (e.g. severity and interference).

The negative association between habitual exercise or physical activity and fatigue only on non-dialysis days is not a surprising finding. Prior studies reported that hemodialysis patients are significantly less engaged in physical activities on a dialysis day compared to a non-dialysis day due to several reasons – notably, lack of motivation, time commitment during dialysis days including travel to dialysis clinic, and post-dialysis fatigue. In addition, it is likely that chronic kidney failure patients with primary etiology of diabetes suffer from multiple comorbidities such as diabetic retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, lower limb amputation, and arthropathy which are significant barrier to physical activity. Self-reported mean duration of time spent on habitual physical activity by our study participants was only about 60 min per week.

It is also possible that significantly lower dietary energy and protein intakes on dialysis days compared to non-dialysis days may contribute to fatigue. Burrowes et al. showed that both dietary energy and protein intakes were lower on dialysis day than on non-dialysis day in the Hemodialysis study patients. We found that nPCR, which is often used to evaluate habitual protein intake, was inversely associated with global fatigue on dialysis day and with fatigue severity on both dialysis and non-dialysis days (Table 3). These findings are consistent with results from a recent study. In general, a low-protein diet may contribute to malnutrition and skeletal muscle loss resulting in poor outcomes including fatigue. The mean nPCR of our study population was 1.03 ± 0.30 g/kg/day (Table 1) which was below the optimal target of > 1.4 g/kg per day and the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative clinical practice guidelines recommend minimum target of 1.2 g/kg/day.

### Mechanical factors and vitamin D deficiency in schoolchildren with low back pain: biochemical and cross-sectional survey analysis [^1126Tcqc]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was designed to evaluate the role of vitamin D, muscle fatigue biomarkers, and mechanical factors in the progression of low back pain (LBP) in schoolchildren.

Background

Children and adolescents frequently suffer from LBP with no clear clinical causes, and > 71% of schoolchildren aged 12–17 years will show at least one episode of LBP.

Materials and methods

A total of 250 schoolchildren aged 12–16 years were randomly enrolled in this study. For all schoolchildren height, weight, percentage of daily sun exposure and areas of skin exposed to sun, method of carrying the bag, and bag weight and type were recorded over a typical school week. Pain scores, physical activity (PA), LBP, serum vitamin 25(OH)D level, serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities and calcium (Ca) concentrations were estimated using prevalidated Pain Rating Scale, modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire, short-form PA questionnaire, and colorimetric and immunoassay techniques.

Results

During the period of October 2013–May 2014, LBP was estimated in 52.2% of the schoolchildren. It was classified into moderate (34%) and severe (18%). Girls showed a higher LBP (36%) compared with boys (24%). In schoolchildren with moderate and severe LBP significantly higher (P = 0.01) body mass index, waist, hip, and waist-to-hip ratio measurements were observed compared with normal schoolchildren. LBP significantly correlated with less sun exposure, lower PA, sedentary activity (TV/computer use), and overloaded school bags. In addition, schoolchildren with severe LBP showed lower levels of vitamin 25(OH)D and Ca and higher levels of CK, LDH, and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase compared with moderate and healthy schoolchildren. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that age, gender, demographic parameters, PA, vitamin D levels, Ca, CK, and LDH associated with ~56.8%–86.7% of the incidence of LBP among schoolchildren.

Conclusion

In children and adolescents, LBP was shown to be linked with limited sun exposure, inadequate vitamin D diets, adiposity, lower PA, sedentary lifestyles, vitamin 25 (OH) D deficiency, and lower levels of Ca, CK, and LDH.

### Symptoms and symptom clusters in patients newly diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease: results from the IBSEN III study [^1139bpaL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency was statistically significantly associated with the impaired energy cluster. Vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in patients with IBD than in the general population. This deficiency is associated with malabsorption, reduced sunlight exposure, insufficient physical activity, and reduced vitamin D intake. A meta-analysis found that a low vitamin D status was a marker for lower quality of life scores and was associated with muscle weakness and increased disease activity in patients with IBD. Even though the association between vitamin D deficiency and fatigue has been studied in IBD, no certain associations have been established. Hence, our finding is of interest and warrants further exploration. As none of the other clinical or socio-demographic variables were associated with cluster membership, this warrants an individual patient approach by health-care professionals.

### Prevalence and factors associated with fatigue in patients with ulcerative colitis in China: a cross-sectional study [^112C3kfg]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

In our study, approximately a quarter of the patients had anemia. Univariate analysis confirmed that patients with anemia had a higher prevalence of fatigue than those without anemia. As expected from previous studies, anemia was the significant predictors of fatigue in IBD. Nevertheless, we did not find a positive correlation between anemia and the presence of fatigue or its severity in multivariate analysis. The results were in agreement with some other studies. About two-thirds of the patients included in present study were in remission or mild activity, indicating that the bloody stools and other clinical symptoms of UC patient were not serious and persistent. It allows patients to adapt to this slow and mild change without feeling fatigue. Furthermore, different statistical methods performed among these studies were also responsible for these conflicting results.

Propositions on the relationship between fatigue and nutritional deficiency was inconsistent currently. Several studies confirmed that nutritional deficiency, including but not limited to Vitamin B12 and Iron deficiency, could contribute to fatigue. By contrast, additional studies have suggested no difference in IBD patients with or without fatigue in level of Vitamin D or Vitamin B12. Our study demonstrated that the degree of nutritional risk was related to fatigue in univariate analysis. The same as depression, sleep disorders, and anemia, there is no correlation between nutritional risk and fatigue in multivariate analysis. Most of the included patients had mild disease and the nutritional risk was low to moderate. Therefore, the relationship between fatigue and nutritional risk tends to be overlooked. More researches need to be conducted to confirm the relationship between fatigue and nutritional risk.

### Falls as one of the atypical presentations of COVID-19 in older population [^1125Wvpe]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

COVID-19 and Falls

Studies revealed that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests with a wide spectrum of presentations. Most reports of COVID-19 highlight shortness of breath, fever, cough, fatigue, abdominal pain, diarrhea and decreased appetite as the dominant initial presentations. However, COVID-19 atypical symptoms, such as delirium, confusion, dizziness and unusual fatigue, can be observed in the older patients. - According to Norman et al. among the main presentations of COVID-19, balance issues, including falls, are listed. It has been observed that older people tested positive for COVID-19 are more likely to experience. It signifies that screening tests based on typical symptoms of the infection performed in older people are insufficient. The authors of the research point to the importance of a holistic, multidisciplinary assessment in targeting the profile of COVID-19 patients, including fall risk assessment, evaluation of motor functions, cognitive impairment and mental performance. All healthcare professionals, including physiotherapists, should be aware of the non-specific COVID-19 symptoms to ensure infection prevention and appropriate care for older people. Further prospective studies are urgently needed to investigate a combination of signs and symptoms to assess the COVID-19 syndrome in older adults.

Tramontana et al. in their studies emphasize the fact that maintaining optimal vitamin D concentration is of great importance in older population, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Imbalances and the associated increased frequency of falls and osteoporotic fractures, whose risk and frequency grow with age, are among the most dangerous effects of vitamin D deficiency. According to the authors of this study, the presumed beneficial effect of vitamin D in COVID-19 patients relates to its function as a modulator of the musculoskeletal and immune systems and its effectiveness in comorbidities such as recurrent respiratory complications.

According to other authors, low serum concentration of 25(OH)D, the best index of vitamin D nutritional status, is associated with impaired respiratory health and increased susceptibility to acute respiratory infections. It should be considered in comparison with data of COVID-19 patients. It was found that 67–85% of COVID-19 patients experience acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which represents one of the leading causes of mortality. Tramontana et al. also suggest further research into the potential benefits of Vitamin D with regard to its effects on the immune system.

### Exercise may ameliorate the detrimental side effects of high vitamin D supplementation on muscle function in mice [^117A3ACA]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D is commonly prescribed to normalize deficiencies and to treat osteoporosis. However, the effect vitamin D supplements have on skeletal muscle health is equivocal. Although vitamin D is known to play a role in the various processes that maintain muscle integrity and function, recent studies utilizing high bolus dose vitamin D supplementation has demonstrated an increased risk of falls. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of high vitamin D supplementation on skeletal muscle function with and without exercise enrichment. Four-week old C57BL/10 mice (n = 48) were separated into either normal vitamin D (1500 IU/kg diet; unsupplemented) or high vitamin D (20,000 IU/kg diet; supplemented) treatment groups. Each dietary group was further separated into interventional subgroups where mice either remained sedentary or received exercise-enrichment for 8 weeks in the form of voluntary running. Following the intervention period, whole body in vivo and ex vivo contractile analysis were performed. High vitamin D supplementation decreased force production in the slow-twitch soleus muscles of sedentary mice (p < .01); however, exercise normalized this effect. Eight weeks of exercise did not improve fatigue resistance of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) or soleus muscles in unsupplemented mice, likely due to low levels of activation in these muscles. In contrast, fatigability was improved in the EDL (p < .01) and even more so in the soleus (p < .001) in the supplemented exercise-enriched group. Our data highlights that increasing vitamin D levels above normal reduces postural muscle force as seen in the soleus. Thus, unnecessary vitamin D supplementation may contribute to the increased risk of falls observed in some studies. Interestingly, when vitamin D supplementation was combined with exercise, force production was effectively restored, and fatigue resistance improved, even in muscles lowly activated. Regular exercise may modulate the effects of vitamin D on skeletal muscle, and be recommended for individuals receiving vitamin D supplements. © 2020 The Authors.

### Prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and clinical associations among veiled east African women in Washington state [^113Amo4z]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

Cultural and biological factors place immigrant women from equatorial Africa at increased risk of vitamin D insufficiency. This could in part explain the high prevalence of fatigue, musculoskeletal complaints, and depressive symptoms in this population.

Methods

In a cross-sectional study of East African immigrant women in Washington State, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) serum concentrations and multiple measures of physical and psychological symptoms were assessed. Mean serum 25(OH)D serum concentrations and chi-square were used to assess differences between groups. Multiple logistic regression was used to explore differences in the symptoms of subjects with varying degrees of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency.

Results

Of the 75 women interviewed and who completed surveys, 25(OH)D serum samples were available in 71 subjects. All were found to have low 25(OH)D; 9 (12.3%) had ≤ 8 ng/mL, 29 (40.9%) had 8.1–15 ng/mL, and 33 (44.9%) had 15.1–30 ng/mL. After controlling for age, women with 25(OH)D < 15 ng/mL were 66% less likely to drink milk than women with 25(OH)D ≥ 15 ng/mL (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.11–0.99). Musculoskeletal complaints, depressive symptoms, and fatigue did not correlate with the severity of 25(OH)D insufficiency.

Conclusions

Vitamin D insufficiency, as reflected by low 25(OH)D serum concentrations, was a universal finding in this group of women, suggesting the need for widespread education and intervention in this and other immigrant groups at northern latitudes.

### Preliminary report: vitamin D deficiency in advanced cancer patients with symptoms of fatigue or anorexia [^1166hPHg]. The Oncologist (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency in noncancer patients is associated with symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, and depression. These symptoms are common among advanced cancer patients. We investigated the prevalence of low serum vitamin D levels in cancer patients with fatigue or poor appetite and their association with symptom burden and other correctable endocrine abnormalities.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of 100 consecutive cancer patients with appetite or fatigue scores of ≥ 4 of 10 referred to a supportive care clinic. We investigated serum levels of 25(OH) vitamin D, cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and bioavailable testosterone. Symptoms were measured by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. Serum 25(OH) vitamin D < 20 ng/mL was considered deficient; ≥ 20 ng/mL and < 30 ng/mL were considered insufficient.

Results

Patients were predominantly male (68%) and white (66%), with a median age of 60 years (range, 27–91 years). Gastrointestinal (30%) and lung (22%) cancers were predominant. Forty-seven patients (47%) were vitamin D deficient and 70 (70%) were insufficient. Thirteen of 70 patients (19%) with vitamin D insufficiency were on supplementation. Vitamin D deficiency was more common among nonwhites (82% versus 36%) and females. No significant association was found between vitamin D and symptoms. Hypogonadic males had a significantly lower mean 25(OH) vitamin D level than eugonadic males.

Conclusions

Low vitamin D levels were highly prevalent among advanced cancer patients with cachexia or fatigue. Vitamin D deficiency was more frequent among nonwhite and female patients. Vitamin D levels were also significantly lower in male patients with hypogonadism.

### Stress fractures: concepts and therapeutics [^116mmZ4v]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Stress fractures are repetitive use injuries in which recurrent strains lead to material fatigue and microarchitectural discontinuities. They account for up to 20% of athletic injuries, more often in women and in the setting of track-and-field events. In women, menstrual disturbances, low body mass index, low energy intake, and sometimes low bone mass, may be contributing factors. There are no standard protocols for evaluation or management of stress fractures.

Evidence Acquisition

Available literature published in English was retrieved using the following terms: stress fractures; fractures; osteoporosis, athletes, premenopausal women, and athletic triad; through PubMed. Reviews, original reports, and case reports were all included.

Evidence Synthesis

Despite lack of consistency among the publications, a phenotype emerges, namely of individuals whose bone mineral density is reduced along with low intake of dietary calcium and low circulating levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Limited experience suggests that calcium and vitamin D supplementation might be helpful. Bisphosphonates or teriparatide may accelerate fracture healing in special circumstances.

Conclusions

Most individuals who experience a stress fracture are young and healthy and do not appear to have an underlying metabolic bone disease. On the other hand, the presence of low bone mass and hormonal disturbances in some afflicted individuals might identify a cohort who needs endocrinological attention. Prospective, well-designed studies of stress fractures are needed to elucidate further underlying pathophysiological elements that predispose such individuals. Guidelines for prevention and treatment may follow from such well-controlled studies.

### Recognition and management of vitamin D deficiency [^114Lxtxc]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency affects persons of all ages. Common manifestations of vitamin D deficiency are symmetric low back pain, proximal muscle weakness, muscle aches, and throbbing bone pain elicited with pressure over the sternum or tibia. A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level should be obtained in patients with suspected vitamin D deficiency. Deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 20 ng per mL (50 nmol per L), and insufficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 20 to 30 ng per mL (50 to 75 nmol per L). The goal of treatment is to normalize vitamin D levels to relieve symptoms and decrease the risk of fractures, falls, and other adverse health outcomes. To prevent vitamin D deficiency, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants and children receive at least 400 IU per day from diet and supplements. Evidence shows that vitamin D supplementation of at least 700 to 800 IU per day reduces fracture and fall rates in adults. In persons with vitamin D deficiency, treatment may include oral ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) at 50,000 IU per week for eight weeks. After vitamin D levels normalize, experts recommend maintenance dosages of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) at 800 to 1,000 IU per day from dietary and supplemental sources.

### Vitamin D screening and supplementation in community-dwelling adults: common questions and answers [^115iKZP4]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Measurement of vitamin D levels and supplementation with oral vitamin D have become commonplace, although clinical trials have not demonstrated health benefits. The usefulness of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to assess adequate exposure to vitamin D is hampered by variations in measurement technique and precision. Serum levels less than 12 ng per mL reflect inadequate vitamin D intake for bone health. Levels greater than 20 ng per mL are adequate for 97.5% of the population. Routine vitamin D supplementation does not prolong life, decrease the incidence of cancer or cardiovascular disease, or decrease fracture rates. Screening asymptomatic individuals for vitamin D deficiency and treating those considered to be deficient do not reduce the risk of cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or death in community-dwelling adults, or fractures in persons not at high risk of fractures. Randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of depression, fatigue, osteoarthritis, and chronic pain show no benefit, even in persons with low levels at baseline.

### Can vitamin D supplementation prevent bone loss in persons with MS? A placebo-controlled trial [^112MW26X]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Supplementing 20,000 IU vitamin D 3 per week increased serum 25(OH)D by 68 nmol/L, and 32 out of 35 participants in the intervention group reached desired vitamin D levels of ≥ 75 nmol/L. The study medication was tolerated without clinical or biochemical side effects, and even higher doses of vitamin D 3 are probably safe. Supplementation with vitamin D can be achieved equally well with daily as with weekly dosing frequencies.

At baseline, one quarter of our study population had lower than expected BMD for sex and age. Over the 96 week study period, BMD at the hip decreased in both treatment arms, the change being statistically significant in the placebo group. This finding indicates that MS may be a cause of secondary osteoporosis. In healthy individuals, studies have reported no significant bone loss at the hip in women before the perimenopausal years, while men may or may not have a small bone loss before age 50. The general bone loss at the hip, a weight bearing site, may result from decreased physical activity even in fully ambulatory persons with MS, due to fatigue, visual problems, and impaired balance. We observed no change in BMD at the lumbar spine. This finding is in agreement with two recent studies reporting unchanged BMD at the lumbar spine over a period of respectively 96 weeks and 39 months in interferon beta-treated persons with MS. At the non-dominant UD radius, BMD increased significantly in the intervention group, but not in the placebo group. In healthy individuals, BMD at this site has been reported to be stable or increasing up to age 40 in both sexes. BMD at the UD radius, especially in the non-dominant arm, is not dependent on weight bearing activity and therefore is likely to be less affected by mild to moderate MS-related disability.

### Subclinical macro and microvascular disease is differently associated with depressive symptoms in men and women: findings from the SABRE population-based study [^116uZu62]. Atherosclerosis (2020). Medium credibility.

While the associations between measures of subclinical coronary disease, cerebrovascular disease, large vessel disease, myocardial injury and depressive symptoms were generally similar in men and women, our findings suggest that the associations for ACR were stronger in men and LADI were stronger in women. In the subgroup of participants without diagnosed CVD, we also noted sex differences consistent with those in the complete sample. No studies to date have investigated sex difference in the association between ACR and depression. The stronger association between LADI and depressive symptoms in women in our study might be linked to non-cardiac factors. One potential explanation may be anaemia. Women are more likely than men to be anaemic and low haemoglobin has been reported to be correlated with markers of diastolic dysfunction and increased filling pressure. Although haemoglobin was not measured at this clinic visit, measurement at a subsequent visit 5 years later indicated that SABRE study women, on average, had haemoglobin levels 1.2 mg/dl lower than men (13.3 vs 14.5 mg/dl) (unpublished data). It is possible that fatigue and lack of energy due to anaemia might masquerade as depressive symptoms, resulting in an ostensibly stronger relationship in women. Another potential mechanism for fatigue in women might be vitamin D deficiency and, although this was not measured in our study, it is frequently observed in older women.

### Overweight and vitamin D deficiency are common in patients with irritable bowel syndrome-a cross-sectional study [^114B4B8J]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The etiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is unknown, but several factors such as female sex, dietary habits, psychological factors, gastrointestinal (GI) motility, visceral hypersensitivity, gut-brain axis dysfunction, low-grade intestinal inflammation, impaired epithelial barrier integrity, and gut microbiota alterations have been discussed as risk factors for the disease. Comorbidities with depression, anxiety, and pain from other organs are common in IBS. Food intake is often a trigger to aggravated GI symptoms, and both a starch- and sucrose-reduced diet (SSRD) and a diet with low levels of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) have been shown to markedly improve GI symptoms, extraintestinal symptoms, and psychological well-being.

Patients with IBS/disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) have been found to have a low intake and circulating levels of several micronutrients. This may be explained by poor food habits in IBS with high consumption of sugar and processed food. A history of several restrictive diets, such as the low FODMAPs diet, to control abdominal pain and symptoms may lead to lower intakes of fruits, vegetables, and micronutrients. Poor food habits for several years may lead to cognitive dysfunction, mental illness, and several organic conditions. Both iron and vitamin D deficiency have become worldwide health issues. Iron deficiency and anemia are well-established causes of chronic fatigue. Vitamin D deficiency may be involved in the development of central hypersensitivity and trigger both IBS symptoms and impaired psychological well-being, and is associated with many chronic diseases. Overweight and obesity are also growing health issues in the world, leading to several inflammatory and endocrine changes which can increase the risk for chronic diseases including IBS. An association between vitamin D deficiency and overweight/obesity has been described.

Our hypothesis was that overweight and low circulating levels of micronutrients may be of importance for experience of symptoms and psychological well-being in IBS. The aim of the present study was to examine weight and plasma/serum levels of micronutrients in IBS compared to healthy controls and whether these factors were associated with aggravated GI or extraintestinal symptoms and dietary habits.

### The association between diet and glucocorticoid treatment in patients with SLE [^117VctBM]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study focused on the association between diet and GC treatment in patients with SLE. The results were based on data from a Swedish SLE cohort and showed that some dietary nutrients were associated or inversely associated with unfavourable outcomes of GC.

Diet and GC treatment

Several previous studies have shown that low vitamin D levels in serum are associated with disease activity in SLE. Vitamin D supplementation has also been suggested to improve disease activity and fatigue scores in SLE. Based on these and other studies, it has been suggested that vitamin D is protective against lupus activity. However, in this study, dietary vitamin D was positively associated with GC treatment, not suggesting a protective effect, but this association was not significant after adjusting for supplement use of calcium/vitamin D supplementation. Patients included in this study might have been aware of the existing evidence of the beneficial effect of vitamin D, explaining an increased vitamin D intake in patients with GC treatment/higher disease activity. Nevertheless, these results were based on dietary intake and not supplement intake of vitamin D. The results on the association between dietary vitamin D and GC were affected by calcium/vitamin D supplementation. However, if an adequate vitamin D intake is obtained (either through diet or supplementation), it is not necessarily followed by adequate vitamin D levels in blood, since GC reduces absorption of vitamin D.

Alcohol was inversely associated with GC treatment, reflecting older findings on the link between moderate alcohol intake and reduced risk of rheumatic diseases, and even specifically of SLE.

### Vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D receptor fokI polymorphism as risk factors for COVID-19 [^112K6Pw5]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The largest meta-analysis that involved more than one million adult individuals suggested a potential link between vitamin D status and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. They added that sufficient vitamin D levels may decrease the risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2. An Israeli epidemiological study reported that 25(OH) D levels < 20 ng/mL almost doubled the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization. Pinzon et al. reported a 90% prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among COVID-19 patients in Indonesia although it is a tropical country with a plenty of sunny weather. A similar study in Italy reported vitamin D deficiency in 81% of patients admitted to ICU with ARF due to COVID-19. The authors added that severe vitamin D deficiency may be a marker of poor prognosis in these patients. Whether any link exists between vitamin D deficiency and the severity of COVID-19 requires further evidence.

In keeping with a meta-analysis performed by de Souza et al.the most prevalent symptoms among studied cohort were fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath, followed by diarrhea, vomiting, and fatigue. Moreover, dry cough and development of pneumonia were more frequent in patients who had deficient level of vitamin D (Group 1) than those with normal vitamin D status (Group 2) although it does not reach a statistical significance. Among the most common abnormal laboratory findings were lymphopenia, elevated CRP, and D-dimer level. However, no significant difference was evident between both groups in terms of measured laboratory parameters and inflammatory biomarkers. Fortunately, all patients survived so we could not evaluate the association between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 mortality.

In animal models, severe acute lung injury was accompanied by an increase in pulmonary renin and angiotensin II levels and excessive induction of angiopoietin (Ang)-2 and myosin light chain (MLC). The vitamin D-VDR signaling protects the pulmonary vascular barrier and prevents acute lung injury by targeting the renin–angiotensin cascade and blocking the Ang-2-Tie-2-MLC kinase pathway.

### Missed diagnoses and health problems in adults with Prader-Willi syndrome: recommendations for screening and treatment [^114TDXDg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Fatigue and daytime sleepiness

Fatigue and daytime sleepiness were very common problems among adults with PWS. According to caregivers, these complaints often prevented them from taking part in day trips and physical activities. Daytime sleepiness is usually attributed to a lack of hypothalamic arousal and is regarded as a problem that is inherent to the syndrome. However, when we looked in more detail, all patients with clinically relevant fatigue or daytime sleepiness had treatable underlying problems such as sleep apnea, narcolepsia, nycturia, vitamin D deficiency, untreated male hypogonadism, or use of drugs that can cause sleepiness. Although we could not perform a randomized controlled trial to assess whether treating these underlying problems resolved the complaints, our clinical experience is that the majority of the patients reported less fatigue after treatment of the underlying cause. Also, caregivers reported that these patients were more actively participating in daily activities. This indicates that daytime sleepiness is not necessarily just "part of the syndrome", but could be the symptom of an underlying, treatable problem. Treating the underlying cause is important to reduce daytime sleepiness and increase physical activity.

Vitamin D deficiency and hypogonadism

Both vitamin D deficiency and hypogonadism are frequently present in adults with PWS. Low levels of vitamin D and testosterone are often attributed to obesity, as vitamin D is fat-soluble and testosterone production can be diminished by increased estradiol levels due to adipose tissue aromatase activity. However, lean male patients also had hypogonadism and vitamin D defiency. Although there is no consensus on the clinical effects of vitamin D, we found a clear relation between (the severity of) vitamin D deficiency and daytime sleepiness. Although the cause of daytime sleepiness in this complex patient population is likely to be multifactorial, we believe that prescribing vitamin D may be beneficial for all PWS adults with vitamin D deficiency. The high prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia in adults with PWS combined with the fact that vitamin D knows little side effects are additional arguments for treatment. Therefore, we recommend prescribing vitamin D supplementation in all adults with PWS with a vitamin D level below 50 ng/mL.
