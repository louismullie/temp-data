## Question

AKI

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a stepwise expert narrative on acute kidney injury (AKI). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition and staging framework to anchor diagnosis. Then, I should verify epidemiology and risk factors to frame pretest probability. Next, I will examine pathophysiology to guide etiologic thinking. After that, I need to review diagnostic workup, including labs, imaging, and biomarkers. Then, I will outline prevention and supportive management, followed by indications and timing for renal replacement therapy. I should also consider special populations and long-term follow-up, and finally synthesize controversies and evidence gaps to inform individualized care and research directions.

> Let me first confirm the definition and staging so I don't misclassify patients. AKI is defined by KDIGO as a rapid (within 7 days) rise in serum creatinine of at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or a 50% increase from baseline, or urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours, with staging by severity using these same axes; I should double-check that I'm applying the 48-hour and 7-day windows correctly, and yes, that's accurate per KDIGO harmonization of RIFLE and AKIN [^116NZ4SF] [^112TZHBx].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology to contextualize risk. Hospitalized adults have AKI in roughly 10–20% of admissions, and ICU incidence exceeds 50% in many cohorts; mortality rises with severity, and AKI requiring RRT carries short-term mortality near 40–70%, with long-term risks of CKD, ESRD, and cardiovascular events substantially increased; I should confirm that these ranges are consistent across contemporary sources, and they are supported by high-quality reviews and summaries [^116gQkzx] [^115sSaVq] [^114R2JkN].

> I will now examine pathophysiology to guide bedside reasoning. AKI is heterogeneous: prerenal azotemia from hypoperfusion, intrinsic tubular or glomerular injury from ischemia, toxins, or inflammation, and postrenal obstruction; sepsis-associated AKI is common and increasingly viewed as an inflammatory-microcirculatory disorder rather than purely hemodynamic failure, so I need to ensure I'm not oversimplifying to "renal blood flow only" explanations [^116gQkzx] [^115sSaVq] [^11222p3J].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup and confirm the sequence. I need to check for prerenal causes with volume status and hemodynamics, screen for postrenal obstruction with bladder scan and ultrasound if indicated, and evaluate intrinsic causes with urinalysis, sediment, and targeted labs; I should also remember that creatinine lags and can be confounded by muscle mass, so dynamic assessment and urine output trends matter, and in select contexts, a furosemide stress test can help predict progression risk; hold on, I should verify that biomarkers are adjuncts, not replacements, and yes, consensus recommends integrating damage and functional biomarkers with clinical data rather than using them alone [^116gQkzx] [^115sSaVq] [^1164os86] [^1128wWJv].

> Let me consider prevention and supportive care, since no disease-modifying therapy exists. I need to ensure hemodynamic optimization with early, adequate resuscitation using crystalloids and avoidance of starch colloids, then transition to conservative fluid management after 24–48 hours to avoid volume overload; I should double-check that balanced crystalloids vs saline remains an area of equipoise and tailor to context; strict nephrotoxin stewardship, tight glycemic control in appropriate patients, and protocolized care bundles are key; I should confirm that diuretics are not for prevention or treatment of AKI per se, but are appropriate for volume management when needed [^115WnXbc] [^1161eqHR] [^117U7GYm] [^112Sxyba].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about RRT timing; I should review the highest-quality evidence. Early RRT does not clearly reduce mortality and increases adverse events such as hypotension, arrhythmias, infection, and hypophosphatemia, though it may modestly shorten ICU and hospital length of stay; therefore, an expectant approach is reasonable, initiating RRT for life-threatening indications or when metabolic and fluid demands exceed kidney capacity, with shared decision-making and reassessment; I need to ensure I'm aligning with contemporary systematic reviews and expert guidance here [^114kuL3u] [^114Uwnb3] [^1164os86].

> I should confirm indications and dosing so I don't over- or under-treat. Absolute indications include refractory hyperkalemia, severe metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema from volume overload, and uremic complications; for dosing, I need to target urea reduction ratio at least 65% or single-pool Kt/V at least 1.2 per IHD session, adjusting upward to 70%/1.3 to account for delivery shortfalls; modality selection should be individualized by hemodynamics, logistics, and local expertise, recognizing that CRRT, IHD, and PIRRT are complementary rather than mutually exclusive [^1164os86] [^113anemE] [^113zC5af].

> But wait, what about special populations and settings; I need to ensure I tailor. In COVID-19, AKI is common and often tubular, with management following general AKI principles while adapting RRT logistics during surges; in pediatrics, incidence and risk stratification differ, and biomarker-guided strategies are under validation; in LMICs, prevention and early recognition are paramount given limited RRT access, and pragmatic, resource-sensitive protocols are essential; I should double-check that these points are supported by consensus and epidemiologic data [^113W37AP] [^112Jk31p] [^113nhEFc].

> Next, I should review long-term consequences and follow-up so I don't miss the chronic disease transition. Even after apparent recovery, AKI survivors have higher risks of CKD, recurrent AKI, cardiovascular events, and mortality; I need to arrange structured follow-up with kidney function checks, blood pressure control, and assessment for proteinuria, which itself portends worse outcomes; I should confirm timing: reassess around 2–3 months post-discharge, and sooner for high-risk patients, aligning with ERBP and contemporary guidance [^116gQkzx] [^115beXTX] [^111Mkkgt].

> I will now examine controversies and evidence gaps to avoid overconfidence. The KDIGO staging system, while useful for epidemiology and trials, has been criticized for poor correlation between creatinine and true GFR in the acute setting and for limited actionability at the bedside; biomarkers show promise but lack outcome-changing implementation; and the optimal RRT timing question remains unsettled despite multiple RCTs; I should acknowledge that personalized, phenotype-driven approaches and better endpoints are active research frontiers [^114YTEht] [^1128wWJv] [^114kuL3u] [^1162zsGX].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach and make sure nothing critical is missing. Identify AKI early using creatinine and urine output thresholds, stage severity, and immediately search for reversible causes; implement prevention bundles with hemodynamic optimization and nephrotoxin avoidance; escalate support as needed, reserving RRT for hard indications or when demand exceeds capacity; individualize modality and dose, and plan longitudinal follow-up for renal and cardiovascular health; I should confirm that this aligns with KDIGO, UKKA, and contemporary reviews, and it does [^116gQkzx] [^115F1HLD] [^115WnXbc].

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a **sudden decline in kidney function** [^115sSaVq] over hours to days, defined by KDIGO as a rise in serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, a ≥ 50% increase within 7 days, or urine output ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours [^116NZ4SF]. AKI is common in hospitalized patients — especially in the ICU [^115mnBcH] — and is linked to **high short- and long-term morbidity and mortality** [^116gQkzx], as well as progression to chronic kidney disease [^116Mvdoq]. Management is **supportive**, focusing on treating the cause, avoiding nephrotoxins, and correcting volume, electrolyte, and acid-base disturbances [^1174XRkG]; renal replacement therapy (RRT) is reserved for refractory complications [^116gQkzx]. Early recognition and intervention are critical to improving outcomes [^113czexv].

---

## Definition and classification

AKI is classified by **severity and duration** using standardized criteria [^114e5SHX]:

| **Stage** | **Serum creatinine criteria** | **Urine output criteria** |
|-|-|-|
| Stage 1 | Increase ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or 1.5–1.9× baseline within 7 days | ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6–12 hours |
| Stage 2 | Increase 2.0–2.9× baseline within 7 days | ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h for ≥ 12 hours |
| Stage 3 | Increase ≥ 3.0× baseline or ≥ 4.0 mg/dL with acute rise ≥ 0.5 mg/dL within 7 days | ≤ 0.3 mL/kg/h for ≥ 24 hours or anuria ≥ 12 hours |

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

AKI affects approximately 10–15% of hospitalized patients [^115sSaVq] and more than 50% of ICU patients [^115sSaVq]. Risk factors include advanced age, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease, sepsis, major surgery, contrast exposure, and nephrotoxic medications [^111pc4Gq].

---

## Pathophysiology

AKI results from **complex interactions** among hemodynamic, inflammatory, and cellular injury mechanisms [^notfound]. Prerenal azotemia from hypoperfusion, intrinsic tubular injury from ischemia or nephrotoxins, and postrenal obstruction are the principal categories [^115tb9kd]. Sepsis-associated AKI involves microvascular dysfunction, inflammation, and cellular metabolic reprogramming [^11222p3J].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

AKI presents with **oliguria/anuria**, fluid overload, electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis), and uremic symptoms (encephalopathy, pericarditis) [^114DQC2P]. Diagnosis relies on **serial serum creatinine** and urine output measurements [^114nqdGk], with additional tests (urinalysis, imaging) to determine etiology [^notfound]. Biomarkers (**NGAL, KIM-1, IL-18**) may enable earlier detection but are not yet routinely used [^113LsPJo].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on:

- **Treat underlying cause**: Correct hypoperfusion, remove nephrotoxins, relieve obstruction [^115tb9kd].
- **Supportive care**: Optimize volume status, electrolytes, and acid-base balance; avoid nephrotoxins [^115WnXbc].
- **Renal replacement therapy (RRT)**: Indicated for refractory hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, fluid overload, or uremic complications [^1164os86] [^114DQC2P].
- **Timing of RRT**: Controversial; recent evidence suggests no mortality benefit from early initiation, with expectant management reasonable unless life-threatening indications arise [^114kuL3u] [^114Uwnb3].

---

## Complications and outcomes

AKI is associated with **high short-term mortality** (up to 50% in ICU patients requiring RRT) [^116vu6Fh] and substantial long-term morbidity, including chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular events, and increased mortality [^116gQkzx]. Recovery may be incomplete, with persistent renal impairment in many survivors [^114R2JkN].

---

## Prevention and early detection

Prevention centers on **risk stratification**, avoiding nephrotoxins, and maintaining adequate perfusion [^115WnXbc]. Early detection via serial creatinine and urine output monitoring, electronic alerts, and biomarkers can facilitate timely intervention [^111C45S2] [^115vu6YR] [^1128wWJv].

---

## Current research and future directions

Research focuses on **novel biomarkers**, precision medicine, and targeted therapies [^116Mvdoq]. Subphenotyping and individualized treatment strategies are promising avenues to improve outcomes [^116gQkzx].

---

AKI is a **common, heterogeneous syndrome** with significant morbidity and mortality [^116gQkzx]. Early recognition, prompt treatment of the cause, and supportive care are essential; RRT is reserved for refractory complications. Ongoing research aims to refine definitions, improve early detection, and develop targeted therapies [^114e5SHX].

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of acute kidney injury: a KDIGO summary (part 1) [^111JD9cT]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious problem affecting millions and causing death and disability for many. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes completed the first ever, international, multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline for AKI. The guideline is based on evidence review and appraisal, and covers AKI definition, risk assessment, evaluation, prevention, and treatment. In this review we summarize key aspects of the guideline including definition and staging of AKI, as well as evaluation and nondialytic management. Contrast-induced AKI and management of renal replacement therapy will be addressed in a separate review. Treatment recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant trials. Appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed and a detailed rationale for each recommendation is provided.

### Acute kidney injury: epidemiology, outcomes, complications, and therapeutic strategies [^115mnBcH]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common serious complications for all hospital admissions, with its incidence increasing among hospitalized patients, particularly those in the intensive care unit. Despite significant improvements in critical care and dialysis technology, AKI is associated with an increased risk of short- and long-term mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and dialysis dependence. These risks are particularly relevant for critically ill patients with AKI severe enough to require renal replacement therapy (RRT). No specific pharmacologic treatment has been established to treat AKI. Hence, the mainstay treatment for patients with AKI is RRT even though there are still several problematic issues regarding its use including RRT modality, dose, and timing. Recently, the impact of AKI on an increased risk of progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or transplantation is attracting increased attention.

### Acute kidney injury [^116gQkzx]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common, heterogeneous, multifactorial condition, which is part of the overarching syndrome of acute kidney diseases and disorders. This condition's incidence highest in low-income and middle-income countries. In the short term, AKI is associated with increased mortality, an increased risk of complications, extended stays in hospital, and high health-care costs. Long-term complications include chronic kidney disease, kidney failure, cardiovascular morbidity, and an increased risk of death. Several strategies are available to prevent and treat AKI in specific clinical contexts. Otherwise, AKI care is primarily supportive, focused on treatment of the underlying cause, prevention of further injury, management of complications, and short-term renal replacement therapy in case of refractory complications. Evidence confirming that AKI subphenotyping is necessary to identify precision-oriented interventions is growing. Long-term follow-up of individuals recovered from AKI is recommended but the most effective models of care remain unclear.

### Acute kidney injury: what's the prognosis? [^116Mvdoq]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common (especially during critical illness), increasing in incidence, and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage renal disease (RIFLE) classification currently provides a standardized estimate of incidence and outcomes from AKI. Despite advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of human AKI, our ability to assess kidney function is limited and functional impairment poorly correlates with structural injury to the kidneys. Emerging novel biomarkers are, however, likely to further enhance risk stratification, facilitate early diagnosis, enable early enrollment in therapeutic trials, and assess prognosis. Sepsis remains the leading cause of AKI among the critically ill and over the past few years insights into the pathogenesis of AKI in sepsis are beginning to shift attention from renal blood flow to inflammation-mediated organ injury. Emerging evidence suggests that survivors of AKI incur long-term risks for developing chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease compared with those without AKI. Despite decades of research, no specific therapy for AKI other than supportive care currently exists and further work is required to better understand the pathogenesis of AKI during critical illness and to develop novel treatments.

### Timing of initiation and discontinuation of renal replacement therapy in AKI: unanswered key questions [^111shZB1]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) often require initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Currently, there is wide variation worldwide on the indications for and timing of initiation and discontinuation of RRT for AKI. Various parameters for metabolic, solute, and fluid control are generally used to guide the initiation and discontinuation of therapy; however, there are currently no standards in this field. Members of the recently established Acute Kidney Injury Network, representing key societies in critical care and nephrology along with additional experts in adult and pediatric AKI, participated in a 3-d conference in Vancouver in September 2006 to evaluate the available literature on this topic and draft consensus recommendations for research studies in this area. Key questions included the following: what are the indications for RRT, when should acute RRT support be initiated, and when should RRT be stopped? This report summarizes the available evidence and describes in detail the key questions, and some of the methods of answering them that will need to be addressed with the goal of standardizing the care of patients with AKI and improving outcomes.

### Management of acute kidney injury: core curriculum 2018 [^1174XRkG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous disorder that is common in hospitalized patients and associated with short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. When AKI is present, prompt workup of the underlying cause should be pursued, with specific attention to reversible causes. Measures to prevent AKI include optimization of volume status and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications. Crystalloids are preferred over colloids for most patients, and hydroxyethyl starches should be avoided. Volume overload in the setting of AKI is associated with adverse outcomes, so attention should be paid to overall fluid balance. Currently there are no targeted pharmacotherapies approved for the treatment of AKI. The optimal timing of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with AKI is unclear, but is an area of active investigation. Recent studies suggest that AKI is not a "self-limited" process, but is strongly linked to increased risk for chronic kidney disease, subsequent AKI, and future mortality.

### Timing of renal replacement therapy initiation for acute kidney injury [^113csV6n]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common condition among patients in intensive care units (ICUs), and is associated with high death. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a blood purification technique used to treat the most severe forms of AKI. The optimal time to initiate RRT so as to improve clinical outcomes remains uncertain. This review complements another Cochrane review by the same authors: Intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different timing (early and standard) of RRT initiation on death and recovery of kidney function in critically ill patients with AKI.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 23 August 2018 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched LILACS to 11 September 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We included all patients with AKI in ICU regardless of age, comparing early versus standard RRT initiation. For safety and cost outcomes we planned to include cohort studies and non-RCTs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two authors. The random-effects model was used and results were reported as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included five studies enrolling 1084 participants. Overall, most domains were assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias. Compared to standard treatment, early initiation may reduce the risk of death at day 30, although the 95% CI does not rule out an increased risk (5 studies, 1084 participants: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.13; I² = 52%; low certainty evidence); and probably reduces the death after 30 days post randomisation (4 studies, 1056 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.10; I² = 29%; moderate certainty evidence); however in both results the CIs included a reduction and an increase of death. Earlier start may reduce the risk of death or non-recovery kidney function (5 studies, 1076 participants: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.05; I² = 54%; low certainty evidence). Early strategy may increase the number of patients who were free of RRT after RRT discontinuation (5 studies, 1084 participants: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.40; I² = 58%; low certainty evidence) and probably slightly increases the recovery of kidney function among survivors who discontinued RRT after day 30 (5 studies, 572 participants: RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.06; I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence) compared to standard; however the lower limit of CI includes the null effect. Early RRT initiation increased the number of patients who experienced adverse events (4 studies, 899 participants: RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.16; I² = 0%; high certainty evidence). Compared to standard, earlier RRT start may reduce the number of days in ICU (4 studies, 1056 participants: MD -1.78 days, 95% CI -3.70 to 0.13; I² = 90%; low certainty evidence), but the CI included benefit and harm.

Authors' Conclusions

Based mainly on low quality of evidence identified, early RRT may reduce the risk of death and may improve the recovery of kidney function in critically patients with AKI, however the 95% CI indicates that early RRT might worsen these outcomes. There was an increased risk of adverse events with early RRT. Further adequate-powered RCTs using appropriate criteria to define the optimal time of RRT are needed to reduce the imprecision of the results.

### Acute kidney injury: short-term and long-term effects [^116YoCeZ]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common cause of organ dysfunction in critically ill adults, with a single episode of AKI, regardless of stage, carrying a significant morbidity and mortality risk. Since the consensus on AKI nomenclature has been reached, data reflecting outcomes have become more apparent allowing investigation of both short- and long-term outcomes. Classically the short-term effects of AKI can be thought of as those reflecting an acute deterioration in renal function per se. However, the effects of AKI, especially with regard to distant organ function ("organ cross-talk"), are being elucidated as is the increased susceptibility to other conditions. With regards to the long-term effects, the consideration that outcome is a simple binary endpoint of dialysis or not, or survival or not, is overly simplistic, with the reality being much more complex. Also discussed are currently available treatment strategies to mitigate these adverse effects, as they have the potential to improve patient outcome and provide considerable economic health savings. Moving forward, an agreement for defining renal recovery is warranted if we are to assess and extrapolate the efficacy of novel therapies. Future research should focus on targeted therapies assessed by measure of long-term outcomes.

### Timing of kidney replacement therapy initiation for acute kidney injury [^114kuL3u]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common condition among patients in intensive care units (ICUs) and is associated with high numbers of deaths. Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) is a blood purification technique used to treat the most severe forms of AKI. The optimal time to initiate KRT so as to improve clinical outcomes remains uncertain. This is an update of a review first published in 2018. This review complements another Cochrane review by the same authors: Intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different timing (early and standard) of KRT initiation on death and recovery of kidney function in critically ill patients with AKI.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 4 August 2022 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register, ClinicalTrials and LILACS to 1 August 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We included all patients with AKI in the ICU regardless of age, comparing early versus standard KRT initiation. For safety and cost outcomes, we planned to include cohort studies and non-RCTs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two authors. The random-effects model was used, and results were reported as risk ratios(RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference(MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included 12 studies enrolling 4880 participants. Overall, most domains were assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias. Compared to standard treatment, early KRT initiation may have little to no difference on the risk of death at day 30 (12 studies, 4826 participants: RR 0.97,95% CI 0.87 to 1.09; I² = 29%; low certainty evidence), and death after 30 days (7 studies, 4534 participants: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.07; I² = 6%; moderate certainty evidence). Early KRT initiation may make little or no difference to the risk of death or non-recovery of kidney function at 90 days (6 studies, 4011 participants: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.11; I² = 66%; low certainty evidence); CIs included both benefits and harms. Low certainty evidence showed early KRT initiation may make little or no difference to the number of patients who were free from KRT (10 studies, 4717 participants: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94 to1.22; I² = 55%) and recovery of kidney function among survivors who were free from KRT after day 30 (10 studies, 2510 participants: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.07; I² = 69%) compared to standard treatment. High certainty evidence showed early KRT initiation increased the risk of hypophosphataemia (1 study, 2927 participants: RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.44), hypotension (5 studies, 3864 participants: RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.85; I² = 0%), cardiac-rhythm disorder (6 studies, 4483 participants: RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.75; I² = 16%), and infection (5 studies, 4252 participants: RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.77; I² = 0%); however, it is uncertain whether early KRT initiation increases or reduces the number of patients who experienced any adverse events (5 studies, 3983 participants: RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.68; I² = 91%; very low certainty evidence). Moderate certainty evidence showed early KRT initiation probably reduces the number of days in hospital (7 studies, 4589 participants: MD-2.45 days, 95% CI -4.75 to -0.14; I² = 10%) and length of stay in ICU (5 studies, 4240 participants: MD -1.01 days, 95% CI -1.60 to -0.42; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on mainly low to moderate certainty of the evidence, early KRT has no beneficial effect on death and may increase the recovery of kidney function. Earlier KRT probably reduces the length of ICU and hospital stay but increases the risk of adverse events. Further adequate-powered RCTs using robust and validated tools that complement clinical judgement are needed to define the optimal time of KRT in critical patients with AKI in order to improve their outcomes. The surgical AKI population should be considered in future research.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^115bjeSL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) guideline states that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are "appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials", but concludes "there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States". The panel "generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI", while emphasizing "the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations" and "the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI". For clinical context, AKI "represents the sudden loss of kidney function, generally occurring over the course of hours to days and resulting in the retention of metabolic waste products and the development of volume overload and electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities".

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^1162zsGX]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published a guideline on the classification and management of acute kidney injury (AKI). The guideline was derived from evidence available through February 2011. Since then, new evidence has emerged that has important implications for clinical practice in diagnosing and managing AKI. In April of 2019, KDIGO held a controversies conference entitled Acute Kidney Injury with the following goals: determine best practices and areas of uncertainty in treating AKI; review key relevant literature published since the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline; address ongoing controversial issues; identify new topics or issues to be revisited for the next iteration of the KDIGO AKI guideline; and outline research needed to improve AKI management. Here, we present the findings of this conference and describe key areas that future guidelines may address.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^112TZHBx]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

In response to the recently released 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury (AKI), the National Kidney Foundation organized a group of US experts in adult and pediatric AKI and critical care nephrology to review the recommendations and comment on their relevancy in the context of current US clinical practice and concerns. The first portion of the KDIGO guideline attempts to harmonize earlier consensus definitions and staging criteria for AKI. While the expert panel thought that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials, the panel concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States. The panel generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI, although noting the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations and the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI.

### Acute kidney injury: global health alert [^115BhpEW]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly prevalent in developing and developed countries and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Most etiologies of AKI can be prevented by interventions at the individual, community, regional and in-hospital levels. Effective measures must include community-wide efforts to increase an awareness of the devastating effects of AKI and provide guidance on preventive strategies, as well as early recognition and management. Efforts should be focused on minimizing causes of AKI, increasing awareness of the importance of serial measurements of serum creatinine in high-risk patients, and documenting urine volume in acutely ill people to achieve early diagnosis; there is as yet no definitive role for alternative biomarkers. Protocols need to be developed to systematically manage prerenal conditions and specific infections. More accurate data about the true incidence and clinical impact of AKI will help to raise the importance of the disease in the community, and increase awareness of AKI by governments, the public, general and family physicians and other healthcare professionals to help prevent the disease. Prevention is the key to avoid the heavy burden of mortality and morbidity associated with AKI.

### Contrast-induced acute kidney injury and renal support for acute kidney injury: a KDIGO summary (part 2) [^111FECn1]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious problem affecting millions and causing death and disability for many. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes completed the first ever international multidisciplinary clinical practice guideline for AKI. The guideline is based on evidence review and appraisal, and covers AKI definition, risk assessment, evaluation, prevention, and treatment. Two topics, contrast-induced AKI and management of renal replacement therapy, deserve special attention because of the frequency in which they are encountered and the availability of evidence. Recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant trials. Appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed and a detailed rationale for each recommendation is provided. This review is an abridged version of the guideline and provides additional rationale and commentary for those recommendation statements that most directly impact the practice of critical care.

### Raising awareness of acute kidney injury: a global perspective of a silent killer [^1124N7BV]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Worldwide, acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with poor patient outcomes. Over the last few years, collaborative efforts, enabled by a common definition of AKI, have provided a description of the epidemiology, natural history, and outcomes of this disease and improved our understanding of the pathophysiology. There is increased recognition that AKI is encountered in multiple settings and in all age groups, and that its course and outcomes are influenced by the severity and duration of the event. The effect of AKI on an individual patient and the resulting societal burden that ensues from the long-term effects of the disease, including development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is attracting increasing scrutiny. There is evidence of marked variation in the management of AKI, which is, to a large extent, due to a lack of awareness and an absence of standards for prevention, early recognition, and intervention. These emerging data point to an urgent need for a global effort to highlight that AKI is preventable, its course is modifiable, and its treatment can improve outcomes. In this article, we provide a framework of reference and propose specific strategies to raise awareness of AKI globally, with the goal to ultimately improve outcomes from this devastating disease.

### Intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury [^1176VJbw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common condition among patients in intensive care units (ICU), and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a blood purification technique used to treat the most severe forms of AKI but its effectiveness remains unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different intensities (intensive and less intensive) of CRRT on mortality and recovery of kidney function in critically ill AKI patients.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 9 February 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE; handsearching conference proceedings; and searching the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched LILACS to 9 February 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We included all patients with AKI in ICU regardless of age, comparing intensive (usually a prescribed dose ≥ 35 mL/kg/h) versus less intensive CRRT (usually a prescribed dose < 35 mL/kg/h). For safety and cost outcomes we planned to include cohort studies and non-RCTs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two authors. The random-effects model was used and results were reported as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included six studies enrolling 3185 participants. Studies were assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias. There was no significant difference between intensive versus less intensive CRRT on mortality risk at day 30 (5 studies, 2402 participants: RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.08; I² = 75%; low quality of evidence) or after 30 days post randomisation (5 studies, 2759 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.06; I² = 65%; low quality of evidence). There were no significant differences between intensive versus less intensive CRRT in the numbers of patients who were free of RRT after CRRT discontinuation (5 studies, 2402 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.37; I² = 71%; low quality of evidence) or among survivors at day 30 (5 studies, 1415 participants: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.11; I² = 69%; low quality of evidence) and day 90 (3 studies, 988 participants: RR 0.98, IC 95% 0.94 to 1.01, I² = 0%; moderatequality of evidence). There were no significant differences between intensive and less intensive CRRT on the number of days in hospital (2 studies, 1665 participants): MD -0.23 days, 95% CI -3.35 to 2.89; I² = 8%; low quality of evidence) and the number of days in ICU (2 studies, 1665 participants: MD -0.58 days, 95% CI -3.73 to 2.56, I² = 19%; low quality of evidence). Intensive CRRT increased the risk of hypophosphataemia (1 study, 1441 participants: RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.31; high quality evidence) compared to less intensive CRRT. There was no significant differences between intensive and less intensive CRRT on numbers of patients who experienced adverse events (3 studies, 1753 participants: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.61; I² = 16%; moderate quality of evidence). In the subgroups analysis by severity of illness and by aetiology of AKI, intensive CRRT would seem to reduce the risk mortality (2 studies, 531 participants: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; I² = 0%; high quality of evidence) only in the subgroup of patients with post-surgical AKI.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the current low quality of evidence identified, more intensive CRRT did not demonstrate beneficial effects on mortality or recovery of kidney function in critically ill patients with AKI. There was an increased risk of hypophosphataemia with more intense CRRT. Intensive CRRT reduced the risk of mortality in patients with post-surgical AKI.

### Acute kidney injury [^115sSaVq]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a rapid increase in serum creatinine, decrease in urine output, or both. AKI occurs in approximately 10–15% of patients admitted to hospital, while its incidence in intensive care has been reported in more than 50% of patients. Kidney dysfunction or damage can occur over a longer period or follow AKI in a continuum with acute and chronic kidney disease. Biomarkers of kidney injury or stress are new tools for risk assessment and could possibly guide therapy. AKI is not a single disease but rather a loose collection of syndromes as diverse as sepsis, cardiorenal syndrome, and urinary tract obstruction. The approach to a patient with AKI depends on the clinical context and can also vary by resource availability. Although the effectiveness of several widely applied treatments is still controversial, evidence for several interventions, especially when used together, has increased over the past decade.

### Acute kidney injury in the critically ill: an updated review on pathophysiology and management [^112cs4jN]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The availability of a consensus definition of acute kidney injury (AKI) has been an important step in establishing AKI epidemiology. AKI affects 30–60% of critically ill patients and is associated with acute morbidity and mortality. Evidence is also accumulating that the burden of AKI extends beyond the acute phase with progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD), increased risk of cardiovascular complications, recurrent episodes of AKI and long-term mortality. Prevention of development and/or progression is currently limited to hemodynamic and fluid status optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins. Search for a specific pharmacologic treatment is hampered by the late diagnosis and the complex and incompletely elucidated pathophysiology. Progress in the management of AKI is to be expected from the recognition that AKI is a very heterogeneous syndrome with variable etiology, pathophysiology and clinical presentation.

In this narrative review, we discuss methods for early diagnosis of AKI, clinical phenotypes, pathophysiology, nephrotoxicity, optimal supportive management, as well as the importance of recovery and long-term follow-up. A discussion of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is outside the scope of this review.

### Preventing acute kidney injury and its longer-term impact in the critically ill [^111mg36D]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a sudden (within 7 days) loss of kidney function that is determined on the basis of reduced urinary output and/or increased serum creatinine levels. Acute kidney disease (AKD) includes a variety of acute and subacute kidney conditions, including AKI, lasting for up to 90 days. AKD can persist after incomplete resolution of an AKI episode or AKD can develop without ever meeting AKI criteria, for example, when kidney dysfunction evolves slowly. Kidney dysfunction lasting for > 3 months is referred to as chronic kidney disease (CKD).

As the diagnostic markers of AKI, serum creatinine (SCr) and urine output (UO), have poor sensitivity and specificity, it is possible that a healthy individual with transient volume depletion could fulfill the diagnostic criteria of AKI without having kidney injury or long-term health implications. Therefore, clinical judgement is required to diagnose AKI and consider the clinical context. AKI persisting despite volume repletion likely reflects structural damage to the kidney. Similarly, drugs that affect glomerular filtration may cause small changes in SCr levels that are not necessarily indicative of kidney injury.

AKI is a syndrome affecting 10–15% of hospitalized patients and more than 50% of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is associated with acute morbidity and mortality. AKI can be caused by different etiologies and the large spectrum of AKI implies diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. Recent evidence demonstrates that the AKI burden extends beyond the acute phase with progression to CKD, recurrent episodes of AKI, increased risk of cardiovascular complications, and reduced long-term survival. Finding specific pharmacologic treatment is hampered by the late diagnosis and the fact that AKI is a very heterogeneous syndrome with variable etiology, pathophysiology and clinical presentation. Existing animal models fail to recapitulate the complexity of human AKI, which is often multifactorial. In addition, many clinical trials do not enroll patients with the precise mechanisms and timing modeled in animal experiments thereby limiting translation. Therefore, the main focus lies on preventing AKI development and progression. Recently, several trials have identified measures to prevent the development of AKI in different settings.

In this narrative review, we discuss methods for early diagnosis of AKI, AKI-CKD transition, preventive strategies, as well as the choice of endpoints for AKI prevention trials. A discussion of other AKI etiologies (e.g. glomerulonephritis, vasculitis), AKI management and renal replacement therapy (RRT) is outside the scope of this review.

Key messages

- AKI is a complex disorder, and we have proposed uniform standards for diagnosing and classifying AKI on the basis of existing systems (that is, RIFLE). These proposals will require validation.

- Our recommendations have been endorsed by participating societies that represent the majority of critical care and nephrology societies worldwide.

- These recommendations provide a stepping stone to standardizing the care of patients with AKI and will greatly enhance our ability to design prospective studies to evaluate potential prevention and treatment strategies.

- Future clinical and translational research in AKI will require the development of collaborative networks. The AKIN was formed to provide an effective mechanism for facilitating such efforts.

### Effect of acute kidney injury care bundles on patient prognosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116vu6Fh]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI), a heterogeneous clinical syndrome and significant challenge in modern medicine, is prevalent among hospitalized patients and demonstrates substantial mortality during the acute phase. Its progression to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease significantly increases the risk, accompanied by substantial growth in medical costs. Epidemiological data indicate that approximately 13.3 million people experience AKI annually and 1.7 million die of AKI, with a mortality rate as high as 50% among AKI patients requiring renal replacement therapy. A retrospective multi-center study involving hospitalized patients from China revealed an AKI incidence rate of 11.6% among hospitalized patients, with a nosocomial AKI of 9.1% and an in-hospital AKI mortality rate of 8.8%. Therefore, early identification of AKI and effective treatment and management are crucial strategies to prevent the progression of adverse outcomes.

Notwithstanding the current absence of disease-modifying therapies for AKI, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) consortium established evidence-based clinical practice guidelines in 2012, prioritizing three core management pillars: hemodynamic optimization through volume resuscitation, mitigation of nephrotoxic exposures, and stringent glycemic control. These preventive and management measures are referred to as "care bundles". Care bundles are defined as a structured approach to improving care processes and patient outcomes, which consists of a set of small, direct evidence-based practices, treatments, and/or interventions tailored to specific patient populations or groups and care environments. When collectively applied, care bundles significantly enhances care reliability and patient outcomes beyond the expected effects of individual implementations. It is worth noting that there are certain differences in the bundle of care for Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), and the basic components and specific objectives are not yet clearly defined. Data from clinical study indicated that care bundles represent one of the most promising care models for preventing disease progression in AKI patients, which can not only reduce the AKI incidence but also achieve better renal outcomes following AKI. Therefore, this study is designed to investigate the positive effect of AKI care bundles on patients through a systematic review, thereby providing a reference basis for optimizing clinical practices in AKI care.

### Optimising the timing of renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury [^114Uwnb3]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

The optimal timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) has been much debated. Over the past five years several studies have provided new guidance for evidence-based decision-making. High-quality evidence now supports an approach of expectant management in critically ill patients with AKI, where RRT may be deferred up to 72 h unless a life-threatening indication develops. Nevertheless, physicians' judgment still plays a central role in identifying appropriate patients for expectant management.

### Management of patients at risk of acute kidney injury [^115WnXbc]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a multifaceted syndrome that occurs in different settings. The course of AKI can be variable, from single hit and complete recovery, to multiple hits resulting in end-stage renal disease. No interventions to improve outcomes of established AKI have yet been developed, so prevention and early diagnosis are key. Awareness campaigns and education for health-care professionals on diagnosis and management of AKI-with attention to avoidance of volume depletion, hypotension, and nephrotoxic interventions-coupled with electronic early warning systems where available can improve outcomes. Biomarker-based strategies have not shown improvements in outcome. Fluid management should aim for early, rapid restoration of circulatory volume, but should be more limited after the first 24–48 h to avoid volume overload. Use of balanced crystalloid solutions versus normal saline remains controversial. Renal replacement therapy should only be started on the basis of hard criteria, but should not be delayed when criteria are met. On the basis of recent evidence, the risk of contrast-induced AKI might be overestimated for many conditions.

### Early versus late initiation of renal replacement therapy in patients with acute kidney injury-a systematic review&meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113VoPa8]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in the critically ill patients and associated with a substantial morbidity and mortality. Severe AKI may be associated with up to 60% hospital mortality. Over the years, renal replacement therapy (RRT) has emerged as the mainstay of the treatment for AKI. However, the exact timing of initiation of RRT for better patient outcome is still debatable with conflicting data from randomized controlled trials. Thus, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to assess the impact of "early" versus "late" initiation of RRT.

Methods

All the published literature through the major databases including Medline/Pubmed, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched from 1970 to October 2016. Reference lists from the articles were reviewed to identify additional pertinent articles. Retrieved papers concerning the effect of "early/prophylactic" RRT versus "late/as and when required" RRT were reviewed by the authors, and the data were extracted using a standardized data collection tool. Randomized trials (RCTs) comparing early initiation of RRT or prophylactic RRT with late or as and when required RRT were included. The primary outcome measures were all cause mortality and dialysis dependence on day 90. The secondary outcome measures were: length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, recovery of renal function and adverse events.

Results

Of the 547 citation retrieved, full text of 44 articles was assessed for eligibility. Of these a total of 10 RCTs with 1,636 participants were included. All the trials were open label; six trials have unclear or high risk of bias for allocation concealment while four trials have low risk of bias for allocation concealment. There was a variable definition of early versus late in different studies. Thus, the definition of early or late was taken according to individual study definition. Compared to late RRT, there was no significant benefit of early RRT on day 30 mortality [6 studies; 1301 participants; RR, 0.92;95% CI: 0.76, 1.12); day 60 mortality [3 trials;1075 participants; RR, 0.94; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.14)]; day 90 mortality [3 trials; 555 participants; RR,0.94;95% CI: 0.67, 1.33)]; overall ICU or hospital mortality; dialysis dependence on day 90 [3 trials; (RR, 1.06; 95% CI:0.53, 2.12)]. There was no significant difference between length of ICU or hospital stay or recovery of renal functions. A subgroup analysis based on modality of RRT or mixed medical and surgical vs. surgical or based on severity of illness showed no difference in outcome measure. The trials with high or unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment showed benefit of early RRT (RR, 0.74; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.91) while the trials with low risk of bias for allocation concealment showed no difference in the mortality (RR, 1.02; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.17). Grade evidence generated for most of the outcomes was "low quality".

Conclusion

This updated meta-analysis showed no added benefit of early initiation of RRT for patients with AKI. The grade evidence generated was of "low quality" and there was a high heterogeneity in the included trials.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and is associated with serious short- and long-term complications.

### Recommendations for clinical trial design in acute kidney injury from the 31st Acute Disease Quality Initiative consensus conference. A consensus statement [^115YzZYU]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Phase 2 trials evaluate the efficacy of drugs or devices, in preventing the occurrence of new kidney damage or injury and to determine mechanistic pathways and establish biological plausibility for the interventions. These trials are usually smaller than phase 3 trials. Markers of kidney function may be more sensitive than clinical AKI at indicating whether an intervention affects kidney function. Similarly, measuring kidney damage markers, such as urine sediment, proteinuria, or biomarkers, may allow evaluation whether the intervention mitigates new, or different types of damage in the kidneys. In phase 3 trials, the efficacy and safety of interventions are evaluated in larger patient cohorts. As the goal of these interventions is to prevent AKI, we recommend a primary endpoint of KDIGO-defined AKI.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^1164os86]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline suggested initiating RRT emergently in the presence of life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid–base balance. Since 2012, data from several RCTs and observational studies have become available. However, the optimal timing for acute RRT remains unknown. It has been proposed that initiation of RRT should be considered when metabolic and fluid demands exceed the kidney's capacity to meet them. – This concept acknowledges the dynamic nature of acute illness and stresses the importance of regular evaluation of the demand and renal capacity relationship. However, the exact methods for determining demand and capacity are unknown. Existing evidence does not support using biomarkers when deciding whether to initiate RRT. Use of a standardized FST can be considered in AKI, to further quantify the likelihood of AKI progression, and integrated into the spectrum of clinical information available when planning for and deciding to initiate RRT. In determining whether or not to start RRT, risk of complications, global prognosis, potential for recovery, and patient preferences should be considered (Figure 3). Although some regions of the globe have challenges and constraints in providing universal access to RRT, we recommend a similar approach be undertaken for considering for whom and when to start RRT in all regions. – Additionally, a similar approach should be undertaken in both intensive care unit and non–intensive care unit settings.

### A comparison of early versus late initiation of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111izhxz]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The utilization of RRT in critically ill patients with AKI is relatively common. Importantly, the incidence is increasing. These critically ill patients have a risk of death approaching 60%. The decision to initiate RRT is a modifiable intervention for these patients; however, it also represents a significant escalation in the complexity and cost of their support. The current uncertainty over the optimal time to initiate RRT is a critical knowledge gap in evidence that has almost certainly contributed to the wide variation in clinical practice. Moreover, this has been further compounded by a lack of consensus and a standardised definition for "early" RRT. There are currently numerous clinical, biochemical, and physiological factors that are considered when deciding to initiate RRT; however, there remains no consensus guidelines or rigorous evidence to guide clinicians on this important issue. This is analogous to the uncertainty regarding the optimal dose-intensity of RRT in critically ill patients with AKI that was largely settled by the recent publication of two large randomised trials. A future randomised trial will ideally require broad-based consensus on eligibility criteria and operational definitions for 'early' and 'standard' initiation of RRT in critically ill patients to ensure feasibility and adequate separation of treatment arms. In addition, such a study may benefit from the integration of novel kidney-injury specific biomarkers to aid in the prediction of those who will develop worsening AKI. Understanding methods to further optimise the delivery of acute RRT for critically ill patients with AKI is of utmost importance to improve patient outcomes, guide resource utilization, and rationally deliver standardised care.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^116uvW8Z]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome characterised by a rapid (hours to days) deterioration of kidney function. It is often diagnosed in the context of other acute illnesses and is particularly common in critically ill patients. The clinical consequences of AKI include the accumulation of waste products, electrolytes, and fluid, but also less obvious effects, including reduced immunity and dysfunction of non-renal organs (organ cross-talk).

The impact and prognosis of AKI vary considerably depending on the severity, clinical setting, comorbid factors, and also geographical location. There is increasing evidence that AKI is associated with serious short- and long-term complications, in particular increased mortality and morbidity, the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and high financial healthcare costs. As such, AKI is now recognized as a major public health problem.

Rapid diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic workup are essential to identify those types of AKI where specific therapies and interventions are available to reverse the injurious process within the kidneys. This review will summarise the key aspects of diagnosis and diagnostic work-up with particular focus on patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^114YTEht]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary — evaluation and management positions for AKI state that the authors "strongly concur with the KDIGO recommendations that the cause of AKI should be determined whenever possible" and that "patients with AKI should be evaluated promptly to determine the cause, with special attention to reversible causes", but they express concerns that "the stage-based management recommendations… are not adequately evidence based" and "implicitly assume homogeneity within each AKI stage and successive increases in severity across stages". They note "the lack of correlation between serum creatinine level and GFR in the acute setting", such that increases in serum creatinine can yield "apparent progression in AKI stage, despite improvement in GFR", and describe the recommendations as "relatively nonspecific and unlikely to help in daily clinical practice". They caution that "development of clinical action plans based on AKI stage may result in inappropriate protocolization of care", and cite examples where "waiting until stage 2 AKI to check for changes in drug dosing" is implied and recommendations to consider renal replacement therapy (RRT) and "intensive care unit admission in stage 2 AKI seem premature". They also "agree with the emphasis on close postdischarge clinical evaluation of patients with moderate to severe AKI".

The KDIGO guidelines for acute kidney injury (AKI) are designed to assist health-care providers around the world in managing patients with AKI. Clinical guidelines are intended to help the clinician make an informed decision based on review of the currently available evidence. Due to the generic nature of guidelines, it is sometimes difficult to translate a guideline for a particular individual patient who may have specific clinical circumstances. To illustrate this point, we have discussed the interpretation of the KDIGO guideline in patients who have subtleties in their clinical presentation, which may make treatment decisions less than straightforward.

### Acute kidney injury [^113LsPJo]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a sudden loss of excretory kidney function. AKI is part of a range of conditions summarized as acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD), in which slow deterioration of kidney function or persistent kidney dysfunction is associated with an irreversible loss of kidney cells and nephrons, which can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD). New biomarkers to identify injury before function loss await clinical implementation. AKI and AKD are a global concern. In low-income and middle-income countries, infections and hypovolaemic shock are the predominant causes of AKI. In high-income countries, AKI mostly occurs in elderly patients who are in hospital, and is related to sepsis, drugs or invasive procedures. Infection and trauma-related AKI and AKD are frequent in all regions. The large spectrum of AKI implies diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. AKI management in critical care settings is challenging, including appropriate volume control, nephrotoxic drug management, and the timing and type of kidney support. Fluid and electrolyte management are essential. As AKI can be lethal, kidney replacement therapy is frequently required. AKI has a poor prognosis in critically ill patients. Long-term consequences of AKI and AKD include CKD and cardiovascular morbidity. Thus, prevention and early detection of AKI are essential.

### Acute kidney injury: short-term and long-term effects [^112jnkKQ]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The finding that critically unwell patients with AKI who survive the index case continue to have increased morbidity and mortality long-term remains unexplained, but is significant. Future research should focus on these patients with targeted therapies assessed by measure of long-term outcomes.

A consensus agreement for defining renal recovery is warranted if we are to assess and extrapolate the efficacy of novel therapies. Currently available treatment strategies have the potential to improve patient outcome and provide considerable economic health savings provided they are adopted early in the course of the patient's illness with appropriate specialist follow-up to be recommended.

### A comparison of early versus late initiation of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117NTb7S]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, our systematic review suggests that early institution of RRT in critically ill patients with AKI may have a measurable benefit on survival. However, existing evidence is based on mostly smaller studies with important differences in design and quality, and only two randomised trials. In the absence of novel evidence from a multi-centric suitably-designed randomised trial, conclusive treatment recommendations on the optimal time to initiate RRT remain uncertain. Future investigation must be targeted at defining acceptable "early" RRT criteria and determining whether "early" initiation of RRT, compared with the current standard-of-care, has an important modifying influence on short- and long-term survival and kidney recovery.

### Trends in hospitalizations for acute kidney injury-United States, 2000–2014 [^111pc4Gq]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury increases the risk of developing or exacerbating underlying chronic kidney disease (gradual loss of kidney function over time). National health (Healthy People 2020;) objectives call for renal evaluation of patients hospitalized for acute kidney injury 6 months after discharge to monitor kidney function and prevent or delay onset of chronic kidney disease. CDC's Chronic Kidney Disease Surveillance System monitors the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and its risk factors (including acute kidney injury) in the U.S. population and tracks progress in its prevention, management, and control.

Improving both patient and provider awareness that diabetes, hypertension, and advancing age are frequently associated with acute kidney injury is important for reversing these trends. Elderly persons have physiologically reduced kidney function and functional reserve with the appearance of global sclerosis, but also more comorbidity than do young adults, all of which heighten older persons' susceptibility to nephrotoxic medicines, dyes used for imaging, and even dehydration, all preventable risks for acute kidney injury. Better recognition of risk factors for acute kidney injury by health care providers might improve the effectiveness of treatment of underlying conditions and prevent or mitigate additional kidney insult to patients, particularly among those hospitalized or in long-term care.

### Recommendations on acute kidney injury biomarkers from the Acute Disease Quality Initiative consensus conference: a consensus statement [^1128wWJv]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

In the last decade, new biomarkers for acute kidney injury (AKI) have been identified and studied in clinical trials. Guidance is needed regarding how best to incorporate them into clinical practice.

Objective

To develop recommendations on AKI biomarkers based on existing data and expert consensus for practicing clinicians and researchers.

Evidence Review

At the 23rd Acute Disease Quality Initiative meeting, a meeting of 23 international experts in critical care, nephrology, and related specialties, the panel focused on 4 broad areas, as follows: (1) AKI risk assessment; (2) AKI prediction and prevention; (3) AKI diagnosis, etiology, and management; and (4) AKI progression and kidney recovery. A literature search revealed more than 65 000 articles published between 1965 and May 2019. In a modified Delphi process, recommendations and consensus statements were developed based on existing data, with 90% agreement among panel members required for final adoption. Recommendations were graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations system.

Findings

The panel developed 11 consensus statements for biomarker use and 14 research recommendations. The key suggestions were that a combination of damage and functional biomarkers, along with clinical information, be used to identify high-risk patient groups, improve the diagnostic accuracy of AKI, improve processes of care, and assist the management of AKI.

Conclusions and Relevance

Current evidence from clinical studies supports the use of new biomarkers in prevention and management of AKI. Substantial gaps in knowledge remain, and more research is necessary.

### Advances in the diagnosis of early biomarkers for acute kidney injury: a literature review [^112DoURG]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous group of conditions, typically occurring in the context of acute or chronic illness, characterized by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), accompanied by an increase in serum creatinine concentration or a decrease in urine output. The term "acute" refers to kidney dysfunction occurring within hours to days, while "kidney injury" implies a potentially reversible condition that, if not promptly addressed, may progress to acute kidney disease (AKD) and even chronic kidney disease (CKD). AKI affects 15–20% of hospitalized patients, doubling the risk of in-hospital mortality and increasing the risk of CKD by fourfold. Current clinical diagnosis relies on serum creatinine levels, but its lagging nature limits the early diagnosis and treatment of AKI. As a marker of GFR, creatinine only increases when there is a significant drop in GFR or substantial parenchymal damage, and it does not reflect specific pathological processes. AKI primarily affects the tubules, with changes in GFR typically occurring only after tubular damage has progressed. The absence of changes in creatinine levels may lead to false reassurance, resulting in inappropriate medication dosing or delays in discontinuing nephrotoxic agents, thereby increasing the risk of worsening kidney injury.

Biomarkers are defined and categorized according to the BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) resource from the joint task force of the FDA and NIH, covering functions such as diagnosis, monitoring, prognosis, and prediction, and guiding the application of clinical and surrogate endpoint biomarkers. Ideally, biomarkers should be validated in multicenter and prospective cohorts, and tested in clinical trials for their impact on patient outcomes. As many researchers have advocated, in AKI, an ideal biomarker may not replace serum creatinine (SCr) and urine output but should be considered of additional value. In recent years, biomarkers for tubular injury, inflammation and repair, renal filtration, and oxidative stress have shown significant potential in the early detection and prognosis of AKI (Fig. 1). However, their clinical implementation faces challenges in terms of technology and validation, requiring large-scale studies to confirm their effectiveness. This review summarizes the current state of early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for AKI, exploring their prospects in clinical practice and providing guidance to improve the diagnosis and treatment of AKI.

Key messages

- The overall design and quality of studies comparing early versus late initiation of RRT in critically ill patients with AKI is low.

- Earlier initiation of RRT in critically ill patients with AKI may have a beneficial impact on survival.

- A well-designed randomised trial targeting acceptable 'early' compared with "standard" criteria for RRT initiation in homogenous patient populations is needed to definitively determine the effect of RRT timing on patient outcomes.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) epidemiology and outcomes — clinical burden — span multiple settings, and severe disease in critical illness is frequent and lethal; "severe AKI occurs in > 5% of critically ill patients and is associated with mortality rates of 40%-70%". Although "recovery of kidney function occurs in the majority of patients surviving an episode of AKI, many patients remain dialysis dependent or are left with severe renal impairment", and "even patients who have complete or near-complete recovery of kidney function are at increased risk of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD)" with superimposed AKI on CKD "associated with acceleration in the rate of progression to end-stage disease".

### Early, individualized recommendations for hospitalized patients with acute kidney injury: a randomized clinical trial [^114XM4ks]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study KAT-AKI was published by Abinet M Aklilu and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute kidney injury. In the KAT-AKI study, the trial question was: what is the role of recommendations from a kidney action team in patients hospitalized with AKI? In the KAT-AKI study, the study design was: multi-center, single blinded, RCT. In the KAT-AKI study, the population was: 4003 patients (1874 female, 2129 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients hospitalized with AKI. The key exclusion criteria were renal failure undergoing dialysis; stage 5 CKD; admission creatinine levels > 4 mg/dL; solid organ transplant; acute ingestion of dialyzable toxins. In the KAT-AKI study, the interventions were: n = 1999 receipt of recommendation note (kidney action team sent personalized recommendations via electronic health record) n = 2004 usual care (no recommendation sent via electronic health record). In the KAT-AKI study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the rate of AKI progression to a higher stage of AKI, dialysis, or death occurring while hospitalized and within 14 days from randomization (19.8% vs. 18.4%; AD 1.4%, 95% CI -1.1 to 3.8). In the KAT-AKI study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in AKI progression (13.5% vs. 13%; AD 0.5%, 95% CI -1.6 to 2.6) No significant difference in death (9.6% vs. 9.2%; AD 0.4%, 95% CI -1.5 to 2.1) No significant difference in dialysis (1.6% vs. 1.5%; AD 0.1%, 95% CI -0.7 to 0.8). In the KAT-AKI study, the conclusion was: in adult patients hospitalized with AKI, receipt of recommendation note was not superior to usual care with respect to the rate of AKI progression to a higher stage of AKI, dialysis, or death occurring while hospitalized and within 14 days from randomization.

### Recommendations for clinical trial design in acute kidney injury from the 31st Acute Disease Quality Initiative consensus conference. A consensus statement [^117Ucd4X]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Prevention and attenuation studies

We recommend that when selecting endpoints for AKI prevention studies, investigators consider trial design and endpoint characteristics including: i) biological plausibility; ii) validity in the target population; iii) practicality; and iv) patient centeredness.

Numerous factors should be considered when selecting appropriate endpoints for trials examining prevention or attenuation (interventions after exposure but before clinical manifestation) of AKI with some measure of acute injury, damage, stress, or dysfunction as the primary endpoint (Fig. 1, supplementary Tables 3, 4, and 5). Moreover, endpoint selection should be appropriate for the trial phase. Surrogate endpoints of kidney injury (e.g. functional, damage or stress biomarkers) may be appropriate for phase 2 trials where they capture the effect of the intervention and allow inference of likely clinical outcomes. However, for phase 3 trials, an internationally accepted consensus definition of AKI (currently based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 criteria) may be preferable. It makes intuitive sense to measure the occurrence of AKI if the goal of an intervention is to prevent it. The severity of AKI chosen as the primary endpoint in phase 3 trials requires consideration regarding tradeoff between statistical power (as gained by including all stages of AKI) and identification of definitive renal injury (as is more likely when only severe AKI is studied). Major adverse kidney events (MAKE) is usually not an appropriate endpoint for prevention trials, because the rate of events is too low, and it may be affected by several factors apart from the AKI event. Safety, cost-effectiveness, patient-centered outcome measures, and resource utilization may also be important outcomes for secondary endpoints in phase 2–3 or as primary endpoints for phase 4 studies.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^114zgDTg]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury (AKI) — KDOQI US commentary conclusion states that the work group "recognizes the need for a consensus definition of AKI and commends KDIGO for harmonizing the prior definitions and staging criteria", but "do not believe that it is sufficiently validated for use in the diagnosis and clinical management of patients with AKI", and that management "should be based on assessment of overall clinical status, including specific cause of AKI, trends in kidney function over time, comorbid conditions, assessment of volume status, and concomitant acid-base and electrolyte disturbances". For prevention and nondialytic management, they "generally agreed" yet "note the paucity of high-level evidence and the absence of highly effective therapies", and "can support the use of protocol-based management of perioperative patients and patients with sepsis" while stating such protocols "need to be further developed and validated" and that they "do not believe that there are sufficient data to benchmark care". Regarding renal replacement therapy (RRT), "we are in general agreement with the KDIGO recommendations", but "Given the lack of FDA-approved citrate solutions for regional anticoagulation during CRRT, we do not believe that this approach can be currently recommended; however, we believe that this will need to be reconsidered if appropriate citrate solutions become available". They also note that KDIGO provides "little discussion of the modalities of PIRRT" and "believe that these modalities are a reasonable alternative to CRRT in hemodynamically unstable patients".

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^115tb9kd]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) after surgery has been consistently associated with long-term morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Furthermore, the relationship persists even among patients with complete renal recovery, or patients with minor perturbations in renal function not reaching the threshold for AKI. The mechanism, pathogenesis, and risk factors for postoperative AKI vary significantly by surgical type and corresponding perioperative stressors.

Because treatment options for postoperative AKI are limited, perioperative management has traditionally focused on prevention and diagnosis. Identifying prerenal (hypoperfusion), postrenal (outflow obstruction), and intrinsic renal (ischemic or nephrotoxic injury) causes are crucial first steps in the management of AKI. Additionally, the 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines emphasize severity-based management of AKI. In patients with normal kidney function and mild AKI, management focuses on rapid identification and avoidance of nephrotoxic insults plus attention to volume status and renal perfusion pressure. As the severity of AKI increases, the accompanying disruption to acid–base status and electrolyte balance may necessitate focused medical and supportive therapies, with renal replacement therapy and/or intensive care admission for the most severe cases.

In this review, we define AKI in the perioperative setting, describe the epidemiologic burden, discuss procedure-specific risk factors, detail principles of management, and highlight areas of ongoing controversy and research.

### Management of acute kidney injury associated with COVID-19: what have we learned? [^116Mioba]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although initially kidney involvement in COVID-19 infection was felt to occur relatively infrequently, this has proved not to be the case. In critically ill patients with COVID-19, multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and is associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. This review focuses briefly on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of COVID-19 associated AKI as well as options for management.

Recent Findings

The risk factors for AKI are common to both noncovid-related AKI and COVID-19 associated AKI. Kidney injury in COVID-19 associated AKI may arise through several mechanisms, including not only direct effects on the kidney leading to tubular injury but also through the effects of treatment of multiorgan failure complicating infection. During surge conditions, the use of kidney replacement therapy has embraced all modalities including the use of peritoneal dialysis. The use of blood purification techniques has been proposed, but to date, the results are variable.

Summary

COVID-19 associated AKI is common, affecting approximately a quarter of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Glomerular injury can occur, but in the main tubular injury seems most likely leading to AKI, which should be managed following clinical pathways informed by accepted guidelines.

### Initiative: recommendations for awareness, recognition, and management of AKI [^113EJC6w]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Society of Nephrology has established a new initiative, AKI!Now, with the goal of promoting excellence in the prevention and treatment of AKI by building a foundational program that transforms education and delivery of AKI care, aiming to reduce morbidity and associated mortality and to improve long-term outcomes. In this article, we describe our current efforts to improve early recognition and management involving inclusive interdisciplinary collaboration between providers, patients, and their families; discuss the ongoing need to change some of our current AKI paradigms and diagnostic methods; and provide specific recommendations to improve AKI recognition and care. In the hospital and the community, AKI is a common and increasingly frequent condition that generates risks of adverse events and high costs. Unfortunately, patients with AKI may frequently have received less than optimal quality of care. New classifications have facilitated understanding of AKI incidence and its impact on outcomes, but they are not always well aligned with AKI pathophysiology. Despite ongoing research efforts, treatments to promote or hasten kidney recovery remain ineffective. To avoid progression, the current approach to AKI emphasizes the promotion of early recognition and timely response. However, a lack of awareness of the importance of early recognition and treatment among health care team members and the heterogeneity of approaches within the health care teams assessing the patient remains a major challenge. Early identification is further complicated by differences in settings where AKI occurs (the community or the hospital), and by differences in patient populations and cultures between the intensive care unit and ward environments. To address these obstacles, we discuss the need to improve education at all levels of care and to generate specific guidance on AKI evaluation and management, including the development of a widely applicable education and an AKI management toolkit, engaging hospital administrators to incorporate AKI as a quality initiative, and raising awareness of AKI as a complication of other disease processes.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^116g6S8T]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Although much of the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline remains state of the art, advances over the past decade have improved our understanding of best practices. Many of these advances are widely accepted (e.g. nephrotoxic medication stewardship, shared decision making for RRT), but others are more controversial (Table 5). Although some centers and specific programs have embraced new technologies and ways of thinking, others have taken a more conservative, or "wait-and-see" approach. Even among conference participants, there was lack of unanimity for various perspectives, and obvious practice variation continues to exist, even among experts. Perhaps more than any new trial or discovery, this fact provides ample rationale for revisiting the AKI guideline in the near future.

### Recommendations for clinical trial design in acute kidney injury from the 31st Acute Disease Quality Initiative consensus conference. A consensus statement [^117CpcC2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The main objective for a phase 3 trial of treatment for AKI is to establish the effectiveness of the treatment to modify outcomes that are important to patients or society. Regulatory bodies have accepted the MAKE endpoint as indicative of an intervention that meets the "feels, functions or survives" concept of an effective treatment for AKI. However, achieving success with MAKE has proved difficult and this, in turn, has led to efforts to provide suitable alternatives. The selection of endpoints for phase 3 trials of treatments for AKI have often focused on conventional endpoints with clinical importance and composite endpoints (Table 1). These endpoints may align with the principles of patient-centeredness but have seldom been directly informed by PWLE. Composite endpoints have the recognized advantage of improving trial efficiency but they also have drawbacks (Table 2). Selected composite endpoints can have importance to both PWLE and potentially society as a whole. For example, "organ-support"-free days, ICU-free days or alive and out-of-hospital are composite endpoints that integrate both patient centeredness and resource utilization. The increased use of hierarchical composite endpoints (HCE) (e.g. win ratio) represents an innovation that we suggest can be applied to treatment trials in AKI and also be leveraged to integrate outcomes perceived as important to PWLE. HCE select a range of endpoints ranked in order of importance (supplementary Fig. 3). Their advantages and disadvantages have been reviewed elsewhere. One disadvantage of the win ratio is that this strategy does not allow for an accurate calculation of the number needed to harm or treat (magnitude of the overall effect). Another limitation is that, although hierarchically ordered, each component of the hierarchical endpoint is weighted the same when using the win ratio, so it could be driven by its least clinically meaningful component. Surrogate measures with correlation to clinically important outcomes can also be integrated into HCE. Innovation in selection of endpoints and in the analytic strategies utilized may further improve and simplify the interpretation of phase 3 trials for PWLE and knowledge users of health research, along with facilitation of clinical adoption.

### Acute kidney injury [^114DQC2P]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by a sudden decrease in glomerular filtration rate, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine concentration or oliguria, and classified by stage and cause. This type of injury occurs in approximately 20% of hospitalized patients, with major complications including volume overload, electrolyte disorders, uremic complications, and drug toxicity. Management includes specific treatments according to the underlying cause and supportive treatment to prevent and manage complications. Kidney replacement therapy is used when complications cannot be managed with medical therapy alone. Despite advances in care, the mortality rate in patients requiring kidney replacement therapy remains approximately 50%.

### Recent developments in the detection and management of acute kidney injury [^114ERJ3r]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common condition in children admitted to hospital and existing serum and urine biomarkers are insensitive. There have been significant developments in stratifying the risk of AKI in children and also in the identification of new AKI biomarkers. Risk stratification coupled with a panel of AKI biomarkers will improve future detection of AKI, however, paediatric validation studies in mixed patient cohorts are required. The principles of effective management rely on treating the underlying cause and preventing secondary AKI by the appropriate use of fluids and medication. Further therapeutic innovation will depend on improving our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying AKI in children.

### Systematic review and subgroup analysis of the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19 [^111pdfXo]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to more than 60 million infections and over 1 million deaths worldwide. The mortality due to COVID-19 is particularly high among older patients with chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease and cardiac disease. In 2003, the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with SARS was reported to be 6.7, and 91.7% of patients who died were diagnosed with AKI as a complication. Recent studies have suggested that the incidence of AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 has a wide range and that AKI is associated with a poor prognosis. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is usually required for critically ill COVID-19 patients, not only for the treatment of AKI but also to effectively eliminate the cytokine storm. The need for CRRT in COVID-19 patients should be evaluated.

Given the current ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, there is a need to identify safe and effective treatment options. Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, has been shown to have antiviral activity against several RNA viruses, including MERS-CoV and Ebola virus (EV). As remdesivir was found to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in a mouse model, it has been authorized for the treatment of COVID-19 patients in some countries, including the United States. The incidence of AKI in COVID-19 patients being treated with remdesivir is still uncertain. Overall, the exact incidence rate and characteristics of AKI associated with COVID-19 are not well understood. In this study, we performed a systematic review of the incidence of AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^115z8HhV]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients who progress to stage 2 AKI, adjusting drug dosages to account for glomerular filtration and careful attention to volume input or output become important. Stage 3 AKI is associated with acid–base imbalance, altered electrolyte levels, and accumulation of uremic toxins. Decisions on the need for intensive care and initiation of kidney replacement therapy require expertise in nephrology or critical care medicine and should be considered early in disease progression.

Phase of care, monitoring, and follow-up can vary greatly depending on the severity of disease. The KDIGO clinical practice guidelines recommend that all patients diagnosed with AKI are evaluated at 3 months to screen for new or progressive chronic kidney disease, while the Acute Disease Quality Initiative and PeriOperative Quality Initiative recommend all postoperative patients with AKI or acute kidney disease have a kidney health assessment within 30 days of hospital discharge. As morbidity and mortality increase with severity of AKI (and in patients without renal recovery), these factors should inform the frequency and nature of follow-up. Management of AKI during the period of inpatient hospitalization provides an opportunity to prevent or delay progression of AKI to chronic kidney disease. Patients requiring acute renal replacement therapy (or necessitate continuous renal replacement therapy due to hemodynamic instability) should be managed in the ICU. Furthermore, a variety of critical conditions associated with AKI including shock, sepsis, acid–base imbalance, and respiratory failure secondary to fluid overload require intensive care. The KDIGO management guidelines recommend considering ICU admission beginning at stage 2 AKI.

### Acute kidney injury: short-term and long-term effects [^111QZom7]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common cause of organ dysfunction in critically ill adults with an incidence of around 34%, and carries an observed in-hospital mortality as high as 62%. Indeed, even a single episode of AKI carries a significant morbidity and mortality risk, with an episode of stage 1 AKI complicating a critical illness being independently associated with an increase in 10-year mortality. Moreover, the long-term effects of AKI also contribute significantly to health costs and, in the UK, has been estimated to account for about 1% of the total health and social care budget.

In this narrative review we will consider how, since a consensus has been reached, the effects of kidney injury on both short- and long-term outcomes have been highlighted.

### Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury-treatment standard [^114KVotC]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a host's deleterious response to infection, which could lead to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is the most frequent organ dysfunction and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Sepsis contributes to ≈50% of all AKI in critically ill adult patients. A growing body of evidence has unveiled key aspects of the clinical risk factors, pathobiology, response to treatment and elements of renal recovery that have advanced our ability to detect, prevent and treat SA-AKI. Despite these advancements, SA-AKI remains a critical clinical condition and a major health burden, and further studies are needed to diminish the short and long-term consequences of SA-AKI. We review the current treatment standards and discuss novel developments in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, outcome prediction and management of SA-AKI.

Conclusion

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome defined by a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output as per KDIGO classification. Future definitions are likely to incorporate novel functional and damage biomarkers to characterise AKI better. Early diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic work-up are essential to determine the underlying aetiology and to identify cases of AKI that require specific and timely therapeutic interventions. The exact diagnostic investigations depend on the clinical context and should include routine baseline tests as well as more specific and novel tools.

### Impact of AKI care bundles on kidney and patient outcomes in hospitalized patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Sxyba]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the PRISMA guidelines (Supplementary Table 1). The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020207523).

Eligibility criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCT's), retrospective and prospective observational, propensity-matched or intervention studies on the implementation of a care bundle for AKI. The studied population were adult and paediatric patients (ICU, emergency department, medical and surgical wards) with AKI or at risk of AKI during hospitalization.

Only articles published in English, Dutch, Spanish and French were included in this meta-analysis. Articles on AKI in outpatient setting and primary care were excluded as well as articles concerning care bundles on sepsis, liver cirrhosis, resuscitation, or other bundles in which AKI was not the main focus. Case reports, reviews, editorials, intervention studies evaluating a specific treatment, duplicate publications and articles which did not report on the outcome measures were excluded. The KDIGO practice guideline for AKI recommended the concept of a specific AKI bundle in 2012. Therefore, we included studies published since 2012.

Outcomes and prioritization

The review was restricted to studies that report compliance of care bundles, kidney outcomes such as occurrence of AKI and moderate to severe AKI (KDIGO stage 2 and 3), in-hospital use of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) and kidney recovery and patient outcomes (ICU, in-hospital and 30-day all-cause mortality and ICU and hospital length-of-stay or LOS).

### A comparison of early versus late initiation of renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury in critically ill patients: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1147ppdG]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

To investigate the impact of timing the initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) on clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), focusing on the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this field.

Methods

The PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched between January 1, 1985, and June 30, 2016, to identify randomized trials that assessed the timing of initiation of RRT in patients with AKI.

Results

Nine RCTs, with a total of 1636 patients, were enrolled in this meta-analysis. A pooled analysis of the studies indicated no mortality benefit with "early" RRT, with an RR of 0.98 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.23, P = 0.84). There was no significant difference in intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) or hospital LOS between the early and late RRT groups for survivors or nonsurvivors. Pooled analysis also demonstrated no significant change in renal function recovery (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.19, I2 = 59%), RRT dependence (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.37, I2 = 0%), duration of RRT (Mean difference 1.43, 95% CI -1.75 to 4.61, I2 = 78%), renal recovery time (Mean difference 0.73, 95% CI -2.09 to 3.56, I2 = 70%) or mechanical ventilation time (Mean difference − 0.95, 95% CI -3.54 to 1.64, I2 = 64%) between the early and late RRT groups. We found no significant differences in complications between the groups.

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis revealed that the "early" initiation of RRT in critically ill patients did not result in reduced mortality. Pooled analysis of secondary outcomes also showed no significant difference between the early and late RRT groups. More well-designed and large-scale trials are expected to confirm the result of this meta-analysis.

### Effects of non-severe acute kidney injury on clinical outcomes in critically ill patients [^111bdLKm]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious medical condition estimated to affect more than ten million people around the world annually. AKI results in a 1.7- to 6.9-fold increased risk of hospital mortality, and risk-adjusted rates of AKI and mortality appear similar across the world. Patients who develop AKI also have worse kidney function at hospital discharge and thus far more risk for chronic kidney disease. However, these risks are most clearly apparent for patients with very severe AKI, such as those who receive renal replacement therapy (RRT). Milder forms of AKI are less clearly associated with adverse outcomes and thus it is unclear whether mild AKI is in the causal pathway for morbidity and mortality. For example, in a large international study of patients cared for in the intensive care unit (ICU), stage 2 or 3 AKIs were strongly associated with mortality even after risk adjustment, whereas for patients incurring only stage 1 AKI the association was attenuated and no longer significant (odds ratio 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89–3.17; P = 0.11).

For purposes of this review, we define "non-severe AKI" as AKI that is not managed by RRT. We acknowledge that this is an imperfect definition because the decision to commence RRT is often a difficult one and there exists considerable heterogeneity across centers and among physicians, even experts. Thus, the same patient could be counted as non-severe if cared for by one clinician but severe if cared for by another. Although differences exist at the individual patient-provider level, rates of RRT for critically ill patients with AKI in general, though increasing, are relatively consistent around the world. For example, a decade ago, Uchino and colleagues found that in 23 countries on four continents 4.2% of patients admitted to the ICU received RRT for AKI and this rate was not different between world regions (95% CI 4.0–4.4%). Similarly, Hoste and colleagues recently found that in 33 countries on five continents 13.5% of all patients admitted to the ICU (excluding patients with end-stage renal disease) received RRT for AKI; again, the range was rather narrow (95% CI 12.0–15.1%). Approximately 25% of critically ill patients with AKI receive RRT; this article is about the remaining 75%.

### Are diuretics harmful in the management of acute kidney injury? [^113tQ7DQ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To assess the role of diuretics in acute kidney injury (AKI) and their effectiveness in preventing AKI, achieving fluid balance, and decreasing progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Recent Findings

Diuretics are associated with increased risk for AKI. The theoretical advantage of diuretic-induced preservation of renal medullary oxygenation to prevent AKI has not been proven. A higher cumulative diuretic dose during the dialysis period can cause hypotension and increase mortality in a dose-dependent manner. Data on the use of forced euvolemic diuresis to prevent AKI remains controversial. Positive fluid balance has emerged as an independent predictor of adverse outcomes. Post-AKI furosemide dose had a favorable effect on mortality due in part to the reduction of positive fluid balance. There are exciting experimental data suggesting that spironolactone may prevent AKI once an ischemic insult has occurred and thus prevent the progression to CKD.

Summary

Diuretics are ineffective and even detrimental in the prevention and treatment of AKI, and neither shorten the duration of AKI, nor reduce the need for renal replacement therapy. Diuretics have an important role in volume management in AKI, but they are not recommended for the prevention of AKI. There is increased emphasis on the prevention of progression of AKI to CKD.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

Wide variation in healthcare infrastructure, staffing, and funding within and across LMICs results in a broad range of treatment capabilities. A 2015 cross-sectional study of the identification and management of AKI in various healthcare facilities showed that crystalloid fluid was used as initial management in 92% of all patients in LMICs. In addition, 73.9% of these patients were administered antibiotics. Diuretics were used in 36.1% of patients. A 2016 survey of 160 physicians treating kidney disease in low-resource settings found that nearly all regional hospitals had access to oral and intravenous hydration solutions, and antibiotics, whereas only 60% and 52% of rural healthcare providers had access to intravenous fluids and antibiotics for AKI management, respectively.

Feasibility and affordability of AKI treatment has been an ongoing challenge in LMICs, especially in remote and community healthcare settings. Intravenous fluids are the most commonly available resource for the management of AKI in both urban and community settings in LMICs and could be used to the benefit of AKI patients early in their disease courses. However, emerging evidence indicating increased adverse outcomes among AKI, ARDS, and critically ill patients receiving excessive fluid resuscitation poses safety concerns if this treatment is improperly implemented by providers with little working knowledge of fluid management. One observational study of 1,808 patients with sepsis across ICUs in 84 countries found an increased risk of death in those with higher fluid balance. Multiple reviews regarding fluid management in the setting of COVID-19 therefore recommend maintaining a negative fluid balance to improve outcomes, especially in critically ill patients dependent on mechanical ventilation.

Recommendations and suggestions (Table 1).

1 We recommend the judicious use of intravenous fluid resuscitation using crystalloids for early management of AKI in all COVID-19 patients (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).
2 We recommend more conservative fluid management for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Negative fluid balance should be maintained, if possible (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).
3 We suggest the use of lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategies, where applicable, to prevent renal injury from associated cytokine release (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

Question 4: In patients with COVID-19–related AKI in LMICs, what strategies can be used to optimize efficiency and availability of dialysis?

### The pressing need for real-time risk assessment of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury [^1146BEaB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is associated with short- and long-term outcomes that reflect the severity of the injury. Recent studies have suggested that 'early' initiation of renal replacement therapy may alter the course of AKI and improve short-term outcomes like inpatient mortality. The current Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) consensus definition of AKI has been criticized for misclassification bias, lack of sensitivity and the static manner in which AKI stages are defined. This editorial reviews various approaches to improving the specificity and sensitivity of the KDIGO AKI criteria, and also concludes that a staging system based on creatinine trajectories would be better suited for developing a prognostic index for real-time, dynamic risk assessment that the current KDIGO staging criteria.

### Acute kidney injury: an increasing global concern [^112XELTZ]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Despite an increasing incidence of acute kidney injury in both high-income and low-income countries and growing insight into the causes and mechanisms of disease, few preventive and therapeutic options exist. Even small acute changes in kidney function can result in short-term and long-term complications, including chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, and death. Presence of more than one comorbidity results in high severity of illness scores in all medical settings. Development or progression of chronic kidney disease after one or more episode of acute kidney injury could have striking socioeconomic and public health outcomes for all countries. Concerted international action encompassing many medical disciplines is needed to aid early recognition and management of acute kidney injury.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^115vu6YR]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published a guideline on the classification and management of acute kidney injury (AKI). Since then, new evidence has emerged that has important implications for clinical practice. Large epidemiology studies and risk profiles for AKI have become available in adults and children, such as the AKI–Epidemiologic Prospective Investigation (AKI-EPI) study, the 0by25 Initiative, the Southeast Asia–AKI (SEA-AKI) study, and the Assessment of Worldwide Acute Kidney Injury, Renal Angina, and Epidemiology (AWARE)and Assessment of Worldwide Acute Kidney Injury Epidemiology in Neonates (AWAKEN)studies. The effectiveness of the KDIGO recommendations in preventing AKI has been confirmed in small single-center randomized controlled trials (RCTs), such as the Prevention of AKI (PrevAKI)and the Biomarker Guided Intervention for Prevention of AKI (BigpAK)studies. In addition, results of RCTs have provided new data relevant to several facets of preventing and managing AKI, including early resuscitation, fluid therapy, prevention of contrast-associated AKI, and timing of acute renal replacement therapy (RRT). – Finally, there is now evidence from large studies in different countries that the use of KDIGO criteria for AKI, as part of computer decision-support systems, can improve clinical outcomes. However, there has also been important progress in the development of new tools to diagnose and manage AKI, including biomarkers, decision support programs, and electronic alerts, that go beyond the current KDIGO definition/staging criteria, and these warrant consideration for inclusion in AKI guidelines. –

These advances are not without controversy. Adoption of new biomarkers has been heterogenous, and there are calls to revise KDIGO AKI staging based on creatinine and urine output, and even calls to discard the KDIGO staging completely. Thus, in April 2019, KDIGO held a controversies conference entitled Acute Kidney Injury, in Rome, Italy. Participants examined and summarized evidence published since 2012 as it relates to the risk assessment, diagnosis, and management of patients with AKI and provided commentary on areas of controversy and agreement. The ultimate goals were to provide the clinical and research communities with a snapshot of the current state of the art for diagnosis and management of AKI and to prepare for future revision of the 2012 guideline.

### The RIFLE and AKIN classifications for acute kidney injury: a critical and comprehensive review [^111m84zK]. Clinical Kidney Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "AKIN diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury" for acute kidney injury.

The AKIN (Acute Kidney Injury Network) classification for acute kidney injury is a diagnostic and severity grading system used in patients with suspected acute kidney injury (AKI). This calculator is applicable to all patient populations, including those in the intensive care unit, hospitalized patients, and outpatients.

The AKIN classification system is used to identify and stratify the severity of AKI based on changes in serum creatinine levels or urine output. It helps clinicians to determine the appropriate treatment strategies and predict patient outcomes.

The AKIN classification system is not suitable for patients with chronic kidney disease or those with pre-existing renal dysfunction, as the changes in serum creatinine levels or urine output may not accurately reflect the acute changes in kidney function in these patients.

The AKIN diagnostic criteria tool helps identify the severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) by evaluating changes in serum creatinine levels and urine output. The user starts by selecting one diagnostic criterion from a list of options, each reflecting different clinical measures.

These criteria include:

- Serum creatinine increase of at least 0.3 mg/dL (26.4 mcmol/L) or 1.5 to 2 times the baseline, with urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour lasting over 6 hours.
- Serum creatinine increase of more than 2 to 3 times from baseline, combined with urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour over a 12-hour period.
- Serum creatinine increase to or beyond 4 mg/dL (354 mcmol/L), with a rapid increment of at least 0.5 mg/dL (44 mcmol/L), or over 3 times the baseline value. This is associated with urine output below 0.3 mL/kg/hour for 24 hours, or complete lack of urine for 12 hours.

Using these criteria, the tool assigns an AKI stage:

- Stage 1 corresponds to the selection where serum creatinine increases are at least 0.3 mg/dL or 1.5–2 times above baseline paired with specified urine output reduction over 6 hours.
- Stage 2 signifies a creatinine increase of more than 2–3 times from baseline with decreased urine output extending past 12 hours.
- Stage 3 is indicated by the most severe changes in creatinine and urine output metrics, the latter showing significant reduction or lack of production over longer durations.

Each stage reflects increasing AKI severity, impacting clinical evaluation and management decisions. Recognizing the stage is critical for patient outcomes, steering appropriate interventions and monitoring.

### Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic interventions in acute kidney injury: a literature review [^117GjGv4]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

AKI is a critical concern in nephrology, inflicting considerable harm on both physical and mental health, while its elevated incidence and fatality rates place a tremendous strain on the healthcare system. The clinical diagnosis of AKI relies on changes in serum creatinine levels and urine output, lacking definitive methodologies. It is imperative to investigate the molecular pathways to create highly specific and readily observable diagnostic tools and to develop therapeutic agents targeting these mechanisms.

RRT long-term outcomes and follow-up

Choice of RRT modality and impact on recovery.

The selection of RRT modality does not appear to have a major impact on recovery of kidney function. – Selection of modality of RRT should therefore be based on shared decision-making, local expertise, logistic factors, and patient characteristics. Estimated GFR in conjunction with major adverse kidney events has been used for medium- and long-term assessment but has several limitations. There is uncertainty about the best way to measure renal recovery after RRT in both the short- and medium-term. However, proteinuria is associated with worse long-term outcomes and is easy to measure.

Assessment of kidney function for renal recovery.

In addition to the development of CKD, patient-centered outcomes (quality of life, functional recovery), along with patient experience after AKI, should be a priority and need to be assessed. Post-AKI proteinuria is associated with future loss of kidney function and is regarded as a valuable risk-stratification tool in the post-AKI period. –

Optimal follow-up for AKI patients following RRT

Shared decision-making and communication among caregivers, the patient, and family members is crucial to patient recovery. Patients recovering from critical illness and AKI are often discharged to rehabilitation/skilled nursing facilities and need close monitoring to ensure adequate overall recovery to a baseline state of health and well-being. Such patients should receive multidisciplinary, recovery-focused care. Patients with AKI who continue to require RRT at hospital discharge often receive hemodialysis in outpatient dialysis facilities. Patients with congestive heart failure are less likely to recover kidney function. Higher ultrafiltration rates and more intradialytic hypotensive episodes are associated with higher risk of non-recovery of kidney function. To assess for renal recovery, hemodynamic status, intravascular volume, and urine output during dialysis should be carefully monitored.

Quality indicators for acute RRT

The importance of measuring and monitoring the quality of acute RRT provided to critically ill patients with AKI, including the optimal "benchmarking" for acute RRT programs, is receiving great attention. Quality of acute RRT should be monitored to ensure the effective and safe delivery of care. At a minimum, institutions and programs providing RRT should integrate, monitor, and report quality and outcome indicators across all forms of acute RRT therapies. These outcome measures should comprise a variety of metrics that incorporate patient survival, patient-centered acute RRT outcomes, safety, AKI survivor–related outcomes, and patient experience. Quality indicators should include shared goals that are patient- and clinically centered.

### Classification and staging of acute kidney injury: beyond the RIFLE and AKIN criteria [^1117NoeX]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is often overlooked in hospitalized patients, despite the fact that even mild forms are strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes such as increased mortality, morbidity, cardiovascular failure and infections. Research endorsed by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative led to the publication of a consensus definition for AKI — the RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of function, and End-stage renal disease) — which was designed to standardize and classify renal dysfunction. These criteria, along with revised versions developed by the AKI Network (AKIN), can detect AKI with high sensitivity and high specificity and describe different severity levels that aim to predict the prognosis of affected patients. The RIFLE and AKIN criteria are easy to use in a variety of clinical and research settings, but have several limitations: both utilize an increase in serum creatinine level from a hypothetical baseline value and a decrease in urine output, but these surrogate markers of renal impairment manifest relatively late after injury has occurred and do not consider the nature or site of the kidney injury. New biomarkers for AKI have shown promise for early diagnosis and prediction of the prognosis of AKI. As more data become available, they could, in the future, be incorporated into improved definitions or criteria for AKI.

### Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury: consensus report of the 28th Acute Disease Quality Initiative workgroup [^11222p3J]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is common in critically ill patients and is strongly associated with adverse outcomes, including an increased risk of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular events and death. The pathophysiology of SA-AKI remains elusive, although microcirculatory dysfunction, cellular metabolic reprogramming and dysregulated inflammatory responses have been implicated in preclinical studies. SA-AKI is best defined as the occurrence of AKI within 7 days of sepsis onset (diagnosed according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome criteria and Sepsis 3 criteria, respectively). Improving outcomes in SA-AKI is challenging, as patients can present with either clinical or subclinical AKI. Early identification of patients at risk of AKI, or at risk of progressing to severe and/or persistent AKI, is crucial to the timely initiation of adequate supportive measures, including limiting further insults to the kidney. Accordingly, the discovery of biomarkers associated with AKI that can aid in early diagnosis is an area of intensive investigation. Additionally, high-quality evidence on best-practice care of patients with AKI, sepsis and SA-AKI has continued to accrue. Although specific therapeutic options are limited, several clinical trials have evaluated the use of care bundles and extracorporeal techniques as potential therapeutic approaches. Here we provide graded recommendations for managing SA-AKI and highlight priorities for future research.

### Validated risk prediction models for outcomes of acute kidney injury: a systematic review [^116NZ4SF]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) among hospitalized patients is characterized by a sudden decline in renal function and is associated with poor long-term and short-term outcomes. The overall incidence of AKI in hospital patients ranges between 7 and 22%, and it ranges from 20 to 50% in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. Increasing incidences of AKI have been reported, especially among low- to middle-income countries, and this is likely due to an increasingly complex patient population. Moreover, it has been shown that when sepsis is present at ICU admission, the prevalence of AKI is greater than 40%.

The definition of AKI has changed over the years. In 2012, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) unified the previous definitions (RIFLE and AKIN). By KDIGO definition, AKI is diagnosed by an absolute increase in SCr, at least 0.3 mg/dL (26.5µmol/L) within 48 h or by a 50% increase in SCr from baseline within 7 days, or a urine volume of less than 0.5mL/kg/h for at least 6 h. Although KDIGO is now the most accepted and used AKI criteria, recently Sparrow et al. evaluated the impact of further sub-categorizing the KDIGO-defined AKI stage 1 into two stages based on SCr criteria: stage 1a (an absolute increase of SCr of 0.3 mg/dL within 48 h) and stage 1b (a 50% relative increase in SCr within 7 days) and therefore creating a 4-stage KDIGO classification which they named KDIGO-4. In a separate study, Nateghi Haredasht et al. showed that within the KDIGO AKI stage 1, there are indeed two sub-populations with different clinical outcomes.

### The implications and management of septic acute kidney injury [^114Xsbop]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is the most common and severe cause of morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome often complicates sepsis, leading to a worse prognosis that is proportional to the severity and number of damaged organs. Acute kidney injury (AKI) also complicates sepsis, with a linear relationship between the severity of kidney damage and sepsis prognosis. The management of sepsis and septic AKI involves intensive proactive preventive measures, medical and extracorporeal treatment of established sepsis, support of failing organs and rehabilitation of the residual effects left by this devastating syndrome. Unfortunately, although some innovations in the clinical management of sepsis are now available, their beneficial effects on renal function are still uncertain. The aim of this Review is to provide an update on the current state of interventions in sepsis-related AKI. Prevention, pharmacological support and extracorporeal blood purification for septic AKI will be reviewed and discussed.

1.3. Further follow-up of AKI

1.3.1 Assess patients 2 months after AKI to evaluate the completeness of resolution, the detection of new onset CKD or worsening of pre-existing CKD. (1C)

Rationale

Observations in recently published epidemiological studies show that in a considerable number of patients who survive the acute clinical condition, CKD develops or worsens. Thus, management of patients should extend even beyond the condition of AKI, and should include monitoring for new-onset CKD. Although the follow-up interval after which an assessment should occur is a matter of clinical judgement, we feel that in high-risk in-patients kidney function should be re-assessed not later than 2 months after hospital discharge. Patients should be managed according to appropriate guidelines if CKD is detected.

NOMENCLATURE AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

AKI-related definitions

AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasingly recognized as related entities representing a continuum of disease. The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) 2002 guideline and the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline defined CKD as measured or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m, or the presence of markers of kidney damage (e.g. albuminuria) for > 90 days. The 2012 KDIGO guideline defined AKI as an abrupt decrease in kidney function occurring over 7 days or fewer (Table 1). To complete the continuum, the 2012 guideline proposed the term acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) to define conditions of impaired kidney function not meeting the criteria for either AKI or CKD but having adverse outcomes and requiring clinical care. However, consensus on the exact criteria and indicators of severity is urgently needed.

Because the diagnosis of AKI should be tied to management decisions, and because changing disease definitions may have major implications for disease epidemiology, the case for revising the 2012 KDIGO definition of AKI should be strong before changes are proposed. Furthermore, in the context of an AKI guideline revision, several classification systems in addition to the stages of AKI should be rigorously defined. These relate to the distinctions among persistent, transient, relapsing, and recovered AKI; various etiologies of AKI; and community-onset versus hospital-onset AKI. In addition, there is emerging evidence that markers of structural kidney damage may be associated with clinically relevant outcomes and therefore identify potentially actionable entities. For an AKI guideline revision, the evidence base should be reviewed to determine whether markers of kidney damage constitute risk factors for AKI, define a new entity (such as subclinical or preclinical AKI), or should be incorporated into the AKI definition. Finally, the future guideline should use nomenclature that is precise and patient-centered.

Target a higher dose (urea reduction ratio ≥ 70% or single pool Kt/V ≥ 1.3 per session) to accommodate prescription-delivery shortfalls.

Kelleher, MD, MPH, FAAP. Download citation file: Acute kidney injury is a syndrome of sudden diminution or cessation of kidney function. The term AKI has been adopted to replace the previous clinical nomenclature of acute renal failure, because it focuses attention on early recognition of kidney insult and interventions to prevent or mitigate the effects of significant renal failure. Until 2004, more than 30 AKI/ARF definitions existed in the published literature.

However, in the past 10 years, standardized, multidimensional, graded AKI diagnostic criteria have been developed and validated to demonstrate increasing morbidity and mortality in patients with increasing AKI severity. These criteria include the RIFLE.
