## Question

how long to hold aspirin before eye surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to hold aspirin before eye surgery and how to tailor that decision to procedure type and cardiovascular risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's indication for aspirin and their thrombotic risk. Then, I should classify the eye procedure by bleeding risk. Next, I will align recommendations with major guidelines. After that, I need to check for special scenarios like dual antiplatelet therapy, recent coronary stenting, and AERD. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, procedure-specific recommendation and confirm the timing for stopping and restarting aspirin if interruption is needed.

> Let me first confirm the patient-specific factors that drive continuation versus interruption of aspirin: indication (primary vs secondary cardiovascular prevention, coronary stenting, atrial fibrillation with high thrombotic risk), time since stent placement, and overall bleeding risk. I need to ensure I weigh the risk of aspirin withdrawal syndrome against procedural bleeding, because abrupt cessation can trigger rebound platelet activation and increase thrombotic events, especially in secondary prevention populations [^111nAFeK] [^112zxSV4].

> Next, I should review the procedure-specific bleeding risk for eye surgeries. Cataract surgery is generally low bleeding risk, glaucoma procedures are low to moderate, and vitreoretinal surgery is often considered high bleeding risk, particularly when retrobulbar anesthesia or posterior segment work is involved, so I need to be precise about which eye operation is planned before deciding on aspirin [^1134Fnu2] [^113mjNP2] [^116Ueg87].

> Now, I will align with high-credibility guidelines. The ACCP/CHEST 2022 guidance suggests continuing aspirin for most minor ophthalmologic procedures and, if interruption is required for elective surgery, stopping within 7 days rather than 7–10 days, while the ESC 2022 advises interrupting aspirin for at least 7 days before high bleeding risk surgeries such as vitreoretinal procedures, and the AAO cataract preferred practice pattern supports continuation of antithrombotics for cataract surgery given low rates of sight-threatening bleeding. I should double-check that these positions are consistent across sources, and yes, they converge on continuation for low-risk procedures and interruption for high-risk closed-space or complex posterior segment surgery [^117HGtGk] [^1171hN5g] [^113mjNP2] [^1134Fnu2].

> For low bleeding risk eye procedures such as cataract surgery, routine intravitreal injections, and many oculoplastic surface procedures, I should confirm that continuing aspirin is favored. Indeed, ACCP suggests continuing antiplatelets for minor ophthalmologic procedures, AAO cataract guidance supports continuation, and large series show no increase in sight-threatening hemorrhage with continued aspirin, though subconjunctival hemorrhage may be more common and clinically inconsequential, so I should counsel patients accordingly [^117HGtGk] [^1134Fnu2] [^116Xe9mC].

> For high bleeding risk eye procedures such as vitreoretinal surgery or when retrobulbar anesthesia is planned, I need to ensure I follow the ESC recommendation to interrupt aspirin for at least 7 days preoperatively. ACCP also allows interruption within 7 days when needed, and although some anesthesia societies mention 3–5 days, given the irreversibility of aspirin's platelet effect and the closed-space risk in the posterior chamber, 7 days is the safer, guideline-concordant interval here [^113mjNP2] [^1171hN5g] [^114CrT6Z].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions for intermediate-risk glaucoma surgery. I should verify that the evidence is mixed and decisions are individualized, with some data suggesting increased minor bleeding when antithrombotics are continued but no clear signal for worse visual outcomes, so in these cases I should coordinate with the ophthalmologist and cardiologist to balance thrombotic versus bleeding risk and consider techniques that minimize bleeding rather than automatically stopping aspirin [^115eBhXP] [^115hqKcp].

> I will now examine dual antiplatelet therapy scenarios. If the patient is on aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor after coronary stenting, I should continue aspirin and stop the P2Y12 inhibitor 5–7 days before elective eye surgery when feasible, and for high thrombotic risk stents, consider postponing elective procedures until the mandatory DAPT window has passed. Urgent or semi-urgent cases may proceed with aspirin alone and consider short-acting parenteral bridging in select high-risk stent patients in consultation with cardiology [^1136WZW8] [^112M3gc5] [^117SDGxQ].

> But wait, what if the patient has aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease on maintenance aspirin after desensitization? I should confirm that interrupting aspirin risks loss of tolerance, so if surgery allows, I will hold aspirin only the day before and restart immediately postoperatively within 48 hours to preserve the desensitized state, and if a longer hold is unavoidable, plan to repeat desensitization afterward to restore tolerance [^117KS8tX] [^113hqRxZ].

> Let me synthesize practical timing now. For cataract surgery, intravitreal injections, and most surface oculoplastic procedures, continue aspirin without interruption. For vitreoretinal surgery or when retrobulbar anesthesia is planned, stop aspirin 7 days before the procedure. For glaucoma surgery, individualize based on patient risk and surgeon preference, with many choosing to continue aspirin. If aspirin is interrupted for any elective reason, stopping within 7 days and restarting as soon as hemostasis allows, typically within 24–48 hours postoperatively, is reasonable, balancing thrombotic and bleeding risks [^117HGtGk] [^113mjNP2] [^1171hN5g].

> Finally, I should confirm that patient counseling covers expected outcomes. Continued aspirin may increase minor ocular surface bleeding such as subconjunctival hemorrhage without threatening vision, whereas stopping aspirin can increase cardiovascular events, so shared decision-making is essential, and I should document the rationale for continuation or interruption alongside the surgical plan and cardiology input when relevant [^1134Fnu2] [^111nAFeK].

Hold aspirin **7 days before eye surgery** [^113mjNP2] when it is used for primary prevention or when the bleeding risk is high (e.g. vitreoretinal surgery) [^112M3gc5]. For secondary cardiovascular prevention, **continue aspirin** unless the bleeding risk is very high, as stopping increases thrombotic events [^112zxSV4] [^1178MUVK]. For low–bleeding-risk procedures (e.g. cataract, glaucoma, intravitreal injections), **do not stop aspirin** [^113R8fuP] [^1134Fnu2] [^116Xe9mC]. Always coordinate with the prescribing physician and ophthalmologist to individualize the plan.

## General principles for aspirin management in eye surgery

- **Primary prevention**: Stop aspirin 7 days before surgery to reduce bleeding risk [^113mjNP2].

- **Secondary prevention**: Continue aspirin unless bleeding risk is very high, as stopping increases thrombotic events [^111PHZUV] [^111nAFeK].

- **Procedure-specific risk**: Tailor aspirin management to the procedure's bleeding risk and the patient's cardiovascular profile [^112gyZbe].

---

## Specific recommendations by procedure

| **Procedure** | **Recommendation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Cataract surgery | Continue aspirin | - Low bleeding risk <br/> - Stopping does not reduce complications [^1134Fnu2] [^113R8fuP] |
| Glaucoma surgery | Continue aspirin | - Low bleeding risk <br/> - Stopping does not reduce complications [^117HGtGk] [^116Ueg87] |
| Intravitreal injections | Continue aspirin | - Low bleeding risk <br/> - Stopping does not reduce complications [^116Xe9mC] |
| Vitreoretinal surgery | Stop aspirin 7 days before surgery | Higher bleeding risk; stopping reduces complications [^113mjNP2] [^112M3gc5] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommendations

- **Cataract surgery**: Continuing aspirin does not increase sight-threatening bleeding or visual acuity loss [^1134Fnu2] [^115eaJ97].

- **Glaucoma surgery**: Continuing aspirin does not significantly increase severe bleeding or failure risk [^115hqKcp].

- **Intravitreal injections**: No significant increase in hemorrhagic complications with continued aspirin [^116Xe9mC].

- **Vitreoretinal surgery**: Stopping aspirin reduces intraoperative bleeding risk [^notfound].

---

## Risks associated with stopping aspirin

Stopping aspirin increases **thrombotic events** (myocardial infarction, stroke, stent thrombosis) [^111PHZUV] [^112zxSV4] and can cause a **rebound platelet effect** with heightened thrombotic risk [^111nAFeK] [^113u5mzC].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision

- **Cardiovascular history**: Secondary prevention patients should generally continue aspirin [^111PHZUV] [^112M3gc5].

- **Bleeding risk**: Assess patient-specific bleeding risk (age, renal function, prior bleeding) [^1141UEtD] [^116UP8Xv].

- **Medication regimen**: Consider other anticoagulants or antiplatelets [^1136WZW8] [^112M3gc5].

---

## Multidisciplinary approach

Coordinate care with **ophthalmology, cardiology, and anesthesia** to balance bleeding and thrombotic risks, and provide patient education explaining the risks and benefits of continuing or stopping aspirin [^112kV8ws] [^112gyZbe].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Primary prevention**: Stop aspirin 7 days before surgery [^1171hN5g].

- **Secondary prevention**: Continue aspirin unless bleeding risk is very high [^111PHZUV] [^117SDGxQ].

- **Low–bleeding-risk procedures**: Continue aspirin (cataract, glaucoma, intravitreal injections) [^113R8fuP] [^1134Fnu2] [^116Xe9mC].

- **High–bleeding-risk procedures**: Stop aspirin 7 days before surgery (vitreoretinal surgery) [^113mjNP2].

---

Hold aspirin **7 days before eye surgery** when used for primary prevention or when the bleeding risk is high (e.g. vitreoretinal surgery) [^113mjNP2] [^117AFpdT]. For secondary cardiovascular prevention, **continue aspirin** unless the bleeding risk is very high, as stopping increases thrombotic events [^111PHZUV] [^112zxSV4]. For low–bleeding-risk procedures (e.g. cataract, glaucoma, intravitreal injections), **do not stop aspirin** [^113R8fuP] [^1134Fnu2] [^116Xe9mC]. Always coordinate with the prescribing physician and ophthalmologist to individualize the plan.

Conclusions — role of ATAD in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) emphasizes benefit, safety, and selection, stating that since the early 1980s ATAD has had an unusual status and may be considered too risky in some practices but blinded and longitudinal studies consistently show benefit with safety data for both desensitization and maintenance therapy; although not all patients with AERD will respond, ATAD has the potential to improve respiratory symptoms, prevent or delay sinus surgery, and enhance quality of life, diagnostic aspirin challenges should be considered for uncertain histories, ATAD can be a highly economical option versus frequent sinus surgeries and newer biologics, and aspirin desensitization followed by maintenance aspirin therapy should be considered in all eligible patients with AERD to improve outcomes and delay or prevent future sinus surgery.

Influence of AP/ AC Agents

There is controversy in the literature as to whether AP and AC agents should be discontinued before eye surgery. In vitreoretinal surgery there is a rising number of studies showing that the perioperative intake of such medications is not associated with an increased risk of intraoperative bleeding. Nevertheless, specialists in glaucoma surgery are more reluctant to make such statements. Rather, there seems to be consensus that the each patient's bleeding risk should be individually assessed. In a retrospective evaluation of 367 trabeculectomies, Cobb et al noted that taking ASA100 raised the risk of hyphema, but had no impact on surgical success. However, taking warfarin resulted in significantly worse outcomes. Regarding ASA100 our results are comparable, as we likewise observed no significantly increased risk for severe bleeding. The statement by Cobb et al regarding warfarin needs to be viewed critically, as only 5 patients in their cohort were taking warfarin. Only 2 of our study patients were taking a vitamin k antagonist, thus enabling no comparison. Law et al retrospectively compared glaucoma interventions in 347 patients taking AP and/ or AC agents with 347 controls. Risk for bleeding complications was higher in the study group (10.1% vs 3.7%) with the overall highest risk for patients on AC medication (22.9%). Their overall recorded risk of bleeding resembled our study's (6.9% vs 9%). However, the 22.9% risk increase in their patients taking AC agents could have been partly caused by the study's population, which revealed significant differences between groups regarding underlying diseases, such as arterial hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia and coronary artery disease. Furthermore, as they did not grade the registered bleeding events, the effect of each bleeding event is unclear. There is a limitation associated with our study's observational design, that is, patients were included who continued to take their AP and/or AC agents as usual, as were those who discontinued them or bridged AC agents by using heparin. This heterogeneity made analysis challenging, but it reflects the real-world clinical situation (at least in Germany).

Carotid disease and retinal artery occlusion — For symptomatic carotid disease with a 50% to 99% carotid artery occlusion, an endarterectomy has demonstrated a better outcome than medical therapy, and for asymptomatic carotid disease with 60% to 99% carotid artery occlusion, revascularization should be considered. In general, initiation or continuation of antiplatelet and statin therapies is appropriate for most affected patients, and treatment for atrial fibrillation should be initiated, while carotid surgery will apply to less than 30% of patients.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — aspirin desensitization with maintenance therapy (ATAD) outcomes are detailed across observational studies. Reported tolerability and symptom responses include 95% (20 of 21 subjects) tolerated aspirin and 84% (27 of 32 subjects) tolerated aspirin; in a prospective cohort, 31% (12 of 39 subjects) had improved symptoms and lung function on ATAD, whereas 49% (19 of 39 subjects) could not complete the desensitization or had worsening symptoms and lung function on ATAD. Long-term patient-reported benefit included 85% of subjects on ATAD describing the treatment as very or extremely helpful. One study used 1300 mg for the first 4 wk, then 650 mg; among patients who required repeat ESS and underwent another ATAD, 100% (24 patients) tolerated this ATAD. Patients reported improvement as early as 4 weeks following desensitization, and even 10 years following desensitization, 85% of patients still taking daily aspirin found the therapy to be very or extremely helpful. In one study, fewer patients on daily aspirin (32%) required an additional sinus surgery than those who discontinued (79%), but aspirin therapy did not significantly reduce the total number of sinus surgeries needed nor did it delay the time of the next sinus surgery between the 2 groups. In a separate study combining sinus surgery with aspirin desensitization/maintenance therapy, 95% of patients had sustained endoscopic and symptomatic improvement.

### Thrombotic complications related to discontinuation of warfarin and aspirin therapy perioperatively for cutaneous operation [^116CwdoT]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Aside from anecdotal reports, there are few data on the risk of thrombotic complications in patients in whom use of warfarin and aspirin is discontinued perioperatively for cutaneous operation.

Objective

Our aim was to present a large case series of thrombotic complications resulting from this practice and to estimate the incidence of these events.

Methods

A total of 504 members of the American College of Mohs Micrographic Surgery and Cutaneous Oncology were surveyed regarding thrombotic complications when blood thinners were withheld perioperatively to ascertain the frequency of these complications and to describe associated morbidity and mortality.

Results

A total of 168 responding physicians reported 46 patients who experienced thrombotic events. Of these patients, 54% (25 of 46) experienced the event when warfarin was withheld and 39% (18 of 46) when aspirin use was discontinued. Thrombotic events included 24 strokes, 3 cerebral emboli, 5 myocardial infarctions, 8 transient ischemic attacks, 3 deep venous thromboses, 2 pulmonary emboli, and 1 retinal artery occlusion leading to blindness. Three deaths were reported. Calculation of incidence yielded an estimated thrombotic risk of 1 event per 12,816 operations, 1 in 6219 operations when use of warfarin was discontinued and 1 in 21,448 when aspirin was withheld.

Conclusions

With no documented increase in severe hemorrhagic complications during continued use perioperatively of blood thinners, these data provide a compelling argument to maintain patients on medically necessary blood thinners during cutaneous operation. All relevant clinical facts must be weighed when making this decision.

### Patient's perceptions of importance of discontinuing antithrombotic medication before oculoplastics surgery [^113FNL2w]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

This study aims to analyze patients' perspectives to ultimately gain insight into the patients understanding in 3 broad categories: their understanding of how their medications, supplements, and over-the-counter drugs work, their understanding of the risks these agents pose in a surgical setting, and their preferences for the continued use of the agents during and after oculoplastic surgery. To obtain these data, the authors prospectively surveyed 129 patients who had an oculoplastic surgery clinical evaluation at our tertiary care academic facility. Because no previously validated questionnaire on this topic existed, the authors utilized a novel questionnaire the authors developed. For antithrombotic medications, about 60% of patients felt there were risks associated both with stopping and continuing the agent during surgery. For antithrombotic supplements, more patients answered there were risks associated with continuing the agents during surgery versus stopping the agents during surgery (40% versus 25%, respectively). There was a relationship between patients' knowledge that they were on an antithrombotic prescription and their understanding of the risks associated with antithrombotic usage during surgery as well as sudden discontinuation of the prescription. With an understanding of the patient's point of view, surgeons will be equipped to have multifaceted conversations with their patients surrounding their medications, systemic health, and oculoplastic surgery.

### Endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy in patients taking aspirin perioperatively [^116okZLS]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study is to report the results of endoscopic dacryocystorhinotomy (EDCR) in patients who did not interrupt their low-dose (75–150 mg daily) aspirin regimen for the procedure.

Materials and Methods

A case note review was made of all 40 patients taking aspirin who had EDCR at Ipswich Hospital from May 1998 to October 2003. Age, gender, indications for surgery, complications, and outcome were analyzed and the bleeding rate compared to that in patients who were not on aspirin or warfarin who had an EDCR.

Results

Of the 51 EDCRs performed in the 40 patients, 47 had complete relief of epiphora. Two of the patients with a persistent watering eye are to have revision surgery, 1 patient was observed (75% improvement), and 1 patient has since died. A total of 33 patients had no postoperative complications; 5 had epistaxis but only 1 of these required a nasal pack; 1 each had minor periorbital bruising, confusion, and facial pain, none of which delayed discharge. None required readmission. Of 257 EDCRs in patients not on aspirin or warfarin, 1.3% had epistaxis resulting in delayed discharged or readmission.

Conclusions

EDCR is a safe and efficacious treatment in patients with distal nasolacrimal obstruction in patients taking aspirin and does not require stopping the aspirin perioperatively.

### Risks and benefits of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medication use before cataract surgery [^1173SiHa]. Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the risks and benefits associated with continuation of anticoagulants or antiplatelet medication use before cataract surgery.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Participants

Patients 50 and older scheduled for 19,283 cataract surgeries at nine centers in the United States and Canada between June 1995 and June 1997.

Intervention

None.

Main Outcome Measures

Intraoperative and postoperative (within 7 days) retrobulbar hemorrhage, vitreous or choroidal hemorrhage, hyphema, transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, deep vein thrombosis, myocardial ischemia, and myocardial infarction.

Results

Before cataract surgery 24.2% and 4.0% of patients routinely used aspirin and warfarin, respectively. Among routine users, 22.5% of aspirin users and 28.3% of warfarin users discontinued these medications before surgery. The rates of stroke, TIA, or deep vein thrombosis were 1.5/1000 among those who did not use aspirin or warfarin and 3.8/1000 surgeries among routine users of aspirin and warfarin who continued their medication before surgery. The rate was 1 event per 1000 surgeries among those who discontinued aspirin use (relative risk = 0.7, 95% confidence interval = 0.1–5.9). There were no events among warfarin users who discontinued use. The rates of myocardial infarction or ischemia were 5.1/1000 surgeries (aspirin) and 7.6/1000 surgeries (warfarin) among routine continuous users and no different from those of routine users who discontinued use.

Conclusions

The risks of medical and ophthalmic events surrounding cataract surgery were so low that absolute differences in risk associated with changes in routine anticoagulant or antiplatelet use were minimal.

Discontinuation of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents

In general, whenever possible discontinuation of all antiplatelets (i.e. aspirin, clopidogrel) and anticoagulants (i.e. warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)) in the perioperative phase is the best option. The decision and timing of interruption are influenced by patient's characteristics, types of surgery, type of anaesthesia (i.e.g.eneral vs regional) and type of anticoagulant. some patients direly need these drugs to be continued to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular and thrombotic events. In these cases, the decision needs to be tailored and multidisciplinary and tailored to the patient's specific condition. The intrinsic risks of suspending these agents must be balanced against the procedure-related risks of bleeding. The discussion about the risk–benefit balance must be done together with the patient and appropriate specialists. In general, due to its pharmacokinetics aspirin can be continued for most of the emergency surgical procedures. Its discontinuation may be considered in the post-operative period according to the risk–benefit balance. Regarding warfarin, stopping it and bridging should be considered only in patients with the highest risk of thrombosis (i.e. those with mechanical heart valves or venous thromboembolism within the previous 3 months); postoperative bridging should not be started until at least 48 h after surgery with a high bleeding risk.

DOACs, owing to their predictable pharmacokinetics, should be stopped 48 h before most operations in the presence of normal hepatic and renal function. Adenosine 5 ′ -diphosphate receptor antagonists, such as clopidogrel, should be stopped 5–7 days before operation. In emergency surgery, there is not enough time to stop anticoagulant drugs and the risk of bleeding is increased. In this situation, specific reversal factors are available and the decision to reverse must considerthe balance of bleeding versus the risk of clotting.

### Ranibizumab (Susvimo) [^111DMCqE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5	Vitreous Hemorrhage

Vitreous hemorrhages may result in temporary vision loss. Vitrectomy may be needed in the case of a non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage [see Dosage and Administration (2.10)].

In clinical trials of SUSVIMO including the extension phases in patients with AMD, vitreous hemorrhages were reported in 5.2% (23/443) of patients receiving SUSVIMO.

In the clinical trial of SUSVIMO including the extension phases in patients with DME, vitreous hemorrhages were reported in 10.1% (56/556) of patients receiving SUSVIMO.

In the clinical trial of SUSVIMO including the extension phase in patients with DR, vitreous hemorrhages were reported in 9.4% (12/128) of patients receiving SUSVIMO.

The majority of these hemorrhages occurred within the first post-operative month following surgical implantation and the majority of vitreous hemorrhages resolved spontaneously.

Patients on antithrombotic medication (e.g., oral anticoagulants, aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be at increased risk of vitreous hemorrhage. Antithrombotic medications are recommended to be temporarily interrupted prior to the implant insertion procedure. The SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) dose (refill-exchange) should be delayed in the event of sight-threatening vitreous hemorrhage.

The use of pars plana laser ablation and scleral cauterization should be performed to reduce the risk of vitreous hemorrhage.

### Managing antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs in patients undergoing elective ophthalmic surgery [^114Xp7qB]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

The management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatment can be challenging for the ophthalmic surgeon with the risk of impaired surgical view or potentially sight-threatening haemorrhage. With the advent of newer medications and the expanding usage of these drugs, there is a need for up-to-date guidance on the subject. This paper describes the current use of modern antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs in the UK, and reviews the evidence of such treatments in the context of ophthalmic surgery. A multidisciplinary approach has been used to develop a guideline for the management of antiplatelet and anticoagulation treatment in elective ophthalmic surgery. Specifically, guidance is provided on when and how to stop antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatment and, importantly, when to seek specialist medical advice.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^113R8fuP]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Patients having a minor dental, dermatologic, or ophthalmologic procedure — antiplatelet continuation evidence and question: The PICO asks whether antiplatelet drugs should be continued vs stopping antiplatelet drugs 7 to 10 days before the procedure. For minor dental procedures, small (< 100 patients) randomized trials and cohort studies suggest no increase in major bleeding with ASA continuation. For minor skin procedures, prospective cohort studies totaling about 200 patients suggest a low (< 1%) risk for major bleeding with continuation of ASA. For phacoemulsification (cataract) surgery, prospective cohort studies have suggested a low (< 1%) incidence of major bleeding with perioperative ASA continuation. For eyelid surgery, one 42-patient randomized trial compared ASA continuation with no perioperative ASA use and reported no significant effect on bleeding or thromboembolic outcomes. For skin procedures, one meta-analysis of two randomized trials and 28 observational studies totaling > 14,000 patients found no significant increase in bleeding with perioperative ASA continuation.

### Diabetic retinopathy preferred practice pattern ® [^1134rVir]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy — risk reduction and counseling states that maintaining near-normal glucose levels and near-normal blood pressure lowers the risk of retinopathy developing and/or progressing, and that patients should be informed of the importance of maintaining good HbA1c levels and blood pressure; serum lipids could also play an important role in DR, and aspirin may be used by diabetic patients for other medical indications without concern that the aspirin therapy will worsen DR or worsen a vitreous hemorrhage should it occur.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1174R9av]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Valvular heart disease — procedures with minimal bleeding — Antithrombotic therapy should not be stopped for procedures in which bleeding is unlikely or would be inconsequential, with examples including surgery on the skin, dental cleaning, or simple treatment for dental caries, and eye surgery for cataracts or glaucoma is usually associated with very little bleeding and is frequently performed without alteration of anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA).

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Acular LS) [^112Nh8Np]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Delayed Healing

Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may slow or delay healing. Topical corticosteroids are also known to slow or delay healing. Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for healing problems.

5.2 Cross-Sensitivity or Hypersensitivity

There is the potential for cross-sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid, phenylacetic acid derivatives, and other NSAIDs. There have been reports of bronchospasm or exacerbation of asthma associated with the use of ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution in patients who have either a known hypersensitivity to aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or a past medical history of asthma. Therefore, caution should be used when treating individuals who have previously exhibited sensitivities to these drugs.

5.3 Increased Bleeding Time

With some NSAIDs, there exists the potential for increased bleeding time due to interference with thrombocyte aggregation. There have been reports that ocularly applied nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may cause increased bleeding of ocular tissues (including hyphemas) in conjunction with ocular surgery.

It is recommended that ACULAR LS ophthalmic solution be used with caution in patients with known bleeding tendencies or who are receiving other medications, which may prolong bleeding time.

5.4 Corneal Effects

Use of topical NSAIDs may result in keratitis. In some susceptible patients, continued use of topical NSAIDs may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal thinning, corneal erosion, corneal ulceration, or corneal perforation. These events may be sight threatening. Patients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately discontinue use of topical NSAIDs and should be closely monitored for corneal health.

Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases (e.g., dry eye syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis, or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time may be at increased risk for corneal adverse events which may become sight threatening. Topical NSAIDs should be used with caution in these patients.

Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs also suggests that use more than 1 day prior to surgery or use beyond 14 days post-surgery may increase patient risk for the occurrence and severity of corneal adverse events.

5.5 Risk of Contamination

Do not allow the tip of the bottle to contact the eye or surrounding structures because this could cause the tip to become contaminated by common bacteria known to cause ocular infections. Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated solutions.

For patients with intermediate risk, the recommended target of vitamin K antagonism anticoagulation therapy is an INR of 2.5 and for those in the high-risk group an INR of 3.0 is recommended.

Assessing hemorrhagic risk

Remaining on anticoagulation in the periprocedural period must be balanced against the risk of periprocedural hemorrhage. While this can be difficult to quantify, the factors generally taken into account are patient characteristics and the nature of the procedure they are to undergo. Numerous scoring tools have been proposed to quantify patient hemorrhage risk including the Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index, the HEMORR2HAGES score, and the HAS-BLED score. The HAS-BLED score is the most commonly employed tool that has been validated to predict bleeding risk during bridging of anticoagulation. The HAS-BLED score assigns a point value to each of the following risk factors: hypertension, abnormal renal or liver function, stroke, bleeding history, labile INR, elderly age, and drugs (aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, alcohol) and groups patients into low, medium, and high risk of bleeding (see tables 6 and 7).

Table 6
HAS-BLED score to assess bleeding risk

Table 7
Risk of bleeding by HAS-BLED score

These systems can be used to gauge the risk of bleeding when considering recommendations for periprocedural management.

The nature of the procedure should also be considered when assessing bleeding risk. While there is no firm scoring system to quantify this, procedures can generally be grouped into high-risk (2–4%) and low-risk (0–2%) procedures.
High risk: cardiovascular, orthopedic, head and neck cancer or urological in nature, or those > 45 min in length.
Low risk: procedures anticipated to be < 45 min, cutaneous, or relatively straightforward such as a cholecystectomy.

Also to be taken into account are those situations where a small amount of bleeding can have serious consequences, such as ophthalmological procedures, or those where bleeding may not be easily detected.

### How do cardiologists select patients for dual antiplatelet therapy continuation beyond 1 year after a myocardial infarction? Insights from the EYESHOT post-MI study [^116qkLd9]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Current guidelines suggest that continuation of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for longer than 12 months should be considered in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) who have tolerated DAPT without bleeding complications. 1, 2 This recommendation is based on recent randomized clinical trials suggesting that DAPT prolongation reduces the rate of recurrent ischemic events in post‐MI patients, compared with aspirin alone. 3, 4 However, these benefits come at the cost of increased risk of bleeding, raising the question about how to identify the ideal patient profile who could safely prolong DAPT. 1, 2, 5, 6 Although predictors of DAPT interruption have been already identified in large international registries, 7, 8, 9 specific appraisals underlying the decision on the extension of DAPT have been poorly investigated. 10, 11

Using data from the EYESHOT (EmploYEd antithrombotic therapies in patients with acute coronary Syndromes HOspitalized in iTaly) Post‐MI study 12 we sought to evaluate the criteria used by cardiologists in daily clinical practice for selecting post‐MI patients eligible for DAPT continuation beyond 1 year.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin desensitization and aspirin therapy in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — indications and contraindications are summarized as follows: Indication is persistent sinonasal and asthma symptoms in a patient with AERD despite conventional medical and surgical therapy. Contraindications include poorly controlled asthma, significant nasal polyp burden at time of desensitization, pregnancy, history of eosinophilic esophagitis, history of gastric and/or peptic ulcer disease, history of a bleeding disorder or coagulopathy, and history of medication nonadherence. A relative contraindication is a history of anaphylaxis to aspirin or other NSAID; patients with such a history may undergo an aspirin desensitization and aspirin therapy, but this decision merits careful discussion with the patient and physician.

### Antiplatelet agents in the perioperative period… [^111PHZUV]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Aspirin use should not be stopped in the perioperative period unless the risk of bleeding exceeds the thrombotic risk from withholding the drug. With the exception of recent drug-eluting stent implantation, clopidogrel bisulfate use should be stopped at least 5 days prior to most elective surgery. Use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors must be discontinued preoperatively for more than 12 hours to allow normal hemostasis. Because platelets are unable to generate significant amounts of new COX, the effects of aspirin-induced COX-1 inhibition last for the lifetime of the platelet. In contrast, endothelial cells recover normal function shortly after exposure to aspirin; therefore, aspirin is an antithrombotic agent. Most surgeons advise patients to stop taking aspirin at least 7 to 10 days preoperatively.

The French Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care in 2001 questioned this policy because of a reported increased incidence of myocardial infarction86 and recommended that aspirin use should not be stopped in the perioperative period unless the risk of hemorrhagic complications related to a specific procedure appeared to be greater than the increase in thrombotic/cardiovascular risk from withholding the drug. The ASPIRIN trial is an ongoing multicenter trial comparing low-dose aspirin therapy vs placebo during the perioperative period in patients with documented symptomatic stable coronary artery disease undergoing noncardiac surgery. This study may provide definitive guidelines for patients taking aspirin in the perioperative period. Because clopidogrel is seen as a more powerful antiplatelet agent than aspirin, most surgeons advise discontinuation prior to surgery.

The timing of surgery is often dictated by the clinical circumstances in which clopidogrel has been prescribed. Clopidogrel therapy is advised for at least 4 weeks after placement of a BMS. For example, if there is a major risk of both stent thrombosis and bleeding, surgery should be postponed for at least 6 to 12 months post-DES. If this is not possible, aspirin use should be continued and clopidogrel therapy stopped 5 days before surgery. If the bleeding risk is small and there is a major risk of stent thrombosis, then antiplatelet agents should be continued in the perioperative period.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Pre-desensitization medical management — Before aspirin desensitization, it is recommended that all coexisting cardiopulmonary conditions be optimized and sinonasal and asthma symptoms be optimally controlled for the week before desensitization; most authors recommend a prebronchodilator FEV1 percent predicted value of at least 70% to safely perform desensitizations.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^116Ueg87]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Minor ophthalmologic procedures in patients receiving vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — evidence and recommendation: Minor ophthalmologic procedures include cataract surgery (phacoemulsification) and surgeries for glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy; no randomized trials have assessed perioperative management with cataract surgery, cohort data report bleeding < 3%, and a meta-analysis found increased bleeding risk with continued VKAs (OR = 3.26; 95% CI: 1.73–6.16) with an overall bleeding incidence of 10% (95% CI: 5–19), with events generally self-limiting and no compromised visual acuity. Therefore, in patients receiving VKA therapy who require a minor ophthalmologic procedure, we suggest continuation of VKA over VKA interruption (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence), while noting that retrobulbar anesthesia poses a concern and VKA interruption may be preferred in higher-bleeding-risk situations such as more complex retinal surgery or retrobulbar anesthesia.

Regarding specific circumstances for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to patients undergoing interventional procedures (preprocedural discontinuation of antiplatelet agents), ASIPP 2024 guidelines recommend to interrupt aspirin (81 or 325 mg) for 6 days for high-risk procedures. Consider continuing aspirin (81 or 325 mg) without interruption for low- and intermediate-risk procedures or discontinue (81 or 325 mg) for 3 days.

### Low-dose aspirin discontinuation and risk of cardiovascular events: a Swedish nationwide, population-based cohort study [^112zxSV4]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There are increasing concerns about risks associated with aspirin discontinuation in the absence of major surgery or bleeding. We investigated whether long-term low-dose aspirin discontinuation and treatment gaps increase the risk of cardiovascular events.

Methods

We performed a cohort study of 601527 users of low-dose aspirin for primary or secondary prevention in the Swedish prescription register between 2005 and 2009 who were > 40 years of age, were free from previous cancer, and had ≥ 80% adherence during the first observed year of treatment. Cardiovascular events were identified with the Swedish inpatient and cause-of-death registers. The first 3 months after a major bleeding or surgical procedure were excluded from the time at risk.

Results

During a median of 3.0 years of follow-up, 62690 cardiovascular events occurred. Patients who discontinued aspirin had a higher rate of cardiovascular events than those who continued (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.34–1.41), corresponding to an additional cardiovascular event observed per year in 1 of every 74 patients who discontinue aspirin. The risk increased shortly after discontinuation and did not appear to diminish over time.

Conclusions

In long-term users, discontinuation of low-dose aspirin in the absence of major surgery or bleeding was associated with a > 30% increased risk of cardiovascular events. Adherence to low-dose aspirin treatment in the absence of major surgery or bleeding is likely an important treatment goal.

Antiplatelet therapy for minor dental, dermatologic, and ophthalmologic procedures — In patients receiving an antiplatelet drug (ASA or P2Y12 inhibitor) who are undergoing a minor dental procedure, we suggest continuing the antiplatelet drug (ASA or P2Y12 inhibitor) over stopping the antiplatelet agent before the procedure (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence); for a minor dermatologic procedure, we suggest continuing the antiplatelet drug (ASA or P2Y12 inhibitor) over stopping the antiplatelet drug before the procedure (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence); and for a minor ophthalmologic procedure, we suggest continuing the antiplatelet drug (ASA or P2Y12 inhibitor) throughout the ophthalmologic procedure over stopping the antiplatelet agent before the procedure (Conditional Recommendation, Low Certainty of Evidence). Patients who are receiving dual antiplatelet therapy with ASA and a P2Y12 inhibitor can continue ASA and interrupt the P2Y12 inhibitor.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic medications… [^1136WZW8]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of Vitamin K Antagonist Medications For patients taking the vitamin K antagonist warfarin, continue the medication if bleeding risk is minimal. With low to moderate or high bleeding risk, stop warfarin; patients with high thrombosis risk should receive heparin before and after surgery. In patients who are at low to moderate risk for thromboembolism, no bridging with heparin is recommended. For atrial fibrillation, the benefits of bridging are less certain because the stroke risk over a few days is low. Warfarin should be stopped at least five days before the procedure and restarted 12 to 24 hours after the procedure if hemostasis has been obtained. Heparin bridging can occur with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin. If intravenous unfractionated heparin is used, heparin should be stopped at least four hours before the procedure and restarted at least 24 hours after the procedure.

If low-molecular-weight heparin is used, give one-half the daily dosage 24 hours before the procedure, and wait at least 24 hours after surgery to give the first postoperative dose of low-molecular-weight heparin. If the surgery has a high bleeding risk, wait 48 to 72 hours before restarting heparin to ensure hemostasis. Management of Antiplatelet Medications Continuing aspirin is recommended for all noncardiac surgery. If stopping aspirin, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends stopping within seven days of surgery. P2Y. 12 platelet receptor inhibitors should be stopped before surgery. Stop clopidogrel five days before surgery, ticagrelor three to five days before surgery, and prasugrel seven to 10 days before surgery. All P2Y 12 inhibitors can be restarted within 24 hours of surgery if hemostasis has been obtained. 12 inhibitor and continue aspirin therapy.

Bridging these gaps with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications does not improve outcomes. Because these medications can be held one to two days before surgery and restarted one to two days after surgery, bridging with heparin is not recommended, unlike with warfarin. The other interesting recommendation is to continue aspirin through the surgery because of little, if any, increase in bleeding. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Assistant Medical Editor.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^115aKxwZ]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Cataract in the adult eye — prevention and risk modification: Preventive measures could have a large public health impact given that 24.4 million people over the age of 40 years in the United States are affected by cataract. A Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials found no evidence to support high doses of vitamin E, vitamin C, or beta-carotene for preventing development or progression of cataract, and there is currently no level 1 evidence to suggest that high-dose antioxidant supplementation slows cataract progression; there is moderate evidence that a multivitamin/mineral supplement may decrease the risk of cataract. There is currently insufficient evidence to support a specific diet, but a well-balanced diet rich with fruits and vegetables is a reasonable recommendation based on observational studies. Long-term increased physical activity and exercise may decrease the risk of cataract, whereas long periods of inactivity and prolonged sitting may be associated with cataract progression. Long-term users of inhaled or oral corticosteroids are at higher risk of cataract formation, while intranasal corticosteroids are not associated with a significant risk of incident cataract based on recent systematic reviews; the association between statin use and cataract has conflicting results, phenothiazines have been associated with anterior subcapsular opacities, and multiple studies show no benefit of aspirin on cataract development or the need for cataract surgery. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome are associated with increased risk of cataract or cataract surgery, and prevention and treatment of these conditions may reduce risk. Smoking is a risk factor (with a dose-response effect for nuclear sclerosis); cessation reduces risk and patients should be counseled to quit smoking.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Acuvail) [^11291pUR]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Delayed Healing

Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may slow or delay healing. Topical corticosteroids are also known to slow or delay healing. Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for healing problems.

5.000000000000000e+00 2 Cross-Sensitivity or Hypersensitivity

There is the potential for cross-sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid, phenylacetic acid derivatives, and other NSAIDs. There have been reports of bronchospasm or exacerbation of asthma associated with the use of ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution in patients who either have a known hypersensitivity to aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or a past medical history of asthma. Therefore, caution should be used when treating individuals who have previously exhibited sensitivities to these drugs.

5.000000000000000e+00 3 Increased Bleeding Time

With some NSAIDs, there exists the potential for increased bleeding time due to interference with thrombocyte aggregation. There have been reports that ocularly applied nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may cause increased bleeding of ocular tissues (including hyphemas) in conjunction with ocular surgery.

It is recommended that ACUVAIL be used with caution in patients with known bleeding tendencies or who are receiving other medications, which may prolong bleeding time.

5.000000000000000e+00 4 Corneal E ffects

Use of topical NSAIDs may result in keratitis. In some susceptible patients, continued use of topical NSAIDs may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal thinning, corneal erosion, corneal ulceration, or corneal perforation. These events may be sight threatening. Patients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately discontinue use of topical NSAIDs and should be closely monitored for corneal health.

Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases (e.g., dry eye syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis, or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time may be at increased risk for corneal adverse events which may become sight threatening. Topical NSAIDs should be used with caution in these patients.

Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs also suggests that use more than 1 day prior to surgery or use beyond 14 days post-surgery may increase patient risk for the occurrence and severity of corneal adverse events.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^116d1oAY]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The American College of Chest Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline on the Perioperative Management of Antithrombotic Therapy addresses 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions related to the perioperative management of patients who are receiving long-term oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and require an elective surgery/procedure. This guideline is separated into four broad categories, encompassing the management of patients who are receiving: (1) a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), mainly warfarin; (2) if receiving a VKA, the use of perioperative heparin bridging, typically with a low-molecular-weight heparin; (3) a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC); and (4) an antiplatelet drug.

Methods

Strong or conditional practice recommendations are generated based on high, moderate, low, and very low certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology for clinical practice guidelines.

Results

A multidisciplinary panel generated 44 guideline recommendations for the perioperative management of VKAs, heparin bridging, DOACs, and antiplatelet drugs, of which two are strong recommendations: (1) against the use of heparin bridging in patients with atrial fibrillation; and (2) continuation of VKA therapy in patients having a pacemaker or internal cardiac defibrillator implantation. There are separate recommendations on the perioperative management of patients who are undergoing minor procedures, comprising dental, dermatologic, ophthalmologic, pacemaker/internal cardiac defibrillator implantation, and GI (endoscopic) procedures.

Conclusions

Substantial new evidence has emerged since the 2012 iteration of these guidelines, especially to inform best practices for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving a VKA and may require heparin bridging, for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving a DOAC, and for patients who are receiving one or more antiplatelet drugs. Despite this new knowledge, uncertainty remains as to best practices for the majority of perioperative management questions.

### Update on the evaluation of transient vision loss [^116ytrJH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Managing TVL begins with a focused history and examination. Once a preliminary diagnosis is made, evaluation and treatment depend on the findings. Amaurosis fugax requires workup with carotid and cardiac imaging. Hypercoagulable testing and angiography may be helpful in certain cases. Carotid surgery or antithrombotic medications (antiplatelet/anticoagulation) can prevent future stroke. Retinal vasospasm could be treated with aspirin or calcium channel blockers. Retinal migraine responds to standard migraine treatments. Ocular causes such angle closure are treated accordingly. First and foremost, however, the patient must get evaluated. Therefore, we must continue to educate the public and our medical colleagues about the importance of getting an ophthalmologic evaluation in patients with TVL.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Oral aspirin therapy following aspirin desensitization — patients are cross-sensitized to nonselective COX inhibitors as long as they continue an aspirin 325 mg daily or higher doses, and they can change from one COX inhibitor to another without losing the desensitized state; if aspirin is discontinued, NSAID tolerance may continue for several days, but repeating intranasal aspirin-lysine challenges 24 hours after the initial challenge resulted in positive reactions in 98% of the patients, and if a desensitized patient misses more than 2 days of aspirin it is strongly recommended they be evaluated for repeat desensitization before resuming therapy.

### Clinical outcomes associated with per-operative discontinuation of aspirin in patients with coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Nr1pM]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative state is characterized by increased thrombotic risk by virtue of platelet activation. Whether aspirin ameliorates this risk in patients with established coronary artery disease undergoing cardiac or noncardiac surgery is unknown. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and the risk of bleeding in patients with early (3–5 or more days before surgery) vs. late discontinuation(< 3–5 days)/no discontinuation of aspirin.

Methods

Multiple databases were searched from inception of these databases until March 2015 to identify studies that reported discontinuation of aspirin in patients undergoing surgery. The outcomes measured were all cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction and other relevant thrombotic events (MACE) which also may include, fatal and nonfatal MI, stent thrombosis and restenosis, stroke, perioperative cardiovascular complications (heart failure, MI, VTE, acute stroke) and perioperative bleeding during the perioperative period to up to 30 days after surgery.

Results

A total of 1,018 titles were screened, after which six observational studies met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis suggests that there is no difference in MACE with planned discontinuation of aspirin (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.76–1.81; P = 0.05; I² = 55%). Early discontinuation of aspirin showed a decreased risk of peri-operative bleeding (OR 0.82, 95% CI = 0.67–0.99; P = 0.04; I² = 42%).

Conclusion

Our analysis suggests that planned short-term discontinuation in the appropriate clinical setting appears to be safe in the correct clinical setting with no increased risk of thrombotic events and with a decreased risk of bleeding. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^112EkEbL]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to risk factors (aspirin), AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that observational studies have indicated a possible link between aspirin use and AMD. The Beaver Dam Eye Study reported two times the incidence of late macular degeneration in patients who used aspirin at least twice weekly for 10 years compared with those who used no aspirin. Other studies have shown a potential protective effect of aspirin against the development of AMD. In a meta-analyses of 10 studies, the use of aspirin was not associated with an increased risk of AMD, but another meta-analysis of 16 studies identified an association with aspirin in a subgroup of studies with long-term follow-up. In light of all of the available information on aspirin use and AMD, the current preferred practice for patients who have been instructed by their physician to use aspirin is to continue their aspirin therapy as prescribed.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin therapy duration and perioperative management — It is recommended to attempt an initial trial period of 6 months on aspirin treatment to determine whether the patient notes clinical improvement; for patients who respond to aspirin, we recommend continuing aspirin indefinitely, while high-dose aspirin may be discontinued after 6 months in those with no clinical benefit. To maintain tolerance, a patient may take 325 mg of aspirin daily, noting that doses lower than 325 mg daily may not provide cross-tolerance to other NSAIDs. Antecedent endoscopic sinus surgery performed 3 to 4 weeks before desensitization improves aspirin treatment response in patients with AERD. For patients who require surgery, aspirin can be completely discontinued 2 weeks before the procedure with restart only after desensitization, or the dose can be lowered to 325 mg once daily, held the day before, and restarted in the evening to allow restart within the 48-hour refractory period; many minor procedures such as a colonoscopy can be done on daily aspirin. A small case series suggests that stopping aspirin and bridging with ibuprofen might maintain desensitization but will limit the antiplatelet effect of aspirin.

### Perioperative antiplatelet therapy [^117SDGxQ]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Aspirin is recommended as a lifelong therapy that should never be interrupted for patients with cardiovascular dis- ease. Clopidogrel therapy is mandatory for six weeks after placement of bare-metal stents, three to six months after myocardial infarction, and at least 12 months after placement of drug-eluting stents. Because of the hypercoagulable state induced by surgery, early withdrawal of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease increases the risk of postoperative myocardial infarction and death five- to 10-fold in stented patients who are on continuous dual antiplatelet therapy. The shorter the time between revascularization and surgery, the higher the risk of adverse cardiac events. Elective surgery should be postponed beyond these periods, whereas vital, semiurgent, or urgent operations should be performed under continued dual antiplatelet therapy. The risk of surgical hemorrhage is increased approximately 20 percent by aspirin or clopidogrel alone, and 50 percent by dual antiplatelet therapy. The present clinical data suggest that the risk of a cardiovascular event when stopping antiplatelet agents preoperatively is higher than the risk of surgical bleeding when continuing these drugs, except during surgery in a closed space (e.g., intracranial, posterior eye chamber) or surgeries associated with massive bleeding and difficult hemostasis.

### Risk of hemorrhagic complications and secondary surgery in patients on warfarin vs DOACs undergoing glaucoma surgery [^1133MmmS]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

One area of active clinical discussion is the discontinuation of anticoagulant medications prior to glaucoma surgery due to risk of bleeding. Currently, the literature has not reached a consensus on the single best practice for patients requiring glaucoma filtration surgery. One leading argument, however, is that although maintenance of warfarin and DOACs increase the risk of certain hemorrhagic events following glaucoma surgery, these dangers are outweighed by the risk of systemic thromboembolic events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke if patients discontinue anticoagulant use before surgery. Although not definitive, our study provides additional perspective to this ongoing discussion. Our results indicate potentially increased risk of specific types of ocular bleeding in warfarin vs DOAC patients, but these outcomes do not necessarily correlate with impaired visual acuity or permanent adverse outcomes. Our results also could not establish anticoagulant use as a risk factor for needing secondary glaucoma surgery. Based on these findings, there may be clinical evidence to keep patients on anticoagulant medication prior to glaucoma filtration surgery despite the aforementioned potential associated risks. However, further studies comparing risks of hemorrhagic complications with continuation of anticoagulant medications to risks of thromboembolic events with cessation of these drugs are needed to confidently answer this clinically relevant question. It is worth noting that researchers have reached a broader consensus for continuing anticoagulant use in cataract surgery despite its risks because anticoagulants were not associated with increased bleeding events in cataract surgery.

Because of their safety and efficacy, clinicians may prefer DOACs over warfarin. Several studies also corroborate this preference, as seen in one study conducted by Fang et al, which studied rates of recurrent venous thromboemboli in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). This study found that the cohort of patients taking DOACs was associated with a lower risk of recurrent VTE compared to those patients on warfarin. Another systematic review/meta-analysis conducted by Zeng et al found that, in atrial fibrillation patients, DOAC therapy reduced the risk of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and all-cause death but did not find a change in difference in risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. However, like these studies, most research directly comparing warfarin to DOAC assesses cardiovascular pathologies and studies outcomes like stroke that affect the systemic vasculature. The only similar study in the literature pertaining to ophthalmic outcomes studied conversion rates to neovascular disease in patients with non-neovascular age-related macular degeneration with warfarin vs DOAC use.

### Aspirin in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery [^114B8Eer]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The study POISE-2 (aspirin) was published by Devereaux PJ and colleagues in 2014 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, Periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy and Perioperative bleeding. In the POISE-2 (aspirin) study, the trial question was: what is the role of aspirin in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery? In the POISE-2 (aspirin) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the POISE-2 (aspirin) study, the population was: 10010 patients (4727 female, 5283 male). The inclusion criteria were patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who were at risk for vascular complications. The key exclusion criteria were hypersensitivity or known allergy to aspirin, consumption of aspirin within 72 hours prior to surgery, SBP < 105 m Hg, active peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 weeks before surgery, undergoing intracranial surgery, carotid endarterectomy, or retinal surgery. In the POISE-2 (aspirin) study, the interventions were: n = 4998 aspirin (at a dose of 200 mg before surgery and continued daily at a dose of 100 mg for 30 days in the initiation stratum and for 7 days in the continuation stratum) n = 5012 placebo (matching dose). In the POISE-2 (aspirin) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death or nonfatal myocardial infarction at 30 days (7% vs. 7.1%; HR 0.99, 99% CI 0.86 to 1.15). In the POISE-2 (aspirin) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in myocardial infarction (6.2% vs. 6.3%; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.15). In the POISE-2 (aspirin) study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in major bleeding (4.6% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.04; HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01–1.49). In the POISE-2 (aspirin) study, the conclusion was: in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who were at risk for vascular complications, aspirin was not superior to placebo with respect to death or nonfatal myocardial infarction at 30 days.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116iFeG9]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — avoidance of medications that may make asthma worse — Aspirin and other NSAIDs can cause severe exacerbations, and beta‑blocker drugs, including topical ophthalmic preparations, may cause bronchospasm. Clinicians are advised to always ask people with asthma about concomitant medications, including eyedrops, and to always ask about asthma and previous reactions before prescribing NSAIDs, advising patients to stop using these medications if asthma worsens. Aspirin and NSAIDs are not generally contraindicated in asthma unless there is a history of previous reactions to these agents (Evidence A). For people with asthma who may benefit from oral or ophthalmic beta‑blocker treatment, a decision to prescribe these medications should be made on a case‑by‑case basis, and treatment should only be initiated under close medical supervision by a specialist (Evidence D). Asthma should not be regarded as an absolute contraindication to use cardioselective beta‑blockers when they are indicated for acute coronary events, but the relative risks and benefits should be considered (Evidence D), and the prescribing physician and patient should be aware of the risks and benefits of treatment.

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy in vitreoretinal surgery [^112dwo2k]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate changes in the prevalence of antiplatelet (aspirin, clopidogrel) and anticoagulation (warfarin) therapy and its possible relationship to postoperative bleeding in vitreoretinal surgery (VRS) patients.

Design

Observational, retrospective case control study.

Methods

setting: University practice.study population: A total of 822 patents who underwent VRS during 3 intervals in 1994, 2004, and 2008.observation procedure: Retrospective chart review for 1994 and 2004, but contemporaneous in 2008.main outcome measures: Proportion using antiplatelets or anticoagulants, the incidence of early postoperative intraocular bleeding in patients, and clinical consequence of the hemorrhage.

Results

Thirty-one of 213 patients (14.6%) who underwent VRS in 1994, 103 of 361 patients (28.5%) in 2004, and 80 of 248 patients (32.3%) in 2008 had taken antiplatelet therapy (P < .001). The rates of anticoagulant therapy did not vary. The incidence of bleeding was higher (20.0%) in the patients who did not suspend antiplatelets than in those who did (9.6%) (P = 0.05, χ(2) test), but this difference lost statistical significance in a multivariate analysis (P = 0.079). Anticoagulant was associated with intraocular hemorrhage at postoperative first day after vitrectomy (P = 0.03, Fisher exact test). No reoperation or failure of the surgery was attributable to the hemorrhage in anticoagulant or antiplatelet patients.

Conclusions

Use of antiplatelet agents has increased in patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery but probably does not increase the risk of postoperative intraocular bleeding; however, when safe to suspend even for a short time the potential risk is further reduced. Anticoagulant use was associated with a higher risk, but without serious consequences. Working with a patient's medical doctor may allow safe suspension in some cases, which may further lower these risks.

Investigation of indications for antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy

The abnormal systemic conditions requiring antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy were identified as CKD, CVD, atrial fibrillation, HTN, and diabetic foot (n = 141). Among the 141 patients requiring antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy, 66 patients did not receive any medication due to an unawareness of their abnormal systemic conditions; 13 patients discontinued their treatment after the onset of ocular symptoms; and 34 patients were on aspirin, five on heparin, one on dabigatran, 15 on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel or dabigatran), and seven on combined therapy (Table 1).

Table 1
The use of anticoagulation and antiplatelet medications in PDR patients at presentation

The reasons for combined therapy were CKD combined with HTN (5/67), CKD combined with CAD and HTN (7/28), CKD combined with stroke and HTN (4/6), CKD combined with CAD and stroke (1/4), CAD (2/30), and CAD with AF (3/4). There were 109 patients with stage 2 or more severe CKD; there were 36 patients on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy and 5 out of 12 dialysis patients on heparin. There were 66 patients with a diagnosis of CAD. Among them, there were 13 patients on antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation therapy (Fig. 1).

In patients on aspirin monotherapy, aspirin was discontinued for at least one week before surgery in 27 patients (79.4%). Clopidogrel (9/15) was discontinued for at least five days before surgery in patients with CAD treated with dual antiplatelet therapy. In patients with dual antiplatelet therapy, aspirin was continued, while dabigatran (1) and clopidogrel (6/15) were discontinued. Warfarin (7/7) was stopped and bridged with low-weight-molecular heparin three days before the operation. In patients on dialysis, heparin (5) was stopped and bridged with LMWH during the perioperative period. There were 22 patients (35.5%) whose antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy was not changed due to systemic abnormalities, and none of them developed POVH.

All anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies were restarted within one week after PPV when the absence of rebleeding in the fundus was confirmed.

### Urgent surgery in patients with a recently implanted coronary drug-eluting stent: a phase II study of' bridging' antiplatelet therapy with tirofiban during temporary withdrawal of clopidogrel [^113ysb51]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with a recently implanted coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) who need urgent surgery are at increased risk of surgical bleeding unless clopidogrel is discontinued beforehand, but clopidogrel discontinuation has been associated with a high rate of adverse events due to stent thrombosis. This pilot study tested the hypothesis that the i.v. perioperative administration of the short-acting antiplatelet agent tirofiban allows the safe withdrawal of clopidogrel without increasing the rate of surgical bleeding.

Methods

Phase II study with a Simon two-stage design.

Results

Thirty patients with a recently implanted DES [median (range) 4 (1–12) months] and high-risk characteristics for stent thrombosis underwent urgent major surgery or eye surgery. Clopidogrel was to be withdrawn 5 days before surgery, and tirofiban started 24 h later, continued until 4 h before surgery, and resumed 2 h after surgery until oral clopidogrel was resumed. The use of aspirin was decided by the surgeon. There were no cases of death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, or surgical re-exploration due to bleeding during the index admission, with a risk estimate of 0–11.6% (one-tail 97.5% CI). There was one case of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) major and one of TIMI minor bleeding in the postoperative phase; another four patients were transfused without meeting the TIMI criteria for major or minor bleeding.

Conclusions

In patients with a recently implanted DES and high-risk characteristics for stent thrombosis needing urgent surgery, a 'bridging strategy' using i.v. tirofiban may allow temporary withdrawal of oral clopidogrel without increasing the risk of bleeding.

### The role of aspirin desensitization followed by oral aspirin therapy in managing patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: a Work group report from the rhinitis, rhinosinusitis and ocular allergy committee of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^111yUFJq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — indications and diagnostic confirmation for aspirin desensitization followed by oral aspirin therapy are specified as follows: Indications "include rapidly recurring nasal polyps following sinus surgery, uncontrolled rhinosinusitis despite use of standard medical therapies, and the need for frequent bursts of systemic corticosteroids to control respiratory or sinus symptoms", and "this therapy should only be recommended for patients with AERD because no clinical benefit has been described for aspirin-tolerant patients with CRSwNP and/or asthma". Because diagnosis matters for eligibility, "it is essential to confirm the diagnosis of AERD before desensitization", and "although the criterion standard for diagnosing AERD is a formal aspirin challenge, the diagnosis is more commonly made clinically", such that "for patients with known physician-diagnosed asthma, documented nasal polyps, and a clearly-reported history of a respiratory reaction after ingestion of an NSAID, the diagnosis of AERD does not need to be confirmed by a formal aspirin challenge". Patient report can be unreliable: "Up to 15% of patients with AERD are not able to identify whether or not they are intolerant to NSAIDs", and some "do not become aware of their hypersensitivity until a physician-administered provocative oral challenge induces a reaction", so "a provocative aspirin challenge is required" in selected groups that "fall into 1 of 4 categories": "Patients who have not used NSAIDs recently"; "Patients who are on a leukotriene-modifying drug"; "Patients who are less perceptive to their reactions"; and "Patients already on daily low-dose aspirin", including those "already taking 81 mg aspirin" who may only react "after stopping low-dose aspirin for at least 10 days" during a "provocative oral aspirin challenge".

### Age-specific risks, severity, time course, and outcome of bleeding on long-term antiplatelet treatment after vascular events: a population-based cohort study [^1141UEtD]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Figure 1
Annual rates of bleeding events requiring medical attention according to source of data

Ascertainment in the Oxford Vascular Study, with multiple sources versus bleeding events identified by use of administrative hospital coding alone. Age-specific reasons for major bleeds that were not identified by administrative coding alone are reported in table 2.

Table 2
Age-specific reasons for major bleeds not identified by administrative coding alone

Risk of non-major bleeds was unrelated to age and risk of major bleeds did not increase with age in patients younger than 70 years (figure 2, appendix p 10). The mean age of patients in previous trials of aspirin for secondary prevention of transient ischaemic attack or stroke was 63 years, and most were younger than 75 years (appendix pp 3–5, 11). The average annual risk of major bleeding in OXVASC patients with transient ischaemic attack or stroke younger than 75 years during the first 3 years of follow-up (1·1%, 95% CI 0·7–1·6; mean age 62 years [SD 10·3]) was similar to the annual risk of major bleeding reported in the previous trials (pooled risk 1·0%, 0·8–1·1; appendix pp 11, 12).

Figure 2
Age-specific annual rate of bleeding events requiring medical attention

Stratified by severity and by antiplatelet treatment immediately before the event. Annual rate derived as number per 100 patient-years. We used Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) criteria to define bleeding events as major (substantially disabling with persistent sequelae, intraocular bleeding leading to significant loss of vision, or bleeding requiring transfusion of ≥ 2 units of blood) and life-threatening or fatal (symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, fall in haemoglobin of ≥ 5 g/dL, hypotension requiring intravenous inotropes, or required surgical intervention or transfusion of ≥ 4 units of blood).

The annual risk of major bleeds in OXVASC increased steeply above age 70 years (figure 2), reaching 4·1% at age 85 years or older, with similar patterns for both life-threatening and fatal bleeds, reflecting high risks of upper gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeds at older ages (appendix p 10). Results were similar in analyses confined to patients still receiving antiplatelet treatment and in analyses excluding bleeds occurring during treatment with aspirin plus clopidogrel (figure 2, appendix p 13). The antiplatelet regimen at the time of bleeding did not differ with age (appendix p 14).

### Patterns of antiplatelet therapy during noncardiac surgery in patients with second-generation drug-eluting stents [^111qUXoT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Patterns of Perioperative APT

Of the 3582 eligible patients, 1832 (51%) continued APT and 1750 (49%) discontinued APT before NCS (Figure 1). The baseline characteristics of the 2 groups are shown in Table 1. Incidence of discontinuing APT widely differs across types of surgery. More patients discontinued APT before certain type of surgeries including gynecology (79%), breast (70%), head and neck (63%), and intra‐abdominal (62%) surgeries; however, only some of the candidates for vascular (15%) or ophthalmologic (27%) surgeries discontinued APT. In women, preoperative use of aspirin monotherapy, β‐blocker, or renin‐angiotensin system inhibitor and surgery with higher cardiac or hemorrhage risk were independently associated with discontinuing APT. Chronic kidney disease, stable angina, high‐risk PCI, and urgent surgery were related to discontinuing APT (Table 1, Table S4). Seventy‐five percent of patients undergoing NCS within 6 months after PCI preoperatively continued APT, while 44% of patients undergoing NCS 12 months after PCI continued APT. Compared with other patterns of perioperative APT, continuing DAPT was associated with higher incidence of risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, anemia, MI, and high‐risk PCI (Table S5). Median time interval between PCI and NCS in patients continuing DAPT (7 months) was much shorter than the other groups (23–27 months; Table S5). Median duration of DAPT was 10.3 months in patients with stable angina and 11.2 months in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

### Management of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in glaucoma surgery [^115eBhXP]. Journal of Glaucoma (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of antithrombotic therapy is rising as the population of older adults grows and novel agents with wider indications emerge. Likewise, surgical treatment of glaucoma may become increasingly common as the prevalence of glaucoma increases and innovative treatment options are developed. These trends highlight the need to understand how best to manage antithrombotic therapy in the context of glaucoma surgery. This review article describes current literature on antithrombotic therapy and perioperative thromboembolic risk evaluation based on individual factors. In addition, guidance is offered on the management of antithrombotic therapy in the setting of each type of glaucoma surgery, with an emphasis on a multidisciplinary approach involving the patients' treating physicians.

### Perioperative use of warfarin and aspirin in cataract surgery by Canadian society of cataract and refractive surgery members: survey [^113bm8dF]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To survey the members of the Canadian Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (CSCRS) and identify their practices regarding the perioperative use of warfarin and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) in cataract surgery.

Setting

Private practice, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.

Methods

Members of the CSCRS were faxed a questionnaire that examined their perioperative management of patients being treated with warfarin and aspirin.

Results

Of the 110 eligible participants, 82 returned a completed questionnaire, representing a response rate of 74.5%. Warfarin or aspirin was routinely stopped prior to cataract surgery by 25.6% of the respondents. The majority of surgeons who discontinued these medications reported doing so 3 to 7 days prior to surgery and resumed their use 1 to 2 days postoperatively. Topical anesthesia and clear corneal incisions were preferred by the higher volume surgeons. These surgeons were also less likely to discontinue either warfarin or aspirin preoperatively.

Conclusions

The majority of the Canadian Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery members do not stop either warfarin or aspirin for cataract surgery during the perioperative period.

### ASCEND-eye: effects of aspirin on diabetic retinopathy [^113efdzc]. Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Preclinical studies support a protective role for aspirin in early diabetic retinopathy (DR), but the findings from randomized trials are limited. We present randomized evidence for the efficacy and safety of aspirin on DR outcomes.

Design

A substudy of the A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes (ASCEND) double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 100 mg aspirin daily for the primary prevention of serious cardiovascular events in people with diabetes.

Participants

Fifteen thousand four hundred eighty United Kingdom adults at least 40 years of age with diabetes.

Methods

Linkage to electronic National Health Service Diabetic Eye Screening Programme records in England and Wales and confirmation of participant-reported eye events via medical record review were carried out. Log-rank methods were used for intention-to-treat analyses of time until the first primary efficacy and safety outcomes.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy end point was the first record of referable disease after randomization, a composite of referable retinopathy or referable maculopathy based on the grading criteria defined by the United Kingdom National Screening Committee. The primary safety outcome was the first sight-threatening eye bleed, defined as clinically significant bleeding in the eye that resulted in unresolved visual loss or required an urgent intervention such as laser photocoagulation, vitreoretinal surgery, intraocular injection, or a combination thereof.

Results

Linkage data were obtained for 7360 participants (48% of those randomized in ASCEND). During the mean follow-up of 6.5 years, 539 participants (14.6%) experienced a referable disease event in the aspirin group, compared with 522 participants (14.2%) in the placebo group (rate ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91–1.16; P = 0.64). No statistically significant between-group difference was found in the proportions of sight-threatening eye bleed events (57 participants [0.7%] and 64 participants [0.8%], respectively; rate ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.62–1.27).

Discussion

These data exclude any clinically meaningful benefits of aspirin for DR, but give reassurance regarding the ophthalmologic safety of aspirin.

Antihistamines around desensitization — The use of histamine 1 receptor antagonists before aspirin desensitization is controversial; some authors have advocated discontinuation before challenge and desensitization because they may blunt a reaction to aspirin and potentially mask the sentinel reaction, whereas others have performed desensitization while continuing antihistamines, especially in shorter protocols.

The changing profile of patients undergoing ophthalmic surgery, with an increase in prevalence of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drug use, predisposes to bleeding complications. This mandates an awareness of these agents, allowing optimal patient management. We review traditional and newer agents in the context of cataract, vitreoretinal, glaucoma and oculoplastic surgery. Recommendations are given for continuation, cessation and re-commencement of these agents in order to minimise the risk of bleeding and thrombotic/thromboembolic complications.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin desensitization for AERD — timing with planned sinus surgery: Given the potential for increased intraoperative bleeding and associated decrease in intraoperative visualization accompanying NSAID use, it is advisable to delay aspirin desensitization until the completion of planned sinus surgery, and reactions to aspirin are generally less severe when desensitization is performed following sinus surgery. Although controlled studies are lacking, general expert consensus suggests that long-term clinical outcomes are improved when the initiation of aspirin therapy occurs after sinus surgery, and it is often recommended that a sinus surgery to debulk the inflammatory nasal polyp tissue precede aspirin desensitization.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Acular) [^115X1u7U]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1

	Delayed Healing

Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may slow or delay healing. Topical corticosteroids are also known to slow or delay healing. Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for healing problems.

5.2

	Cross-Sensitivity or Hypersensitivity

There is the potential for cross-sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid, phenylacetic acid derivatives, and other NSAIDs. There have been reports of bronchospasm or exacerbation of asthma associated with the use of ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution in patients who have either a known hypersensitivity to aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or a past medical history of asthma. Therefore, caution should be used when treating individuals who have previously exhibited sensitivities to these drugs.

5.3

	Increased Bleeding Time

With some NSAIDs, there exists the potential for increased bleeding time due to interference with thrombocyte aggregation. There have been reports that ocularly applied nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may cause increased bleeding of ocular tissues (including hyphemas) in conjunction with ocular surgery.

It is recommended that ACULAR be used with caution in patients with known bleeding tendencies or who are receiving other medications, which may prolong bleeding time.

5.4

	Corneal Effects

Use of topical NSAIDs may result in keratitis. In some susceptible patients, continued use of topical NSAIDs may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal thinning, corneal erosion, corneal ulceration, or corneal perforation. These events may be sight threatening. Patients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately discontinue use of topical NSAIDs and should be closely monitored for corneal health.

Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases (e.g., dry eye syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis, or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time may be at increased risk for corneal adverse events which may become sight threatening. Topical NSAIDs should be used with caution in these patients.

Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs also suggests that use more than 1 day prior to surgery or use beyond 14 days post-surgery may increase patient risk for the occurrence and severity of corneal adverse events.

5.5

	Risk of Contamination

Avoid allowing the tip of the bottle to contact the eye or surrounding structures because this could cause the tip to become contaminated by common bacteria known to cause ocular infections. Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated solutions.

5.6

	Contact Lens Wear

ACULAR should not be administered while wearing contact lenses.

### Evaluation of the need to discontinue antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications before cataract surgery [^115eaJ97]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the risk for intraoperative and postoperative bleeding associated with antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant treatment in patients having uneventful phacoemulsification.

Setting

Kokura Memorial Hospital, Kitakyusyu, Japan.

Methods

In a nonrandomized case series, consecutive patients had phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation under sub-Tenon anesthesia. All patients were on warfarin, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) therapy, or both. Patients discontinued therapy 1 week before surgery (discontinuation group) or continued the therapeutic regimen until the time of surgery (maintenance group).

Results

The discontinuation group comprised 182 patients and the maintenance group, 173 patients. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the mean prothrombin time-international normalized ratio in patients taking warfarin (P = 0.6). Although there was no significant intraoperative bleeding in any case, 47 eyes (16.5%) in the maintenance group and 31 eyes (10.8%) in the discontinuation group had a subconjunctival hemorrhage postoperatively (P = 0.0309). Minor postoperative ocular bleeding occurred in 11 eyes (4.0%) in the maintenance group and 7 eyes (2.5%) in the discontinuation group (P = 0.4). During the 1-month postoperative period, the mean change in corrected distance visual acuity was -0.462 logMAR ± 0.331 (SD) in the maintenance group and -0.434 ± 0.318 logMAR in the discontinuation group (P = 0.3).

Conclusions

Patients taking warfarin, aspirin, or both up to the time of phacoemulsification had a significantly higher incidence of subconjunctival hemorrhage than those who discontinued therapy. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications or in visual improvement.

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: the use of blood components and their alternatives [^112M3gc5]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Antiplatelet drugs

Antiplatelet drugs are used in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. They may be taken individually or as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), usually following acute coronary syndromes or after coronary artery stenting. Aspirin inhibits the production of thromboxane. If taken alone it should be continued for most procedures until the day before surgery as most evidence suggests it does not increase bleeding, except for surgeries with a particularly high bleeding risk or surgery in a confined space (brain, posterior chamber of the eye, medullary canal) where it should be discontinued 5 days before the procedure. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor (P2Y12) antagonists (including clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor) are thienopyridines. They should be discontinued 5–7 days pre‐operatively. Consideration should be given to the use of haemadsorption filters if urgent or emergency cardiopulmonary bypass is undertaken in patients with P2Y12 inhibitors.

Antiplatelet drugs in patients with coronary stents having non‐cardiac surgery

The management of these drugs in patients with coronary stents in situ is more challenging. Dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for at least 4 weeks after the insertion of a bare metal stent and for 12 months after a drug‐eluting stent. The risk of peri‐operative adverse cardiac events reduces as time passes following the insertion of the stent. Very low bleeding‐risk procedures can be undertaken without stopping DAPT. Low bleeding‐risk procedures in patients with low thrombotic risk may be undertaken with discontinuation of the ADP‐receptor antagonist (5–7 days pre‐operatively) with aspirin continuing.

Ideally, elective surgery in patients deemed to be at high thrombotic risk (within 6 months of stent insertion) should be deferred until they are lower risk. If this is not possible it should proceed on aspirin with temporary discontinuation of the ADP‐receptor antagonist. Bridging with a parenteral short‐acting glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, such as tirofiban or eptifibatide, during the period of ADP receptor antagonist withdrawal can also be considered in conjunction with cardiology input.

For emergency surgery, management depends on the antiplatelet agent and when the last dose was taken. Platelet transfusions have been proven to improve haemostasis. Platelet function testing may be helpful to determine the degree of platelet inhibition. Neuraxial anaesthesia should be avoided when ADP antagonists have been taken within 7 days, although aspirin is generally thought to be safe to continue.

### Management of antithrombotic therapies in patients scheduled for eye surgery [^114gaX3V]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

The large majority of patients undergoing ophthalmic surgery are elderly and take systemic medications on a regular basis, including antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatments. It is current practice for many physicians to discontinue antithrombotic treatment prior to surgery to reduce bleeding complications that may lead to retrobulbar haemorrhage and, ultimately, to loss of vision. However, discontinuation of antithrombotic treatment in such patients may lead to thromboembolic events with serious consequences. The present narrative review highlights the risk of thrombosis when discontinuing antithrombotic drugs and the risk of bleeding when continuing them. The published literature on this topic shows that discontinuation of antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment leads to a substantially increased risk of arterial or venous thromboembolic events and related complications, especially in patients with atrial fibrillation, prosthetic heart valves or recent coronary stenting. This risk is distinctly higher than the risk of significant local haemorrhage. Ophthalmic bleeding events reported in the literature are usually minor, without serious consequences, even if antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatments are continued, provided that the anticoagulation level is within the therapeutic range. Thus, the current data are in favour of maintaining antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs for most ophthalmic procedures, regardless of the anaesthetic techniques.

### Low-dose aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention-cardiovascular risks after its perioperative withdrawal versus bleeding risks with its continuation-review and meta-analysis [^113u5mzC]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Low-dose aspirin given for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease is frequently withdrawn prior to surgical or diagnostic procedures to reduce bleeding complications. This may expose patients to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Aim of the study was to review and quantify cardiovascular risks because of periprocedural aspirin withdrawal and bleeding risks with the continuation of aspirin.

Methods

We screened MEDLINE (January 1970-October 2004) with additional manual cross-referencing for clinical studies, surveys on the opinions of doctors and guidelines.

Results

Studies reporting the relative risk of acute cardiovascular events after aspirin withdrawal when compared with its continuation were not found. However, retrospective investigations revealed that aspirin withdrawal precedes up to 10.2% of acute cardiovascular syndromes. The time interval between discontinuation and acute cerebral events was 14.3 ± 11.3 days, 8.5 ± 3.6 days for acute coronary syndromes, and 25.8 ± 18.1 days for acute peripheral arterial syndromes (P < 0.02 versus acute coronary syndromes). On aspirin-related bleeding risks, we obtained 41 (12 observational retrospective, 19 observational prospective, 10 randomized) studies, reporting on 49 590 patients (14 981 on aspirin). Baseline frequency of bleeding complications varied between 0 (skin lesion excision, cataract surgery) and 75% (transrectal prostate biopsy). Whilst aspirin increased the rate of bleeding complications by factor 1.5 (median, interquartile range: 1.0–2.5), it did not lead to a higher level of the severity of bleeding complications (exception: intracranial surgery, and possibly transurethral prostatectomy). Surveys amongst doctors on the management of this problem demonstrate wide variations. Available guidelines are scarce and in part contradictory.

Conclusions

Only if low-dose aspirin may cause bleeding risks with increased mortality or sequels comparable with the observed cardiovascular risks after aspirin withdrawal, it should be discontinued prior to an intended operation or procedure. Controlled clinical studies are urgently needed.

### Factors related to postoperative vitreous hemorrhage after small-gauge vitrectomy in proliferative diabetic retinopathy patients [^112qTq5E]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our cohort of PDR patients had a high prevalence of CKD, CAD (141/220), and (CVD (141/220). Antiplatelet use is recommended in DM patients to reduce CVD mortality risk. The long-term use of combined antiplatelet or anticoagulation is required in most diabetic patients with CKD or CVD, especially in patients with AF or deep vein thrombosis. Contrary to expectations, 66 out of 141 patients with CKD or CVD were not on proper anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy due to their unawareness of the combined systemic conditions prior to preoperative assessment.

Most patients were instructed to discontinue anticoagulation, antiplatelet medications, or bridging therapy with LMWH before PPV (64.5%). Aspirin monotherapy was discontinued for at least one week (27/34), dual antiplatelet therapy was switched to aspirin monotherapy for at least five days (15/15), and anticoagulation therapy was replaced with warfarin (7), and heparin (5) was bridged with LMWH during the perioperative period. The anticoagulation or antiplatelet plans of twenty-two patients (35.5%) were not changed due to systemic abnormalities. Thirteen patients stopped anticoagulation medication after the onset of ocular symptoms without physician consultation. To reduce the risk of thrombosis, most patients' previous anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications were restarted one to two days after PPV and following post-PPV ocular evaluation of the possibility of active bleeding, according to the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines for the perioperative management of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. Our data demonstrated that this practice of altering the systemic therapy in advance of PPV surgery (53) might increase the occurrence of POVH compared to a small sample of patients who continued the previous therapy (22). It should be explored in a further study enrolling a larger sample of PDR patients with adjusted or continued anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1161x5Qh]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy — CHEST clinical practice guideline scope and strong recommendations — addresses 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions for patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy who require an elective surgery/procedure; it is separated into four broad categories (vitamin K antagonist [VKA]; perioperative heparin bridging while receiving a VKA; direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC]; antiplatelet drug) and generates strong or conditional practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. A multidisciplinary panel generated 44 guideline recommendations, of which two are strong recommendations: against the use of heparin bridging in patients with atrial fibrillation and continuation of VKA therapy in patients having a pacemaker or internal cardiac defibrillator implantation; separate recommendations address minor procedures, comprising dental, dermatologic, ophthalmologic, pacemaker/internal cardiac defibrillator implantation, and GI (endoscopic) procedures.

### A comprehensive update on aspirin management during noncardiac surgery [^112gyZbe]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is considered critical lifelong therapy for patients with established cardiovascular (CV) disease (including coronary artery, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial diseases) and is consequently one of the most widely used medications worldwide. However, the indications for aspirin use continue to evolve and recent trials question its efficacy for primary prevention. Although one third of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery and at risk for a major adverse CV event receive aspirin perioperatively, uncertainty still exists about how aspirin should be optimally managed in this context, and significant practice variability remains. Recent trials suggest that the risks of continuing aspirin during the perioperative period outweigh the benefits in many cases, but data on patients with high CV risk remain limited. We performed a comprehensive PubMed and Medline literature search using the following keywords: aspirin, aspirin withdrawal, perioperative, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, and CV disease; we manually reviewed all relevant citations for inclusion. Patients taking aspirin for the primary prevention of CV disease should likely discontinue it during the perioperative period, especially when there is a high risk of bleeding. Patients with established CV disease but without a coronary stent should likely continue aspirin during the perioperative period unless undergoing closed-space surgery. Patients with a history of coronary stenting also likely need aspirin continuation throughout the perioperative period for nonclosed space procedures. Perioperative clinicians need to balance the risks of ceasing aspirin before surgery against its continuation during the perioperative interval using a patient-specific strategy. The guidance on decision-making with regard to perioperative aspirin cessation or continuation using currently available clinical data from studies in high-risk patients along with nonclinical aspirin studies is conflicting and does not enable a simplified or unified answer. However, pertinent guidelines on CV disease management provide a basic framework for aspirin management, and large trial findings provide some insight into the safety of perioperative aspirin cessation in some contexts, although uncertainty on perioperative aspirin still exists. This review provides an evidence-based update on perioperative aspirin management in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery with a focus on recommendations for perioperative clinicians on continuing versus holding aspirin during this context.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Corticosteroids around desensitization — Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and ICSs combined with long‑acting β2‑agonists for asthma should be continued during aspirin desensitization and, if already in use with stable disease, at the same dose; if asthma is well controlled and ICSs are not routinely used, the added benefit of starting an ICS before desensitization is unclear. The benefit of starting systemic corticosteroids in a patient who is not chronically dependent and whose asthma is controlled is also unknown, although select patients with poorly controlled asthma may need a short course of oral corticosteroids before desensitization; there is little data on intranasal corticosteroids during oral aspirin desensitization though many practitioners continue their use.

### Risk factors for severe bleeding complications in glaucoma surgery and the role of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents [^1114ugMN]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intraoperative bleeding can negatively influence the ophthalmic surgical result. This is particularly true for glaucoma surgery, where bleeding can lead to procedural failure or irreversible optic-nerve damage caused by postoperatively elevated/excessive intraocular pressure. Patients requiring glaucoma surgery are often taking various systemic medications including antiplatelet (AP) and anticoagulant (AC) agents, and the percentage of patients taking these has been rising for years. The question glaucoma surgeons face is whether these medications should be discontinued for surgery to possibly reduce the risk of bleeding, or whether a potentially higher risk of thromboembolic events is acceptable. Despite its being an everyday topic for glaucoma surgeons, there is, as well as for retinal surgeons, still no standardized guideline on how to proceed with the various AP and AC agents prior to different glaucoma procedures. Efforts have been made to assess the effect of platelet inhibitors or anticoagulants on bleeding frequency and severity during different ophthalmic procedures. In retinal surgery, there is growing evidence that the use of anticoagulant medications is unlikely to have a significant impact on the incidence of severe bleeding complications. A prospective study of 374 retinal patients performed concurrently with this study also came to this conclusion. However, in glaucoma surgery, uncertainty prevails regarding the extent to which anticoagulant medications raise the intraoperative bleeding risk. Studies demonstrating an increased risk of bleeding in patients using vitamin k antagonists appeared over a decade ago. More recent reviews recommend taking an individualized approach to each patient's preoperative management, but there still seems to be too little known about the influence of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). The purpose of this prospective study was thus to identify risk factors for intraoperative severe bleeding events, and to evaluate the influence of AP and AC agents on their incidence and severity in glaucoma surgical procedures. Another aim was to validate a consensus scale of bleeding complications serving as a possible guide for upcoming glaucoma studies.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^1134Fnu2]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Antithrombotic therapy in cataract surgery — an analysis of 48,862 surgeries reported higher subconjunctival hemorrhage with warfarin or clopidogrel (3.7% warfarin, 4.4% clopidogrel, 1.7% nonusers) and more anesthetic‑block complications (6.2% warfarin, 8% clopidogrel, 4.3% nonusers), yet no significant increase in potentially sight‑threatening local anesthetic or operative hemorrhage, and no increase with aspirin alone. A study of 19,283 surgeries (74% with a peribulbar or retrobulbar block) found no increased risk of ocular hemorrhagic events when aspirin or warfarin were continued, though subconjunctival hemorrhage and eyelid ecchymosis were not reported. Data on newer anticoagulants are sparse. In a hospital series screening 141,213 emergencies, three cases of grade IV retrobulbar hemorrhage were identified; two patients were on combined acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel and had retrobulbar injections, whereas a U.K. series of 48,862 cataract surgeries found no increase in anesthetic or hemorrhagic complications with dual antiplatelet or combined aspirin/warfarin treatment receiving blocks or sub‑Tenon's anesthesia. Overall, several studies show a higher incidence of subconjunctival hemorrhage with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication, but available data do not show increased sight‑threatening complications or decreased postoperative visual acuity. Evidence‑based guidelines recommend continuation of anticoagulants and antiplatelet medications in patients undergoing cataract surgery, with management tailored to the individual patient. There are no recommendations from either the American Heart Association or the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons to prescribe systemic antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with artificial heart valves or joint prostheses who undergo cataract surgery.

### Perioperative aspirin management after POISE-2: some answers, but questions remain [^1163GcQ9]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2015). Low credibility.

Aspirin constitutes important uninterrupted lifelong therapy for many patients with cardiovascular (CV) disease or significant (CV) risk factors. However, whether aspirin should be continued or withheld in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery is a common clinical conundrum that balances the potential of aspirin for decreasing thrombotic risk with its possibility for increasing perioperative blood loss. In this focused review, we describe the role of aspirin in treating and preventing cardiovascular disease, summarize the most important literature on the perioperative use of aspirin (including the recently published PeriOperative ISchemic Evaluation [POISE]-2 trial), and offer current recommendations for managing aspirin during the perioperative period. POISE-2 suggests that aspirin administration during the perioperative period does not change the risk of a cardiovascular event and may result in increased bleeding. However, these findings are tempered by a number of methodological issues related to the study. On the basis of currently available literature, including POISE-2, aspirin should not be administered to patients undergoing surgery unless there is a definitive guideline-based primary or secondary prevention indication. Aside from closed-space procedures, intramedullary spine surgery, or possibly prostate surgery, moderate-risk patients taking lifelong aspirin for a guideline-based primary or secondary indication may warrant continuation of their aspirin throughout the perioperative period.

### Long-term use of aspirin and age-related macular degeneration [^112hauve]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

Aspirin is widely used for relief of pain and for cardioprotective effects. Its use is of concern to ophthalmologists when ocular surgery is being considered and also in the presence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Objective

To examine the association of regular aspirin use with incidence of AMD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Beaver Dam Eye Study, a longitudinal population-based study of age-related eye diseases conducted in Wisconsin. Examinations were performed every 5 years over a 20-year period (1988–1990 through 2008–2010). Study participants (N = 4926) were aged 43 to 86 years at the baseline examination. At subsequent examinations, participants were asked if they had regularly used aspirin at least twice a week for more than 3 months.

Main Outcome Measure

Incidence of early AMD, late AMD, and 2 subtypes of late AMD (neovascular AMD and pure geographic atrophy), assessed in retinal photographs according to the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System.

Results

The mean duration of follow-up was 14.8 years. There were 512 incident cases of early AMD (of 6243 person-visits at risk) and 117 incident cases of late AMD (of 8621 person-visits at risk) over the course of the study. Regular aspirin use 10 years prior to retinal examination was associated with late AMD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.63 [95% CI, 1.01–2.63]; p = 0.05), with estimated incidence of 1.76% (95% CI, 1.17%-2.64%) in regular users and 1.03% (95% CI, 0.70%-1.51%) in nonusers. For subtypes of late AMD, regular aspirin use 10 years prior to retinal examination was significantly associated with neovascular AMD (HR, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.20–4.15]; p = 0.01) but not pure geographic atrophy (HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.25–1.95]; p = 0.45). Aspirin use 5 years (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.71–1.05]; p = 0.13) or 10 years (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.65–1.13]; p = 0.28) prior to retinal examination was not associated with incident early AMD.

Conclusions

Among an adult cohort, aspirin use 5 years prior to observed incidence was not associated with incident early or late AMD. However, regular aspirin use 10 years prior was associated with a small but statistically significant increase in the risk of incident late and neovascular AMD.

### Incidence of hemorrhagic complications after intravitreal bevacizumab (avastin) or ranibizumab (lucentis) injections on systemically anticoagulated patients [^116Xe9mC]. Retina (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the risk of hemorrhagic complications when performing intravitreal injections on systemically anticoagulated patients.

Methods

A single-center retrospective case series of 520 consecutive patients (675 eyes) receiving 3,106 antivascular endothelial growth factor injections. Patients on the systemic anticoagulants Coumadin (warfarin sodium) or Plavix (clopidogrel bisulfate) were identified, as well as patients on aspirin. Demographic parameters were recorded, as well as relevant anticoagulant medications, preoperative/postoperative best-corrected visual acuities and intraocular pressures, previous ocular surgery, relative ocular diagnoses, and injection complications.

Results

Of all patients, 104 were on Coumadin (134 eyes; 548 injections), 90 were on Plavix (123 eyes; 523 injections), 7 were on both Coumadin and Plavix (8 eyes; 33 injections), and 319 were not anticoagulated (400 eyes; 2002 injections). Also, 1,254 injections were on patients taking aspirin. There were no hemorrhagic complications (choroidal hemorrhage, vitreous hemorrhage, or increased submacular hemorrhage) noted in the Plavix (P = 1.0000; 95% confidence interval = 0.0000–0.0088), Coumadin (P = 1.0000; 95% confidence interval = 0.0000–0.0084), or aspirin (P = 1.0000; 95% confidence interval = 0.0000–0.0037) groups.

Conclusion

The risk of hemorrhagic complications in systemically anticoagulated patients receiving intravitreal injections is extremely low. Because of the demonstrated thromboembolic risk of stopping anticoagulant therapy, we recommend that patients continue their current regiment without cessation.

### Factors related to postoperative vitreous hemorrhage after small-gauge vitrectomy in proliferative diabetic retinopathy patients [^1156Juv5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the leading cause of blindness in working-age individuals. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) may be required to treat the complications of PDR, such as vitreous hemorrhage (VH) and tractional retinal detachment (TRD), to prevent patients from severe, irreversible vision loss. Postoperative vitreous hemorrhage (POVH) is a common PPV complication and occasionally requires reoperation.

PDR, as a complication of diabetes, is often combined with diabetic cardio-cerebral vascular diseases (CVDs) or chronic kidney diseases (CKDs). Systemic diabetic complications may require long-term anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy to prevent thromboembolism. The surgeon often must balance the risk of thromboembolism and the risk of bleeding in the perioperative adjustment of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. The perioperative guidelines on the adjustment of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in noncardiac surgery show that in acute coronary syndrome, for patients with percutaneous intervention or drug-eluting stents, aspirin is recommended to be continued and clopidogrel should be restarted as soon as possible after surgery; in patients with atrial fibrillation a mechanical heart valve, or venous thromboembolism, warfarin is typically stopped five days before surgery and resumed within 24 h postprocedure in cases of moderate bleeding risk, and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridging therapy may be considered in the perioperative period; in patients with CKD, heparin is recommended. The LMWH bridging therapy is commonly used in dialysis patients or diabetic CKD patients during the perioperative period. There is no guideline or consensus on the perioperative adjustment of anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy in diabetic vitrectomy. The consensus regarding ocular surgery recommends that there is no need to stop anticoagulation therapy in only cataract surgery, which is regarded as a procedure with a minimal bleeding risk.

### Should more patients continue aspirin therapy perioperatively? clinical impact of aspirin withdrawal syndrome [^111nAFeK]. Annals of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an evidence-based focused review of aspirin use in the perioperative period along with an in-depth discussion of the considerations and risks associated with its preoperative withdrawal.

Background

For patients with established cardiovascular disease, taking aspirin is considered a critical therapy. The cessation of aspirin can cause a platelet rebound phenomenon and prothrombotic state leading to major adverse cardiovascular events. Despite the risks of aspirin withdrawal, which are exacerbated during the perioperative period, standard practice has been to stop aspirin before elective surgery for fear of excessive bleeding. Mounting evidence suggests that this practice should be abandoned.

Methods

We performed a PubMed and Medline literature search using the keywords aspirin, withdrawal, and perioperative. We manually reviewed relevant citations for inclusion.

Results/Conclusions

Clinicians should employ a patient-specific strategy for perioperative aspirin management that weighs the risks of stopping aspirin with those associated with its continuation. Most patients, especially those taking aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention, should have their aspirin continued throughout the perioperative period. When aspirin is held preoperatively, the aspirin withdrawal syndrome may significantly increase the risk of a major thromboembolic complication. For many operative procedures, the risk of perioperative bleeding while continuing aspirin is minimal, as compared with the concomitant thromboembolic risks associated with aspirin withdrawal. Those cases where aspirin should be stopped include patients undergoing intracranial, middle ear, posterior eye, intramedullary spine, and possibly transurethral prostatectomy surgery.

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^112kV8ws]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Discontinuation of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents — evidence and consensus indicate that one nonrandomized comparative observational study is equivocal regarding discontinuing warfarin and replacing it with low-molecular-weight heparin on transfusion requirements (Category B1-E evidence). Observational studies report blood loss volumes ranging from 265 to 756 mL and transfusion requirements ranging from a mean of 0.08 to 0.5 units when clopidogrel is discontinued preoperatively (Category B3 evidence). The literature is insufficient to evaluate discontinuing aspirin before surgery, with two RCTs versus placebo reporting equivocal findings (P > 0.01) for perioperative blood loss, transfusion, or postoperative adverse events (Category A2-E evidence). Survey findings state both consultants and ASA members strongly agree regarding discontinuing anticoagulation therapy for elective surgery in consultation with a specialist, if clinically possible discontinuing nonsurgical antiplatelet agents sufficiently in advance except in patients with prior percutaneous coronary interventions, and considering thrombosis versus increased bleeding risk when altering anticoagulation status.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin challenge versus aspirin desensitization — both use the same protocol and, after a reaction, patients should be treated and monitored for at least 3 hours until symptoms have resolved; in a challenge the protocol is discontinued and the patient is discharged, whereas in a desensitization the provocative aspirin dose is repeated and the protocol is continued through the 325-mg dose of aspirin.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^117KS8tX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Aspirin therapy after desensitization and perioperative management — To maintain tolerance, continued daily administration of at least 325 mg of aspirin once daily is required; for control of nasal polyps/airway inflammation, initial doses of 650 mg twice daily may be necessary. Gastrointestinal protection with an enteric‑coated aspirin and other prophylaxis may be considered. Gaps in aspirin doses > 48 hours can lead to loss of tolerance, and after 5 days all patients will react; if a procedure allows a 48‑hour window, aspirin can be restarted immediately after surgery, and a strategy of 325 mg daily for 7 days before surgery with holding the day prior and day of, then restarting immediately postoperatively, allows retention of tolerance. If off aspirin for > 48 hours, desensitization should be repeated; ibuprofen bridging is another consideration. Pretreatment is recommended with leukotriene modifying agents and inhaled corticosteroid/long‑acting beta agonist inhalers should also be considered; once desensitized, universal tolerance to all COX–1‑inhibiting NSAIDs (in addition to aspirin) is achieved.

WARNINGS

The potential exists for cross sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Therefore, caution should be used when treating individuals who have previously exhibited sensitivities to these drugs.

With nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the potential exists for increased bleeding time due to interference with thrombocyte aggregation. There have been reports that ocularly applied nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may cause increased bleeding tendency of ocular tissues in conjunction with ocular surgery.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^114wTwNn]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) management — observational data and evidence gaps are as follows: Observational evidence reported a low rate (1.6%) of major pocket hematomas and a 25-patient observational study of DOAC continuation for cataract surgery identified no bleeding events; in low-bleed-risk procedures, preoperative DOAC interruption versus continuation was associated with lower overall and minor bleeding (OR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.91; OR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.93), persisting after adjustment (OR = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.95). Almost all evidence pertains to atrial fibrillation, few retrospective case series address VTE, and there are no studies for low-dose DOAC therapy (rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid) with ASA in stable coronary or peripheral arterial disease.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^1135esd6]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Aspirin and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) — Observational studies have indicated a possible link between aspirin use and AMD. The Beaver Dam Eye Study reported two times the incidence of late macular degeneration in patients who used aspirin at least twice weekly for 10 years compared with those who used no aspirin; other studies have shown a potential protective effect of aspirin against the development of AMD; in a meta-analyses of 10 studies, the use of aspirin was not associated with an increased risk of AMD, but another meta-analysis of 16 studies identified an association with aspirin in a subgroup of studies with long-term follow-up. In light of all of the available information on aspirin use and AMD, the current preferred practice for patients who have been instructed by their physician to use aspirin is to continue their aspirin therapy as prescribed.

### Aspirin and warfarin therapy in oculoplastic surgery [^11248pWg]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2000). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

There are no nationally agreed guidelines on preoperative management of patients who are on aspirin or warfarin therapy. There is considerable evidence that complication rates in anticoagulated patients are low whereas there are higher rates of thromboembolic complications in those whose therapy is manipulated. This survey aimed to establish oculoplastic specialist and non-specialist ophthalmic surgeons' current management practice of patients before oculoplastic surgery who are taking aspirin or warfarin and to assess the rate of complications in these patients.

Method

An anonymous postal questionnaire survey of all ophthalmic consultants and specialist registrars in the Wessex region along with oculoplastic specialists in the Southern region.

Results

The overall response rate was 92%. Preoperative management was influenced both by type of operation and by type of surgeon. A statistically significant higher proportion of surgeons would consider altering warfarin compared with aspirin treatment. For all procedures, non-specialists are unlikely to stop aspirin therapy, and are less likely to stop warfarin before all procedures apart from dacrocystorhinostomy. A significant proportion of surgeons (18%) would allow insufficient time for the coagulation status of the patient to change after altering treatment. A considerable proportion of surgeons (54%) reported that they had seen complications as a result either of stopping or continuing anticoagulation therapy.

Conclusions

In this survey, at least half the surgeons questioned would consider stopping warfarin before oculoplastic procedures. Over half of all surgeons have seen complications related to aspirin or warfarin, some of which were serious. A suggested approach to minimising patient risk is given.
