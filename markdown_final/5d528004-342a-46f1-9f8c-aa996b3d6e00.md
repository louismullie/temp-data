## Question

How is PANDAS managed and treated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage and treat suspected PANDAS. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify how to document streptococcal infection and what labs are truly informative. Next, I will review first-line infection management and prevention strategies, followed by symptomatic neuropsychiatric care. After that, I need to consider anti-inflammatory options, escalation to immunomodulatory therapy, and the debated role of tonsillectomy. Finally, I will outline longitudinal monitoring, discuss controversies and uncertainties, and synthesize a pragmatic algorithm with shared decision-making built in.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and acknowledge the controversy. PANDAS remains an evolving and debated entity; core criteria include prepubertal onset, abrupt dramatic onset of OCD and/or tics, an episodic course with abrupt exacerbations, a temporal relationship to Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and neurological abnormalities such as hyperactivity or choreiform movements during flares, so I should verify each of these carefully and avoid overcalling the diagnosis in ambiguous cases [^notfound]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; there are no robust, widely accepted biomarkers, and anti-basal ganglia antibodies have not consistently distinguished cases from controls, which means clinical pattern recognition and exclusion of mimics are essential [^114FYgtT]. I need to ensure appropriate subspecialty input because community misdiagnosis rates are high and lead to inappropriate antibiotics or immunosuppression without documented infection [^116L9vWQ].

> I should double-check the laboratory approach and what "temporal association" really means. Throat culture and rapid antigen testing with backup culture remain standards for diagnosing acute GABHS pharyngitis, and paired antistreptococcal antibody titers such as ASO and anti–DNase B can help establish recent infection, but I should interpret titers judiciously and in context of serial changes rather than single values [^115sgq15]. Wait, let me verify the role of adjunctive panels; the Cunningham Panel may show antineuronal antibodies and correlate with symptom change in some series, but its clinical utility remains debated and should not replace core diagnostic criteria or dictate immunotherapy on its own [^115sgq15] [^114qFoEM]. For suspected pharyngitis, I need to remember Centor-based risk stratification has lower utility in children, so lab confirmation matters more in pediatrics before labeling infections as streptococcal triggers [^115wtfuM].

> Next, I should review the differential and rule out mimics that can look similar but require different treatments. Tourette syndrome, primary OCD, Sydenham chorea, autoimmune encephalitis, and monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes can overlap with or be mistaken for PANDAS; features such as dysautonomia, movement disorder phenomenology, CSF or MRI findings, or systemic signs can help redirect the diagnosis toward pediatric autoimmune encephalitis or autoinflammatory vasculitides when present, so I will check for red flags and proceed with the appropriate AE workup when indicated [^113oP4GZ] [^112X5MHi] [^114d6Per]. But wait, what if the strep linkage is weak or inconsistent over time; prospective work suggests many exacerbations are not temporally linked to bona fide GABHS, which should temper my causal attributions and reduce premature immunologic labeling [^117DqLDS] [^111erJcg].

> I will now examine management of proven acute streptococcal infection and recurrence prevention. Treat confirmed GABHS pharyngitis per standard pediatric regimens such as penicillin or amoxicillin, and avoid antibiotics for neuropsychiatric symptoms in the absence of documented infection, because overtreatment is common when diagnosis is presumed but unproven [^115sgq15] [^116L9vWQ]. Hold on, I should verify prophylaxis; antibiotic prophylaxis can be considered in children with frequent, well-documented reinfections, but high-quality evidence is limited and recommendations remain cautious, so shared decision-making and documentation standards are critical [^notfound]. I need to ensure surgical decisions follow airway-infection guidelines rather than PANDAS per se; tonsillectomy is indicated for strictly defined recurrent GABHS infections, while watchful waiting is recommended when criteria are not met, and surgery does not prevent the onset of PANDAS or uniformly change its trajectory [^113dDL6T] [^112ATHAW] [^1178kcBE].

> Let me consider neuropsychiatric symptom treatment because this is often where impairment is greatest. Standard-of-care for pediatric OCD includes CBT with exposure and response prevention and, when needed, SSRIs at usual pediatric doses; even though parents in survey research often rate these approaches as less appropriate or acceptable, the evidence base for OCD supports them, so I should reconcile parental perceptions with clinical efficacy through careful psychoeducation and graded engagement [^115sgq15] [^113c7SWt]. I need to check tic management; alpha-2 adrenergic agonists and atypical antipsychotics can be used when tics are severe or functionally impairing, following Tourette management principles, while monitoring for adverse effects and interactions with comorbid ADHD or anxiety [^115sgq15]. Academic accommodations and family counseling are important adjuncts given documented deficits in attention and executive functioning and the caregiver burden reported in these families, so I will integrate school supports and family-based interventions early [^115tDWiz] [^113c7SWt].

> Next, I should review anti-inflammatory options for moderate symptom flares in cases with a credible autoimmune phenotype. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or naproxen are commonly used in short courses and are often well accepted by families, with limited but plausible mechanistic rationale in an inflammatory model, so I can consider them during defined exacerbations while tracking objective outcomes [^115sgq15] [^113c7SWt]. For more severe exacerbations, short tapers of oral corticosteroids may reduce symptoms in select cases, but the evidence consists largely of case series and expert opinion; I need to ensure close monitoring for psychiatric activation, sleep disturbance, and metabolic side effects that can paradoxically worsen OCD or tics during the taper [^115sgq15].

> I should double-check the indications and evidence for escalation to immunomodulatory therapy in severe or refractory cases. A rigorous RCT of IVIG in PANDAS did not show a statistically significant advantage over placebo during the blinded phase, although open-label extension suggested substantial improvement by weeks 12 and 24; this mixed signal requires careful risk–benefit discussion about cost, infusion risks, and uncertain efficacy in any given child, and I should anchor decisions in multidisciplinary consensus and documented functional severity [^116vLSeH] [^115sgq15]. Plasma exchange has case-level support and may be considered in fulminant, life-threatening presentations with severe movement or psychiatric symptoms when standard measures fail, but again evidence quality is low, necessitating caution and expert oversight [^115sgq15]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there was strong evidence for rituximab in PANDAS, but let me verify; the frequently cited study demonstrates antibody binding to striatal cholinergic interneurons and change after IVIG rather than controlled rituximab data, so rituximab remains an anecdotal, last-resort consideration rather than a recommended therapy based on trials [^111p7Efn] [^115sgq15].

> I will now examine the debated role of tonsillectomy as a disease-modifying adjunct distinct from infection-frequency indications. Small series suggest that some children with incomplete antibiotic response may experience symptom reduction after tonsillectomy, and caregiver surveys report high satisfaction, but these designs are vulnerable to bias and placebo effects, and at least one comparative study showed no differences in titers, classification, or severity between surgical and nonsurgical groups, so I should frame surgery strictly by established infection criteria and avoid promising neuropsychiatric benefit a priori [^117KtcEB] [^115vqFMz] [^1178kcBE] [^113dDL6T].

> Let me think about longitudinal monitoring and team-based care because the course is often relapsing-remitting. During active phases, close follow-up every 4 to 6 weeks with validated scales such as the CY-BOCS for OCD and the YGTSS for tics helps objectify response, then spacing to every 3 months during remission makes sense, with rapid access for suspected infections or flares, and all of this is best coordinated through an interdisciplinary team including pediatrics, psychiatry, neurology, immunology, and otolaryngology as needed [^115sgq15]. I should confirm prognostic counseling includes the reality that most exacerbations have no clear temporal link to GABHS and that residual neuropsychiatric symptoms may persist, which can help calibrate expectations and reduce cycles of urgent, low-value infection-focused interventions when triggers are absent [^117DqLDS] [^115sgq15].

> Hold on, I should review controversies and uncertainties explicitly to support shared decision-making. Evidence quality across diagnostic tests and treatments remains limited, with meta-analytic and prospective data showing weak or inconsistent temporal links between new GABHS infections and exacerbations, and antibody studies failing to consistently differentiate cases from controls, which undercuts simple pathogenic narratives and supports a cautious, criteria-driven approach [^111erJcg] [^114FYgtT]. I need to ensure families understand the risks of overtreatment and misdiagnosis documented in community settings and reconcile parental preferences that often favor anti-infective or lifestyle interventions over psychiatric medications and psychotherapy with the evidence base for OCD and tic management, using motivational and educational strategies to improve adherence where appropriate [^116L9vWQ] [^113c7SWt]. The classic Pediatrics viewpoint that PANDAS remains an unproven hypothesis still applies to many aspects of care, so my plan should emphasize individualized risk–benefit analysis and prospective reassessment rather than rigid protocols [^113zDJdy].

> In summary, my practical algorithm is to confirm a strict PANDAS phenotype and exclude mimics, treat only documented acute GABHS infections with guideline-concordant antibiotics, use CBT-ERP and SSRIs for OCD and standard therapies for tics with careful psychoeducation, add short courses of NSAIDs or corticosteroids for selected inflammatory flares, escalate to IVIG or plasma exchange only for severe, refractory disease after multidisciplinary review, reserve tonsillectomy for children who meet standard recurrent-infection criteria rather than as a primary neuropsychiatric intervention, and sustain longitudinal, interdisciplinary monitoring with objective measures and transparent counseling about uncertainties and likely trajectories [^115sgq15] [^115wtfuM] [^116vLSeH] [^113dDL6T] [^112ATHAW] [^1178kcBE] [^117DqLDS] [^113zDJdy]. I should double-check at every step whether new data strengthen or weaken the presumed strep linkage for that child, adjust accordingly, and document shared decisions and outcomes to iteratively refine care over time [^115sgq15].

---

Management of PANDAS centers on **treating acute streptococcal infections with antibiotics** [^115wtfuM] and **using CBT with SSRIs for OCD and tics** [^115sgq15]. Immunomodulatory therapies (IVIG, corticosteroids, plasmapheresis) are **reserved for severe or refractory cases** given limited evidence and potential risks [^116vLSeH] [^113xkmRA]. Tonsillectomy is not routinely recommended but may be considered for recurrent streptococcal infections unresponsive to antibiotics [^113dDL6T] [^112ATHAW]. Management should be **individualized and multidisciplinary**, with regular monitoring for relapses and comorbidities [^115sgq15] [^112YGKEv].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic therapy is a **cornerstone of PANDAS management**, aimed at eradicating acute streptococcal infections and preventing recurrences [^115sgq15]. The following antibiotics are commonly used:

- **Penicillin V**: First-line antibiotic for acute streptococcal infections [^115wtfuM].

- **Amoxicillin**: Alternative first-line antibiotic, particularly in younger children [^115sgq15].

- **Cephalosporins (e.g. cefdinir, cefalexin)**: Used in cases of penicillin allergy or intolerance [^115wtfuM].

- **Azithromycin**: Alternative antibiotic for patients with severe penicillin allergies [^115sgq15].

Prophylactic antibiotics **may be considered** for patients with frequent recurrent streptococcal infections, but evidence that they prevent neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations is limited [^111erJcg] [^117BTviJ].

---

## Immunomodulatory therapies

Immunomodulatory therapies are **considered in severe or refractory cases** of PANDAS, particularly when symptoms significantly impair daily functioning [^116vLSeH]. The following treatments have been explored:

- **Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)**: IVIG has been shown to reduce symptom severity in some patients, although evidence from randomized controlled trials is limited and mixed [^113xkmRA] [^116vLSeH].

- **Corticosteroids**: Short courses of corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) may provide temporary symptom relief during acute exacerbations, but long-term use is not recommended due to potential side effects [^115sgq15].

- **Plasmapheresis**: Plasma exchange has been reported to improve symptoms in severe cases, but it is an invasive procedure with potential risks and limited evidence supporting its routine use.

---

## Psychiatric and behavioral interventions

Psychiatric and behavioral interventions are **essential components** of PANDAS management, particularly for addressing OCD and tic symptoms [^115sgq15]:

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: CBT, specifically exposure and response prevention (ERP), is effective in managing OCD symptoms and is considered first-line behavioral therapy [^115sgq15].

- **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**: SSRIs (e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline) are commonly used to manage OCD symptoms, although careful monitoring for side effects is necessary [^115sgq15].

- **Antipsychotic medications**: Atypical antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone, aripiprazole) may be considered for severe tic symptoms or comorbid behavioral disturbances [^116W3s2E].

---

## Surgical interventions

Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy have been explored as potential interventions for PANDAS, particularly in patients with recurrent streptococcal infections. However, evidence supporting their efficacy in preventing neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations is **limited and controversial** [^1178kcBE] [^117KtcEB], and current guidelines recommend considering tonsillectomy only for documented recurrent streptococcal infections that meet specific clinical criteria [^113dDL6T] [^112ATHAW].

---

## Multidisciplinary approach and long-term management

Effective PANDAS management is **multidisciplinary**, engaging pediatricians, neurologists, psychiatrists, immunologists, and infectious disease specialists, with monitoring of symptoms, immune markers, and streptococcal antibody titers to guide decisions and prevent relapses [^112YGKEv] [^1142u1kD]. Long-term care emphasizes regular follow-up to track symptom progression and treatment response; patient and family education on symptom recognition, infection prevention, and adherence [^113c7SWt]; and psychosocial support to address emotional and behavioral challenges associated with chronic illness [^112YGKEv].

---

## Controversies and gaps in current treatment guidelines

Key uncertainties include the **lack of standardized diagnostic criteria**, which complicates clinical decisions and research [^113oP4GZ] [^113zDJdy], and the limited evidence supporting immunomodulatory therapies, underscoring the need for robust trials [^116vLSeH]. The role of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing neuropsychiatric exacerbations remains unclear [^111erJcg] [^117BTviJ], and the efficacy of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy is debated; further research is warranted [^1178kcBE] [^117KtcEB].

---

Management of PANDAS involves antibiotic therapy, immunomodulatory treatments, psychiatric and behavioral interventions, and, in select cases, surgical procedures. A **multidisciplinary, individualized approach** is essential for effective care, although persistent controversies and gaps in current guidelines highlight the need for further research and standardized diagnostic criteria [^115sgq15].

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome, further subcategorized as pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with Streptococcus, is a form of idiopathic autoimmune encephalitis (IAE). Post-streptococcal autoimmunity seen in idiopathic autoimmune encephalitis manifests as various neuropsychiatric symptoms such as obsessive rituals, tics, anxiety, depression, and many others. Idiopathic autoimmune encephalitis has clinically heterogeneous phenotypes that make accurate diagnosing difficult, although diagnostic testing such as the Cunningham Panel increases the likelihood of finding effective treatments. Recommended treatments include psychiatric medication, behavioral intervention, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory therapy, and immunomodulating therapy.

- **Objective**: To provide an updated review on the diagnosis, management, and treatment of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with Streptococcus and pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric syndrome, also referred to as IAE.

- **Results**: Information from 47 sources was used to outline knowledge of IAE pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and epidemiology, and to outline diagnostic recommendations and treatment guidelines. Gaps in knowledge, in addition to controversy, were also outlined to provide a thorough background of this condition and future needs for IAE research.

- **Conclusion**: Owing to the complexity and variability in ways patients with IAE may present to the allergist/immunologist office, an interdisciplinary approach is imperative.

### Clinical practice guideline: Tonsillectomy in children (update) [^113dDL6T]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, specifically in relation to indications for tonsillectomy, the AAO-HNSF 2019 guidelines recommend performing tonsillectomy in pediatric patients who experience recurrent throat infections. This is defined as at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 consecutive years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 consecutive years. Each episode should be documented in the medical record with at least one of the following:

- **Temperature**: > 38.3 °C (> 101 °F)
- **Cervical adenopathy**: Presence of swollen neck glands
- **Tonsillar exudate**: Evidence of pus on the tonsils
- **Positive test for group A β-hemolytic streptococcus**: Laboratory confirmation of the infection

This guideline aims to ensure appropriate surgical intervention for children suffering from recurrent group A streptococcal infections.

### Parent perceptions of various treatment approaches for PANS and PANDAS [^113c7SWt]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder (PANDAS) is characterized by a sudden, dramatic onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) following a Group A Streptococcus infection. Pediatric acute neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) refers to a sudden, dramatic onset of OCD and/or restricted eating triggered by infections and other inflammatory reactions. A variety of treatments have been utilized for PANS/PANDAS; however, there is no "gold standard" intervention protocol. Parental expectations of a given treatment have been found to improve a child's overall treatment experience; however, parent attitudes towards PANS/PANDAS treatments are unknown, which was the purpose of this study.

An online survey was distributed to 208 parents of children with self-reported PANS/PANDAS. Treatments were grouped together within overarching categories, including psychotherapy, psychiatric/psychotropic interventions, inflammation/infection mitigation, supplements, lifestyle changes, and surgery.

- **Parent ratings**: Categorically, parents rated inflammation/infection mitigation interventions and lifestyle changes as most appropriate, while psychiatric/psychotropic interventions were considered least appropriate. At the individual level, treatments such as antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intravenous immunoglobulin, and family counseling received ratings ranging from "appropriate" to "extremely appropriate". Alternatively, treatments such as deep brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, antidepressant medications, and exposure and response prevention received ratings between "inappropriate" and "extremely inappropriate".

### Randomized, controlled trial of intravenous immunoglobulin for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections [^116vLSeH]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) are hypothesized to occur as a result of cross-reactive antibodies produced in response to group A streptococcal infections. Previous research suggests that immunomodulatory therapies, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), may lead to rapid and sustained symptom improvement in patients with PANDAS.

A total of 35 children meeting the criteria for PANDAS and moderate to severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) were enrolled in a randomized-entry, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week trial of IVIG (1 g/kg/day on 2 consecutive days), followed by optional open-label treatment for nonresponders, with follow-up at 12 and 24 weeks. Primary outcome measures were the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) rating. "Responders" were defined, a priori, by a ≥ 30% decrease in the CY-BOCS total score, and a "much" or "very much" improved rating on CGI-I.

During the double-blind phase, the mean decrease in CY-BOCS score was 24% ± 31% in the IVIG group (n = 17) and 12% ± 27% in the placebo group (n = 18), with six responders in the IVIG group (35%) versus four (22%) in the placebo group; these differences were not statistically significant. Twenty-four participants met criteria for nonresponse to double-blind infusion and received open-label IVIG at week 6. Among all participants, the mean CY-BOCS improvement from baseline was 55% ± 33% at week 12 and 62% ± 33% at week 24.

### Child neurology practice guidelines: past, present, and future [^114JE4hh]. Pediatric Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Practice guidelines have been developed in child neurology over the last fifteen years to address important clinical questions and provide evidence-based recommendations for patient care.

- **Methods**: This review describes the guideline development process and how it has evolved to meet the needs of child neurologists.

- **Results**: Several child neurology guidelines are reviewed, and the advantages and disadvantages of guidelines, as well as the legal consequences of using them to determine a standard of care, are discussed. The future of guidelines and their influence on integrated support systems are also considered.

- **Conclusions**: Child neurology practice guidelines are a helpful resource for clinicians, families, and institutions as they provide evidence-based recommendations concerning the diagnosis and management of common neurological conditions affecting children. Incorporating consensus processes has allowed the expansion of clinically relevant recommendations, thereby increasing the utility of guidelines.

### Streptococcal infection and exacerbations of childhood tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms: a prospective blinded cohort study [^117DqLDS]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: If pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections constitute a unique clinical entity, we hypothesized that children meeting diagnostic criteria would have more clinical exacerbations temporally linked to bona fide group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection than matched control subjects, which included chronic tic and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder with no known temporal relationship to group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection.

- **Patients and methods**: Subjects included 40 matched pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections case-control pairs who were prospectively evaluated with intensive laboratory testing for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus and clinical measures for an average of 2 years. Additional testing occurred at the time of any clinical exacerbations or illness. Laboratory personnel were blinded to case or control status and clinical (exacerbation or not) condition. Clinical raters were blinded to the results of laboratory tests.

- **Results**: The cases had a higher clinical exacerbation rate and a higher bona fide group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection rate than the control group. Only 5 of 64 exacerbations were temporally associated (within 4 weeks) with a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection, and all occurred in cases. The number (5.0) was significantly higher than the number that would be expected by chance alone (1.6). However, over 75% of the clinical exacerbations in cases had no observable temporal relationship to group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection.

### Anti-basal ganglia antibodies in pandas [^114FYgtT]. Movement Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

An autoimmune-mediated mechanism involving molecular mimicry has been proposed for a variety of pediatric movement disorders that occur following a streptococcal infection. In this study, anti-basal ganglia antibodies (ABGA) were measured in 15 children with the diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) and compared with those in 15 controls. ELISA and Western immunoblotting (WB) methods were used to detect ABGA against supernatant (S1), pellet (P2), and synaptosomal preparations from adult postmortem caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus.

ELISA optical density values did not differ between PANDAS patients and controls across all preparations. Immunoblotting identified multiple bands in all subjects with no differences in the number of bands or their total density. Discriminant analysis, used to assess mean binding patterns, showed that PANDAS patients differed from controls only for the caudate S1 fraction (Wilks' lambda = 0.0236, P < 0.0002), with PANDAS-primarily tic subjects providing the greatest discrimination. Among the epitopes contributing to differences between PANDAS and control in the caudate S1 fraction, mean binding to the epitope at 183 kDa was the most different between groups.

In conclusion, ELISA measurements do not differentiate between PANDAS and controls, suggesting a lack of major antibody changes in this disorder. Further immunoblot analyses using a caudate supernatant fraction are required to completely exclude the possibility of minor antibody repertoire differences in PANDAS subjects.

### Clinical approach to the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis in the pediatric patient [^113oP4GZ]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Other diagnoses within the differential include PANS and pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS). These conditions describe an idiopathic or postinfectious onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating restriction, other emotional syndromes, tics, loss of skills, or personality changes. Both clinical phenotypes lack robust biomarkers, and pathogenesis remains disputed; however, there is some evidence of immune mediation and immunotherapy responsiveness. Although patients may appear to have an acquired brain syndrome, most children with PANDAS or PANS would not fulfill the proposed pediatric AE criteria.

Monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes may also involve the brain, such as genetic interferonopathies, vasculopathies, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. These disorders typically present in early childhood, resulting in chronic progressive disease, often involving increasing spasticity, intracranial calcifications, and microcephaly, and are associated with persistent CSF immune activation. These syndromes are distinguished from AE by the presence of non-neurologic features, such as skin lesions, cytopenias, hepatosplenomegaly, and lung disease.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in pediatric AE and are also the hallmark of primary psychiatric disorders. Delusions, hallucinations, reduced speech, sleep disturbance, and cognitive difficulties may be seen in both disease groups. Features that distinguish patients with AE from those with psychiatric disease include autonomic instability, hyperkinesia, and dyskinesia.

### Guillain-Barré syndrome in times of pandemics [^115mX9oB]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

In case of a sudden increase in patients with GBS, clinicians with limited expertise in GBS may need to manage these patients, and availability of facilities and resources may run out. We expect limitations mainly in ICU beds and rehabilitation care, as this was also reported during the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil. These limitations are especially important in low-resource countries that often have suboptimal or malfunctional healthcare systems, a lack of health professionals, and are hot spots for outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. Here, we provide recommendations on how to safeguard good quality diagnosis and management of GBS during a pandemic.

- **Guideline for management of GBS**: Diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of GBS can be complicated as patients may present with non-specific symptoms and vary with respect to clinical severity, treatment response, and outcome. Furthermore, there are several diseases that can be difficult to distinguish from GBS, such as critical illness neuropathy, which is now especially important as many patients are admitted to the ICU for extended periods of time due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Recently, a 10-step evidence-based consensus guideline for GBS was developed in response to the Zika virus outbreak. This guideline was designed to be compact and easy-to-use and applicable in all healthcare settings. An online version of the guideline is supported by The Global Health Network. Its use may help improve the management of GBS during an outbreak.

### Autoimmune neurology: The need for comprehensive care [^112YGKEv]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Autoimmune neurology is a rapidly developing subspecialty. Familiarity and awareness of different antibody-associated phenotypes can help to ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment. In cases that are less clear, a sound diagnostic approach anchored on objective clinical findings is important for optimizing outcomes. Clinical monitoring and treatment must expand beyond the acute care setting. A growing body of literature illustrates prolonged periods of recovery complicated by behavioral dysfunction and neuropsychiatric symptoms in the months to years after the diagnosis. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive teams with expertise in autoimmune neurologic disorders. The ultimate goal is to provide optimal, long-term outpatient care coordinated among clinicians while anticipating the needs of the patients and caregivers.

### Streptococcal upper respiratory tract infections and exacerbations of tic and obsessive-compulsive symptoms: A prospective longitudinal study [^117BTviJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this blinded, prospective, longitudinal study was to determine whether new group A β hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infections are temporally associated with exacerbations of tic or obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms in children who met published criteria for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS). A group of children with Tourette syndrome and/or OC disorder without a PANDAS history served as the comparison (non-PANDAS) group.

- **Method**: Consecutive clinical ratings of tic and OC symptom severity were obtained for 31 PANDAS subjects and 53 non-PANDAS subjects. Clinical symptoms and laboratory values (throat cultures and streptococcal antibody titers) were evaluated at regular intervals during a 25-month period. Additional testing occurred at the time of any tic or OC symptom exacerbation. New GABHS infections were established by throat swab cultures and/or recent significant rise in streptococcal antibodies. Laboratory personnel were blinded to case or control status, clinical (exacerbation or not) condition, and clinical evaluators were blinded to the laboratory results.

- **Results**: No group differences were observed in the number of clinical exacerbations or the number of newly diagnosed GABHS infections. On only six occasions of a total of 51 (12%), a newly diagnosed GABHS infection was followed, within 2 months, by an exacerbation of tic and/or OC symptoms. In every instance, this association occurred in the non-PANDAS group.

- **Conclusions**: This study provides no evidence for a temporal association between new GABHS infections and exacerbations of tic or OC symptoms in children meeting the criteria for PANDAS.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and management of autoimmune pancreatitis in childhood: Consensus from INSPPIRE [^1121kQyq]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). High credibility.

In addressing specific circumstances for pediatric pancreatitis, particularly in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis, the INSPPIRE 2018 guidelines recommend regular monitoring of these patients by pediatric gastroenterologists. Upon reaching adulthood, it is advised that the management be continued by adult gastroenterologists. Regular surveillance is emphasized for ensuring ongoing health and appropriate management transitions in these cases.

### Guideline for the management of acute sore throat [^115wtfuM]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the classification and risk stratification for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, specifically concerning risk assessment, the ESCMID 2012 guidelines recommend considering the Centor clinical scoring system. This system helps to identify patients with a higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection and target antibiotic use. However, its utility in pediatric patients appears lower than in adults because of the different clinical presentation of sore throat in the first years of life.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and management of autoimmune pancreatitis in childhood: Consensus from INSPPIRE [^111wr16y]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pediatric pancreatitis, particularly concerning patients with autoimmune pancreatitis, the INSPPIRE 2018 guidelines recommend the following:

- **Diagnostic imaging**: Consider obtaining a transabdominal ultrasound as first-line imaging in pediatric patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis and/or obstructive jaundice. Obtain an MRI/MRCP in cases of high suspicion for autoimmune pancreatitis. This includes scenarios where there is hypoechoic parenchyma, diffuse or focal enlargement of the pancreas, or a pancreatic mass lesion with or without a dilated common bile duct in the absence of choledocholithiasis.

### Ofatumumab for the treatment of COVID-19-associated autoimmune encephalitis: A case report [^1177PJe8]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2025). Low credibility.

Autoimmune encephalitis is a rare but severe complication of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Treatment typically involves immunomodulatory approaches such as steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or plasma exchange; however, these treatments may not be effective for all patients. In this case report, we present a patient with COVID-19-associated encephalitis who exhibited cognitive impairment, epileptic seizures, tachycardia, and diaphoresis, with cranial MRI findings resembling those seen in limbic encephalitis. Initially, the patient showed a suboptimal response to antiviral therapy, high-dose steroids, and IVIG treatment. Nevertheless, his clinical symptoms and cranial MRI abnormalities markedly improved following the administration of ofatumumab. Administering ofatumumab early in COVID-19-related autoimmune encephalitis may benefit patients more.

### Clinical approach to the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis in the pediatric patient [^112uDLby]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

At the 2014 Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance Conference in North Carolina, the Autoimmune Encephalitis International Working Group was formed to initiate discussions on developing diagnostic criteria for autoimmune encephalitis (AE). A subcommittee of pediatric neurologists and rheumatologists identified that adult-focused criteria might not apply well to children.

As a result, this subcommittee collaborated through conference calls and email correspondence to consider a pediatric-specific approach to AE. They reviewed the literature on relevant AE studies and sought additional input from other experts. The first author, T.C., developed a draft based on the discussions that was subsequently reviewed and modified by all authors.

In specific cases of pediatric pancreatitis, particularly in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis, the 2018 INSPPIRE guidelines emphasize the importance of monitoring treatment response to corticosteroid therapy. They recommend assessing clinical response within two weeks of initiating therapy and employing imaging modalities — such as transabdominal ultrasound, MRI/MRCP, or EUS — approximately three months after starting therapy.

### Pans and PANDAS - symptoms beyond OCD and tics - a systematic review [^111d9MxY]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Low credibility.

This article aims to describe the symptomatology of Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections (PANDAS) and Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS), and to highlight some of their potential distinctive features by juxtaposing available data with existing literature on pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Given the scarcity of high-quality studies, we decided to review a wide range of publications on the clinical presentation of PANS and PANDAS, including case series and case reports, regardless of their methodological heterogeneity.

Although PANS and PANDAS share many characteristics with non-PANS/PANDAS OCD, the acute onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in conjunction with concomitant features, especially separation anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, or dysgraphia, should prompt consideration of a possible post-infectious etiology. Further research aimed at creating more precise diagnostic tools is needed to facilitate differential diagnosis.

### Central nervous system neuronal surface antibody associated syndromes: Review and guidelines for recognition [^1165HuXH]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

This new field of immune-mediated CNS diseases is exciting but also challenging. There is a need for more intense research into those conditions that are shown to be immunotherapy responsive and thereby can be defined as possible NSAS. The presence of these and other NSAbs in patients with more common conditions, such as epilepsy, psychosis, and dementia, needs to be systematically examined. Ideally, antibody testing should be performed in local laboratories using internationally validated procedures so that the diagnosis can be made and treatments started as soon as possible in the hope of restoring health, limiting hospitalization, and optimizing outcomes. Systematic studies of the treatments are needed in order to establish best practice.

### Antizol [^1175FSTw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2009). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines: If ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning is left untreated, the natural progression of the poisoning leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, including glycolic and oxalic acids (ethylene glycol intoxication) and formic acid (methanol intoxication). These metabolites can induce metabolic acidosis, nausea/vomiting, seizures, stupor, coma, calcium oxaluria, acute tubular necrosis, blindness, and death. Diagnosing these poisonings may be difficult because ethylene glycol and methanol concentrations diminish in the blood as they are metabolized to their respective metabolites. Hence, both ethylene glycol and methanol concentrations and acid-base balance, as determined by serum electrolyte (anion gap) and/or arterial blood gas analysis, should be frequently monitored and used to guide treatment.

Treatment consists of blocking the formation of toxic metabolites using inhibitors of alcohol dehydrogenase, such as Antizol®, and correcting metabolic abnormalities. In patients with high ethylene glycol or methanol concentrations (≥ 50 mg/dL), significant metabolic acidosis, or renal failure, hemodialysis should be considered to remove ethylene glycol or methanol and the respective toxic metabolites of these alcohols.

Begin Antizol® treatment immediately upon suspicion of ethylene glycol or methanol ingestion based on patient history and/or anion gap metabolic acidosis, increased osmolar gap, visual disturbances, or oxalate crystals in the urine, or a documented serum ethylene glycol or methanol concentration.

### Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections - anesthetic implications and literature review [^111x3WTL]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) are rare neurobehavioral disorders in children. Affected children may exhibit a diverse array of perioperative manifestations, including compulsive behavior, agitation, and abnormal movements. Perioperative management might pose added challenges for anesthesiologists. A series of therapeutic plasmapheresis in these children may further complicate their anesthesia management. This paper describes the first case of a patient with PANDAS and its anesthesia implications.

### Association between streptococcal infection and obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette's syndrome, and tic disorder [^113718SN]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Reports have suggested that streptococcal infection may be etiologically related to pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders (PANDAS), but there are few rigorous epidemiologic studies to support this theory. Using population-based data from a large West-Coast health maintenance organization, researchers assessed whether streptococcal infection was associated with an increased risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette's syndrome (TS), or tic disorder.

This study employed a case-control design, examining children aged 4 to 13 who received their first diagnosis of OCD, TS, or tic disorder between January 1992 and December 1999 at Group Health Cooperative outpatient facilities. Cases were matched to controls by birth date, gender, primary physician, and propensity to seek health care.

Patients with OCD, TS, or tic disorder were more likely than controls to have had prior streptococcal infection (OR: 2.22; 95% CI: 1.05, 4.69) in the three months before the onset date. The risk was higher among children with multiple streptococcal infections within 12 months (OR: 3.10; 95% CI: 1.77, 8.96). Multiple infections with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus within a 12-month period were associated with a significantly increased risk for TS (OR: 13.6; 95% CI: 1.93, 51.0). These associations did not change appreciably when limited to cases with a clear date of symptom onset or with tighter matching on health care behavior.

These findings provide epidemiologic evidence that PANDAS may arise as a result of a postinfectious autoimmune phenomenon induced by childhood streptococcal infection.

### Clinical factors associated with pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections [^114iFBZ9]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

To explore associated clinical factors in children with pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), children with tics, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or both (n = 109) were examined. The examination included a personal and family history review, a diagnostic interview, a physical examination, a review of medical records, and the measurement of baseline levels of streptococcal antibodies.

Significant group differences were found on several variables. Children with PANDAS, as opposed to those without, were more likely to have experienced dramatic onset, definite remissions, remission of neuropsychiatric symptoms during antibiotic therapy, a history of tonsillectomies/adenoidectomies, evidence of group A streptococcal infection, and clumsiness.

The identification of clinical features associated with PANDAS should assist in delineating risks for this subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder/tics.

### Neuroimmune disorders in COVID-19 [^115ULAqV]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic raised relevant questions and concerns for neurologists taking care of patients with pre-existing neuroimmunological diseases treated with immunotherapy. Considering that it is well-established that certain drugs routinely adopted in neuroimmunology may increase the risk of infection by some pathogens, including viruses (e.g. John Cunningham virus [JCV] infection), an important question that needs to be answered is whether the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 is different in patients taking immunomodulatory or immunosuppressant medications, and whether the risk of severe COVID-19 and death is the same as the general population in this selected group of patients.

In this context, clinical decision-making remains largely non-evidence-based, as few large-scale studies were published. The available evidence gathered from patients with neurologic and non-neurologic autoimmune disorders treated with immunotherapy, as well as organ transplant recipients under immunosuppressant medications, is overall reassuring insofar as there is no evidence of worse COVID-19 outcomes, and major safety issues were not observed. Several national and international recommendations (e.g. those from the Association of British Neurologists, ABN) as well as opinion papers have been published to guide the physician in managing immunotherapy during the pandemic. Most of these recommendations converge on the following points: ongoing immunotherapy should not be discontinued in clinically stable and non-lymp…

### Prospective longitudinal analysis of immune responses in pediatric subjects after pharyngeal acquisition of group A streptococci [^1142u1kD]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: Two previous studies designed to examine the possible association between GAS infection and pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococci (PANDAS) enrolled the original 160 subjects. The subjects ranged in age from 6 to 15 years and were enrolled at multiple academic medical centers across the United States; the planned observation time was 108 weeks. The study evaluated a subset of 41 subjects who experienced 51 new pharyngeal acquisitions of GAS during the 2-year study period. A new immunologically significant acquisition was defined as a throat culture that tested positive for an emm type of GAS that had not been isolated previously and was followed by an immune response to 1 or more antigens in the enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) panel. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, the University of Minnesota, and the respective clinical sites that participated in the original studies.

- **Throat cultures**: Throat swabs were obtained on enrollment, every 4 weeks thereafter, and when the subjects showed any signs or symptoms of pharyngitis. Swabs were sent to the University of Minnesota Streptococcal Reference Laboratory, where group A β-hemolytic streptococci were identified, grouped, and emm typed.

- **Serum samples**: Serum samples were obtained on enrollment and every 13 weeks from each study subject. In the intervals between scheduled collections, signs and symptoms of pharyngitis resulted in an additional serum collection.

### American College of Rheumatology guidance statements for addressing mental health concerns in youth with pediatric rheumatologic diseases [^111HPym1]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Low credibility.

- **Collaborative management statements**: Delphi panel members reached consensus after two rounds of voting in all but one of the collaborative management guidance statements. Two of these comprised the 11 final guidance statements. These two recommendations were that patients with moderate or severe symptoms need urgent assessment by a mental health specialist and patients with mild symptoms should follow up with their primary physician for monitoring. Eight additional statements reaching consensus, but with less empirical support, are detailed in Supplementary Table 3.

- **Clinic environment and education statements**: Delphi panel members reached consensus after two rounds of voting in all but two of the clinic environment/education statements. Two of these comprised the 11 guidance statements. These recommendations were that patients with a new PRD diagnosis should be offered resources, like websites or peer support, that address common mental health concerns for youth with PRDs and that ongoing discussions and education about mental health should occur in a manner consistent with the patient's developmental stage and sociocultural background.

- **Additional perspectives from the pediatric rheumatology community**: We captured additional insights on addressing mental health concerns for patients with PRDs through comments submitted by the pediatric rheumatology community during the open comment period.

### Antibodies from children with PANDAS bind specifically to striatal cholinergic interneurons and alter their activity [^111p7Efn]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) sometimes appears rapidly, even overnight, often after an infection. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections, or PANDAS, describe such a situation after infection with Streptococcus pyogenes. PANDAS may result from induced autoimmunity against brain antigens, although this remains unproven. Pilot work suggests that IgG antibodies from children with PANDAS bind to cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the striatum. CIN deficiency has been independently associated with tics in humans and with repetitive behavioral pathology in mice, making it a plausible locus of pathology. The authors sought to replicate and extend earlier work and to investigate the cellular effects of PANDAS antibodies on cholinergic interneurons.

- **Methods**: Binding of IgG to specific neurons in human and mouse brain slices was evaluated ex vivo after incubation with serum from 27 children with rigorously characterized PANDAS, both at baseline and after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment, and 23 matched control subjects. Binding was correlated with symptom measures. Neural activity after serum incubation was assessed in mouse slices using molecular markers and electrophysiological recording.

- **Results**: IgG from children with PANDAS bound to CINs, but not to several other neuron types, more than IgG from control subjects, in three independent cohorts of patients. Post-IVIG serum had reduced IgG binding to CINs, and this reduction correlated with symptom improvement. Baseline PANDAS sera decreased.

On April 16 and 17, 2016, the Pediatric Anesthesia and Neurodevelopment Assessment (PANDA) study held its fifth biennial symposium at the Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York. The PANDA symposium has served as a key forum for clinicians, researchers, and other major stakeholders to gather and review the state of preclinical and clinical research related to anesthetic neurotoxicity in children. Goals of the meeting included assessing how knowledge has translated and impacted clinical care of patients who may be at risk and determining future directions for research and policy.

The program participants represented a diverse group with a shared concern about potential anesthetic neurotoxicity in children. They included clinicians, preclinical and clinical researchers, as well as representatives from government organizations like the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and the National Institutes of Health. A total of 135 individuals attended the symposium.

### A case of PANDAS treated with tetrabenazine and tonsillectomy [^117HPc9U]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections) is a rare clinical syndrome. It is characterized by the presence of tics, Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or chorea immediately following a streptococcal infection. This report describes the case of an 11-year-old boy who developed PANDAS with severe choreic movements. The criteria for PANDAS diagnosis were met, and serum antibrain antibodies were present. The patient was initially treated with tetrabenazine 12.5 mg twice daily, resulting in remission of the neurological symptoms. Subsequently, the patient underwent tonsillectomy and has been asymptomatic since, with antistreptolysin O titer levels within range.

### Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and autoantibody profiles in the cerebrospinal fluid of 3 teenaged patients with COVID-19 and subacute neuropsychiatric symptoms [^113Ak83C]. JAMA Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

More than 100 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, including nearly 2 million children in the US. Although respiratory disease in pediatric COVID-19 is generally mild, parainfectious and postinfectious neurologic sequelae are increasingly recognized. These include encephalitis, seizures, aseptic meningitis, and confusion — conditions found in about 20% of cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Notably, rates of new and recurrent psychiatric illness are significantly increased in adults after SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with influenza and other respiratory infections.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA is rarely detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with COVID-19, but intrathecal anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been reported, suggesting possible neuroinvasion. Although some neurologically impaired adults with COVID-19 have intrathecal antineural autoantibodies, to our knowledge, neither intrathecal anti–SARS-CoV-2 nor antineural antibodies have been reported in pediatric patients with COVID-19 and neuropsychiatric presentations.

### Contactin-1 autoimmunity: Serologic, neurologic, and pathologic correlates [^111BFfo3]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Immunotherapy and clinical outcomes**: All except one patient (9/10) was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Other first-line therapies included plasmapheresis (4/9) and IV corticosteroids (2/9). Four of the nine patients who received IVIG as first-line immunotherapy improved, but three of those four relapsed within four weeks and became refractory to retreatment with IVIG. Among three patients with undetectable subtype anti-contactin IgG4 in our series, two received IVIG and one received plasmapheresis as first-line immunotherapy. None of these three cases had a sustained response to first-line therapy and had a relapsing or progressive course.

- **Second-line treatment**: Six of the ten contactin-1 neuropathy cases received second-line immunosuppressive agents (rituximab, n = 2; mycophenolate mofetil, n = 2; cyclophosphamide, n = 1; azathioprine, n = 1). Two of those patients stabilized (cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) and one (infused with rituximab) improved. Five patients were using a wheelchair for ambulation at last follow-up. The median follow-up period was 60 months (range, 4–180 months).

### Spasmodic dysphonia in an adolescent patient with an autoimmune neurologic disorder [^113Zeve1]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2007). Low credibility.

Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) has been primarily described in the neurology and psychiatry literature. The symptoms of this syndrome typically include a range of obsessive-compulsive disorders and neuromuscular tics. The otolaryngologist occasionally becomes involved with these children when it is determined that chronic tonsil infections are the source. We report here on a child diagnosed with PANDAS who presented with severe ventricular hyperfunction and adductor spasmodic dysphonia. She was treated with botulinum toxin, which resulted in a significant improvement in subjective voice, as well as reduced jitter and shimmer on objective voice measurements.

### Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus: Comparison of diagnosis and treatment in the community and at a specialty clinic [^116L9vWQ]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

This study aimed to examine whether pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus were appropriately diagnosed in the community and to determine subsequent rates of unwarranted use of antibiotic treatment for tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms without the identification of an infection.

- **Methods**: The design was a retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study of 176 children and adolescents who were evaluated in a specialty program for tics, Tourette's disorder, and related problems. Previously published diagnostic criteria were used to establish the diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus in our clinic.

- **Results**: Subjects were significantly less likely to receive a diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus at the specialty clinic than in the community. In the community, subjects were significantly more likely to be treated with antibiotics or immunosuppressant medication if they received a diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus. Of the 27 subjects with a community diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus who were treated with antibiotics, 22 (82%) were treated without laboratory evidence of an infection; 2 were treated with immunomodulatory medications.

- **Conclusions**: Our results support our hypothesis that pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus are frequently diagnosed in the community.

Regarding specific circumstances for pediatric pancreatitis, particularly in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis, INSPPIRE 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting pediatric autoimmune pancreatitis in the presence of more than one MRI/MRCP finding:

- **Focal, segmental, or global pancreas enlargement**: This includes significant changes in the size of the pancreas.

- **Hypointense pancreas on T1-weighted images**: This refers to the pancreas appearing darker on specific MRI scans.

- **Hypointense capsule-like rim on T2-weighted images**: Observations on T2-weighted images may show a dark rim resembling a capsule around the pancreas.

- **Main pancreatic duct irregularities or stricture**: This involves any abnormal narrowing or irregularity of the duct.

- **Common bile duct stricture or dilatation of the common bile duct which tapers toward an enlarged pancreatic head**: Any abnormal narrowing or widening of the bile duct that is associated with an enlarged pancreas head should be noted.

### Complex movement disorders at disease onset in childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy [^115XLaso]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

The association between 'active' motor phenomena and evidence of recent streptococcal infection was the second notable finding of this study. We wish to indicate that the cases reported in this study occurred prior to 2009–10, and thus are unlikely to involve H1N1 vaccination or the H1N1 pandemic previously involved in selected cases. Indeed, the H1N1 pandemic reached Italy only in May 2009, and none of our cases occurred after the H1N1 vaccination. Rather, increased diagnoses in our Sleep Disorders Center may reflect increased awareness of narcolepsy with cataplexy linked to a media campaign by the Italian association of narcoleptic patients. Group A β-haemolytic streptococcus infections have been reported as possible environmental triggers for narcolepsy with cataplexy by several studies.

In this context, childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy could be considered related to brain autoimmune post-streptococcal diseases such as Sydenham's chorea, obsessive-compulsive disorder, tics, and PANDAS. All these conditions share an episodic course, a childhood onset with acute presentation, and the coexistence of motor and behavioral symptoms. It is notable that when narcolepsy with cataplexy is misdiagnosed, a choreiform movement disorder is often proposed as the cause. PANDAS and Sydenham's chorea were previous diagnoses in our case series, and an initial diagnosis of Huntington's chorea was reported in the first pediatric case series. Moreover, typical characteristics of narcolepsy with cataplexy are reported in Sydenham's chorea, such as being 'clumsy' and 'withdrawn'.

### Pandas anorexia nervosa: Endangered, extinct or nonexistent [^1159VhfV]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Substantial evidence exists for the concept of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS), such as some cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder and tics/Tourette's syndrome. More recently, PANDAS-AN has been described. The aim of this article is to provide a critical review of this concept.

The literature was searched using Medline, PsychInfo, and Google. There is some evidence for the entity of PANDAS-AN, but this is considerably limited by a wide range of methodological problems, including the seemingly low prevalence, the lack of clarity in diagnostic criteria, and the lack of specificity in the diagnostic tests. Innovative treatment approaches hold promise but require further evaluation.

Further research into PANDAS-AN, using more clearly defined and consistent diagnostic criteria, is needed, given the potential for enhancing the understanding of the pathogenesis of AN and for more effective treatments.

### D8/17 expression on B lymphocytes in anorexia nervosa [^116rmjre]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The authors' objective was to determine whether D8/17, a rheumatic fever susceptibility trait marker, identifies a possible type of anorexia nervosa: pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus (PANDAS) anorexia nervosa.

Using immunofluorescence, the authors measured the percentage of D8/17-positive B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of 16 subjects aged 7–21 years who had not had rheumatic fever but who had possible PANDAS anorexia nervosa. The comparison subjects were 17 psychiatric patients with no eating disorder and no PANDAS characteristics. Subjects were considered D8/17 positive if they had 12% or more D8/17+ cells.

Results indicated that there were more D8/17-positive individuals among those with PANDAS anorexia nervosa (81%) than among the comparison subjects (12%). The subjects with PANDAS anorexia nervosa had a higher percentage of D8/17+ cells (mean = 27.1%, SD = 17%) than the comparison subjects (mean = 5.3%, SD = 7.4%).

A larger study is needed to determine whether D8/17 serves as a marker for susceptibility to a type of anorexia nervosa.

### Tonsillectomies and adenoidectomies do not prevent the onset of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with group A streptococcus [^1178kcBE]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

In children presenting with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or tics, especially those with a temporal association with streptococcal pharyngitis, such as Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus, there is speculation about whether tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy might improve the child's neuropsychiatric course. Our objective was to examine whether removal of the tonsils and/or adenoids impacted streptococcal antibody titers, the timing of onset of OCD and/or tics, and the clinical severity of these symptoms.

- **Methods**: Study participants (N = 112; average age = 9.2 ± 2.4; 44 females) were recruited as part of a prospective investigation of neuropsychiatric phenomena with temporal association to streptococcal pharyngitis. Participants were examined by family history, diagnostic interview, physical examination, medical record review, psychological testing, and streptococcal antibodies, and divided into surgical or nonsurgical groups. The surgical group consisted of children having previously had a tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (n = 32). The remaining children were categorized as the nonsurgical group (n = 76). Measures of OCD and tic severity, streptococcal antibody titers, and Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus classification were compared between both groups.

- **Results**: There were no significant differences as determined by streptococcal antibody titers, Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus classification, and OCD or tic severity between the surgical and nonsurgical groups.

### Role of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in parental satisfaction of treatments for PANDAS [^115vqFMz]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine caregiver satisfaction with treatments for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcus (PANDAS) and to observe how symptom frequency changes over time.

- **Methods**: A list was created for PANDAS subjects seen at the Georgetown Pediatric Otolaryngology clinic from 2015 to 2018. Questionnaires were distributed to caregivers who could be contacted; 62% responded (n = 60). Subjects were placed into groups based on reported treatments: tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (T&A, n = 28), T&A and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, n = 22), or nonsurgical treatment(s) (n = 10). Caregivers reported frequencies for each of the 10 associated symptoms from the time of treatment to 12 months and expressed their satisfaction with the treatment.

- **Results**: Patients were treated with antibiotics (n = 60, 100%), T&A (83.3%), IVIG (40%), Rituximab (15%), steroids (20%), and/or plasma exchange (10%). Caregivers for 66% (n = 33) of surgical patients identified T&A as the most effective treatment, and 80% would choose the operation again. No difference in median caregiver satisfaction level was found among the groups (p = 0.196). There was no significant difference in frequency for any of the symptoms (all p > 0.05) except choreiform movement (p = 0.0296).

- **Conclusion**: Caregivers reported a decreasing frequency of symptoms over time regardless of treatment, with no difference in satisfaction levels. T&A was the most preferred treatment and the most impactful on symptoms for surgical patients. Given the challenges of immunologic therapies, T&A in combination with antibiotics showed significant potential.

### International consensus recommendations for the treatment of pediatric NMDAR antibody encephalitis [^116JFEPU]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis (NMDARE) is one of the most common autoimmune encephalitides, characterized by a recognizable constellation of neurologic and psychiatric features alongside positive NMDAR antibodies. NMDARE mostly affects children and young adults, particularly females. It may be very severe in the acute phase with a mortality of about 5%. Relapses occur in about 15% of patients, and the final physician-assessed functional outcome is generally favorable, although neuropsychological and psychiatric sequelae are relatively common.

Use of immunotherapies has been shown to improve outcomes, especially with early administration, and to reduce the risk of relapses. However, several aspects of treatment remain incompletely clarified, and treatment strategies are still heterogeneous, especially with regard to second-line and long-term immunotherapies. Indeed, although a number of reviews have been published, no randomized controlled trials or consensus guidelines for the treatment of NMDARE are available.

With support from the Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance, we aimed to create a consensus recommendation for the treatment of pediatric NMDARE, which was pragmatic and relevant to a global community. This could serve as a practical decision support tool for the clinician confronted with this rare and challenging condition. Notably, the present document is intended as a recommendation guideline rather than absolute rules, given the limited evidence supporting most treatment statements.

### The role of tonsillectomy in the treatment of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) [^117KtcEB]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) describe neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations that relate temporally to streptococcal infections in children. Recent case reports suggest that tonsillectomy may effectively reduce these symptoms; however, no consensus treatment guidelines currently exist. This study examines whether tonsillectomy improves neuropsychiatric symptoms in children with PANDAS who have an incomplete response to antibiotic therapy.

- **Observations**: Ten patients met strict diagnostic criteria for PANDAS. Comparisons were made between parental reports of symptom severity at diagnosis, after antibiotic treatment (in 10 patients), and after tonsillectomy (in 9). From a baseline severity score of 10, antibiotics alone improved symptoms to a median (interquartile range [IQR]) score of 8 (6.5–10.0) (P = 0.03). Nine children who subsequently underwent tonsillectomy reported symptom improvement in comparison with treatment with antibiotics alone, including those with no response to antibiotics. Symptom severity improved at all periods after tonsillectomy compared with antibiotics alone. The median score [IQR] 3 months postoperatively was 3 (0.0–6.5) (P = 0.01); 6 months postoperatively, 3 (0.0–5.0) (P = 0.02); 1 year postoperatively, 3 (0.0–5.0) (P = 0.02); and 3 years postoperatively, 0.5 (0.0–2.3) (P = 0.03). Four of the 9 had complete resolution after tonsillectomy.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: This PANDAS cohort, whose neuropsychiatric symptoms did not respond sufficiently to antibiotics, may have gained benefit from tonsillectomy.

### Autoimmune encephalitis: Proposed best practice recommendations for diagnosis and acute management [^116BG1s5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Core authors from the Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance Clinicians Network (AEACN) developed the first draft of this paper. The AEACN is comprised of self-identified clinicians with interest and clinical expertise in AE management, listed by the AE Alliance, a non-profit organization founded by AE patients and families to establish a supportive community for patients and caregivers, enhance clinical collaboration, and facilitate AE scientific research. The AEACN includes a multidisciplinary international group of adult and pediatric neurologists, rheumatologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, and other specialists with real-life experience in AE management.

The authors of the first draft reviewed available literature to compile existing evidence for every step in AE management. Where evidence was lacking or controversial, an electronic survey was distributed to all AEACN members to solicit individual responses. The survey questions were strategically planned to look at initial treatment, continued care, and finally long-term management. After adding survey results to the manuscript, the updated version was circulated to all participating AEACN members for edits and further suggestions.

### Panda: Prioritization of autism-genes using network-based deep-learning approach [^112FKBVr]. Genetic Epidemiology (2020). Low credibility.

Understanding the genetic background of complex diseases and disorders plays an essential role in the promising field of precision medicine. The evaluation of candidate genes, however, requires time-consuming and expensive experiments given a large number of possibilities. Thus, computational methods have seen increasing applications in predicting gene-disease associations. We proposed a bioinformatics framework: Prioritization of Autism-genes using Network-based Deep-learning Approach (PANDA). Our approach aims to identify autism-genes across the human genome based on patterns of gene-gene interactions and topological similarity of genes in the interaction network. PANDA trains a graph deep learning classifier using the input of the human molecular interaction network and predicts and ranks the probability of autism association of every node (gene) in the network. PANDA was able to achieve a high classification accuracy of 89%, outperforming three other commonly used machine learning algorithms. Moreover, the gene prioritization ranking list produced by PANDA was evaluated and validated using an independent large-scale exome-sequencing study. The top 10% of PANDA-ranked genes were found significantly enriched for autism association.

### Evaluation of the Cunningham Panel™ in pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) and pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): Changes in antineuronal antibody titers parallel changes in patient symptoms [^114qFoEM]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2020). Low credibility.

This retrospective study examined whether changes in patient pre- and post-treatment symptoms correlated with changes in anti-neuronal autoantibody titers and the neuronal cell stimulation assay in the Cunningham Panel in patients with Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal Infection (PANDAS), and Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS).

In an analysis of all tests consecutively performed in Moleculera Labs' clinical laboratory from April 22, 2013, to December 31, 2016, we identified 206 patients who were prescribed at least one panel prior to and following treatment and met the PANDAS/PANS diagnostic criteria. Patient follow-up was performed to collect symptoms and treatment or medical intervention. Of the 206 patients, 58 met the inclusion criteria of providing informed consent/assent and documented pre- and post-treatment symptoms. Clinician and parent-reported symptoms after treatment or medical intervention were categorized as "Improved/Resolved" (n = 34) or "Not-Improved/Worsened" (n = 24). These were analyzed for any association between changes in clinical status and changes in Cunningham panel test results. Clinical assay performance was also evaluated for reproducibility and reliability.

Comparison of pre- and post-treatment status revealed that the Cunningham Panel results correlated with changes in patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms. Based upon the change in the number of positive tests, the overall accuracy was 86%, and the sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 83%, respectively.

### Post-streptococcal autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system [^115BWYg1]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Group A Streptococcus can induce autoimmune disease in humans, particularly affecting the heart, joints, and brain. The spectrum of post-streptococcal disease of the central nervous system (CNS) has recently been expanded and includes movement disorders (chorea, tics, dystonia, and Parkinsonism), psychiatric disorders (particularly emotional disorders), and associated sleep disorders. Neuroimaging and pathological studies indicate that the basal ganglia is the most vulnerable brain region.

The immunopathogenesis of the disease is incompletely defined. Although there is some support for autoantibody-mediated disease, several conflicting studies cast doubt on the autoantibody hypothesis. It has been speculated that post-streptococcal autoimmunity plays a role in common neuropsychiatric diseases, but the evidence is conflicting. Routine screening of patients with Tourette syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder for post-streptococcal autoimmune abnormalities is not recommended at present. However, post-streptococcal disorders of the CNS remain a useful model of neuropsychiatric disease, which may improve our understanding of abnormal movements and behaviors in children.

### Autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection: Sydenham chorea, PANDAS, and PANDAS variants [^116W3s2E]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Streptococcal infection in children is usually benign and self-limited. However, in a small percentage of children, prominent neurologic and/or psychiatric sequelae can occur. Sydenham chorea is the best defined and best recognized of these conditions. PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection) is a well-defined syndrome in which tics (motor and/or vocal) and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder consistently exacerbate in temporal correlation to a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection. PANDAS constitutes a subset of children with tics, Tourette syndrome, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

In addition to strictly defined PANDAS, we and others have recognized several PANDAS variants, including adult-onset variant, a dystonic variant, a myoclonic variant, and a "chronic" PANDAS variant. The nosology and classification of these entities are rapidly evolving. The recognition that some pediatric neurobehavioral syndromes have infectious and/or immunologic triggers points to important new avenues of disease treatment. In this review, we summarize this complex and rapidly evolving area of clinical research.

### The pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) etiology for tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms: Hypothesis or entity? Practical considerations for the clinician [^113zDJdy]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Clinicians have been faced with much publicity and contradictory scientific evidence regarding a recently described condition termed pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS). It has been proposed that children with PANDAS experience tics, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and perhaps other neuropsychiatric symptoms as an autoimmune response to streptococcal infection.

We review scientific information and conclude that PANDAS remains a yet-unproven hypothesis. Until more definitive scientific proof is forthcoming, there seems to be insufficient evidence to support:

- **Routine microbiologic or serologic testing**: for group A streptococcus in children who present with neuropsychiatric symptoms.
- **Clinical use of antibiotic or immune-modifying therapies**: in such patients.

The optimum diagnostic and therapeutic approach awaits the results of additional research studies.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and management of autoimmune pancreatitis in childhood: Consensus from INSPPIRE [^114xFvWY]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pediatric pancreatitis, particularly in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis, the INSPPIRE 2018 guidelines recommend identifying acute and/or chronic inflammatory cell infiltration around pancreatic acini or periductular regions, as well as the presence of IgG4-positive plasma cells with or without pancreatic fibrosis, as suggestive of pediatric autoimmune pancreatitis. It is advised to obtain a tissue diagnosis ideally before initiating treatment. If barriers to obtaining a histological diagnosis cannot be overcome, consider diagnosing pediatric autoimmune pancreatitis based on clinical and imaging findings.

### Executive and attention functioning among children in the PANDAS subgroup [^115tDWiz]. Child Neuropsychology (2009). Low credibility.

Evidence from past studies indicates that adults and children with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS) experience subtle neuropsychological deficits. Less is known about the neuropsychological functioning of children and adolescents with a symptom course consistent with the Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infection (PANDAS) subgroup of OCD and tics. To provide such information, we administered three tests of attention control and two of executive function to 67 children and adolescents (ages 5–16) diagnosed with OCD and/or tics and a symptom course consistent with the PANDAS subgroup, and 98 healthy volunteers (HV) matched by age, sex, and IQ.

In a paired comparison of the two groups, the PANDAS subjects were less accurate than HV in a test of response suppression. Further, in a two-step linear regression analysis of the PANDAS group, where clinical variables were added stepwise into the model and in the second step matching variables (age, sex, and IQ) were added, IQ emerged as a predictor of performance on this task. In the same analysis, ADHD diagnosis and age emerged as predictors of response time in a continuous performance task. Subdividing the PANDAS group by primary psychiatric diagnosis revealed that subjects with TS or OCD with tics exhibited a longer response time compared to controls than subjects with OCD only, replicating previous findings within TS and OCD. This study demonstrates that children with PANDAS exhibit neuropsychological profiles similar to those of their primary psychiatric diagnosis.

### Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders and streptococcal infections: Role of otolaryngologist [^112egeoC]. The Laryngoscope (2001). Low credibility.

The objective is to increase awareness and understanding of the putative role of streptococcal infection in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders in children and to discuss therapeutic options in this group of patients.

- **Methods**: Case illustration and literature review.

- **Results**: Two siblings, one with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and one with a tic disorder, underwent tonsillectomy for recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis. At the latest follow-up visit (11 months postoperatively), both patients exhibited significant improvement in their psychiatric illnesses. We discuss these cases as well as the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS).

- **Conclusion**: PANDAS is an active area of research investigating the relationship between streptococcal infections and the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder or tic disorders (or both) in children. The etiopathogenesis of PANDAS is thought to reflect autoimmune mechanisms and involvement of the basal ganglia of susceptible hosts. Because otolaryngologists evaluate a large portion of pediatric patients with recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, it is important to be aware of this association and to manage these patients appropriately.

- **Warning: Risk of serious disorders**: See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Pegasys may cause or aggravate fatal or life-threatening neuropsychiatric, autoimmune, ischemic, and infectious disorders. Monitor closely and withdraw therapy with persistently severe or worsening signs or symptoms of the above disorders.

- **Detailed risk of serious disorders**: Alpha interferons, including Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a), may cause or aggravate these conditions. Patients should undergo periodic clinical and laboratory evaluations. Therapy should be withdrawn in cases of persistently severe or worsening signs or symptoms of these disorders. In many cases, these issues resolve after stopping Pegasys therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.5, 5.8, 5.11, 5.14, 5.16), Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

On April 14 and 15, 2018, the sixth biennial Pediatric Anesthesia Neurodevelopmental Assessment (PANDA) Symposium convened at Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian/Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York. Since its inception over 10 years ago, the PANDA Symposium has served as a key forum for clinicians, researchers, and other major stakeholders to gather and review the state of preclinical and clinical research related to anesthetic neurotoxicity in the developing brain. It has also served as an important venue for participants to gain insight and leverage support from various public and private regulatory bodies.

Goals of this year's meeting included assessments of how knowledge has evolved, endeavors to develop common outcome measures, and formulations of future directions for research and policy. The symposium program highlighted a diverse body of cutting-edge work, from results of preclinical and clinical studies to updates in clinical practice and policymaking.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and management of autoimmune pancreatitis in childhood: Consensus from INSPPIRE [^111GtPMz]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pediatric pancreatitis, particularly in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis, the management of relapse is addressed by the INSPPIRE 2018 guidelines. These guidelines recommend considering a new course of prednisone in the event of a relapse. For patients with biopsy-proven pediatric autoimmune pancreatitis who require maintenance therapy, immunomodulators such as 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or infliximab (for those with a concomitant diagnosis of IBD) should be considered as alternatives to prednisone.

### Streptococcal infections and exacerbations in PANDAS: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111erJcg]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Low credibility.

The pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) hypothesis suggests an association between group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) infections and subsequent onset or exacerbation of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or tic disorders.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis including longitudinal, prospective studies on exacerbations of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with GABHS infections in children with PANDAS. We searched PubMed and EMBASE through August 14, 2017. Two independent reviewers extracted data, and we used random-effects analysis to calculate rate ratios (RR).

- **Results**: Three studies were included with a total of 82 PANDAS cases and 127 control children with obsessive-compulsive disorder or chronic tic disorder. PANDAS cases had a nonsignificantly increased RR of 2.33 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63–8.70, P = 0.21, I = 28.3%] for exacerbations of neuropsychiatric symptoms in temporal proximity to a GABHS infection and no increased risk of GABHS infections (RR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.56–1.73, P = 0.97, I = 45%) compared with the control children. However, PANDAS cases had an increased risk of neuropsychiatric exacerbations in general, with a RR of 1.54 (95% CI: 1.12–2.11, P = 0.008, I = 0%) compared with the control children. The studies had methodologic heterogeneity, high risk of selection bias, and differed concerning case definition and infection measures.

### IVIG therapy in neurological disorders of childhood [^113xkmRA]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

There is growing evidence that intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) are effective in some neuroimmunological disorders of childhood. This short review summarizes the evidence-based indications and recommendations of IVIG therapy in these disorders. Despite considerable efforts to define the role and mechanisms of IVIG, more clinical studies are needed to further explore the therapeutic potential of IVIG in childhood diseases of the nervous system and muscle.
