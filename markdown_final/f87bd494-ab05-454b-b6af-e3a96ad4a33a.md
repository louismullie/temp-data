## Question

With a history of stones should you order a KUB, ultrasound, or CT scan

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to choose among KUB, ultrasound, and CT for a patient with a history of kidney stones who presents with suspected recurrent renal colic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is a typical, uncomplicated recurrence versus a high-risk scenario. Then, I should verify the radiation risks and cumulative exposure implications for recurrent stone formers. Next, I will review comparative diagnostic performance of ultrasound versus CT, including indirect signs and patient-centered outcomes. After that, I need to check guideline-based recommendations and consensus statements. Then, I will examine the specific role and limitations of KUB radiography. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified algorithm and note special populations and follow-up imaging needs, anchoring to high-quality evidence and guidelines throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: in a patient with known stone disease and a classic, uncomplicated presentation of recurrent renal colic, the pretest probability of a ureteral stone is high, and the management is often supportive unless red flags appear, so I should avoid reflexively ordering CT unless something changes the risk profile or the diagnosis is uncertain [^115Esah5] [^111iVYkS].

> Wait, let me verify the radiation burden because that drives modality choice in recurrent disease. CT delivers ionizing radiation with nontrivial cumulative exposure in stone formers, and quality-improvement data show patients with recurrent colic can accumulate double-digit CTs, with one patient receiving 13 scans, underscoring the need to minimize unnecessary CT in this population [^113pnxG3] [^114Qp4XL].

> Next, I should review diagnostic performance trade-offs. CT remains the most sensitive and specific test for direct stone visualization, but ultrasound detects hydronephrosis, perinephric fluid, and ureteral jets, and in a large pragmatic RCT, initial ultrasound had equivalent 30-day high-risk diagnostic yield and similar serious adverse events compared with CT, with markedly lower 6-month cumulative radiation exposure, which is exactly the outcome we want in recurrent stone formers [^111fFPy5] [^117GnFPB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm guideline direction, and multispecialty consensus from ACEP/ACR/AUA supports ultrasound or no further imaging in many scenarios, reserving CT for when ultrasound is non-diagnostic, symptoms persist, or alternative diagnoses are suspected, aligning with Choosing Wisely to avoid CT in young, otherwise healthy patients with known stones and uncomplicated presentations [^111iVYkS] [^116au5Ca] [^113pnxG3].

> I will now examine the role of KUB. My first thought is that KUB might help quickly confirm a radiopaque stone, but wait, I should double-check its sensitivity and utility in the acute setting — KUB misses radiolucent stones and small calculi, and in the CT era, adding a preliminary KUB rarely changes management and can be omitted without harm, so KUB is not appropriate as an initial test for acute suspected colic in patients with a history of stones [^115oxPxE] [^1171Jzcc].

> Let me consider special populations. In pregnancy, ultrasound is the first-line modality due to radiation concerns, with MR urography or low-dose noncontrast CT considered only if ultrasound is non-diagnostic and the clinical situation demands it, reinforcing the general principle of using nonionizing imaging first when feasible [^112vwgDG] [^115xDvc9].

> Next, I should review follow-up and surveillance imaging. For patients with known stones, periodic imaging to assess stone activity is reasonable, with plain radiography acceptable for radiopaque stones, ultrasound preferred for radiolucent stones, and low-dose CT reserved for complex anatomy or when precise sizing will change management, typically at yearly intervals if stable but tailored to stone activity and clinical changes [^1171Jzcc] [^1145tWcz].

> I need to ensure the practical algorithm is explicit: for a typical, uncomplicated recurrence in a patient under about 50 with known stones, start with ultrasound. If ultrasound is diagnostic for obstruction or a visible stone, manage conservatively without CT. If ultrasound is non-diagnostic and symptoms persist or an alternative diagnosis is suspected, proceed to low-dose noncontrast CT. Reserve standard-dose CT for complex cases or when low-dose protocols are inadequate due to body habitus or diagnostic uncertainty [^111fFPy5] [^111iVYkS] [^113pnxG3].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk or the presentation is atypical? In that case, I should verify that CT is justified earlier because the stakes for alternative diagnoses are higher, and using clinical tools like the STONE score can support shared decision-making and identify patients in whom CT is most likely to add value versus those in whom ultrasound-first is safe and sufficient [^115Esah5] [^116nUi65].

> Let me reconsider KUB one more time. While I initially thought it might be useful for tracking radiopaque stones over time, I should confirm that its role is limited to selected follow-up of known radiopaque stones or very low-dose surveillance, not to acute diagnosis, and certainly not as a gatekeeper before CT in suspected colic, where it risks delaying care without benefit [^115oxPxE] [^1171Jzcc].

> In summary, I should anchor the choice to patient-centered outcomes: ultrasound-first in uncomplicated recurrent colic reduces radiation without increasing missed high-risk diagnoses or adverse events, CT is reserved for diagnostic uncertainty or intervention planning, and KUB is generally not helpful in the acute evaluation, with imaging selection individualized for pregnancy, solitary kidney, or immunocompromised states to prioritize safety and diagnostic yield [^111fFPy5] [^111iVYkS] [^112vwgDG].

For patients with a history of stones, **ultrasound is first-line** [^111fFPy5] for acute flank pain because it avoids radiation, detects hydronephrosis, and is accurate for most clinically significant stones [^117GnFPB] [^113pnxG3]. Use **non-contrast CT** when ultrasound is inconclusive, symptoms persist, or an alternative diagnosis is suspected, as it is the most sensitive test [^114eahRc] [^113VmyK2]. Reserve KUB for tracking known radiopaque stones or when CT is unavailable, as it misses radiolucent stones and small calculi [^1171Jzcc] [^117GnFPB]. Choose imaging based on clinical context, stone risk, and prior studies to minimize radiation and cost [^111iVYkS].

---

## Clinical scenarios and imaging choices

### Acute flank pain (suspected renal colic)

In acute flank pain, **ultrasound is first-line** because it avoids radiation, detects hydronephrosis, and identifies most clinically significant stones [^111fFPy5] [^111iVYkS]; **non-contrast CT** is reserved for inconclusive ultrasound, persistent symptoms, or suspected alternative diagnoses, as it is the most sensitive modality [^114eahRc] [^112AesrX]. KUB is not recommended initially due to low sensitivity and limited utility [^115oxPxE].

---

### Follow-up or surveillance imaging

For follow-up or surveillance, **ultrasound is preferred** for routine monitoring because it avoids radiation and detects new stones or growth [^117GnFPB] [^1171Jzcc]. KUB is acceptable for tracking known radiopaque stones but is limited for radiolucent stones and small calculi [^1171Jzcc] [^117GnFPB]. Non-contrast CT is reserved for complex anatomy, unclear ultrasound findings, or when precise stone characterization is needed [^113VmyK2] [^116edhuh].

---

### Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Ultrasound is first-line; MRI without contrast is a secondary option if ultrasound is inconclusive [^112vwgDG] [^114eahRc].
- **Pediatrics**: Ultrasound is first-line; low-dose non-contrast CT is reserved for inconclusive ultrasound or complex cases [^114MuUhD].
- **Patients with repeated CT exposure**: Prefer ultrasound or KUB to limit cumulative radiation [^114peST8] [^117S2fMc].

---

## Comparative effectiveness and limitations

| **Imaging modality** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Ultrasound | - No radiation <br/> - Detects hydronephrosis <br/> - Identifies most significant stones <br/> - Lower cost | - Operator-dependent <br/> - Limited sensitivity for small (< 5 mm) or ureteral stones [^117S2fMc] [^112uVgPc] |
| Non-contrast CT | - High sensitivity and specificity <br/> - Detects small stones <br/> - Defines anatomy <br/> - Identifies alternatives | - Radiation exposure <br/> - Higher cost <br/> - May detect incidental findings [^111dugHq] [^113pnxG3] |
| KUB radiography | - Low radiation <br/> - Low cost <br/> - Useful for radiopaque stones | - Misses radiolucent stones <br/> - Low sensitivity for small stones <br/> - Limited utility in acute setting [^115oxPxE] [^117GnFPB] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **AUA guidelines**: Ultrasound for initial imaging; non-contrast CT when ultrasound is inconclusive or alternative diagnoses are suspected [^notfound].
- **EAU guidelines**: Ultrasound first-line; non-contrast CT for detailed stone characterization or complex cases [^116P58kz].
- **ACR guidelines**: Ultrasound first-line in pregnancy and pediatrics; non-contrast CT when ultrasound is inconclusive or alternative diagnoses are suspected [^112vwgDG] [^114eahRc].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Ultrasound is **first-line** for acute flank pain and routine surveillance in patients with a history of stones, as it avoids radiation and detects most clinically significant stones [^111fFPy5] [^1171Jzcc]. Non-contrast CT is reserved for inconclusive ultrasound, persistent symptoms, or when an alternative diagnosis is suspected, given its superior sensitivity and specificity [^113VmyK2] [^112AesrX]. KUB is best limited to tracking known radiopaque stones or when CT is unavailable, due to its limited sensitivity and utility [^1171Jzcc] [^115oxPxE].

### Avoid ordering CT of the abdomen and pelvis in young… [^113QYvtu]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Kidney stones can cause severe pain and nausea, which can usually be relieved with medication. Most stones pass spontaneously in the urine in a few days, though kidney stones often do recur. CT scans may be needed to diagnose kidney stones, and rule out other problems that may mimic the pain of kidney stones. Many patients in the emergency department who are less than 50 years old and who have symptoms of recurrent kidney stones do not need a CT scan unless these symptoms persist or worsen, or if there is a fever or a history of severe obstruction with previous stones. CT scans of patients in the ED with symptoms of recurrent kidney stones usually do not change treatment decisions, and the cost and radiation exposure can often be avoided in these cases. Close follow-up by a primary care physician or specialist is necessary.

### Clinical effectiveness protocols for imaging in the management of ureteral calculous disease: AUA technology assessment [^114peST8]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

This technology assessment addresses the optimal use of imaging in the evaluation and treatment of patients with suspected or documented ureteral stones.

Materials and Methods

A comprehensive literature search addressing 4 guiding questions was performed for full text in English articles published between January 1990 and July 2011. The search focused on major subtopics associated with the imaging of ureteral calculi, and included specific imaging modalities used in the diagnosis and management of ureteral calculous disease such as unenhanced (noncontrast) computerized tomography, conventional radiography, ultrasound, excretory urography, magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear medicine studies. Protocols (in the form of decision tree algorithms) were developed based on this literature review and in some instances on panel opinion. The 4 questions addressed were 1) What imaging study should be performed for suspected ureteral calculous disease? 2) What information should be obtained? 3) After diagnosis of a ureteral calculus, what followup imaging should be used? 4) After treatment of a ureteral calculus, what followup imaging studies should be obtained?

Results

Based on these protocols, noncontrast computerized tomography is recommended to establish the diagnosis in most cases, with a low energy protocol advocated if body habitus is favorable. Conventional radiography and ultrasound are endorsed for monitoring the passage of most radiopaque stones as well as for most patients undergoing stone removal. Other studies may be indicated based on imaging findings, and patient, stone and clinical factors.

Conclusions

The protocols generated assist the clinician in establishing the diagnosis of ureteral calculous disease, monitoring stone passage and following patients after treatment. The protocols take into account not only clinical effectiveness but also cost-effectiveness and risk/harm associated with the various imaging modalities.

### Derivation and validation of a clinical prediction rule for uncomplicated ureteral stone – the STONE score: retrospective and prospective observational cohort studies [^116nUi65]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This study showed that a clinical scoring system accurately predicts the likelihood of ureteral stone, which is inversely associated with likelihood of an acutely important alternate cause of symptoms. To our knowledge this is the first clinical scoring system to be derived and validated for prediction of uncomplicated ureteral stone in patients attending emergency departments in whom CT imaging is deemed indicated. A previous study from the intravenous pyelography era derived factors from 203 patients and validated the findings in 73 patients, finding four elements to be predictive of ureteral stone: flank pain, hematuria, acute onset of pain, and positive findings on a plain radiograph. Our data show that the quantitative effects of the five factors incorporated into the STONE score can accurately predict ureteral stone and allow stratification of patients in the emergency department with suspected kidney stone into one of three groups: low probability (≤ 10% chance of stone), moderate probability (about 50% chance of stone), and high probability (about 90% chance of stone).

Additionally, we found that the likelihood of an acutely important alternative finding is inversely proportional to the probability of a ureteral stone being present, as predicted by the STONE score. While the overall presence of acutely important alternative findings was 2.9% in the derivation set and 3.8% in the validation set, the prevalence of clinically important alternative diagnoses in the high probability group was less than half of this: 0.3% and 1.6% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively.

Clinical and policy implications

In deriving and validating this clinical prediction rule (rather than a decision rule), we are not necessarily stating that patients with a high stone score should not undergo CT imaging — though this may not be an unreasonable approach in certain situations. In any clinical situation the risk of a test (in this case from exposure to radiation) and the resources required to do the test will need to be balanced against the tolerance for uncertainty and risk of misdiagnosis on the part of both the clinician and the patient. In some patients — perhaps particularly younger ones who are more susceptible to radiation and less likely to have certain diagnoses such as diverticulitis, aortic disease, or malignancy — this score may be used to provide objective data to help balance the cost and risk of performing a CT. The other possibility is that this clinical prediction rule could be used to determine which patients may be most appropriate for substantially reduced dose CT, which has been shown to reliably identify ureteral stones, particularly large ones that may require intervention.

### Kidney and ureteral stones [^115WXydi]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Renal colic is a common complaint that presents to the emergency department. It is estimated that 13% of men and 7% of women will develop a renal stone. There is a high probability of recurrence, with 50% within 5 years. Computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast and the ultrasound of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder are the common diagnostic imaging modalities used for diagnosis. Initial treatment includes analgesics and medical expulsive therapy. Most of the patients will pass their stone spontaneously within 3 days. The remaining 20% will require urologic intervention.

### EAU guidelines on diagnosis and conservative management of urolithiasis [^111rED3m]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Low-dose computed tomography (CT) has become the first choice for detection of ureteral calculi. Conservative observational management of renal stones is possible, although the availability of minimally invasive treatment often leads to active treatment. Acute renal colic due to ureteral stone obstruction is an emergency that requires immediate pain management. Medical expulsive therapy (MET) for ureteral stones can support spontaneous passage in the absence of complicating factors. These guidelines summarise current recommendations for imaging, pain management, conservative treatment, and MET for renal and ureteral stones. Oral chemolysis is an option for uric acid stones.

Objective

To evaluate the optimal measures for diagnosis and conservative and medical treatment of urolithiasis.

Evidence Acquisition

Several databases were searched for studies on imaging, pain management, observation, and MET for urolithiasis, with particular attention to the level of evidence.

Evidence Synthesis

Most patients with urolithiasis present with typical colic symptoms, but stones in the renal calices remain asymptomatic. Routine evaluation includes ultrasound imaging as the first-line modality. In acute disease, low-dose CT is the method of choice. Ureteral stones < 6mm can pass spontaneously in well-controlled patients. Sufficient pain management is mandatory in acute renal colic. MET, usually with α-receptor antagonists, facilitates stone passage and reduces the need for analgesia. Contrast imaging is advised for accurate determination of the renal anatomy. Asymptomatic calyceal stones may be observed via active surveillance.

Conclusions

Diagnosis, observational management, and medical treatment of urinary calculi are routine measures. Diagnosis is rapid using low-dose CT. However, radiation exposure is a limitation. Active treatment might not be necessary, especially for stones in the lower pole. MET is recommended to support spontaneous stone expulsion.

Patient Summary

For stones in the lower pole of the kidney, treatment may be postponed if there are no complaints. Pharmacological treatment may promote spontaneous stone passage.

The modern management of urolithiasis requires a multi-disciplinary approach. Imaging plays a central role in both diagnosis and planning therapy of renal and ureteric calculi. This article reviews the current status of diagnosis and management of stone disease, and the contribution of radiological imaging in accurately triaging a given case to the most appropriate therapy.

### Imaging for percutaneous renal access and management of renal calculi [^116hAEJs]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Percutaneous renal stone surgery requires detailed imaging to define stone burden and delineate the anatomy of the kidney and nearby organs. It is also essential to carry out safe percutaneous access and to assess postoperative outcomes. The emergence of CT as the imaging modality of choice for detecting renal calculi and the ability of CT urography with or without three-dimensional reconstruction to delineate the collecting system makes this the most versatile and sensitive imaging modality for pre- and postoperative evaluation. At present, intravenous urogram continues to play an important role in the evaluation of patients considered for percutaneous nephrostolithotomy. Fluoroscopy re-mains the mainstay of intraoperative imaging, although ultrasound is a useful alternative. Selection and application of appropriate imaging modalities for patients undergoing per-cutaneous nephrostolithotomy enhances the safety and success of the procedure.

### Stone disease in pregnancy: imaging-guided therapy [^1168a53L]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment

The spontaneous passage rate of stones during pregnancy is up to 64–84% of cases with conservative therapy.

A conservative approach should be the initial management in all pregnant patients with symptomatic ureteric stones. Conservative treatment, which requires close communication between the urologist and obstetrician, includes hydration (oral or intravenous), analgesia, antibiotics (if infection is present), antiemetics, rest and routine sieving of urine.

If the conservative approach fails, stenting (ureteral Double-J stent) may be performed as an initial procedure in patients who have fever and/or proximal ureteric stones. Percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) should be reserved for patients with urosepsis or pyonephrosis if a stent cannot be placed.

Ureteroscopy with a Holmium laser has become the procedure of choice in pregnancy for symptomatic stones less than 1 cm and in those without evidence of sepsis or a history of transplanted kidney.

The algorithm for management of urolithiasis during pregnancy is summarized in Fig. 3.

### The natural history of asymptomatic renal stones ≤ 5 mm: comparison with ≥ 5 mm [^111mA2et]. Journal of Endourology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives: To clarify the natural history of asymptomatic renal stones ≤ 5mm in comparison with stones ≥ 5mm. Calculi ≤ 5mm are considered insignificant stones, but to what extent stone-related events can occur is unclear. Patients and Methods: In this retrospective study, 207 patients with asymptomatic renal stones confirmed by both CT and ultrasonography performed on the same day were enrolled. A follow-up ultrasound was performed every 6 months. The active indications for surgical intervention included stone relocations into the ureter and stone-related symptoms. The primary endpoint was the rate of surgical intervention. Results: A total of 207 patients (71 cases with stones ≤ 5mm and 136 cases with stones > 5mm) were included in this study. At a median follow-up of 3.3 years, 14 patients (20%) from the ≤ 5-mm group and 52 (38%) from the > 5-mm group underwent surgical treatment (p = 0.0067). Moreover, 11 patients (16%) from the ≤ 5-mm group and 27 (20%) from the > 5-mm group received surgical intervention as they manifested active indications, showing no significant difference (p = 0.44). As regards stone events, there were no significant differences in spontaneous stone passage, pain, hematuria, and stone growth. Multivariate analysis revealed that age ≤ 50 years and a history of stone surgery were significant factors, but stone size was not. Conclusion: About 20% of asymptomatic renal stones ≤ 5mm require surgical treatment within 5 years.

### Imaging advances in urolithiasis [^116CA3qi]. Journal of Endourology (2017). Low credibility.

The prevalence of urinary stones in the United States has been described as 1 in 11 persons reporting a history of stones. Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosis, management, and follow-up for these patients and imaging technology over the last 100 years has advanced as the disease prevalence has increased. CT remains the gold standard for imaging urolithiasis and changes in this technology, with the addition of multidetector CT and dual-energy CT, as well as the changes in utilization of CT, have decreased the radiation dose encountered by patients and allowed for improved stone detection. The use of digital tomography has been introduced for follow-up of recurrent stone formers offering the potential to lower radiation exposure over the course of a patient's lifelong treatment. However, there is still a demand for improved imaging techniques to detect smaller stones and stones in larger patients at lower radiation doses as well as the continued need for the judicious use of all imaging modalities for healthcare cost containment and patient safety.

### External validation of the STONE score, a clinical prediction rule for ureteral stone: an observational multi-institutional study [^116YAWdD]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study Design and Setting

To evaluate the STONE score, we conducted a secondary analysis using data from a recently conducted randomized comparative effectiveness trial, the Study of Ultrasonography Versus Computed Tomography for Suspected Nephrolithiasis. The randomized trial was conducted at 15 academic EDs across the United States between October 2011 and February 2013. Details of the participating EDs have been reported. Briefly, the participating sites were academic EDs with emergency medicine residencies and emergency ultrasonography fellowships across the United States, with representation from a number of settings: urban, rural, university based, and safety net hospitals. The sites varied by size, annual census, and patient population served. This randomized trial was performed with institutional review board approval at each site and informed consent was obtained from all participants. This current study was performed with institutional review board approval at the University of California, San Francisco.

Selection of Participants

Adult participants with suspected kidney stones that required imaging (determined by an attending emergency physician) were randomly assigned to receive point-of-care ultrasonography, radiology ultrasonography, or CT as their initial imaging test. Patients were excluded from enrollment if they were pregnant, at high risk of an important alternative (non–kidney stone) diagnosis, had received a kidney transplant, required dialysis, had a known solitary kidney, or weighed more than 129 kg if men or 113 kg if women. The STONE score consists of 5 demographic and clinical variables collected during the ED visit: sex, race, nausea or vomiting, duration of pain symptoms, and hematuria on urine dipstick test. To closely model the validation study with the inclusion and outcome criteria of the original report, we restricted the analysis to sites that used urine dipstick testing for hematuria and to participants who underwent a CT scan during the index ED visit. Of the 2,759 total patients analyzed in the randomized trial, 845 participants had the data available for validation of the STONE score (Figure 1).

### Trends in imaging use for the evaluation and followup of kidney stone disease: a single center experience [^117UnHAi]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Recent reports support renal ultrasound as the initial imaging study to evaluate patients with suspected renal colic. However, urologists often advocate for computerized tomography to better define stone size and location, especially before proceeding with endourological intervention. One concern with using ultrasound as initial imaging is that computerized tomography may be required later, obviating the reduction in costs and radiation gained by using ultrasound.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the electronic health records of 10,680 episodes of stone disease in a total of 7,659 patients who presented to the emergency department or walk-in clinic with a chief complaint or visit diagnosis of urolithiasis from 2009 to 2015 at a single institution. Images obtained during the index encounter and in the following 90 days were recorded.

Results

The index encounter included computerized tomography in 47% of episodes, ultrasound in 20%, plain x-ray of the kidneys, ureters and bladder in 12% and no imaging in 29%. Of the index visits 49% included multiple testing. If no computerized tomography was obtained during the index visit, 10% of patients underwent computerized tomography later in the episode. Total imaging costs and radiation exposure during 90 days were significantly higher when computerized tomography was done at the index visit. If the initial image obtained during an episode was ultrasound, computerized tomography was performed in 20% of cases within 90 days.

Conclusions

Of patients who underwent an initial ultrasound 80% avoided computerized tomography imaging. Avoiding computerized tomography at the index visit was associated with substantial reductions in radiation exposure and imaging costs.

### Appropriate use of CT for patients presenting with suspected renal colic: a quality improvement study [^1139Sbb8]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Interventions

A team of healthcare professionals was established including an emergency physician, a radiologist, a urologist, a clinical nurse educator and an information technology specialist. In consultation with emergency physicians, a root cause analysis was performed, and a driver diagram was developed to identify change ideas, displayed in figure 1. The first intervention was to standardise the decision-making to order CT scans for renal colic. To achieve this, in December 2016, an educational campaign was initiated for emergency physicians. Physicians were surveyed regarding their reasons for ordering CTs in the target population and a root cause analysis was performed. They were subsequently educated about the CW recommendation and the rationale behind it. Physicians were then introduced to a validated decision tool based on sex, time course of symptoms, ethnic origin, nausea, and erythrocytes in the urine (STONE score) for the assessment of renal colic. An electronic version of the STONE score was created and made available to emergency physicians. Next, in May 2017, a separate electronic order was made for CT scans for renal colic. To adhere to recommended practice, the protocol for these scans was adjusted to use a lower dose of radiation. The CW recommendation was incorporated into this electronic order and emergency physicians were advised to order an ultrasound if patients met the CW criteria.

Key driver diagram. Generated with input from emergency physicians, a radiologist, a urologist and a clinical nurse educator. This diagram was used to provide a framework for the proposed aim, the critical factors needed to achieve change, and change strategies. ED, emergency department; EMR, electronic medical record.

Family of measures

The outcome measure was the number of CT scans ordered for those aged < 50 years with a history of renal stones presenting with uncomplicated renal colic. The process measures were the number of ultrasounds ordered for the target population and the number of kidney-ureter-bladder X-rays ordered for the target population. The balancing measure was the number of patients diagnosed with renal colic that returned to the ED within 14 days with an alternate diagnosis.

Statistical analysis

Categorical data were reported as frequencies and proportions, whereas continuous variables were reported as medians with IQR. For comparison purposes, patients were divided by the type of imaging used to investigate their renal colic.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for bladder stones, more specifically with respect to imaging follow-up, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to individualize follow-up imaging for each patient. Recognize that factors affecting follow-up include whether the underlying functional predisposition to stone formation can be treated (such as transurethral resection of prostate) and metabolic risk.

### Eligibility of living kidney donors with kidney stone disease [^114u6DFP]. American Journal of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Guidelines recommend that patients with a self-reported history of kidney stones or stones on imaging during living kidney donor (LKD) evaluation undergo 24-hour urine stone risk testing. We examined eligibility decisions for LKD candidates at two high-volume academic transplant centers based on 24-hour urine testing and imaging findings.

Methods

We identified potential LKDs with a self-reported history of kidney stones or stones identified on imaging, who underwent 24-hour urine collection. Patients who could not donate due to other medical conditions were excluded. Differences in characteristics of patients approved vs. rejected for donation were determined using t tests and chi-square tests, or non-parametric tests when appropriate.

Results

In total, 105 candidates met study criteria, of whom 22 (21%) were rejected for donation. Candidates rejected for donation had higher urinary calcium excretion (p < 0.001), supersaturation of calcium oxalate (p < 0.001), and supersaturation of calcium phosphate (p = 0.02). Thirty-four candidates repeated 24-hour urine analyses following dietary or medical interventions for stone prevention. Candidates approved for donation had an increase in urinary volume (p = 0.045), reduction in urinary calcium excretion (p = 0.02), reduction in urinary oxalate excretion (p = 0.04), and reduction in supersaturations of calcium oxalate (p < 0.001), calcium phosphate (p = 0.004), and uric acid (p = 0.004). Those rejected for donation had no statistically significant changes in urinary parameters. While those rejected for donation had more stones on imaging compared to those approved, this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.06).

Conclusion

### Imaging patients with renal colic-consider ultrasound first [^116sAEYS]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

CT

CT has become the imaging study of choice for renal colic because of its high sensitivity in the detection of renal and ureteral stones. Moreover, when CT is performed with dual energy, it helps to characterise the composition of the renal stones. However, most hospitals do not have this technology, which in addition has very limited usefulness in case of ureteral stones. CT can identify the presence and size of stones with a very high accuracy of > 95% and is able to detect alternative diagnoses that simulate renal colic in 5–10% of patients. Nonetheless, in spite of its high accuracy, there is increasing concern about the increase of health care costs and radiation risk that accompanies CT scans, since the use of CT rarely changes the treatment plans of these patients. In this way, in a recent retrospective study, Westphalen et al. determined the proportion of patient visits for flank or kidney pain receiving CT or US and calculated the diagnosis and hospitalisation rates for urolithiasis. From 1996 to 2007, the use of CT to assess patients with suspected urolithiasis increased from 4.0 to 42.5% over the study period, and the use of US remained low, at about 5%. However, the diagnosis of kidney stones, identification of significant alternate diagnoses or admission to the hospital did not increase.

The problem of exposure to radiation is very important in these patients, especially because of the possibility of cumulative radiation that is not usually well assessed when multiple CTs are performed in repetitive episodes of renal colic. Thus, the use of dedicated low-dose protocols is essential in these patients. In spite of the advances with dedicated low-dose CT protocols, a recent study evaluated renal colic CT studies conducted in 93 institutions in the USA from May 2011 to January 2013 and demonstrated that reduced-dose renal CT protocols are used infrequently. The overall mean effective institutional dose was 11.2 mSv. Only 2% of the studies were conducted with a "reduced dose" of 3 mSv, and only 10% of institutions used an effective dose of 6 mSv or less in at least 50% of patients. In another study performed in a single institution, the mean effective doses for a single study were 6.5 mSv for SDCT and 8.5 mSv for MDCT. Moreover, 4% of these patients (all with a known history of nephrolithiasis) underwent three or more studies, with estimated effective doses ranging from 19.5 to 153.7 mSv.

### Diagnosis and initial management of kidney stones [^112AesrX]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and initial management of urolithiasis have undergone considerable evolution in recent years. The application of noncontrast helical computed tomography (CT) in patients with suspected renal colic is one major advance. The superior sensitivity and specificity of helical CT allow urolithiasis to be diagnosed or excluded definitively and expeditiously without the potential harmful effects of contrast media. Initial management is based on three key concepts: (1) the recognition of urgent and emergency requirements for urologic consultation, (2) the provision of effective pain control using a combination of narcotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in appropriate patients and (3) an understanding of the impact of stone location and size on natural history and definitive urologic management. These concepts are discussed with reference to contemporary literature, with the goal of providing tools that family physicians can use in the emergency department or clinic.

IMAGING OF THE PATIENT SUSPECTED OF APPENDICITIS

Ultrasound Versus Computed Tomography Scan

Ultrasound (US) has been used to evaluate patients suspected of acute appendicitis and has an 85% to 90% positive predictive value with an appendiceal diameter greater than 9 to 10 mm. It does not use radiation energy, is repeatable, and is safe for pregnant women. It can also demonstrate other pelvic pathology in women. Ultrasound is frequently used in pediatric patients and is favored as an initial study in small children. The utility of US is less well documented in the adult population.

Computed tomography scan with contrast has been the standard for imaging the abdomen when searching for acute pathology and is used with increasing frequency in the general diagnosis of abdominal pain, especially by nonsurgeons. It provides a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis but has the potential to identify radiographic abnormalities of the appendix that are not clinically relevant. Computed tomography imaging should always be interpreted in the context of clinical history and physical examination. Computed tomography can also demonstrate an appendiceal fecalith, periappendiceal fluid collection, or an abscess, findings that may be of importance in clinical decision-making. The sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of computed tomography (CT) scans based on pathology results were 87.9%, 81.8%, 94.7%, and 79.3%, respectively, in patients with low clinical suspicion.

In many circumstances, the position of the appendix within the abdomen and its relation to the cecum will be demonstrated.

Women

Childbearing Age

Pelvic pathology must be ruled out when suspecting acute appendicitis in women of childbearing age. A urine analysis may demonstrate urinary tract infection or potential kidney stones. An US or CT scan may show an adnexal tubo-ovarian abscess or ectopic pregnancy.

Pregnant Women

Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality to assess abdominal pain and make the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in pregnant patients, although magnetic resonance imaging is being used with increasing frequency if US findings are not diagnostic. A CT scan should be considered if a patient is acutely ill, and the diagnosis is still in question.– Alternatively, if CT scan does not clearly demonstrate acute appendicitis in the pregnant patient, magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to have a high sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100% in some studies.

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^111WEH6Z]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Kidney stones are highly prevalent and characterized by a high rate of recurrence. Thus, kidney stones not only cause pain, discomfort, and reduced quality of life but also incur tremendous health care costs. However, a significant number of kidney stones pass without symptoms and are not noticed by the patient. Currently, data regarding the frequency of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage are limited. This study evaluated the natural history of asymptomatic kidney stones and factors associated with asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage in patients with recurrent calcium-containing stones. We found that a high number of patients (209 of 383; 55%) experienced a stone event within a relatively short follow-up period of 3 years. Interestingly, 36% (158 of 442) of the spontaneous kidney stone passages were asymptomatic. The number of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passages was significantly associated with a higher number of stones on CT at randomization.

With advances in imaging technology, the possibility of detecting asymptomatic kidney stones has increased. Treatment options for kidney stones include active surveillance, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy. However, a treatment strategy for asymptomatic kidney stones is yet to be established. In several guidelines, kidney stones ≤ 5 mm have been considered insignificant; however, the extent to which stone-related events can occur and surgical intervention should be performed in these small stones. According to previously published data, approximately half of patients with asymptomatic kidney stones will have symptoms during the first stone passage, regardless of the size of the stone. However, the number of stones that never passed, and thus did not cause any symptoms, was unknown in this analysis. By contrast, our study evaluated the natural history of asymptomatic kidney stones in recurrent calcium-containing stone formers by using CT imaging at baseline and at the end of follow-up. Thus, we were able to obtain an accurate evaluation of the natural history of all (presumably calcium-containing) kidney stones, including those resulting from asymptomatic stone passage.

American Urological Association (AUA) Surgical Management of Stones guideline — CT to guide selection between shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) and ureteroscopy (URS): Clinicians may obtain a non-contrast CT scan to help select the best candidate for SWL versus URS; Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C. The guideline states that neither randomized trials nor comparative studies have addressed preoperative CT for treatment selection between SWL and URS, recognizes that multiple imaging modalities including renal ultrasound (US), intravenous pyelogram/intravenous urogram (IVU), and kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) radiography may be used to preoperatively assess candidates, and notes that CT can be useful to determine whether SWL or URS is better suited for a given patient. It adds that non-contrast CT is the most sensitive and specific imaging investigation for diagnosing upper urinary tract stone disease, while also highlighting concerns about long-term cancer risks from ionizing radiation that have led to calls for US in the initial diagnosis of acute flank pain and emphasizing clinician awareness of potential risks/harms when selecting imaging tests.

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association / endourological society guideline, PART II [^112buQNK]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

This Guideline is intended to provide a clinical framework for the surgical management of patients with kidney and/or ureteral stones. The summary presented herein represents Part II of the two-part series dedicated to Surgical Management of Stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society Guideline. Please refer to Part I for introductory information and a discussion of pre-operative imaging and special cases.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review of the literature (search dates 1/1/1985 to 5/31/2015) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed studies relevant to the surgical management of stones. The review yielded an evidence base of 1,911 articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the Guideline statements. Evidence-based statements of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendation were developed based on benefits and risks/burdens to patients. Additional directives are provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions when insufficient evidence existed.

Results

The Panel identified 12 adult Index Patients to represent the most common cases seen in clinical practice. Three additional Index Patients were also created to describe the more commonly encountered special cases, including pediatric and pregnant patients. With these patients in mind, Guideline statements were developed to aid the clinician in identifying optimal management.

Conclusions

Proper treatment selection, which is directed by patient- and stone-specific factors, remains the greatest predictor of successful treatment outcomes. This Guideline is intended for use in conjunction with the individual patient's treatment goals. In all cases, patient preferences and personal goals should be considered when choosing a management strategy.

### Imaging in suspected renal colic: systematic review of the literature and multispecialty consensus [^111Jc1PK]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Renal colic is common and CT (computerized tomography) is frequently utilized when the diagnosis of kidney stone is suspected. CT is accurate, but exposes patients to ionizing radiation and has not been shown to alter either interventional approaches or hospital admission rates. This multi-organizational transdisciplinary collaboration sought evidence-based, multispecialty consensus on optimal imaging across different clinical scenarios in patients with suspected renal colic in the acute setting.

Materials and Methods

In conjunction with the ACEP (American College of Emergency Physicians®) E-QUAL (Emergency Quality Network) we formed a nine-member panel with three physician representatives each from the ACEP, the ACR® (American College of Radiology) and the AUA (American Urological Association). A systematic literature review was used as the basis for a 3-step modified Delphi process to seek consensus on optimal imaging in 29 specific clinical scenarios.

Results

From an initial search yielding 6,337 records there were 232 relevant articles of acceptable evidence quality to guide the literature summary. At the completion of the Delphi process consensus, agreement was rated as perfect in 15 (52%), excellent in 8 (28%), good in 3 (10%) and moderate in 3 (10%) of the 29 scenarios. There were no scenarios where at least moderate consensus was not reached. CT was recommended in 7 scenarios (24%) with ultrasound in 9 (31%) and no further imaging needed in 13 (45%).

Conclusions

Evidence and multispecialty consensus support ultrasound or no further imaging in specific clinical scenarios, with reduced-radiation dose CT to be employed when CT is needed in patients with suspected renal colic.

### Does the protocol for suspected renal colic lead to unnecessary radiation exposure of young female patients? [^1123K2H7]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Unenhanced multidetector computed tomography (CT KUB) is now firmly established as the best imaging method in the evaluation of suspected acute renal colic, and is replacing intravenous urography at an increasing number of hospitals. The female patient presenting at the emergency department with suspected acute renal colic presents a particular diagnostic problem, as the positive rate for stone disease in female patients is considerably lower compared with male patients. The indiscriminate use of suspected renal colic protocol and CT KUB in all female patients with flank pain should be avoided.

### Imaging patients with renal colic-consider ultrasound first [^113VmyK2]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Ultrasound can achieve a high sensitivity and specificity for the depiction of ureteral calculi and acute obstruction and has several advantages including its availability, lower cost and absence of radiation. Thus, it should be considered the first imaging modality in patients with renal colic. No more complications, serious adverse events, return emergency department visits or hospitalisations are expected using US first instead of CT. CT should be reserved for patients in whom US does not obtain a diagnosis, if symptoms do not resolve or there is a suspicion of alternative diagnoses.

### Ultrasonography versus computed tomography for suspected nephrolithiasis [^111fFPy5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.

Methods

In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analogue scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.

Results

A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to CT. The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (P < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (P = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (P = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.

Conclusions

Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.

### Asymptomatic nephrolithiasis detected by ultrasound [^111w6fMy]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Data from several countries suggest a recent world-wide increase in the prevalence of stone disease. However, these studies have not analyzed the effect that increases in utilization of imaging modalities have had on detection of asymptomatic stones.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

A retrospective chart review of all patients who had an abdominal or retroperitoneal ultrasound in 2005 at a Department of Veterans' Affairs Medical Center was conducted. The charts of patients who had ultrasounds demonstrating kidney stones were further reviewed. Patients were classified into symptomatic and asymptomatic groups on the basis of their clinical history. Age and sex for all patients were recorded. For those patients with stones, additional data were recorded. Of all patients in the study, the percentage of those with asymptomatic stones was calculated. Taking into account uncertainty about symptomaticity in some patients, a sensitivity analysis for the presence or absence of gross and microhematuria was performed to determine a range for the percent of asymptomatic stones. Appropriate statistical tests were used to determine significance.

Results

The prevalence of all kidney stones in the study group was 8.6%. Using the sensitivity analysis, 29.8 to 45.7% of all stones were asymptomatic. Of stones found on abdominal ultrasounds, 71.4% were asymptomatic, whereas 36.8% of stones found on retroperitoneal ultrasound were asymptomatic.

Conclusions

Asymptomatic stones have a relatively high prevalence on ultrasound. Epidemiologic estimates of prevalence of nephrolithiasis need to account for increases in utilization of imaging modalities and the resulting detection bias.

### Appropriate use of CT for patients presenting with suspected renal colic: a quality improvement study [^117S2fMc]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Across institutions, non-contrast abdominal and pelvic CT is currently used for ~80% of renal colic presentations due to its high sensitivity for urinary stone disease, as well as ease of availability in most EDs. However, even though CT imaging is often more sensitive than US, both modalities are effective in clinical practice. A prospective cohort study by Yan et al studying the use of ultrasound in the management of low-risk renal colic patients found that at 90-day follow-up, there were no significant intra-abdominal pathologies missed. In a multicentre study comparing US and CT imaging for suspected nephrolithiasis, Smith-Bindman et al found no significant differences in the risk of subsequent adverse events, pain scores, return ED visits or hospitalisations for the two groups. Furthermore, the use of US as the initial test resulted in no need for subsequent CT in most patients, thus resulting in lower cumulative radiation exposure for the US group. Other studies have also found that the use of US has similar patient outcomes as CT imaging, as the stones that are missed by US are usually small (< 5 mm), and often pass spontaneously.

Prior studies have shown that emergency physicians significantly underestimate the radiation exposure from CT and most physicians did not believe that CT increased the lifetime risk of cancer. This attitude can result in risks to patients, which is highlighted by one patient in our study who has undergone 13 CT scans for recurrent renal colic. Since urolithiasis is a recurrent disease and infrequently leads to long-term complications, emergency physicians should consider alternative diagnostic modalities to curb the amount of unnecessary radiation exposure. In particular, this should be considered in young patients with a history of renal colic with typical presentations.

Westphalen et al found that while there was a 10-fold increase in the utilisation of CT imaging for patients with renal colic from 1996 to 2007, there was no associated change in the proportion of diagnoses of kidney stones, significant alternate diagnoses or admissions to the hospital. These findings suggest that increased utilisation of CT imaging may not have a significant impact on the diagnosis and management of renal colic in the ED.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^116sm1go]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

American Urological Association microhematuria guideline — upper tract imaging outlines that when contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) is contraindicated due to chronic kidney disease or iodine-based contrast allergy, the Panel recommends magnetic resonance (MR) urography as an alternative imaging modality; in pregnancy, the Panel recommends initial ultrasonography for microhematuria during pregnancy with consideration of multiphasic CT or MR urography after delivery. MR urography has adequate sensitivity for renal cortical and upper tract urothelial tumors but lower sensitivity for nephrolithiasis; MRI has a lower detection rate than CT for stone disease, so if nephrolithiasis is suspected based on the patient's history, then non-contrast CT should be undertaken. For patients with contraindications to CT and MR urography, imaging of the renal cortex may be achieved with either non-contrast CT or renal ultrasound and retrograde pyelography (RPG) to assess the urothelium; if MR urography is being considered in patients with poor renal function and microhematuria, the Panel recommends discussion with institutional radiologists regarding the agent being used on site and the relative risk-yield ratio of the study, and the American College of Radiology issued recommendations that relax the concern for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis with newer gadolinium agents even in patients with low renal function.

### Kidney stones during pregnancy [^115xDvc9]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Kidney stones affect 10% of people at some point in their lives and, for some unfortunate women, this happens during pregnancy. Pregnancy is a complex state and both physiological and mechanical changes alter risk factors for kidney stone formation. When a pregnant woman develops acute nephrolithiasis, the situation is more complicated than in nonpregnant women. Imaging limitations and treatment restrictions mean that special diagnostic and management algorithms are needed upon presentation. Ultrasonography remains the gold-standard first-line diagnostic imaging modality for kidney stones during pregnancy but several second-line alternatives exist. Acute renal colic during pregnancy is associated with risks to both mother and fetus. As such, these patients need to be handled with special attention. First-line management is generally conservative (trial of passage and pain management) and is associated with a high rate of stone passage. Presentation of obstructive nephrolithiasis with associated infection represents a unique and serious clinical situation requiring immediate drainage. If infection is not present and conservative management fails, ureteroscopy can be offered if clinically appropriate, but, in some circumstances, temporary drainage with ureteral stent or nephrostomy tube might be indicated. Shockwave lithotripsy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy are contraindicated during pregnancy.

### The impact of asymptomatic kidney stones on disease progression in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^113eoJT7]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Ethical statement

This study was in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization, and local regulatory requirements. The study was approved by the local ethics committee with the approval/date and number: 13 March, 2024, 2024/19-E-54022451–050.04–146750.

Study design and population

This retrospective cohort study included patients diagnosed with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) who were followed at our nephrology clinic. Initially, 442 patients were under follow-up. After applying exclusion criteria, 195 patients were included in the final analysis: 85 with kidney stones (N+) and 110 without (N-). The diagnosis of ADPKD and patient selection criteria were based on the KDIGO guidelines, which represent current clinical standards for managing and monitoring ADPKD. The inclusion criteria required a follow-up period of more than 90 days, a diagnosis of ADPKD according to current clinical guidelines, and confirmation of kidney stone diagnosis via imaging techniques such as computed tomography or ultrasonography. We chose a follow-up period of at least 90 days to ensure meaningful changes in eGFR could be observed, which aligns with standard clinical practices for kidney function monitoring. Additionally, this threshold allowed us to exclude patients with very short follow-up durations or those who visited the clinic only once, ensuring data reliability. Most patients with follow-up periods exceeding 90 days were monitored for over a year, capturing significant renal function changes. Furthermore, this criterion balanced the need for robust data while maintaining a sufficient sample size for analysis.

Exclusion criteria

Patients younger than 18 or older than 75 years of age, those with an initial estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 15 ml/min/1.73 m², individuals who had undergone kidney stone surgery, those with a history of acute kidney injury, patients with a follow-up period shorter than 90 days, and individuals lacking available laboratory data were excluded from the study.

Data collection

Patients' demographic data, clinical history, laboratory results, and imaging findings were collected from medical records. eGFR was calculated using the CKD-EPI formula at baseline and follow-up. The presence of kidney stones was confirmed using imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography. All patients underwent at least one computed tomography (CT) imaging study to ensure accurate confirmation of kidney stones.

AUA/Endourological Society surgical management of stones — functional renal imaging: Clinicians may obtain a functional imaging study (DTPA or MAG-3) if clinically significant loss of renal function is suspected (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C); nuclear renography can provide differential function and assess obstruction, though its ability to assess obstruction may be limited in moderate to severe chronic kidney disease. In settings such as chronic kidney disease or staghorn/complex stones, renal function may not be adequately assessed without a nuclear renal scan or contrast-enhanced imaging such as CT urography, magnetic resonance (MR) urography, or IV urography; decreased renal function may prompt consideration of options ranging from observation to nephrectomy, and when obstruction limits assessment a nephrostomy tube or ureteral stent may be required in order to appropriately assess renal function before selecting therapy.

### Guidelines on urolithiasis [^116XjQ6s]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

A project was initiated by the Health Care Office of the European Association of Urology in order to formulate common recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of patients with urolithiasis. The basic task for the working group therefore was to extract and evaluate evidence from the literature in order to reach a consensus on how these patients could best be managed.

Methods

Extensive reviews of the literature together with a thorough and detailed discussion of the various topics, by a working group including of experts from several European countries, provided the basis for a consensus overview of urolithiasis and its management.

Results and Conclusions

Recommendations are given for the management of patients with acute stone colic and for active removal of stones from the ureter and kidney. Moreover, the principles for risk evaluation of patients with recurrent stone formation and appropriate recurrence preventive treatment are given.

### Derivation and validation of a clinical prediction rule for uncomplicated ureteral stone – the STONE score: retrospective and prospective observational cohort studies [^112uVgPc]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Ultrasound is another option that may be used for imaging in suspected renal colic, and ultrasonography is often a first line test outside of the United States. It has the advantage of avoiding radiation entirely and is sometimes definitively diagnostic: identifying the presence, size, and location of a kidney stone that is causing symptoms. Often, however, ultrasonography may show indirect evidence of obstruction (hydronephrosis) without visualizing the actual ureteral stone, which may be obscured by bowel. We did find the presence of hydronephrosis on CT to be highly predictive of ureteral stone, and future work will incorporate the presence of hydronephrosis on ultrasonography into the STONE score.

At our institution, the STONE score has been incorporated into the computerized physician order entry system (Epic, Verona WI). When a clinician orders a CT for kidney stone the questions asked and a STONE score with risk category accompanies the radiology order. This has been welcomed by the radiologists who were often unsure of the perceived likelihood of kidney stone on the part of the ordering physician. We have found that the STONE score is easily entered and calculated using our electronic health record. We are also currently using the STONE score in a prospective study to select patients who are appropriate for either expectant management (no CT) or an ultra low dose CT, with a radiation dose that is about 90% lower than conventional CT (effective dose of around 1 mSv, about that of a plain abdominal radiograph). On a population basis, assuming the no threshold linear model suggested by the Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation report (currently BEIR VII), an equivalent reduction in cancer risk could be expected. The current average effective dose of CT in the United States is 11.2 mSv, with only 2% of CT scans done using low doses.

### Challenges in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to nephrolithiasis [^111bF2gs]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The incidence of renal stones is rising along with the costs and morbidity associated with this condition. With careful evaluation and management, the great majority of recurrent stones are preventable. The cornerstone of this evaluation remains the 24-h urine collection. This review details the physiological rationale for commonly requested urine studies and details how these results should guide therapy with special emphasis on recent advances in the understanding of risk factors for stone disease. Challenges associated with the complicated patient will be addressed.

Long-term follow-up and repeated evaluations are effective at preventing recurrent stones and increasing patient satisfaction. There is growing appreciation of the complexity of dietary risks for stone disease, and traditional risk-factors such as dietary oxalate must be reevaluated.

Summary

The key to stone prevention is the individualization of therapy to specific patient risk factors with a recognition that these factors can change over time leading to a need for alterations in preventive therapies.

### Imaging urolithiasis: complications and interventions in children [^114MuUhD]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Ultrasound allows for identification of most clinically relevant stones, making it the modality of choice in paediatric urolithiasis. In children with symptoms of significant colic and nondiagnostic US, complementary imaging modalities such as KUB radiography or non-contrast CT might be considered. Management of kidney stones includes dietary, pharmacological and urological interventions depending on stone size, location or type and the child's condition. Given the very high incidence of underlying metabolic abnormalities and significant recurrence rates in paediatric urolithiasis, a thorough metabolic evaluation and follow-up examinations are of utmost importance.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute pyelonephritis: 2022 update [^113GGCdL]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute pyelonephritis (APN) is a severe urinary tract infection (UTI) that has the potential to cause sepsis, shock, and death. In the majority of patients, uncomplicated APN is diagnosed clinically and is responsive to treatment with appropriate antibiotics. In patients who are high risk or when treatment is delayed, microabscesses may coalesce to form an acute renal abscess. High-risk patients include those with a prior history of pyelonephritis, lack of response to therapy for lower UTI or for APN, diabetes, anatomic or congenital abnormalities of the urinary system, infections by treatment-resistant organisms, nosocomial infection, urolithiasis, renal obstruction, prior renal surgery, advanced age, pregnancy, renal transplant recipients, and immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients. Pregnant patients and patients with renal transplants on immunosuppression are at an elevated risk of severe complications. Imaging studies are often requested to aid with the diagnosis, identify precipitating factors, and differentiate lower UTI from renal parenchymal involvement, particularly in high-risk individuals. Imaging is usually not appropriate for the first-time presentation of suspected APN in an uncomplicated patient. The primary imaging modalities used in high-risk patients with suspected APN are CT, MRI, and ultrasound, although CT was usually not appropriate for initial imaging in a pregnant patient with no other complications. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Objective

This article reviews types of urinary calculi and their imaging appearances, presents direct and secondary imaging findings of urolithiasis, and provides an overview of treatment methods. Pertinent imaging findings that affect clinical management are highlighted. The implications of complex or variant genitourinary anatomy are reviewed. We outline a standard format for the reporting of urolithiasis to facilitate informed clinical management decisions.

Conclusion

Unenhanced CT is the preferred examination for evaluation of urolithiasis because of its availability, ease of performance, and high sensitivity. An awareness of the important imaging findings to report allows appropriate and efficient therapy.

### External validation of the STONE score, a clinical prediction rule for ureteral stone: an observational multi-institutional study [^113Qydtn]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

LIMITATIONS

There are some limitations of this study. This was a secondary analysis of a randomized trial and thus is vulnerable to some methodological flaws. We did not validate the STONE score in all patients with suspected ureteral stone, but instead in patients who an attending emergency physician deemed should undergo CT scan imaging. This group likely represents those patients for whom attending emergency physicians have greater uncertainty about the diagnosis of kidney stone or alternative diagnosis compared with those who did not receive imaging. For example, patients deemed at very low risk or at very high risk for kidney stone (ie, classic renal colic in a patient with a history of kidney stones and hematuria) may have been less likely to be included. Also, to assemble a cohort with the available data for the STONE predictors and outcome, we restricted the study to subjects who received CT scan at sites that performed urine dipstick testing, which may have resulted in selection bias. Although this is a limitation of the present study, we believe that there is still value in assessing the STONE score in this population who required CT testing. Physicians' threshold for ordering CT scans for suspected kidney stone has decreased over time: emergency physician use of CT scan has increased 10-fold during the last 15 years, without a significant change in the diagnosis of kidney stone or rates of admission for kidney stone. The patients for whom there is greater diagnostic uncertainty should be the focus of a decision rule that functions to increase diagnostic certainty.

Another limitation is the lack of an assessment of the reliability of the predictor variables. Although we collected data prospectively in the randomized trial, dual assessments were not performed. Although sex, race, and hematuria on urine dipstick test are likely to have high interrater reliability, the presence of nausea or vomiting and the hours since the symptoms began require prospective evaluation. Finally, we sought to address potential measurement bias of the outcome and found that at 2 of the 9 sites, the interobserver agreement of the measurement of the ureteral stone outcome was perfect. We have no reason to believe that measurement bias would exist at the other 7 sites.

### Appropriate use of CT for patients presenting with suspected renal colic: a quality improvement study [^113pnxG3]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Urolithiasis is the process of forming stones along the urinary tracts, including the kidney, bladder and urethra. Acute flank pain due to suspected urolithiasis is a common reason for emergency department (ED) visits, accounting for more than 1 million visits in the USA annually. The estimated lifetime incidence of these urinary stones is 12%, they most commonly presents in patients between 30 and 60 years of age, and they are three times more common in men.

Non-contrast abdominopelvic CT has become the most common initial imaging study for suspected urolithiasis due to its high sensitivity for urinary stone disease, which ranges from 91% to 100%. Unlike other imaging modalities such as ultrasonography (US), CT exposes patients to high levels of ionising radiation with consequent long-term cancer risk. It has been estimated that 14 000 additional cancers in the USA may be attributable to unnecessary abdominal and pelvic CT scans. These avoidable scans can also lead to increased false positives and incidental findings, resulting in unnecessary patient anxiety and inappropriate follow-up interventions, further exacerbating the cycle of unnecessary and potentially harmful care. These interventions additionally contribute to increased system-level costs of acute renal colic, which currently amount to over $5 billion annually in the USA. Furthermore, there is no evidence to show that increased CT use, despite its higher sensitivity, is associated with improved patient outcomes.

While ultrasound has lower sensitivities to visualise urinary stones, it is an alternative imaging modality which may be used to investigate renal colic without exposing patients to ionising radiation. Furthermore, ultrasound can accurately detect hydronephrosis, perinephric fluid and abnormal ureteric jets, which increases the sensitivity for detecting kidney stones when they are too small to be visualised directly. As such, the importance of reducing unnecessary CT imaging for presentations of renal colic is recognised at an international level. In support of choosing wisely (CW), the growing international movement to reduce the overuse of unnecessary medical interventions, the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) released 10 recommendations specifically targeting ED interventions. One of these recommendations was to 'avoid ordering CT of the abdomen and pelvis in young, otherwise healthy emergency department patients (age < 50) with known histories of kidney stones, or ureterolithiasis, presenting with symptoms consistent with uncomplicated renal colic'.

### Derivation and validation of a clinical prediction rule for uncomplicated ureteral stone – the STONE score: retrospective and prospective observational cohort studies [^1155HtyZ]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

CT use in the United States, and public health implications

Since the landmark paper by Smith and colleagues in 1996, CT has become the first line test for kidney stone in the United States. However, despite a 10-fold increase in the utilization of CT scanning for diagnosis of kidney stone from 1996–2007, the proportion of patients with a diagnosis of kidney stone, findings of significant alternative diagnoses, or hospital admission has not changed. This suggests that the increase in CT use for diagnosis of this condition may not be substantially improving patient centered outcomes. Outside of the United States, CT is not necessarily the first line test for suspected kidney stone. In 2011 the European Urology Association released comprehensive guidelines on urolithiasis in which it stated that "ultrasonography should be used as the primary procedure". In 2007, the yearly rate of CT scanning in the United States was nearly 228 per 1000 population — more than double the rate in Canada and nearly four times the rate in the United Kingdom. These data are not specific to imaging in kidney stones and do not include patient outcomes, but the presence of wide regional variation (particularly in a condition that is not life threatening) suggests an opportunity for more appropriate utilization.

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^113kjaSU]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding covariates related to stone history, the number of stones on low-dose noncontrast CT imaging at randomization was associated with a significant increase in total and asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage. The direct association between stone burden and the risk of spontaneous passage is expected and comprehensible. Previous radiographic studies have examined the relationship between the width, length, and location of ureteral stones and the rate of spontaneous passage. In general, these studies have indicated a high likelihood of spontaneous passage for stones ≤ 4 mm in width and ≤ 6 mm in length as well as for stones located in the distal ureter. Thus, factors associated with spontaneous stone passage are well established for ureteral stones but not for kidney stones. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the incidence of asymptomatic spontaneous passage of kidney stones and its association with various clinical parameters.

The strengths of our trial include the prospective, imaging-controlled, multicenter design, and the large sample size. Indeed, this is the largest cohort ever to investigate spontaneous stone clearance in a CT-controlled population of kidney stone formers. CT acquisition was standardized as part of a randomized trial, and both baseline and follow-up CT scans of each participant were performed on the same CT scanner with identical acquisition settings. In addition, the standard operating procedure for the low-dose CT indicated a slice thickness of ≤ 2 mm and a slice increment less than or equal to slice thickness, theoretically minimizing the likelihood of missing very small stones. A very close follow-up (every 3 months) was performed; therefore, underreporting of symptomatic stone events is very unlikely.

This study had some limitations. First, we could not always identify (on a radiological basis) in patients with multiple spontaneous passages in which kidney stones present on CT at randomization passed symptomatically or asymptomatically. Thus, the exact sizes of kidney stones that passed spontaneously have presumably not been documented in a very limited number of stone events. This information would have been useful for identifying the size limit for spontaneous stone passage. Moreover, asymptomatic stone passage could not be excluded for stones potentially formed after the beginning of the study and were, therefore, not present at randomization, although we consider this phenomenon, if present at all, very rare.

### The management of urinary calculi in pregnancy [^113L4Pkb]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

When a pregnant patient presents with a urinary calculus, the customary investigations and management must change in order to take into account the well-being of the developing fetus. Transabdominal or endovaginal ultrasound should be the initial imaging modality used in order to establish the diagnosis. A plain abdominal X-ray, limited intravenous pyelography, or retrograde pyelography is used secondarily if a definitive diagnosis is lacking. The treatment of first choice for urolithiasis in pregnancy is conservative, because 70–80% of stones will pass spontaneously. If conservative management fails, or in cases of sepsis, obstruction of a solitary kidney, or bilateral ureteric obstruction, then surgical intervention is indicated. Traditional surgical management consists of draining the obstructed collecting system with a ureteral stent or percutaneous nephrostomy tube with definitive treatment of the stone in the post-partum period. Ureteroscopic lithotripsy and stone extraction is another option that has been used safely and reliably with increasing frequency in many centers. Despite recent reports of using extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy, this treatment is still considered contraindicated in pregnancy.

### Imaging in suspected renal colic: systematic review of the literature and multispecialty consensus [^111iVYkS]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Renal colic is common, and CT is frequently utilized when the diagnosis of kidney stones is suspected. CT is accurate but exposes patients to ionizing radiation and has not been shown to alter either interventional approaches or hospital admission rates. This multi-organizational transdisciplinary collaboration sought evidence-based, multispecialty consensus on optimal imaging across different clinical scenarios in patients with suspected renal colic in the acute setting.

Methods

In conjunction with the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) eQual network, we formed a nine-member panel with three physician representatives each from ACEP, the ACR, and the American Urology Association. A systematic literature review was used as the basis for a three-step modified Delphi process to seek consensus on optimal imaging in 29 specific clinical scenarios.

Results

From an initial search yielding 6,337 records, there were 232 relevant articles of acceptable evidence quality to guide the literature summary. At the completion of the Delphi process consensus, agreement was rated as perfect in 15 (52%), excellent in 8 (28%), good in 3 (10%), and moderate in 3 (10%) of the 29 scenarios. There were no scenarios where at least moderate consensus was not reached. CT was recommended in 7 scenarios (24%), with ultrasound in 9 (31%) and no further imaging needed in 12 (45%).

Summary

Evidence and multispecialty consensus support ultrasound or no further imaging in specific clinical scenarios, with reduced-radiation dose CT to be employed when CT is needed in patients with suspected renal colic.

### Imaging techniques for stone disease and methods for reducing radiation exposure [^114b33pq]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Imaging plays a critical role in the evaluation of patients with urolithiasis. It is essential for the diagnosis of stones and provides important information to aide in determining the appropriate treatment of renal or ureteral calculi. Imaging for urolithiasis has evolved over the past 30 years. Currently, noncontrast computed tomography remains the first-line imaging modality for the evaluation of patients with suspected urolithiasis. Proper imaging modality selection helps to minimize radiation exposure. Following the principles of As Low As Reasonably Achievable in the operating room can help reduce the amount of radiation patients are exposed to from fluoroscopy.

### An overview of kidney stone imaging techniques [^117GnFPB]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2016). Medium credibility.

Kidney stone imaging is an important diagnostic tool and initial step in deciding which therapeutic options to use for the management of kidney stones. Guidelines provided by the American College of Radiology, American Urological Association, and European Association of Urology differ regarding the optimal initial imaging modality to use to evaluate patients with suspected obstructive nephrolithiasis. Noncontrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis consistently provides the most accurate diagnosis but also exposes patients to ionizing radiation. Traditionally, ultrasonography has a lower sensitivity and specificity than CT, but does not require use of radiation. However, when these imaging modalities were compared in a randomized controlled trial they were found to have equivalent diagnostic accuracy within the emergency department. Both modalities have advantages and disadvantages. Kidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) plain film radiography is most helpful in evaluating for interval stone growth in patients with known stone disease, and is less useful in the setting of acute stones. MRI provides the possibility of 3D imaging without exposure to radiation, but it is costly and currently stones are difficult to visualize. Further developments are expected to enhance each imaging modality for the evaluation and treatment of kidney stones in the near future. A proposed algorithm for imaging patients with acute stones in light of the current guidelines and a randomized controlled trial could aid clinicians.

### The impact of new methods of imaging on radiation dosage delivered to patients [^111dugHq]. Current Opinion in Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Ionizing radiation is produced by many of the imaging studies used in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with urolithiasis. Knowing the small, but significant, risks of solid and hematological malignancies associated with increased radiation exposure, our purpose is to discuss new imaging modalities that limit radiation exposure without compromising the valuable information needed by clinicians for appropriate management.

Recent Findings

Recent studies suggest that many patients with urolithiasis may be subjected to relatively high doses of ionizing radiation during acute stone episodes and throughout the management of their disease, due, in large part, to the rapidly increasing usage of computed tomography (CT). Certain imaging modalities, most notably low-dose CT, have shown promise in reducing radiation dose to patients while maintaining comparable sensitivity and specificity to standard CT, under most conditions.

Summary

Urologists who use radiographic imaging in the care of their patients, must be aware of the risks of ionizing radiation. Accordingly, every effort must be made to limit radiation exposure, especially in the most susceptible populations. In our view, low-dose CT is currently the best imaging modality for patients with urolithiasis, as it offers adequate image quality with much reduced radiation exposure.

### Impact of CT scan in patients with first episode of suspected nephrolithiasis [^112ohaCK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This prospective observational outcome study assessed the impact of helical computed tomography (CT) scan in patients with a first episode of suspected nephrolithiasis. Before CT scanning, Emergency Physicians completed a questionnaire, including diagnostic certainty of nephrolithiasis and anticipated patient disposition. Primary outcome measure was the comparison of physician diagnostic certainty and CT scan results. Secondary outcome measures included alternate diagnoses and changes in patient disposition after CT scan. Four categories grouped the pre-CT diagnostic certainty: 0–49%, 50–74%, 75–90%, and 90–100%. The CT scan found urinary calculi in 28.6%, 45.7%, 74.2%, and 80.5% of patients in each category, respectively. CT scanning revealed alternate diagnoses in 40 cases (33.1%). Of these, 19 (47.5%) included other significant pathology. Before CT scanning, physicians planned to discharge 115 patients and admit six patients. After CT scanning, six of the former group were admitted, and five of the latter group were discharged. Patients presenting with a first episode of clinically suspected nephrolithiasis should undergo CT scanning because it enhances diagnostic certainty by identifying alternate diagnoses not suspected on clinical grounds alone.

### Is the KUB radiograph redundant for investigating acute ureteric colic in the non-contrast enhanced computed tomography era? [^115oxPxE]. Clinical Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

To establish whether non-contrast enhanced computed tomography (NCCT) renders the kidneys-ureters-bladder (KUB) radiograph redundant as the initial imaging investigation for suspected acute ureteric colic.

Materials and Methods

The imaging investigations for 120 patients consecutively admitted to an emergency department-led clinical decisions unit (CDU) with suspected acute ureteric colic were retrospectively reviewed. A multidisciplinary meeting reviewed the findings and recommended that KUB radiographs should not be routinely performed prior to NCCT. Prospective assessment of 116 consecutive patients admitted over a comparable period was then undertaken.

Results

In the retrospective group, 61 (50.8%) patients had calculi to account for symptoms (positive NCCT) and 59 (49.2%) patients did not have stone disease (negative NCCT). Ninety (75%) patients had a KUB radiograph prior to NCCT. However, in 46 (38% of total) of these patients the NCCT was negative for stones, and therefore, they had been subjected to an unnecessary radiographic examination. These results prompted a change in practice. In the subsequent and prospectively studied group, preliminary KUB radiographs were performed in only 6% of the patients, with no significant change in the positive NCCT rate (50.8 versus 51.7%) or the total number of examinations performed (120 versus 116).

Conclusion

NCCT should be the initial imaging examination for acute ureteric colic. Up to 50% of patients with clinical suspicion do not have stone disease, and therefore, preliminary KUB radiographs with attendant radiation and cost implications are unjustified. Preliminary KUB radiographs can be omitted from the imaging pathway with no resultant indication creep or increase in demand for NCCT examinations.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute onset flank pain-suspicion of stone disease (urolithiasis) [^114eahRc]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Noncontrast CT (NCCT) is the imaging study of choice for initial evaluation of patients with acute onset of flank pain and suspicion of stone disease without known prior stone disease. NCCT can reliably characterize the location and size of an offending ureteral calculus, identify complications, and diagnose alternative etiologies of abdominal pain. Although less sensitive in the detection of stones, ultrasound may have a role in evaluating for signs of obstruction. Radiography potentially has a role, although has been shown to be less sensitive than NCCT. For patients with known disease and recurrent symptoms of urolithiasis, NCCT remains the test of choice for evaluation. In pregnancy, given radiation concerns, ultrasound is recommended as the initial modality of choice with potential role for noncontrast MRI. In scenarios where stone disease suspected and initial NCCT is inconclusive, contrast-enhanced imaging, either with MRI or CT/CT urogram may be appropriate. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals.

### Recent finding and new technologies in nephrolitiasis: a review of the recent literature [^111UX3ZG]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Radiation exposure

Patients undergoing diagnostic imaging may receive excessive doses of radiation during initial diagnostic and follow-up evaluations. Renal collecting systems can be illustrated more precisely with the advent of multi-detector row CT through thinner slices, high speed acquisitions, and enhanced longitudinal spatial resolution resulting in improved reformatted coronal images. On the other hand, a significant increase in exposure to ionizing radiation, especially in the radiosensitive organs, such as the gonads, is a concern with the increased utilization of urinary tract CT. Few studies investigated the effective radiation dose associated with an acute stone episode and short-term follow-up. Ferrandino et al. in a single-institution study found that 205 patients received a dose greater than 20 mSv. John et al. found a median radiation dose per stone episode of 5.3 mSv, with higher doses in those with renal stones and those who required CT scans and other interventions. Ferrandino suggests that urologists must be cognizant of the radiation exposure to patients and seek alternative imaging strategies to minimize radiation dosages during acute and long-term stone management. In the US, around 60 million CT scans are performed every year, raising concern about the amount of radiation delivered. Thus different lower-dose radiation protocols were proposed. Results show a high efficacy of lower-dose CT. Unfortunately, studies defined standard and low-dose protocols differently. A standard protocol uses about 180 mAs and low-dose protocol would be performed with about 30 mAs. Furthermore, a major role is played by the slice thickness and therefore the patient's time exposure. But low-dose protocols use thicker slices than standard protocols, raising the risk of failure in detecting smaller stones. Memarsadeghi et al. determined that overlapping 3–5 mm slices could be a sufficient parameter for detection of significant urinary stones. Ciaschini et al. found no significant differences with low dose (−25% and −50%) examinations for the detection of calculi greater than 3 mm. Jellison et. al and Jin et al. compared ultra low dose and conventional computerized tomography protocols for detecting distal ureteral calculi and renal calculi in a cadaveric model. Jellison's ultra low dose computerized tomography protocols detected distal ureteral calculi in a fashion similar to that of conventional computerized tomography protocols in a cadaveric model. These protocols may decrease the radiation dose up to 95%. Jin decreased the tube charge from 100 to 30 mAs, resulted in similar detection of renal stones respect conventional CT. Dose reduction is also important in pediatric settings. The use of the 80 mA setting for all children and 40 mA for children weighing 50 kg or less does not significantly affect the diagnosis of pediatric renal stones.

### Symptomatic and radiographic manifestations of kidney stone recurrence and their prediction by risk factors: a prospective cohort study [^112BcUM6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Meaningful interpretation of changes in radiographic kidney stone burden requires understanding how radiographic recurrence relates to symptomatic recurrence and how established risk factors predict these different manifestations of recurrence.

Methods

We recruited first-time symptomatic stone formers from the general community in Minnesota and Florida. Baseline and 5-year follow-up study visits included computed tomography scans, surveys, and medical record review. We noted symptomatic recurrence detected by clinical care (through chart review) or self-report, and radiographic recurrence of any new stone, stone growth, or stone passage (comparing baseline and follow-up scans). To assess the prediction of different manifestations of recurrence, we used the Recurrence of Kidney Stone (ROKS) score, which sums multiple baseline risk factors.

Results

Among 175 stone formers, 19% had symptomatic recurrence detected by clinical care and 25% detected by self-report; radiographic recurrence manifested as a new stone in 35%, stone growth in 24%, and stone passage in 27%. Among those with a baseline asymptomatic stone (54%), at 5 years, 51% had radiographic evidence of stone passage (accompanied by symptoms in only 52%). Imaging evidence of a new stone or stone passage more strongly associated with symptomatic recurrence detected by clinical care than by self-report. The ROKS score weakly predicted one manifestation-symptomatic recurrence resulting in clinical care (c -statistic, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.73)-but strongly predicted any manifestation of symptomatic or radiographic recurrence (5-year rate, 67%; c -statistic, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.86).

Conclusions

Recurrence after the first stone episode is both more common and more predictable when all manifestations of recurrence (symptomatic and radiographic) are considered.

### Appropriate use of CT for patients presenting with suspected renal colic: a quality improvement study [^115TQTBA]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Our initial audit found that 27% of patients under the age of 50 years presenting with uncomplicated, recurrent renal colic received CT imaging, suggesting non-adherence with an ACEP CW recommendation. Importantly, none of the patients who received CT imaging during our audit period demonstrated significant findings warranting hospital admission or leading to identifiable changes in management plans in the ED. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients referred to outpatient urology in either study group.

Our patient demographics and presenting complaints are similar to those reported in the literature, suggesting that our study population represented typical patients presenting to the ED with renal colic. Our audit did not have the statistical power to perform meaningful subgroup analyses, however, certain trends were noted. Patients who had presented to an ED with renal colic or flank pain in the last 30 days were less likely to undergo CT imaging during their second presentation. Presumably, on their initial visit, many of these patients had received imaging which was able to identify a stone, and were thus less likely to receive CT imaging at their return visit. It was also noted that the patient group that received CT imaging was given more narcotic analgesia, suggesting that the perceived severity of a patient's pain may have also influenced the decision to order CT imaging.

### Derivation and validation of a clinical prediction rule for uncomplicated ureteral stone – the STONE score: retrospective and prospective observational cohort studies [^115Esah5]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Kidney stones are estimated to occur at some point in nearly 1 in 11 people in the United States, with flank or kidney pain resulting in over two million annual visits to the emergency department. Computed tomography (CT) has been described as the "best imaging study to confirm the diagnosis of a urinary stone" and is now the first line imaging study for suspected kidney stone in the United States. Though accurate, CT is costly, involves the use of ionizing radiation, and does not seem to have impacted patient centered outcomes, such as rates of diagnosis or hospital admission, in those with suspected kidney stones.

Many patients with flank pain will not benefit from a CT scan, as most kidney stones will pass spontaneously. Moreover, it is unlikely that a CT scan in the setting of flank pain will detect acutely important alternative findings in patients without signs of infection. Hence an objective clinical prediction rule for renal colic that could reliably identify patients highly likely to have a ureteral stone (and thus unlikely to have an important alternative diagnosis) may allow patients to be safely managed without imaging, or imaged with other approaches such as ultrasonography or reduced dose CT.

We derived and validated a clinical prediction score for ureteral stones that cause symptoms, identifying patients with either a very high or a very low probability of having an uncomplicated ureteral stone. We hypothesized that patients who are highly likely to have a kidney stone are unlikely to harbor an important alternative diagnosis, and may be appropriate for imaging choices other than standard dose CT.

Treatment of adult patients with ureteral stones — initial management states that patients with uncomplicated ureteral stones ≤ 10 mm should be offered observation, and those with distal stones of similar size should be offered MET with α-blockers (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade B). Clinicians should offer reimaging to patients prior to surgery if passage of stones is suspected or if stone movement will change management, with reimaging focused on the region of interest and limiting radiation exposure to uninvolved regions (Clinical Principle). In most patients, if observation with or without MET is not successful after four to six weeks and/or the patient/clinician decide to intervene sooner based on a shared decision making approach, clinicians should offer definitive stone treatment (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C).

### Integration and utilization of modern technologies in nephrolithiasis research [^111YGNN9]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2016). Medium credibility.

Nephrolithiasis, or stones, is one of the oldest urological diseases, with descriptions and treatment strategies dating back to ancient times. Despite the enormous number of patients affected by stones, a surprising lack of conceptual understanding of many aspects of this disease still exists. This lack of understanding includes mechanisms of stone formation and retention, the clinical relevance of different stone compositions and that of formation patterns and associated pathological features to the overall course of the condition. Fortunately, a number of new tools are available to assist in answering such questions. New renal endoscopes enable kidney visualization in much higher definition than was previously possible, while micro-CT imaging is the optimal technique for assessment of stone microstructure and mineral composition in a nondestructive fashion. Together, these tools have the potential to provide novel insights into the aetiology of stone formation that might unlock new prevention and treatment strategies, and enable more effective management of patients with nephrolithiasis.

### Does diagnosis change as a result of repeat renal colic computed tomography scan in patients with a history of kidney stones? [^112S7A7K]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We sought to determine the incidence of alternative diagnosis in patients with a history of kidney stones who experience recurrent symptoms and undergo repeat computed tomography (CT) imaging at their return to the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review of ED patients at a tertiary care hospital. Inclusion criteria were all adult ED patients who received a repeat CT for renal colic, after having previously received the diagnosis of obstructive kidney stone confirmed by CT, in our ED. Patients were identified by reviewing the charts of those patients with repeat visits to the ED after January 1, 2004, in which they complained of symptoms suggestive of renal colic and received a CT scan. We determined the frequency of the same diagnosis on repeat CT scan in this population compared with the frequency of alternative diagnosis.

Results

Two hundred thirty-one patients met criteria for the study. Fifty-nine percent were male. One hundred eighty-nine (81.8%) patients had no change in diagnosis as a result of a repeat renal colic CT scan. Twenty-seven (11.6%) patients received an alternative diagnosis that did not require urgent intervention, and 15 (6.5%) patients received a diagnosis that did require an urgent intervention.

Conclusion

Repeat CT imaging of patients with known nephrolithiasis changed management in a minority of patients (6.5%). Knowing the frequency of alternative diagnosis in this population may help clinicians and patients balance the risks and benefits of repeat renal colic CT scans in patients with a history of kidney stones who return to the ED with similar symptoms.

### Appropriate use of CT for patients presenting with suspected renal colic: a quality improvement study [^112QGRC2]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Our QI initiative faced several other challenges during implementation. A urologist was consulted as part of our team of stakeholders and had some concerns about the initiative, as it would result in more referrals to the urology service without CT imaging. These scans can be useful to urologists in clinic to help guide management decisions following an ED visit, and it required further discussions to get stakeholder buy-in. Through explanation of risks and benefits, and reviewing the literature around this specific presentation, our stakeholder team became more engaged with the goal of reducing the number of scans.

Although there was only a modest reduction in the number of CT scans ordered on young patients with recurrent renal colic, the greatest gain from this QI initiative was introduction of the 'CT renal stone low dose'. It allowed a separate electronic order for a low-dose CT scan to be created, embedding the CW recommendation as a reminder and facilitated using the lowest dose of ionising radiation for patients with suspected renal colic. Usability testing was carried out on this new embedded order, and changes were made based on feedback. After integration into our EMR system, it took several weeks for physicians to consistently order the correct CT for presumed renal colic, instead of a full-dose CT scan of abdomen and pelvis. Adherence was monitored through audit and feedback was provided to clinicians. After this period, most physicians readily adapted to the new CT order for presumed renal colic, as it did not significantly alter their workflow. The data continue to show a modest decrease in the use of CT scans in patients aged < 50 years with recurrent renal colic. Emergency physicians continue to consistently use the CT renal stone low-dose order when ordering a CT scan for suspected renal colic.

### Metabolic evaluation of first-time and recurrent stone formers [^111XZEdr]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Evaluation of stone formers should include careful attention to medications, past medical history, social history, family history, dietary evaluation, occupation, and laboratory evaluation. Laboratory evaluation requires at least serum chemistries and urinalysis. Twenty-four-hour urine collections are most appropriate for patients with recurrent stones or complex medical histories. However, these collections may be appropriate for some first-time stone formers, including those with comorbidities or large stones. Although twin studies demonstrate that heritability accounts for at least 50% of the kidney stone phenotype, the responsible genes are not clearly identified, and so genetic testing is rarely indicated.

### Ultrasound use in urinary stones: adapting old technology for a modern-day disease [^114S3Y4Y]. Journal of Endourology (2017). Low credibility.

Ultrasound has become a mainstay tool in urologists' armamentarium for the diagnosis and management of nephrolithiasis. From starting as a rudimentary form of imaging, it has come to play a more prominent role over time, paralleling evolution in ultrasound technology. Throughout the medical community there is a growing emphasis on reducing the amount of ionizing radiation delivered to patients during routine imaging. As such there has been a resurgence of interest in ultrasound given its lack of associated radiation exposure and proven effectiveness as a diagnostic and therapeutic imaging modality. Herein, we provide a review of the history of ultrasound, how the use of ultrasound is expanding in both diagnosis and treatment of urinary stone disease, and finally how promising applications of ultrasound are shaping the future of kidney stone management.

Surgical Management of Stones — imaging for complex stones or anatomy: In patients with complex stones or anatomy, clinicians may obtain additional contrast imaging if further definition of the collecting system and the ureteral anatomy is needed (Conditional recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C), and when treating a complex stone burden or patient with complex anatomy a clinician may obtain additional contrast-enhanced imaging with urographic phases to help determine the best treatment approach; CT and IVU are the most useful IV contrast studies, and MR urography can be useful in defining anatomy during pregnancy (without contrast) and in the setting of IV contrast allergy, although stones are typically not well visualized directly with MR imaging.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^1158TN5x]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — medical management of kidney stones — scope and evidence base: The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis, prevention and follow-up of adult patients with kidney stones based on the best available published literature. The primary source of evidence was the systematic review conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) on recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults, and to augment the AHRQ report the AUA conducted supplementary searches for articles published from 2007 through 2012 that were systematically reviewed using a methodology developed a priori; in total, these sources yielded 46 studies that were used to form evidence-based guideline statements. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional statements were developed as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions. Guideline statements were created to inform clinicians regarding the use of a screening evaluation for first-time and recurrent stone formers, the appropriate initiation of a metabolic evaluation in select patients and recommendations for the initiation and follow-up of medication and/or dietary measures in specific patients. Kidney stone disease burden is highlighted as affecting nearly 1 in 11 individuals in the United States and as likely to recur, with at least 50% of individuals experiencing another stone within 10 years of the first occurrence. The guideline statements offered in this document provide a simple, evidence-based approach to identify high-risk or interested stone-forming patients for whom medical and dietary therapy based on metabolic testing and close follow-up is likely to be effective in reducing stone recurrence.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hydronephrosis on prior imaging-unknown cause [^116eF3kd]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Initial imaging evaluation of hydronephrosis of unknown etiology is a complex subject and is dependent on clinical context. In asymptomatic patients, it is often best conducted via CT urography (CTU) without and with contrast, MR urography (MRU) without and with contrast, or scintigraphic evaluation with mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) imaging. For symptomatic patients, CTU without and with contrast, MRU without and with contrast, MAG3 scintigraphy, or ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder with Doppler imaging are all viable initial imaging studies. In asymptomatic pregnant patients, nonionizing imaging with US of the kidneys and bladder with Doppler imaging is preferred. Similarly, in symptomatic pregnant patients, US of the kidneys and bladder with Doppler imaging or MRU without contrast is the imaging study of choice, as both ionizing radiation and gadolinium contrast are avoided in pregnancy. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### CT for the evaluation of flank pain [^1157qAsw]. Journal of Endourology (2001). Low credibility.

Unenhanced helical CT allows rapid and accurate determination of whether a stone is present anywhere in the urinary tract. There is a learning curve for both radiologist and urologist, but a number of signs are highly predictive of stone. Helical CT scans should always be accompanied by a "scoutogram" to convey an idea of what the stone might look like. The scan requires no contrast medium and takes only 5 to 10 minutes of imaging time, making it cost effective. It behooves both urologists and radiologists to familiarize themselves with the techniques for reading these scans.

### Appropriate use of CT for patients presenting with suspected renal colic: a quality improvement study [^116CUwKX]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

The varied approach to diagnostic imaging of renal colic in our ED demonstrated by this audit is corroborated by other similar studies. Interestingly, a recent report released by the Canadian Institute for Health Information estimated that up to 30% of patients identified by CW Canada recommendations underwent unnecessary investigations. With 27% of our audit population receiving unnecessary imaging, we reached a similar figure.

Our QI initiative involved meeting with stakeholders, standardising a decision-making tool, implementing reminders on the electronic record, and creating a unique low-dose order for CT scans for renal colic. For the first intervention, a validated decision tool to guide treatment of suspected renal colic was introduced to clinicians and integrated into the EMR. This prediction tool, the STONE score, includes five factors which were found to be most predictive of urolithiasis: male sex, non-black race, short duration of pain (< 6 hours), presence of nausea or vomiting, and microscopic haematuria. Moore et al recommend that CT imaging be avoided for patients who score high on this validated tool, and report it could help guide shared decision-making regarding imaging for renal colic. Unfortunately, during our study period, this decision-making tool was infrequently used by clinicians and therefore it was difficult to standardise CT ordering for presumed renal colic. Most physicians did not adopt regular use of this tool, preferring to rely on their own clinical judgement to determine the likelihood of renal colic. While use of this tool was available on an electronic platform that is regularly used during ED workflow, possible next steps could involve incorporating it into the EMR as a force function to encourage physicians to calculate a score and reconsider their imaging order as needed.

### Imaging patients with renal colic-consider ultrasound first [^116GoTVw]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Why use US first?

The possibility of obtaining a diagnosis using US in patients with suspected renal colic has several advantages including its widespread availability and reduced cost over the use of CT. Most importantly, the use of an algorithm in which US is used first can avoid radiation exposure in about 70% of cases. Furthermore, as underlined by Catalano et al. and Ripolles et al. it seems safe to use this diagnostic technique even if it is known to have a lower sensitivity than CT in this field. In fact, in both studies, spontaneous passage of the stone within a few days after the acute episode was observed in all patients with a false-negative US examination. In addition, a recent multicentre study clearly described the primary role of US in the investigation of renal colic today, demonstrating that the initial use of US is not associated with more complications, serious adverse events or hospitalisations than the initial evaluation with CT. It must also be remembered that in patients in whom symptoms are not due to a renal colic US also has the ability to identify alternative diagnoses, albeit with a slightly lower sensitivity than CT, and that most of the important, life-threatening situations that may mimic renal colic can be recognised.

Nonetheless, US also has a few disadvantages: it may take longer to perform than nonenhanced CT and must be performed by an experienced examiner. The first of these limitations cannot be justified within the framework of the justification process of diagnostic studies using ionising radiation; radiologists are strongly advised to use alternative, non-ionising techniques whenever possible. The second limitation may be difficult to overcome, especially if service is to be provided 24/24 h and 7/7 days. However, Dalla Palma et al. have shown that high sensitivity results can be obtained in well-hydrated patients by general radiologists on call who are not specifically dedicated to US. The performance of US studies by radiologists also has an impact on the need for additional imaging techniques as demonstrated in the multicentre study of Smith-Bindman, in which 40.7% of the patients initially evaluated with US by emergency physicians, and only 27% of the patients initially evaluated by radiologists underwent additional CT.

### Emergency department visits, use of imaging, and drugs for urolithiasis have increased in the United States [^111FWqw6]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

The reasons for the increased use of advanced radiologic evaluations in the ED for urolithiasis patients are unclear and cannot be determined from the study database. They may include increased sensitivity and specificity of CT evaluation for urolithiasis, pressures related to fear of medical malpractice claims, and patient demand. Physician time pressures, increased reliance on technology, and use of radiologic techniques as default measures for consultation gateways and admission decisions may constitute incentives to lower the threshold for use of such tests. Although CT evaluation can locate a stone and assess hydronephrosis, the clinical decision-making for a urolithiasis patient, especially a recurrent stone former, in the absence of radiologic assessment is often straightforward. After evaluation of flank pain by physical examination and exclusion of other causes of abdominal pain, urinalysis can suggest infection, and hydration and provision of analgesics can be instituted. This is especially true in patients with a history of urolithiasis. If a stone is not passed during a follow-up observation period, radiologic assessment can then proceed, perhaps with an ultrasound. The proper balance between traditional physical examination and use of advanced radiologic techniques in patients with suspected urolithiasis is uncertain, in part, because of the lack of evidence and practice guidelines to inform clinical approaches for such patients.

Imaging appropriateness during the audit period

During the audit period, adherence in our ED for the CW recommendation to avoid CT imaging in patients under the age of 50 years presenting with uncomplicated, recurrent renal colic was 46/63 (73%). Many patients who met criteria for this recommendation had received multiple CT scans in the past for renal colic. 9.5% (6/63) of our patients had received a total of 3 or more CT scans specifically for renal colic. Notably, one patient had received 13 prior CT scans to investigate renal colic.

For patients who did not receive CT imaging, the alternative imaging modalities that were used are displayed in figure 2.

Imaging appropriateness during the QI period

In the baseline audit from December 2015 to May 2016, 27% of individuals in our study population received unnecessary CT imaging. In the months before the QI project, however, the rates were higher at a baseline of 37%. Interventions were first implemented in December 2016 and then in May 2017. Over a 15-month period, utilisation of inappropriate CT imaging for these patients showed a modest decrease to 29%, displayed in figure 3. September 2017 was an aberrant month with 100% of patients in our study population receiving unnecessary CT imaging. This was due to a very low number of these patients presenting to the ED that month, and all had a CT scan. There was a corresponding increase in the utilisation of ultrasounds for patients with recurrent renal colic and no significant increase in the number of KUB X-rays performed. There were no patients diagnosed with renal colic that returned to the ED within 14 days with an alternate diagnosis.

### Imaging patients with renal colic-consider ultrasound first [^115UkMsG]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

When to use imaging in renal colic

The diagnosis of renal colic is usually based on clinical grounds and immediate imaging is not always necessary. However, it is now common practice to perform imaging studies in all patients with suspected renal colic admitted to the Emergency Department. This may be due to fear of missing a life-threatening condition mimicking this condition, such as rupture of an aortic aneurysm, ovarian torsion or appendicitis, or to the need for imaging confirmation of the cause of symptoms before deciding on whether a patient may be discharged. At present, additional strong indications for imaging are the desire of patients to know the cause of their symptoms and the fear of litigation. If not in all patients, immediate imaging modalities are necessary in patients without clinical improvement after treatment, in cases with fever or leukocytosis, or in some special circumstances (i.e. patients with a single kidney and/or renal failure); furthermore, imaging is also recommended in patients with remission of symptoms who do not eliminate the stone within a few days.

### Does computed tomographic scan affect diagnosis and management of patients with suspected renal colic? [^115LziJq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with renal colic commonly present to the emergency department (ED) and are usually treated with analgesics, antiemetics and hydration. Computed tomographic (CT) scan is commonly utilized in evaluating patients with suspected renal colic.

Objectives

We compared diagnosis and treatment plans before and after CT in patients with suspected renal colic with the aim to evaluate how often changes in diagnosis, treatment and disposition are made.

Methods

In this prospective observational study, we enrolled a convenience sample of clinically Stable ED patients older than 17 with suspected renal colic for whom CT was planned. Exclusion criteria were: chronic kidney disease, urinary tract infection, recent CT and history of previous kidney stone. Pre-CT and Post-CT surveys were completed by the treating provider.

Results

The discharge diagnosis was renal colic in 62 of 93 enrolled patients (67%). Urinalysis showed blood in 52 of these patients (84%). CT confirmed obstructing kidney or bladder stone in 50 patients. There were five cases of alternative diagnoses noted on CT scan. After CT scan, 7 patients had changes in disposition. Sixteen providers felt that CT would not change management. In these cases, CT offered no alternative diagnosis and didn't change disposition.

Conclusion

CT scan didn't change management when providers did not expect it would. This indicates that providers who are confident with the diagnosis of renal colic should consider forgoing a CT scan. CT scan did occasionally find important alternative diagnoses and should be utilized when providers are considering other concerning pathology.
