## Question

Treatment for aterosclerotic change in femoral arteries

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating atherosclerotic change in the femoral arteries. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and disease distribution across femoral segments. Then, I should verify the universal foundation of medical therapy and risk factor modification. Next, I will examine segment-specific strategies for the common femoral artery versus the superficial femoral artery, including when surgery or endovascular therapy is preferred. After that, I should review lesion-specific modifiers such as length, calcification, and bifurcation involvement. Finally, I will integrate patient-specific factors, surveillance, and emerging therapies, and close with a concise decision framework that aligns with guidelines and contemporary evidence [^notfound].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and anatomic distinctions, because treatment hinges on which femoral segment is involved and how symptoms present. Femoral atherosclerosis spans the common femoral artery at the groin, the superficial femoral artery through the thigh, and the profunda femoris as a critical collateral outflow; presentation ranges from asymptomatic PAD to intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia, and femoral plaques often exhibit more fibrosis and calcification than coronary plaques, which affects device selection and durability [^116gSZ8r] [^113sySye] [^116aKQ4Z].

> I need to ensure the universal foundation is solid before discussing interventions. High-intensity statin therapy, antiplatelet therapy, strict blood pressure control, diabetes optimization, smoking cessation, and supervised exercise are first-line for all patients with PAD and should be initiated and intensified irrespective of revascularization plans; these reduce cardiovascular events and can improve walking distance, though limb-specific benefit may be limited in advanced disease, and guideline-directed medical therapy remains the cornerstone [^11281T8D] [^116aKQ4Z] [^116HPkNy] [^116UfGTc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about revascularization thresholds; I should confirm when symptoms warrant escalation. For claudication, a trial of at least 3 months of supervised exercise and optimized medical therapy is recommended before invasive therapy, and any intervention should offer a reasonable likelihood of sustained benefit, typically framed as a greater than 50% chance of improvement lasting at least 2 years; for CLI with rest pain or tissue loss, urgent revascularization is indicated to salvage limb and life [^117DXtsq] [^116HPkNy] [^114TmkPY].

> Now, let me consider the common femoral artery specifically, because this is where practice patterns differ from more distal femoropopliteal disease. The prevailing standard remains open common femoral endarterectomy with patch angioplasty given its proven durability and the mechanical demands at the groin; stenting in the CFA is generally discouraged due to flexion-related fracture and failure risk, and guidelines recommend surgical endarterectomy as first-line when CFA disease is hemodynamically significant, reserving endovascular options for high surgical risk or hostile groins [^112S7EdG] [^1176cLrT] [^112vo7Z3].

> Wait, let me verify the evolving endovascular role in CFA disease, because newer data suggest a niche. Contemporary series and reviews show that carefully selected CFA lesions — particularly focal, nonocclusive, and without heavy bifurcation calcification — can be treated endovascularly with acceptable short-term outcomes, and a meaningful proportion of surgical candidates may be anatomically suitable for endovascular therapy; however, long-term durability remains uncertain and randomized comparisons with surgery are still needed, so endovascular CFA interventions should remain selective and individualized [^111nVPTw] [^113SFqnS] [^113933Yb].

> I should double-check the hybrid strategy when iliac inflow and CFA disease coexist. Combining iliac stenting with femoral endarterectomy yields high technical success and excellent mid-term patency while avoiding the morbidity of full aortofemoral bypass, and is favored when disease extends from the iliac segment into the CFA or when a conduit-based bypass would be excessive for the anatomic pattern [^117F175j] [^1176cLrT].

> Next, I will examine the superficial femoral artery, where endovascular therapy is often first-line for focal disease. For short lesions under about 5 cm, plain balloon angioplasty is reasonable; for longer or more complex segments, drug-coated balloons or drug-eluting stents improve patency compared with bare metal stents or angioplasty alone, though absolute differences attenuate over time and lesion factors matter greatly; cutting or scoring balloons can help in resistant fibrocalcific lesions, but evidence is mixed and device selection should be tailored to morphology [^112J68Ab] [^115zYWNA] [^114kbs7h].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of surgery in SFA disease because durability can favor bypass in selected patients. In patients with long, heavily calcified, or small-caliber SFA disease, especially when good autologous vein is available and operative risk is acceptable, femoropopliteal bypass with saphenous vein can provide superior long-term patency to endovascular therapy; randomized and guideline data support considering surgical bypass when endovascular durability is likely to be limited by anatomy [^112v2WKt] [^112J68Ab].

> Let me think about lesion-specific modifiers that change the calculus. Severe circumferential calcification impairs balloon expansion and increases dissection risk; intravascular lithotripsy can modify calcified plaque to facilitate dilation and drug delivery, and when combined with drug-coated balloons may reduce reintervention, though longer-term CFA-specific data are still maturing; bifurcation involvement at the femoral bifurcation complicates endovascular strategies and strengthens the case for surgery; long-segment disease generally has worse endovascular durability and may tilt toward surgery in good-risk patients [^116h6VCV] [^113dBMiP] [^114jqNcc].

> I need to ensure patient-specific factors are integrated, not just anatomy. High surgical risk, advanced age, frailty, or hostile groin anatomy may favor an endovascular-first approach even in CFA disease, whereas younger patients with long life expectancy and favorable anatomy may benefit from the durability of surgical reconstruction; shared decision-making is essential, and I should confirm that expectations for functional gain and procedural risk are aligned before proceeding [^117DXtsq] [^117TWhFc].

> Next, I should review surveillance and post-procedural medical therapy, because durability depends on both technical success and secondary prevention. After any revascularization, high-intensity statin, antiplatelet therapy, blood pressure and glycemic control, smoking cessation, and structured exercise should be continued and reinforced; duplex ultrasound surveillance at 6 and 12 months and then annually can detect restenosis early, and antiplatelet therapy improves graft patency after bypass, particularly for synthetic conduits [^115VgGpf] [^114nkyMU].

> But wait, what about emerging therapies that might reshape practice. Noninvasive high-intensity focused ultrasound has early human feasibility data in femoral PAD without major complications, yet efficacy signals are limited and this remains investigational; similarly, bioresorbable scaffolds and percutaneous bypass concepts are under study and may expand options for complex femoropopliteal disease in the future, so I should frame these as promising but not standard of care today [^111Vb1C3] [^115zYWNA].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize a practical decision framework to ensure nothing is missed. First, confirm diagnosis and symptom severity with ABI and, if intervention is planned, obtain high-quality anatomic imaging with CTA, MRA, or duplex to define inflow, lesion length, calcification, and bifurcation involvement; second, optimize medical therapy and supervised exercise for claudication and proceed directly to revascularization for CLI; third, for CFA disease, default to endarterectomy unless risk or anatomy favors endovascular therapy or a hybrid approach; fourth, for SFA disease, favor endovascular therapy for focal lesions and consider surgery for long, calcified, or small-caliber segments when vein conduit and acceptable risk are present; finally, embed surveillance and risk factor optimization into long-term care to preserve patency and reduce cardiovascular events [^1147kwLS] [^11281T8D] [^117DXtsq].

Treatment of atherosclerotic change in the femoral artery centers on **risk factor modification** [^11281T8D] and **supervised exercise therapy** [^116HPkNy] for all patients, with **revascularization** reserved for lifestyle-limiting claudication or critical limb ischemia [^113BZUuv]. For the common femoral artery, **endarterectomy with patch angioplasty** is the gold standard [^112S7EdG] due to superior durability [^114SNdUK], though endovascular options (balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloons, atherectomy) are increasingly used in high-risk or carefully selected patients [^1122xo6f] [^111nVPTw]. For superficial femoral artery disease, **endovascular therapy** is first-line [^112J68Ab] (balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloons, drug-eluting stents) for most lesions, with surgical bypass reserved for long, heavily calcified, or failed endovascular cases [^112J68Ab]. Antiplatelet therapy [^116aKQ4Z] and high-intensity statins [^notfound] are essential to reduce cardiovascular events and improve patency [^111BEbUX].

---

## Medical management

Medical therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for femoral artery atherosclerosis, aimed at **reducing cardiovascular risk** [^116aKQ4Z] and **improving symptoms**.

---

### Risk factor modification

- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended to reduce progression and improve outcomes [^112N3QA6].

- **Lipid-lowering therapy**: High-intensity statins are recommended to lower LDL cholesterol and reduce cardiovascular events [^111BEbUX] [^1168BBno].

- **Antihypertensive therapy**: Blood pressure control is essential to reduce cardiovascular risk [^116aKQ4Z].

- **Glycemic control**: Tight control of diabetes mellitus is recommended [^116aKQ4Z].

---

### Antiplatelet therapy

Antiplatelet therapy with **aspirin or clopidogrel** reduces cardiovascular events and improves patency after interventions [^115VgGpf].

---

### Exercise therapy

Supervised exercise programs are recommended to improve walking distance and quality of life in patients with intermittent claudication [^116HPkNy].

---

## Endovascular interventions

Endovascular therapy has become the **preferred initial approach** for many femoral artery lesions due to its minimally invasive nature and favorable short-term outcomes [^111b7UqT].

---

### Balloon angioplasty

Balloon angioplasty is effective for short, focal lesions in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and common femoral artery (CFA) [^notfound]. It provides acceptable short-term patency but has higher restenosis rates compared to other modalities [^116zRk8S].

---

### Drug-coated balloons (DCB)

Drug-coated balloons deliver antiproliferative agents (e.g. paclitaxel) to reduce restenosis [^114dTbdJ]. They are particularly effective in the SFA and popliteal arteries, providing superior patency compared to plain balloon angioplasty [^notfound].

---

### Drug-eluting stents (DES)

Drug-eluting stents provide sustained antiproliferative drug delivery, reducing restenosis and improving patency in the SFA and popliteal arteries [^115zYWNA]. They are particularly useful for longer lesions and those with high restenosis risk [^115zYWNA].

---

### Atherectomy

Atherectomy devices (directional, rotational, laser) are useful for debulking heavily calcified or fibrotic lesions, particularly in the CFA and SFA [^117XXJQj]. They are often combined with drug-coated balloons to optimize outcomes [^117XXJQj].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgical bypass remains the **gold standard** for certain anatomically complex or long-segment lesions, particularly in the CFA [^114SNdUK].

---

### Common femoral artery endarterectomy

Common femoral artery endarterectomy with patch angioplasty is the preferred treatment for significant CFA disease [^111Po4Ko]. It offers excellent long-term patency and durability, particularly in patients with extensive calcification or bifurcation involvement [^113dBMiP] [^113H7drd].

---

### Femoropopliteal bypass grafting

Femoropopliteal bypass grafting is recommended for long-segment SFA disease, particularly when endovascular therapy has failed or is not feasible [^112J68Ab]. Autologous saphenous vein grafts are preferred due to superior patency rates compared to prosthetic grafts [^113H7drd].

---

## Hybrid procedures

Hybrid procedures combine endovascular and surgical techniques, particularly useful for **multilevel disease** or lesions extending across the femoral bifurcation [^117F175j]. They offer the benefits of both minimally invasive and open approaches, optimizing outcomes in complex anatomies [^117F175j].

---

## Emerging therapies

Several **emerging therapies** are under investigation, including:

- **Bioresorbable scaffolds**: Designed to provide temporary support and then dissolve, potentially reducing long-term complications [^notfound].

- **Gene and cell-based therapies**: Aimed at promoting angiogenesis and improving limb perfusion [^112Dbtut].

- **Non-invasive focused ultrasound**: Early studies suggest potential for non-invasive treatment of femoral artery atherosclerosis, though further research is needed [^111Vb1C3].

---

## Complications and outcomes

Endovascular interventions carry risks of restenosis, thrombosis, and embolization, whereas surgical interventions carry risks of infection, graft failure, and perioperative morbidity [^112CofoD]. Overall, **endovascular therapy** offers favorable short-term outcomes with lower perioperative morbidity, while **surgical bypass** provides superior long-term patency in selected patients [^112v2WKt].

---

Treatment of atherosclerotic change in the femoral artery requires a **multidisciplinary approach**, combining medical therapy, endovascular interventions, and surgical procedures. The choice of treatment depends on lesion characteristics, patient comorbidities, and clinical presentation, with endovascular therapy increasingly used as the initial approach and surgery reserved for complex cases or endovascular failure.

Conclusion and future developments

Recent advances in endovascular technology allow the treatment of a variety of CFA atherosclerotic lesions, avoiding some of the potential complications of open surgery. Three advances in endovascular technology may help clinicians with minimally invasive treatment of the CFA. Results from ongoing RCTs are awaited to assess the clinical efficacy and effectiveness of these strategies.

### A proteomic atlas of the neointima identifies novel druggable targets for preventive therapy [^116V9cWe]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases, in particular atherosclerosis of coronary, carotid, or peripheral arteries, are the leading cause of death worldwide. Restoration of blood flow often requires interventional treatment including balloon angioplasty and stenting of coronary, carotid, or peripheral arteries. Such procedures frequently lead to formation of sub-endothelial scars, known as neointima. Neointima formation can become a critical disease itself, when it massively reduces blood flow in the context of restenosis. Depending on the underlying pathology, location and type of intervention, the incidence of restenosis ranges between 6% and 40%, which thereby becomes the most relevant limitation of interventional treatment of atherosclerotic lesions. Importantly, restenosis also influences prognosis: in comparison to patients not suffering from restenosis, patients with restenosis display a higher mortality. Better therapeutic strategies to prevent neointima formation are therefore of major clinical importance.

While the proteome of atherosclerosis has been studied before, – 8 there are few proteomic studies of vascular injury 9, 10 and no unbiased analysis following acute injury to mature neointima formation. To detect key drivers of vascular remodelling and to develop new strategies for prevention and therapy of restenosis, we here set out to study time-resolved proteomic changes in single femoral arteries following vascular injury.

### Distinct inflammatory pathways shape atherosclerosis in different vascular beds [^113sySye]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies suggest varying atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevalence across arterial beds. Factors such as smoking expedite ASCVD progression in the abdominal aorta, while diabetes accelerates plaque development in lower limb arteries, and hypertension plays a significant role in ASCVD development in the coronary and carotid arteries. Moreover, superficial femoral atherosclerosis advances slower compared with atherosclerosis in coronary and carotid arteries. Furthermore, femoral atherosclerosis exhibits higher levels of ossification and calcification, but lower cholesterol concentrations compared with atherosclerotic lesions of other vascular beds. Such disparities exemplify the diverse progression of ASCVD across arterial beds, pointing towards differential mechanistic pathways in each vascular bed. Hence, this review summarizes current literature on immune-inflammatory mechanisms in various arterial beds in ASCVD to advance our understanding of this disease in an aging society with increased need of vascular bed and patient-specific treatment options.

### SCAI expert consensus statement for femoral-popliteal arterial intervention appropriate use [^114jqNcc]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Medium credibility.

SCAI femoral–popliteal intervention — stenosis severity and clinical considerations state that severe FP disease is defined as a stenosis diameter of ≥ 70%, moderate lesions are defined as 50%–69%, and mild lesions are < 50%; severity is also affected by lesion length, reference vessel diameter, arterial calcification, and quantity of atherosclerotic plaque (plaque burden). Categories of Appropriate Care, May Be Appropriate Care, and Rarely Appropriate Care were assigned by a consensus panel based on the best available evidence, and these clinical scenarios assume that life‑style limiting claudication has been refractory to pharmacologic therapy and a walking program, preferably supervised.

### Chapter IV: treatment of critical limb ischaemia [^114SNdUK]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Recommendations stated in the TASC II guidelines for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) regard a heterogeneous group of patients ranging from claudicants to critical limb ischaemia (CLI) patients. However, specific considerations apply to CLI patients. An important problem regarding the majority of currently available literature that reports on revascularisation strategies for PAD is that it does not focus on CLI patients specifically and studies them as a minor part of the complete cohort. Besides the lack of data on CLI patients, studies use a variety of endpoints, and even similar endpoints are often differentially defined. These considerations result in the fact that most recommendations in this guideline are not of the highest recommendation grade. In the present chapter the treatment of CLI is not based on the TASC II classification of atherosclerotic lesions, since definitions of atherosclerotic lesions are changing along the fast development of endovascular techniques, and inter-individual differences in interpretation of the TASC classification are problematic. Therefore we propose a classification merely based on vascular area of the atherosclerotic disease and the lesion length, which is less complex and eases the interpretation. Lesions and their treatment are discussed from the aorta downwards to the infrapopliteal region. For a subset of lesions, surgical revascularisation is still the gold standard, such as in extensive aorto-iliac lesions, lesions of the common femoral artery and long lesions of the superficial femoral artery (> 15 cm), especially when an applicable venous conduit is present, because of higher patency and limb salvage rates, even though the risk of complications is sometimes higher than for endovascular strategies. It is however more and more accepted that an endovascular first strategy is adapted in most iliac, superficial femoral, and in some infrapopliteal lesions. The newer endovascular techniques, i.e. drug-eluting stents and balloons, show promising results especially in infrapopliteal lesions. However, most of these results should still be confirmed in large RCTs focusing on CLI patients. At some point when there is no possibility of an endovascular nor a surgical procedure, some alternative non-reconstructive options have been proposed such as lumbar sympathectomy and spinal cord stimulation. But their effectiveness is limited especially when assessing the results on objective criteria. The additional value of cell-based therapies has still to be proven from large RCTs and should therefore still be confined to a research setting. Altogether this chapter summarises the best available evidence for the treatment of CLI, which is, from multiple perspectives, completely different from claudication. The latter also stresses the importance of well-designed RCTs focusing on CLI patients reporting standardised endpoints, both clinical as well as procedural.

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^113H7drd]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) continues to grow in global prevalence and consumes an increasing amount of resources in the United States health care system. Overall rates of intervention for PAD have been rising steadily in recent years. Changing demographics, evolution of technologies, and an expanding database of outcomes studies are primary forces influencing clinical decision making in PAD. The management of PAD is multidisciplinary, involving primary care physicians and vascular specialists with varying expertise in diagnostic and treatment modalities. PAD represents a broad spectrum of disease from asymptomatic through severe limb ischemia. The Society for Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Practice Guidelines committee reviewed the evidence supporting clinical care in the treatment of asymptomatic PAD and intermittent claudication (IC). The committee made specific practice recommendations using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. There are limited Level I data available for many of the critical questions in the field, demonstrating the urgent need for comparative effectiveness research in PAD. Emphasis is placed on risk factor modification, medical therapies, and broader use of exercise programs to improve cardiovascular health and functional performance. Screening for PAD appears of unproven benefit at present. Revascularization for IC is an appropriate therapy for selected patients with disabling symptoms, after a careful risk-benefit analysis. Treatment should be individualized based on comorbid conditions, degree of functional impairment, and anatomic factors. Invasive treatments for IC should provide predictable functional improvements with reasonable durability. A minimum threshold of a > 50% likelihood of sustained efficacy for at least 2 years is suggested as a benchmark. Anatomic patency (freedom from restenosis) is considered a prerequisite for sustained efficacy of revascularization in IC. Endovascular approaches are favored for most candidates with aortoiliac disease and for selected patients with femoropopliteal disease in whom anatomic durability is expected to meet this minimum threshold. Conversely, caution is warranted in the use of interventions for IC in anatomic settings where durability is limited (extensive calcification, small-caliber arteries, diffuse infrainguinal disease, poor runoff). Surgical bypass may be a preferred strategy in good-risk patients with these disease patterns or in those with prior endovascular failures. Common femoral artery disease should be treated surgically, and saphenous vein is the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass grafting. Patients who undergo invasive treatments for IC should be monitored regularly in a surveillance program to record subjective improvements, assess risk factors, optimize compliance with cardioprotective medications, and monitor hemodynamic and patency status.

### Interventions for lower extremity peripheral artery disease [^112Dbtut]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) of the lower extremities is a common manifestation of atherosclerosis that is increasing in global prevalence and in the associated public health costs. Ageing of the general population, combined with the pandemics of diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and tobacco use, is a major underlying factor. A broad range of care providers are involved in the management of patients with PAD, and all health-care professionals require familiarity with the risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment options for this common disease. Although medical therapies are the cornerstone of secondary prevention in atherosclerotic disease, they have limited direct limb-related benefits in advanced PAD. Despite a major evolution in technologies for limb revascularization, the increasing array of treatment options has not been accompanied by adequate evidence of their comparative effectiveness, which is needed to guide treatment decisions. This Review provides a framework for examining the current status of interventions for PAD, including an overview of disease staging, treatment goals, and the key factors associated with outcomes in defined subgroups. The status of evolving approaches to PAD, such as cell-based and gene-based therapies, and persistent unmet therapeutic needs in this field are also discussed.

### Cutting-balloon angioplasty versus balloon angioplasty as treatment for short atherosclerotic lesions in the superficial femoral artery: randomized controlled trial [^114kbs7h]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the treatments of a short-segment atherosclerotic stenosis in the superficial femoral arteries with the cutting balloon angioplasty (CBA) versus conventional balloon angioplasty [percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA)] in a randomized controlled trial.

Material and Methods

The study group comprised 60 patients (33 men, 27 women; average age 64 years) with a short (≤ 5 cm) focal SFA de novo atherosclerotic stenosis associated with a history of intermittent claudication or rest pain. The primary end point of this study was the rate of binary restenosis in the treated segment 12 months after the intervention. All patients were evenly randomized to either the PTA or CBA treatment arms. Follow-up angiograms and ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurements were performed after 12 months. The evaluation of the restenosis rates and factors influencing its occurrence were calculated by logistic regression analysis.

Results

In the intention-to-treat analysis, restenosis rates after 2-month follow-up were 9 of 30 (30%) in the PTA group and 4 of 30 (13%) in the CBA group (p = 0.117). In the actual treatment analysis, after exclusion of patients who required nitinol stent placement for a suboptimal result after angioplasty alone (5 patients in the PTA group and none in the CBA group), restenosis rates were 9 of 25 (36%) and 4 of 30 (13%), respectively (p = 0.049). In the intention-to-treat analysis there were also significant differences in ABI values between the PTA and CBA groups at 0.77 ± 0.11 versus 0.82 ± 0.12, respectively (p = 0.039), at 12 months.

Conclusion

Based on the presented results of the trial, CBA seems to be a safer and more effective than PTA for treatment of short atherosclerotic lesions in the superior femoral artery.

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^117DXtsq]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines — management of asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and intermittent claudication (IC) — state that the committee reviewed evidence for these populations and made specific practice recommendations using the GRADE system, with emphasis on risk factor modification, medical therapies, and exercise programs. Screening for PAD appears of unproven benefit at present. Revascularization for IC is an appropriate therapy for selected patients with disabling symptoms, after a careful risk-benefit analysis, and treatment should be individualized based on comorbid conditions, degree of functional impairment, and anatomic factors. Invasive treatments for IC should provide predictable functional improvements with reasonable durability, and a minimum threshold of a > 50% likelihood of sustained efficacy for at least 2 years is suggested as a benchmark; anatomic patency (freedom from restenosis) is considered a prerequisite for sustained efficacy of revascularization in IC. Endovascular approaches are favored for most candidates with aortoiliac disease and for selected patients with femoropopliteal disease when anatomic durability is expected to meet this minimum threshold, and caution is warranted when durability is limited (extensive calcification, small-caliber arteries, diffuse infrapopliteal disease, poor runoff). Surgical bypass may be a preferred strategy in good-risk patients with technical factors that suggest durability in the setting of prior endovascular failures; common femoral artery disease should be treated surgically, and saphenous vein is the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass grafting. Patients who undergo invasive treatments for IC should be monitored regularly in a surveillance program to record subjective improvements, assess risk factors, optimize compliance with cardioprotective medications, and monitor hemodynamic and patency status.

### Management of common femoral artery occlusive disease: a review of endovascular treatment strategies and outcomes [^113SFqnS]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Isolated atherosclerotic lesions of the common femoral artery (CFA) are rare but can produce significant claudication and critical limb ischemia. To date, the "gold standard" treatment for this entity has been common femoral endarterectomy (CFE) with or without patch angioplasty. However, surgery does have significant early postoperative complications, with a 15% combined mortality/morbidity. This manuscript sought to perform a comprehensive review of all studies and available data on endovascular treatment of isolated CFA disease and compare its utility to the traditional gold standard treatment. Twenty-one studies from 1987 to 2018 were included exploring the various CFA endovascular therapies (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, intravascular stenting, drug-coated balloons, and directional atherectomy employed to treat CFA disease, in terms of efficacy, safety, and complications). As a conclusion, endovascular interventions provide acceptable short-term technical outcomes for CFA disease while limiting procedural complications. While only two randomized controlled trials compare short and long-term outcomes of surgical versus endovascular treatment, further studies are required to clarify the role of endovascular therapy.

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^1122xo6f]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Common femoral artery (CFA) interventions — endovascular therapy in occlusive CFA disease has limited evidence, with single-center series "presenting a technical success rate of nearly 90% and 1-year primary patency rate of 75%". Information on longer-term patency is limited and "no information is available regarding stent stability in this area over even this short period of time". Given the low risk of femoral endarterectomy, "the use of interventions in this vessel for the present time should be limited to those with a prohibitive risk for open surgical therapy related to local or systemic risk factors".

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^112S7EdG]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Common femoral artery (CFA) involvement — stents are discouraged and a hybrid approach is favored: "Use of stents in the common femoral artery (CFA) is not recommended because they are more likely to fracture or fail due to flexion of the artery that occurs with hip flexion". "If disease extends into the CFA, the use of a hybrid approach combining femoral endarterectomy with iliac stenting is a better alternative in most patients".

### Updated clinical and radiological classification of lower limb atherosclerotic disease [^117EPh6J]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Lower limb atherosclerotic disease has classically been classified as acute or chronic; however, this is an evolving process that has a wide spectrum of clinical and imaging aspects. Owing to the evolvement of endovascular and imaging techniques, we have now garnered new information regarding the pathophysiology and behavior of atherosclerotic disease, also in response to endovascular and surgical techniques. Clinical presentation can actually be classified according to the time of presentation, ranging from acute (< 2 weeks) and subacute (from 2 weeks to 3 months) to chronic (over 3 months) and acute/subacute on underlying chronic disease. Imaging characteristics such as the presence of thrombus, number of collaterals, and target vessel wall features may help in defining the correct type of atherosclerotic lesion, triggering the appropriate treatment strategy. Clinical and imaging characteristics of those different stages are complex and not systematically addressed by current guidelines, that do not show any specific recommendations for imaging pathways/characteristics or treatment. This review illustrates the clinical and imaging characteristics of the different stages of lower limb atherosclerotic disease and related treatment options.

### Non-coronary atherosclerotic arterial disease: where are we now? [^111AmmWd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity peripheral artery and upper extremity artery disease are significant vascular conditions with distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. The lower extremity peripheral artery is associated with worse major adverse cardiovascular events compared with coronary artery disease, but often remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Upper extremity artery disease encompasses a range of clinical presentations resulting from atherosclerosis and other obstructive lesions in arteries such as the subclavian artery and brachiocephalic trunk. While atherosclerosis is a common cause, non-atherosclerotic factors can also influence distal lesions. This review aims to synthesize existing knowledge on both conditions, encompassing risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnostic modalities, and treatment options. Improved awareness and early intervention can mitigate complications and enhance patient outcomes for lower extremity peripheral artery and upper extremity artery disease.

### Editor's choice-eligibility of common femoral artery atherosclerotic disease for endovascular treatment-the CONFESS study [^111nVPTw]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Advances in endovascular technologies have allowed the treatment of common femoral artery (CFA) steno-occlusive disease by minimally invasive means; however, the proportion of lesions treated with common femoral artery endarterectomy (CFAE) which would be amenable to endovascular treatment is unknown. This observational study aimed to describe the morphology and composition of CFA lesions treated with CFAE and report the proportion that would be amenable to endovascular treatment with modern technologies.

Methods

Patients presenting with symptomatic peripheral artery disease who underwent CFAE from January 2014 to December 2018 in two tertiary NHS hospitals were included. Extensive data relating to patient demographics, risk factors, clinical outcomes, as well as anatomical and morphological characteristics of the CFA atherosclerotic lesions, were collected which included detailed plaque analysis using 3D reconstruction of pre-operative computed tomography angiograms. CFA lesions were considered suitable for endovascular treatment if presented with patent iliac inflow, at least one patent outflow vessel (superficial femoral artery [SFA] or profunda femoral artery [PFA]), and stenotic rather than occluded CFA.

Results

A total of 829 CFAs in 737 consecutive patients who underwent CFAE were included (mean age 71 ± 10 years; 526 males, 71%); 451 (62%) presented with chronic limb threatening ischaemia. Overall, 35% of CFAs had a localised lesion (no bifurcation disease) that could possibly be treated endovascularly. In total, 376 (45%) target vessels did not feature severe calcium load, with a patent CFA, PFA, and proximal SFA and therefore would have been amenable to endovascular treatment; while 271 CFAs (33%) featured a significant calcium load which would have potentially required stenting.

Conclusion

A significant proportion of patients with atherosclerotic CFA lesions who undergo surgery could potentially be candidates for endovascular treatment. A randomised trial comparing CFAE and new endovascular techniques in this clinical context is required.

### Current trends in lower extremity revascularization [^1136F4DF]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Femoropopliteal bypass is the traditional management of superficial femoral artery lower extremity athero-occlusive disease for lifestyle-limiting claudication and critical limb ischemia. Over the last decade, with the advent of new technologies, an increasing number of endovascular interventions are being used to treat femoropopliteal disease. Endovascular interventions are attractive to patients and physicians because of their decreased morbidity and mortality, despite the possibility of reduced durability. A multitude of techniques are available, without a clear consensus as to which one is best. This article reviews the current endovascular management options available for femoropopliteal occlusive disease, and the published results with each modality.

### First in human use of non-invasive, robot assisted, high intensity focused ultrasound treatment of femoral atherosclerosis: a safety and feasibility pilot study [^111Vb1C3]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Currently available open or endovascular revascularisation options for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have limited long term patency rates and pose a risk of peri-operative complications. Robot assisted, high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) enables precise targeting of atherosclerotic plaques, creating thermal lesions with submillimetre resolution. As a non-invasive alternative, HIFU may be associated with fewer peri-operative risks. Pre-clinical studies in healthy and atherosclerotic animals have demonstrated the safety of HIFU treatment. This first in human study investigated the safety and feasibility of HIFU therapy for PAD.

Methods

This first in human, single centre, non-randomised pilot study included patients with symptomatic PAD (Rutherford 2–4) with a common femoral and or proximal superficial femoral artery stenosis. Lesions with a calcified volume > 80% or localised at a depth of > 35mm from the skin were excluded. Included patients were treated under sedation with a dual mode ultrasound array (DMUA) system connected to a robotic arm to precisely deliver imaging guided HIFU to the atherosclerotic plaque. Primary outcomes were: the major complication rate, defined as the composite of any complication requiring re-intervention, amputation, or death and adjudicated by two independent medical monitors; and technical feasibility, defined as successful targeting of the complete lesion. Secondary outcomes included any other procedure related complications, clinical endpoints such as ankle brachial index, and imaging parameters.

Results

Between June 2019 and April 2024, 232 limbs in 205 patients were screened. Twelve patients with unilateral lesions underwent HIFU treatment by the same team. The mean treatment time was 113 ± 28.2 minutes, and technical success was achieved in all patients. No major complications or other procedure related complications occurred within 30 days post-procedure or during three months of follow up. No clear differences were observed throughout follow up relative to baseline for the secondary outcomes.

Conclusion

HIFU treatment using a DMUA transducer appears safe and feasible for the treatment of selected patients with PAD localised in the femoral artery.

Femoropopliteal revascularization — catheter-based intervention considerations for claudication include that "Treatment of isolated infrapopliteal disease for relief of claudication is not advised" and "In patients with multisegment disease, the more proximal disease should be treated first and usually results in improvement in symptoms without extending treatment to the more distal arteries". EVT options for FPOD include "PTA alone, especially for short focal lesions < 4 cm", along with angioplasty using self-expanding or balloon-expandable stents, covered stent grafts, atherectomy, and drug-eluting stents (DESs). For common femoral artery disease, lesions are "generally treated with surgical endarterectomy and patch angioplasty, except in patients with significant comorbidities or hostile groins", and "endovascular approaches to the CFA artery are not well proven, and disease in this artery is preferably treated surgically". Profunda femoral interventions for claudication are "of unproven value and may carry substantial risk", and "After failure of an exercise program and optimization of medical therapy, endovascular intervention can be considered".

### Angioplasty versus stenting for iliac artery lesions [^112CofoD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Atherosclerosis of the iliac artery may result in a stenosis or occlusion, which is defined as iliac artery occlusive disease. A range of surgical and endovascular treatment options are available. Open surgical procedures have excellent patency rates but at the cost of substantial morbidity and mortality. Endovascular treatment has good safety and short-term efficacy with decreased morbidity, complications and costs compared with open surgical procedures. Both percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting are commonly used endovascular treatment options for iliac artery occlusive disease. A stenotic or occlusive lesion of the iliac artery can be treated successfully by PTA alone. If PTA alone is technically unsuccessful, additional stent placement is indicated. Alternatively, a stent could be placed primarily to treat an iliac artery stenosis or occlusion (primary stenting, PS). However, there is limited evidence to prove which endovascular treatment strategy is superior for stenotic and occlusive lesions of the iliac arteries. This is an update of the review first published in 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effects of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty versus primary stenting for stenotic and occlusive lesions of the iliac artery.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 24 September 2019. We also undertook reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and primary stenting for iliac artery occlusive disease. We excluded quasi-randomised trials, case reports, case-control or cohort studies. We did not exclude studies based on the language of publication.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected suitable trials, extracted data, assessed trial quality and performed data analyses. When there was disagreement, consensus would be reached first by discussion between the two authors and, if needed, through consultation with a third author. We used GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence and presented the main results in a 'Summary of findings' table. The main outcomes of interest were technical success, complications, symptomatic improvement of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), patency, reinterventions, resolutions of symptoms and signs, and improvement in walking distance as reported by the patient.

Main Results

We identified no new studies for this update. Previously, we identified two RCTs, with a combined total of 397 participants, as meeting the selection criteria. One study included mostly stenotic lesions (95%), whereas the second study included only iliac artery occlusions. Heterogeneity between these two studies meant it was not possible to pool the data. Both studies were of moderate methodological quality with some risk of bias relating to selective reporting and non-blinding of participants and personnel. Both studies occurred in the 1990s and techniques have since evolved. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence to be low. We downgraded by two levels: one for risk of bias concerns and one for imprecision and indirectness. There was no evidence of a difference following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with selective stenting compared to primary stenting (PS) in technical success rates in either the study involving stenotic lesions (odds ratio (OR) 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 2.99; 279 participants; low certainty evidence); or the study involving iliac artery occlusions (OR 2.95, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.90; 112 participants; low certainty evidence). In one trial, PTA of iliac artery occlusions resulted in a higher rate of major complications, especially distal embolisation (OR 4.50 95% CI 1.18 to 17.14; 1 study, 112 participants; low certainty evidence). Immediate complications were similar in the second study (OR 1.81, 95% CI 0.64 to 5.13; 1 study, 279 participants; low certainty evidence). Neither study reported on delayed complications. No evidence of a difference was seen in symptomatic improvement (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.27; 1 study, 157 participants; low certainty evidence). The second study did not provide data but reported no differences. For the outcome of patency, no evidence of a difference was seen in the study involving iliac occlusion at two years (OR 1.60, 95% CI 0.34 to 7.44; 1 study, 57 participants; low certainty evidence); or the study involving stenotic lesions at two years (71.3% in the PS group versus 69.9% in the PTA group). Only one study reported on reintervention (six to eight years, OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.23; 1 study, 279 participants; low certainty evidence); and resolution of symptoms and signs (12 months, OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.00; 1 study, 219 participants; low certainty evidence), with no evidence of a difference detected in either outcome. Neither study reported on improvement in walking distance as reported by the patient.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to make general conclusions about the effects of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty versus primary stenting for stenotic and occlusive lesions of the iliac artery. Data from one study indicate that primary stenting in iliac artery occlusions may result in lower distal embolisation rates (low certainty evidence). The evidence in this review, based on two studies, was assessed as low certainty, with downgrading decisions based on limitations in risk of bias, imprecision and indirectness. More studies are required to strengthen our confidence in the results.

Aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) in intermittent claudication (IC) — endovascular-first care emphasizes that we recommend endovascular procedures over open surgery for focal AIOD causing IC, and we recommend endovascular interventions as first-line revascularization therapy for most patients with common iliac artery or external iliac artery occlusive disease causing IC. We recommend the selective use of bare-metal stent (BMS) or covered stents for aortoiliac angioplasty for common iliac artery or external iliac artery occlusive disease, or both, due to improved technical success and patency, and we recommend the use of covered stents for treatment of AIOD in the presence of severe calcification or aneurysmal changes where the risk of rupture may be increased after unprotected dilation.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) diagnosis — noninvasive test accuracy and screening evidence: In patients suspected to have PAD, ankle-brachial index (ABI) testing shows that ABI < 0.9 has a sensitivity ranging from 79% to 95% with a specificity of > 95%. Among anatomic and physiologic noninvasive studies, the combination of segmental limb pressures and pulse volume recordings had a diagnostic accuracy of 97%, and duplex ultrasound imaging to detect a stenosis ≥ 50% in the aortoiliac tract: sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 97%; for the femoropopliteal tract: sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 96%; for the infragenicular arteries: sensitivity, 83%; specificity, 84%; the accuracy of CT and MR imaging were > 90%. For screening asymptomatic individuals with ABI, there were no data on benefit or harm in patient-important outcomes, and when adding ABI to traditional risk assessment tools, reclassification of risk and change in treatment recommendations occurred in ~19% of men and 36% of women.

### Endovascular superficial femoral artery treatment: can it be as good as bypass? [^112BhCo2]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Care of the vascular patient has changed drastically during the last decade, with the introduction of endovascular therapies. Medical management and open surgical bypass have been the traditional options for superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusive disease. Endovascular revascularization of the SFA, however, has been increasingly utilized during the past decade. Results of endovascular interventions for SFA stenoses and/or occlusions have been mixed. In addition, several different techniques have been developed to address similar lesions. This added complexity makes it difficult to compare endovascular therapies to surgical bypass. This review will discuss the difficulties in comparing open and endovascular therapies as well as outcomes of endovascular therapies. Finally, the role of endovascular interventions for SFA lesions in the future will be discussed.

Findings also suggest that use of femoral artery atherosclerosis measures may be especially effective and beneficial in individuals with a normal‐range ABI who are likely asymptomatic, when detection can lead to earlier intervention to prevent functional declines and improve quality of life. Early interventions could range from lifestyle, such as an exercise program, to pharmacologic, such as initiation or intensification of statins. However, additional follow‐up studies are first needed to confirm associations of femoral artery atherosclerosis with declines in physical function over time among those with a normal‐range ABI.

### Angioplasty versus bare metal stenting for superficial femoral artery lesions [^116zRk8S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Lower limb peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common, important manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis. Stenoses or occlusions in the superficial femoral artery may result in intermittent claudication or even critical ischaemia, which may be treated by balloon angioplasty with or without stenting. This is the first update of a review published in 2009.

Objectives

The primary aim was to determine the effect of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) compared with PTA with bare metal stenting for superficial femoral artery (SFA) stenoses on vessel patency in people with symptomatic (Rutherford categories1 to 6; Fontaine stages II to IV) lower limb peripheral vascular disease. In addition, we assessed the efficacy of PTA and stenting in improving quality of life, ankle brachial index and treadmill walking distance.

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched August 2013) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 6).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of angioplasty alone versus angioplasty with bare metal stenting for the treatment of superficial femoral artery stenoses.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (MC, CT) independently selected suitable trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Furthermore, these two review authors performed assessments of methodological quality and wrote the final manuscript. The third review author (ADM) cross-checked all stages of the review process.

Main Results

We include three new studies in this update, making a total of 11 included trials with 1387 participants. The average age was 69 years and all trials included men and women. Participants were followed for up to two years. There was an improvement in primary duplex patency at six and 12 months in participants treated with PTA plus stent over lesions treated with PTA alone (six months: odds ratio (OR) 2.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 7.18, P = 0.02, six studies, 578 participants; 12 months: OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.10, P = 0.04, nine studies, 858 participants). This was lost by 24 months (P = 0.06). There was a significant angiographic patency benefit at six months (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.49 to 4.17, P = 0.0005, four studies, 329 participants) which was lost by 12 months (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.00, P = 0.24, five studies, 384 participants). Ankle brachial index (ABI) and treadmill walking distance showed no improvement at 12 months (P = 0.49 and P = 0.57 respectively) between participants treated with PTA alone or PTA with stent insertion. Three trials (660 participants) reported quality of life, which showed no significant difference between participants treated with PTA alone or PTA with stent insertion at any time interval. Antiplatelet therapy protocols and inclusion criteria regarding affected arteries between trials showed marked heterogeneity.

Authors' Conclusions

Although there was a short-term gain in primary patency there was no sustained benefit from primary stenting of lesions of the superficial femoral artery in addition to angioplasty. Future trials should focus on quality of life for claudication and limb salvage for critical ischaemia.

### Characteristics of atherosclerosis in femoropopliteal artery and its clinical relevance [^116gSZ8r]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease with different faces. Despite identical or similar pathogenetic mechanisms, atherosclerotic lesions and their clinical manifestations vary in different parts of the vascular system. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) represents one of the most frequent clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis with predominant location in the superficial femoral artery (SFA). Morphological characteristics of atherosclerotic plaques in peripheral arteries differ from lesions in the coronary and carotid arteries. Plaques in SFA have more fibrotic components, less lipids and inflammatory cells, which makes them more stable and less prone to rupture. Factors that determine the different structure of plaques in SFA compared to coronary arteries include hemodynamic forces, vasa vasorum and calcification. Low shear stress in SFA in the adductor canal is one of the factors which determines frequent atherosclerotic lesions in this region. Lower lipid content and fewer inflammatory cells explain higher stability of SFA plaques. The specific structure of SFA plaques may require preventive and therapeutic measures, which to some extent differ from prevention of coronary atherosclerosis and may include inhibition of fibrotic proliferation in SFA plaques and calcification. Revascularization of PAD differs from procedures used in coronary arteries and requires specific technical expertise and devices.

### Endograft use in the femoral and popliteal arteries [^113bKdqr]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The results of infra-inguinal intervention for atherosclerotic occlusive disease have not changed dramatically in the last 15 years despite the advent of many different designs of uncovered stents. "Plain old balloon angioplasty" remains the treatment of choice for short lesions (< 3 cm) with good morphologic characteristics. Stents have improved suboptimal angioplasty results somewhat, but results in longer lesions > 5 cm have remained poor in most series. Although there are no endografts currently approved for arterial use by the FDA, expanded polytetraflouroethylene (ePTFE) covered endoprostheses are available and their use in the femoropopliteal arteries can dramatically improve the results of endovascular treatment for longer lesions and allow one to treat vascular ruptures and aneurysms. In this article, we will review the published results for the use of endografts in the femoropopliteal arteries and describe what we believe to be the current indications for their use.

Diffuse AIOD, aneurysmal disease, and common femoral artery (CFA) assessment — For patients with diffuse AIOD undergoing revascularization, we suggest either endovascular or surgical intervention as first-line approaches and state that endovascular interventions that may impair the potential for subsequent AFB in surgical candidates should be avoided. EVT (endovascular therapy) of AIOD in the presence of aneurysmal disease should be undertaken cautiously, and we recommend that the modality used should either achieve concomitant aneurysm exclusion or should not jeopardize the conduct of any future open or endovascular aneurysm repair. In all patients undergoing revascularization for AIOD, we recommend assessing the CFA and, if hemodynamically significant CFA disease is present, we recommend surgical therapy (endarterectomy) as first-line treatment. In patients with iliac artery disease and involvement of the CFA, we recommend hybrid procedures combining femoral endarterectomy with iliac inflow correction, and we recommend direct surgical reconstruction (bypass, endarterectomy) in patients with reasonable surgical risk and diffuse AIOD not amenable to an endovascular approach, after one or more failed attempts at EVT, or in patients with combined occlusive and aneurysmal disease.

### Challenges and opportunities in the management of type 2 diabetes in patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease: a tailored diagnosis and treatment review [^115M811L]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

PAD, characterized by atherosclerosis in the arteries of the lower extremities, is highly prevalent in patients with T2DM. The management of PAD in patients with T2DM requires a multidisciplinary and individualized approach that addresses both the overarching metabolic disturbances inherent to diabetes and the specific vascular complications of PAD. While there are several societal guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PAD in patients with T2DM, it is important to acknowledge that these guidelines are primarily based on data from the general population. To better tailor recommendations and improve care for this particular population, there is a pressing need for robust, T2DM-specific PAD clinical trials, primarily focusing on novel glucose-lowering agents known for their cardiovascular benefits, including GLP-1RA and SGLT2i. The initiation of such focused research efforts is essential to inform and refine clinical practices, optimizing patient outcomes in this complex interplay of systemic metabolic dysfunction and localized vascular impairment.

Aorto-iliac disease is a common manifestation of atherosclerosis. Individuals with this condition are at heightened cardiovascular risk, and may have limb symptoms ranging from claudication to limb-threatening ischemia. A regimen of medical therapy, risk factor modification, and exercise is first line therapy. Revascularization is reserved for individuals with lifestyle-limiting claudication despite conservative therapy and in those with chronic limb-threatening ischemia. Multiple endovascular therapies are now available that enable even the most complex aorto-iliac lesions to be approached and treated with safe and durable results.

### Assessment and management of peripheral arterial disease: what every cardiologist should know [^115nJTS1]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) typically refers to atherosclerotic narrowing and/or occlusion of all arterial disease other than coronary arteries and the aorta (carotid and vertebral arteries, coeliac and mesenteric arteries, renal arteries and upper and lower limb arteries) (figure 1). As a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis, PAD is associated with greatly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and impairment in quality of life. Because of the frequent overlap between ischaemic heart disease and PAD, cardiologists are in a unique position to screen, diagnose and treat PAD. The body of clinical evidence in patients with PAD is not as robust as the evidence in patients with heart disease, however the treatment goals are similar for both coronary artery disease (CAD) and PAD: to prevent ischaemic outcomes with lifestyle changes and medical therapy and to weigh the risks and benefits of revascularisation (Table 1). This article reviews the basic evaluation and management of the most common types of PAD from a cardiologist's perspective.

### New horizons in peripheral artery disease [^114TmkPY]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is the manifestation of systemic atherosclerotic disease in the arteries of, and supplying, the lower limbs. Similar to other cardiovascular diseases, PAD is an age-related condition with a prevalence over 10% among people aged ≥ 65 living in high-income countries. Whilst the majority of individuals with PAD are asymptomatic, progression of the disease leads to symptoms of intermittent claudication (leg pain on walking) and ultimately pain at rest, ulceration and gangrene. PAD is a major cause of morbidity among older people and may lead to disability, limb loss and death.

In recent years, there have been a number of innovations in medical and surgical management that have changed treatment algorithms for PAD. Additionally, new evidence and updated guidelines have radically changed management pathways with the advent of rapid-access limb salvage clinics to expedite revascularisation for those with rest pain and/or tissue loss. In the context of an ageing population and increasing prevalence of type-2 diabetes mellitus, patient cohorts of those undergoing intervention have changed drastically with many more older patients with PAD living with multi-morbidity, frailty and cognitive impairment admitted to vascular surgery wards.

Screening for asymptomatic atherosclerosis in other arterial beds (coronary, carotid, renal) in PAD — Although the prevalence of atherosclerosis in these arteries is higher in patients with PAD than in those without PAD, the only justification for screening would be if revascularization reduces myocardial infarction, stroke, or death, and this has never been shown; currently, there is no evidence that screening all patients with PAD for asymptomatic atherosclerosis in other arterial beds improves clinical outcome, and intensive treatment of risk factors through guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is the principle method for preventing adverse cardiovascular ischemic events from asymptomatic disease in other arterial beds.

### Endovascular treatment of common femoral artery disease: medium-term outcomes of 360 consecutive procedures [^114PqZ8K]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the technical feasability, safety, and 1-year efficacy of the endovascular treatment of atherosclerotic common femoral artery (CFA) obstructions.

Background

Atherosclerotic CFA obstruction is a known cause of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Although surgical endarterectomy is considered the therapy of choice for this condition, little is known about the percutaneous options.

Methods

Using a prospectively maintained single-center database, we retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 360 consecutive percutaneous interventions of the CFA for atherosclerotic disease and assessed procedural success, in-hospital complications, and 1-year patency and target lesion revascularization rates.

Results

Ninety-seven procedures (26.9%) were isolated CFA interventions, whereas 157 (43.6%) and 152 (42.2%) also involved inflow and outflow vessels, respectively. Bifurcation lesions were present in 140 cases (38.9%), and concomitant treatment of the profunda femoral artery was performed on 93 occasions (25.8%). Chronic total CFA occlusions were recanalized in 60 cases (16.7%). Balloon angioplasty was performed as the primary intervention in virtually all cases (98.6%), whereas stenting was needed for suboptimal angioplasty results in 133 procedures (36.9%). Failures-defined as a final angiographic result with a > 30% residual stenosis-were observed on 26 occasions (7.2%). In-hospital major (i.e., requiring surgery) and minor (i.e., treated percutaneously or conservatively) complications occurred in 5 (1.4%) and 18 (5.0%) procedures, respectively. One-year follow-up data were available for 281 patients (87.5%). Restenosis > 50% by duplex scanning and target lesion revascularization were observed in 74 of 268 (27.6%) and 64 of 322 (19.9%) procedures, respectively.

Conclusions

This large series suggests that the percutaneous approach may be a valid alternative to surgery for CFA atherosclerotic obstructions.

### Contemporary evaluation and management of lower extremity peripheral artery disease [^114B84BX]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) includes atherosclerosis of the aorta and lower extremities. Affecting a large segment of the population, PAD is associated with impaired functional capacity and reduced quality of life as well as an increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. The evaluation of PAD begins with the physical examination, incorporating non-invasive testing such as ankle-brachial indices to confirm the diagnosis. Therapeutic interventions are aimed at alleviating symptoms while preserving limb integrity and reducing overall cardiovascular risk. With this in mind, risk factor modification with exercise and medical therapy are the mainstays of treatment for many patients with PAD. Persistent symptoms or non-healing wounds should prompt more aggressive therapies with endovascular or surgical revascularisation.

### ISAR-PEBIS (paclitaxel-eluting balloon versus conventional balloon angioplasty for in-stent restenosis of superficial femoral artery): a Randomized trial [^114dTbdJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

A variable degree of obstruction at the level of superficial femoral artery (SFA) is a common finding in patients with atherosclerotic disease of peripheral vessels. Guidelines recommend endovascular therapy as a first‐line option for SFA disease. Conventional balloon angioplasty (BA), peripheral stents (with or without release of antiproliferative drugs), atherectomy devices, and paclitaxel‐eluting balloon (PEB) represent valuable options as stand‐alone therapies or in combination for patients with SFA disease. 1

Despite the favorable acute mechanical results with contemporary endovascular therapies for SFA disease, the rate of restenosis (vessel renarrowing at the site of a treated segment) is as high as 70% after BA and 50% after stenting. 2 PEB represents a breakthrough in the percutaneous treatment of SFA disease by providing local delivery of a target‐specific antirestenotic drug without leaving permanent implants behind. Although recent data lend support for superior efficacy of PEB versus BA in de novo lesions of SFA, 3 the angiographic and clinical outcomes of PEB versus BA as therapeutic options for in‐stent restenosis (ISR) of SFA remain poorly studied. 4 In particular, a randomized trial investigating the angiographic and clinical performance of PEB versus BA for ISR of SFA has yet to be performed.

Against this background, we performed a randomized trial in which patients with symptomatic ISR of SFA were assigned to either PEB or BA and received a follow‐up angiography at 6 to 8 months and clinical surveillance at 6‐ and 24‐month follow‐up.

Postintervention medical treatment after lower extremity revascularization — aggressive medical therapy is indicated to prevent future cardiovascular events and to improve patency; patients should be counseled on risk factor modification and receive accepted pharmacologic therapy for systemic atherosclerosis (especially statins and antiplatelet therapy), with systemic anticoagulation required in some patients.

Imaging for invasive treatment planning — "Once the decision has been made to consider invasive treatment, patients should undergo imaging studies to determine the arterial anatomy, the extent of disease, and whether they are best treated with EVT or open surgical therapy". Available modalities "include CTA,129,130 MRA,131 duplex ultrasound imaging,132 and catheter angiography". Catheter arteriography "represents the gold standard" but "is invasive and may be complicated by contrast nephropathy, allergic reactions, and access-site events". Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is "noninvasive" with near-arteriography resolution and reconfigurable image formats, yet "requires a large dose of intravenous contrast" and is "subject to artifact degradation due to calcification". Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has "poorer resolution" but "is not degraded by calcium", and gadolinium use "is contraindicated in patients with significant renal impairment" because of "nephrogenic systemic fibrosis", and "MRA cannot be used in patients with pacemakers and a variety of other implanted medical devices". Duplex ultrasound is "most commonly used as a screening modality" and "occasionally used as a primary imaging modality during EVT" for "isolated focal disease in the superficial femoral artery (SFA)". For open bypass candidates, "Ultrasound vein mapping is therefore recommended as part of the preoperative evaluation of patients who are being considered as potential open bypass candidates".

### Intravascular lithotripsy and drug-coated balloon angioplasty for severely calcified common femoral artery atherosclerotic disease [^113dBMiP]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endovascular treatment has evolved rapidly over the last decades and is currently considered the firstline treatment option for most atherosclerotic lesions of the peripheral vasculature. However, primary open repair remains the standard of care for common femoral artery (CFA) atherosclerosis. Main reasons are the high technical success and the durability of CFA endarterectomy in the long run. – Nevertheless, surgical revascularization of the groin vessels is not as benign as previously believed, given the increased risk for periprocedural morbidity and mortality. A retrospective analysis of 1843 patients who underwent surgical revascularization of the groin observed a 3.4% postoperative mortality, 8% wound-related complications, and a 15% risk of combined mortality/morbidity while > 60% of these events occurred after discharge. Thus, there is a growing interest for the development and adaption of endovascular solutions for CFA disease.

The use of plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA), scaffolds, and drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty with or without debulking has been previously described for CFA lesions. – Nonetheless, the risk for jailing the deep femoral artery or losing an access vessel, as well as the severe calcification, which is frequently observed in the groin, still challenge the performance of endovascular treatment. In addition, as current recommendations suggest against the use of scaffolds for CFA disease, a calcium dedicated "leave-nothing-behind" approach might be a valuable alternative to surgery.

Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL), which uses pulsatile sonic waves to fracture intimal and medial calcification, is associated with promising periprocedural outcomes and low rates of complications in patients with CFA disease. Moreover, the combination of IVL and DCB seems to reduce the need for reinterventions for femoropopliteal lesions. However, the midterm performance of IVL with adjunctive DCB for CFA disease remains unknown. This analysis reports on the 12 months outcomes of IVL with anti-restenotic therapy for calcified CFA lesions.

### Contemporary and optimal medical management of peripheral arterial disease [^117RXVuL]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent condition associated with a significant increase in risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. PAD is underdiagnosed and undertreated. Treatment is focused on (1) lowering cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular disease event rates and (2) improvement in symptoms and quality of life. Multidisciplinary and intersociety guidelines guide optimal medical therapy. Substantial evidence supports implementation of tobacco cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy to help achieve tobacco abstinence, antiplatelet therapy, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) therapy, and antihypertensive therapy for the purpose of lowering cardiovascular event rates and improving survival.

### Medical management of peripheral arterial disease [^114jT2ic]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Whether symptomatic or not, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), atherosclerosis in the arteries of the lower extremities, is a common disorder in the general population. The prevalence increases with age and under the influence of vascular risk factors. The most classic symptomatic expression of PAD is intermittent claudication. However, the majority of patients with PAD is asymptomatic or has leg symptoms other than classic intermittent claudication. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects with PAD have increased mortality rates, mainly due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular expressions of atherosclerotic disease. This review focuses on the current available medical therapies for PAD, including risk-factor modification and antiplatelet therapies, as well as strategies for symptomatic relief in both patients with intermittent claudication and patients with critical limb ischemia. In general, risk factor modification and antiplatelet therapy is essential in all patients with PAD to prevent systemic atherosclerotic complications. Furthermore, for symptomatic relief exercise therapy is the main intervention while pharmacological treatment should be only complementary. In patients with critical limb ischemia, when revascularization therapy is not possible, an attempt should be made to avoid amputation with conservative treatment using analgesics, vasodilators and/or anticoagulants. In case of an acute onset of critical limb ischemia, thrombolysis is indicated.

### The effect of ezetimibe on peripheral arterial atherosclerosis depends upon statin use at baseline [^113zY2Cz]. Atherosclerosis (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Both statins and ezetimibe lower LDL-C, but ezetimibe's effect on atherosclerosis is controversial. We hypothesized that lowering LDL-C cholesterol by adding ezetimibe to statin therapy would regress atherosclerosis measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) in peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

Methods

Atherosclerotic plaque volume was measured in the proximal 15–20 cm of the SFA in 67 PAD patients (age 63 ± 10, ABI 0.69 ± 0.14) at baseline and annually × 2. Statin-naïve patients (n = 34) were randomized to simvastatin 40 mg (S, n = 16) or simvastatin 40 mg+ezetimibe 10mg (S+E, n = 18). Patients already on statins but with LDL-C > 80 mg/dl had open-label ezetimibe 10mg added (E, n = 33). Repeated measures models estimated changes in plaque parameters over time and between-group differences.

Results

LDL-C was lower at year 1 in S+E (67 ± 7 mg/dl) than S (91 ± 8 mg/dl, p < 0.05), but similar at year 2 (68 ± 10 mg/dl vs. 83 ± 11 mg/dl, respectively). Plaque volume did not change from baseline to year 2 in either S+E (11.5 ± 1.4–10.5 ± 1.3 cm(3), p = NS) or S (11.0 ± 1.5–10.5 ± 1.4 cm(3), p = NS). In E, plaque progressed from baseline to year 2 (10.0 ± 0.8–10.8 ± 0.9, p < 0.01) despite a 22% decrease in LDL-C.

Conclusions

Statin initiation with or without ezetimibe in statin-naïve patients halts progression of peripheral atherosclerosis. When ezetimibe is added to patients previously on statins, peripheral atherosclerosis progressed. Thus, ezetimibe's effect on peripheral atherosclerosis may depend upon relative timing of statin therapy.

### Treating the diseased superficial femoral artery [^117DM4Rf]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Vascular disease involving the superficial femoral artery (SFA) is common. Once the decision to treat the SFA is made, the benefits and limitations of angioplasty and stents must be applied to each specific patient. Additionally, the potential role of covered stents as well as drug eluting stents must be considered.

### The early effect of lipid-lowering treatment on carotid and femoral intima media thickness (IMT) [^113nrSsu]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

an increased intima media thickness (IMT) is an early indicator of the atherosclerotic process. We investigated the early effect of atorvastatin on the common carotid artery (CCA) and common femoral artery (CFA) IMT.

Methods

the IMT was measured in the CCA and the CFA of hyperlipidaemic patients referred with peripheral vascular disease. The measurements were performed using an automated radio frequency IMT technique pre-treatment and at 4 and 8 weeks post-treatment with 20 mg/day atorvastatin.

Results

patients (14 men; 11 women), median age 69 years (range: 48–81) had a CCA-IMT mean (SD) of 0.79 (0.21) mm pre-treatment, 0.75 (0.22) mm after 4 weeks, and 0.64 (0.15) mm after 8 weeks. The ANOVA test was significant (p = 0.024) for the CCA-IMT trend. The corresponding CFA-IMT readings were 0.83 (0.13) mm, 0.80 (0.09) mm and 0.69 (0.14) mm (p = 0.0003). After 8 weeks of treatment there was a significant reduction in total cholesterol 6.0 (0.3) to 4.3 (0.8) mmol/l, p = 0.0004 and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 3.7 (0.2) to 2.2 (0.5), p = 0.0001. There was a significant decrease in median serum creatinine levels after 8 weeks treatment: 87 micromol/l (range 67–114) to 84 micromol/l (range: 64–112), p = 0.007.

Conclusions

cholesterol-lowering with atorvastatin 20 mg/day leads to a decrease in CCA-IMT and CFA-IMT. This difference achieved significance after 8 weeks of treatment, but a trend was visible at 4 weeks. These rapid changes in IMT may be attributable to an anti-inflammatory effect. IMT measurement may be a useful tool to rapidly assess the effect of drug treatment on the atherosclerotic process.

### Efficacy and safety of intravascular lithotripsy for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease: an individual patient-level pooled data analysis [^116h6VCV]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) impacts more than 200 million people worldwide. 1 Vascular calcification is common in PAD and is associated with increased risk for acute vessel complications and reduced long‐term patency following endovascular treatment. 2 Intimal peripheral artery calcification is typically the result of atherosclerotic disease whereas medial calcification is most often associated with renal disease, diabetes, and aging. 2, 3, 4 Both forms of calcification pose distinct challenges for the treatment of obstructive PAD. Although a number of tools such as atherectomy and specialty balloons such as focal force, scoring, and cutting balloons have been developed to modify the calcific plaque thereby allowing effective change in arterial compliance and therefore vessel dilation. These modalities are often associated with elevated risk for periprocedural complications and have limited randomized trial data to support their use. Moreover, these methods of lesion modification primarily affect intimal calcification rather than medial calcification. Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL), which uses pulsatile sonic waves to fracture intimal and medial vascular calcium, has emerged as a novel endovascular therapy. Representative case images before and after IVL therapy in a severely calcified right superficial femoral artery lesion are presented (Figure 1). However, to date, this device has only been evaluated in small‐to‐intermediate sized nonrandomized studies. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Therefore, we sought to perform an individual patient‐level data (IPD) pooled meta‐analysis of available IVL trials to assess the efficacy and safety of this technique in the treatment of moderately‐to‐severely calcified PAD lesions.

### Association between statin intensity and femoropopliteal stent primary patency in peripheral arterial disease [^111BEbUX]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a highly morbid and prevalent disease, affecting at least 8.5 million adults in the United States and more than 230 million adults worldwide. Endovascular therapy of the femoral and popliteal arteries with stent placement is utilized to treat multifocal stenoses and occlusions of these segments and is associated with lower risk of periprocedural complications compared to open surgical treatment. However, stent restenosis and occlusion limit the durability of endovascular treatment, particularly in complex Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II class C and D lesions.

Statins are a mainstay of treatment for patients with atherosclerotic disease. In addition to reducing low density lipoprotein levels, statins slow progression of intimal-media thickening and attenuate inflammatory changes implicated in cardiovascular disease. However, they remain underutilized in patients with PAD despite societal consensus guidelines recommending their use. The Heart Protection Study, the largest randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of statins in PAD patients, demonstrated that the use of statins reduced the rate of first major vascular events including myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, and all revascularization procedures in this population with a relative risk reduction of 22%. Later studies have shown that statin use reduces limb loss and mortality in PAD, including in a dose-dependent manner in one study. Therefore, we hypothesized that statin use increases patency of stents placed for PAD. The purpose of this study was to evaluate femoropopliteal stent patency according to statin intensity at the time of stent placement and compare this effect to other covariates that may influence stent patency.

Peripheral arterial interventions appropriate use criteria (SCAI) — In 2014, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) published the first Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) for endovascular therapy (EVT) for atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease (PAD) involving the aorto-iliac, femoral-popliteal, infra-popliteal, and renal arterial circulations. These documents were developed to assist clinicians' decision-making, to improve patients' understanding regarding relative risks and benefits of a procedure, and to guide future research. Clinical scenarios classified catheter-based intervention as "appropriate" or "may be appropriate".

Intermittent claudication (IC) management — most claudicant patients being evaluated initially should begin conservative therapy, as "a 6-month trial of smoking cessation, risk factor modification, exercise, or cilostazol, or a combination, should be initiated before any invasive therapy". For invasive treatment selection, "Surgical and endovascular therapy (EVT) are likely to be similar in efficacy overall", and "Anatomic patency and hemodynamic improvement are considered necessary (although not sufficient) for clinical success of revascularization in IC". The guideline's minimum threshold states, "We suggest that a minimal effectiveness threshold for invasive therapy in IC be a > 50% likelihood of sustained clinical improvement for at least 2 years", with "Freedom from hemodynamically significant restenosis in the treated limb" as "a prerequisite for this goal".

Supporting evidence summaries state that smoking cessation reduces overall mortality and morbidity in smokers in general (quality of evidence A) and that there are no data on benefits and harms of surveillance for serial ABI testing in asymptomatic PAD (quality of evidence C).

### Current treatment of peripheral arterial disease: role of percutaneous interventional therapies [^113jH5Ro]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Despite advances in medical therapies to help prevent the development of atherosclerosis and improve the management of patients with established peripheral arterial disease (PAD), the prevalence of PAD and associated morbidity remains high. Over the past decade, percutaneous revascularization therapies for the treatment of patients with PAD have evolved tremendously, and a great number of patients can now be offered treatment options that are less invasive than traditional surgical options. With the surgical approach, there is significant symptomatic improvement, but the associated morbidity and mortality preclude its routine use. Although newer percutaneous treatment options are associated with lower procedural complications, the technical advances have outpaced the evaluation of these treatments in adequately designed clinical studies, and therapeutic options are available that may not have been rigorously investigated. Therefore, for physicians treating patients with PAD, an understanding of the various therapies available, along with the inherent benefits and limitations of each treatment option is imperative as a greater number of patients with PAD are being encountered.

4. Screening for Atherosclerotic Disease in Other Vascular Beds for the Patient with PAD

4.1. Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: Recommendation

4.2. Screening for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis in Other Arterial Beds (Coronary, Carotid, and Renal Arteries)

The prevalence of atherosclerosis in the coronary, carotid, and renal arteries is higher in patients with PAD than in those without pad.– However, intensive atherosclerosis risk factor modification in patients with PAD is justified regardless of the presence of disease in other arterial beds. Thus, the only justification for screening for disease in other arterial beds is if revascularization results in a reduced risk of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or death, and this has never been shown. Currently, there is no evidence to demonstrate that screening all patients with PAD for asymptomatic atherosclerosis in other arterial beds improves clinical outcome. Intensive treatment of risk factors through GDMT is the principle method for preventing adverse cardiovascular ischemic events from asymptomatic disease in other arterial beds.

Intermittent claudication — general considerations for invasive treatment: We recommend endovascular therapy (EVT) or surgical treatment of intermittent claudication (IC) for patients with significant functional or lifestyle-limiting disability when there is a reasonable likelihood of symptomatic improvement, after pharmacologic or exercise therapy has failed, and when the benefits outweigh the potential risks. We recommend an individualized approach to select an invasive treatment, and the modality offered should provide a reasonable likelihood of sustained benefit to the patient (> 50% likelihood of clinical efficacy for at least 2 years). For revascularization, anatomic patency (freedom from hemodynamically significant restenosis) is considered a prerequisite for sustained efficacy.

### Guardians of the sea: molecular and biochemical adaptations in sharks and whales for atherosclerosis resistance and their potential in human cardioprotection [^114RN3ja]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

The intention of this review is to examine the different cardiovascular characteristics of both sharks and whales to compare and contrast how the differences in lipid profile and vascular physiology may allow them to avoid the pathological ramifications of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis has historically been the predominant cardiovascular disease globally, with rising blood lipid levels, inflammation, and oxidative stress considered important driving forces in the disease's advancement. Atherosclerosis in humans preferentially affects coronary, cerebral, and femoral arteries, where plaque formation can have devastating consequences. This condition is particularly concerning as it often occurs alongside other cardiorenal and metabolic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and hypertension, which frequently co-occur due to shared pathophysiologic pathways. The interconnected nature of these conditions has led to recognition of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, a systemic disorder resulting from harmful interactions between metabolic risk factors, chronic kidney disease, and the cardiovascular system that leads to multiorgan damage and premature mortality. In contrast, whales demonstrate histological adaptations with thicker elastic laminae and reduced vasa vasorum, while sharks lack vasa vasorum entirely, a structural safeguard that may contribute to their resistance to atherosclerotic development. Currently, treatment options in humans include the prescription of lipid-lowering agents (e.g. statins), anti-inflammatory molecules (e.g. NSAIDs), and oxidative stress modulators (e.g. Vitamin C). While effective therapies exist that can improve metabolic, kidney, and cardiovascular outcomes, the high prevalence of these interconnected conditions represents both a public health challenge and an opportunity for novel therapeutic approaches. Alternative treatments tend to be diet- and lifestyle-based, and while the mechanisms of action of each of the conventional treatments differ, they all seek to alleviate or mitigate plaque build-up.

### Contemporary endovascular management of common femoral artery atherosclerotic disease [^117XXJQj]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Atherectomy

Debulking modalities in combination with drug-coated/eluting therapies are increasingly being used in the CFA. Currently available atherectomy catheters can be used to treat arteries up to 7 mm in diameter; the benefit is that atherectomy does not necessitate subsequent stenting. At the same time, the risk of peripheral emboli does necessitate use of intravascular filters to prevent distal occlusions. Furthermore, some CFAs are larger than 7 mm in diameter. In a retrospective study, the 12-month primary patency rate after vessel preparation with directional atherectomy (to debulk the lesion) before using a DCB was higher than with use of a DCB alone (88 versus 68 per cent). However, the difference was not statistically significant. An ongoing RCTis comparing the performance of directional atherectomy with DCB over CFAE. The inclusion of patients with claudication, however, might limit the reproducibility of the results. The use of a debulking catheter can be particularly helpful in patients with restenosis after CFAE or bypass-anastomosis stenosis, where re-exploring the groin might pose difficulties (Fig. 1).

Dyslipidemia management in PAD/IC — Treatment of dyslipidemia with statins reduces the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerosis. Patients with PAD were designated as high or very high risk and are advised to undergo treatment to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to < 100 mg/dL, or to < 70 mg/dL in very high-risk individuals. Although peripheral artery disease per se is not included in the suggested risk estimation algorithm, historical data suggest that all PAD patients would meet the suggested threshold of a 7.5% 10-year risk, and specific low-density lipoprotein targets have never been validated in the PAD population.

Popliteal and infrapopliteal interventions for intermittent claudication (IC) — durability and recommendations include that EVT of popliteal artery occlusive disease is technically feasible; however, its long-term durability is not known and, because flow-limiting dissection, occlusion, or perforation may necessitate a stent across the knee joint, it should be undertaken both with caution and some trepidation for claudication. In most circumstances, isolated tibial disease should not be undertaken for relief of claudication symptoms, tibial angioplasty durability is worse than superficial femoral artery (SFA) angioplasty, averaging < 40% at 3 years in patients undergoing treatment for limb salvage, and isolated infrapopliteal interventions are not recommended for patients with IC.

### The effect of menaquinone-7 supplementation on vascular calcification in patients with diabetes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114mR7cB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Another explanation for these results may concern the interpretation of 18 F-NaF PET activity as a marker of active calcification. 18 F-NaF PET activity is promising to detect early changes in active deposition of vascular calcification probably before calcifications become visible on CT, due to the binding of the tracer to hydroxyapatite, thereby enabling the detection of microcalcifications. Our study is the second trial using 18 F-NaF PET activity for treatment follow-up. One previous trial investigating the effect of etidronate on vascular calcification in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum found no effect on 18 F-NaF PET activity in the femoral artery, whereas CT images showed a significant reduction of vascular calcification in the intervention group. This challenges our understanding of what 18 F-NaF PET activity in femoral arteries actually represents. In addition, in some studies, some areas of macrocalcification showed no 18 F-NaF uptake, whereas other areas with microcalcification showed high 18 F-NaF uptake. Macrocalcifications have a larger volume but a small surface area, whereas microcalcifications have a large surface area. Because 18 F-NaF is only incorporated into the outer surface, our results might reveal a shift from macro- to microcalcification with MK-7 supplementation, by which 18 F-NaF uptake increases as seen in our results. In our study, changes in 18 F-NaF PET activity were directionally concordant with changes in calcification mass; therefore, this does not fully explain our results. Currently, multiple studies are investigating whether 18 F-NaF PET activity can identify the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque, which might shed light on the interpretation of our study results.

### Update on the pathophysiology and medical treatment of peripheral artery disease [^116aKQ4Z]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Approximately 6% of adults worldwide have atherosclerosis and thrombosis of the lower limb arteries (peripheral artery disease (PAD)) and the prevalence is rising. PAD causes leg pain, impaired health-related quality of life, immobility, tissue loss and a high risk of major adverse events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, amputation and death. In this Review, I describe the pathophysiology, presentation, outcome, preclinical research and medical management of PAD. Established treatments for PAD include antithrombotic drugs, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, and medications to treat dyslipidaemia, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that these treatments reduce the risk of major adverse events. The drug cilostazol, exercise therapy and revascularization are the current treatment options for the limb symptoms of PAD, but each has limitations. Novel therapies to promote collateral and new capillary growth and treat PAD-related myopathy are under investigation. Methods to improve the implementation of evidence-based medical management, novel drug therapies and rehabilitation programmes for PAD-related pain, functional impairment and ischaemic foot disease are important areas for future research.

### Patients with type 3 severe von Willebrand disease are not protected against atherosclerosis: results from a multicenter study in 47 patients [^114Y4Vg5]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The results of a number of studies in pigs and mice suggest that absence of von Willebrand factor (vWF) protects against the development of atherosclerosis. We studied whether patients with a complete deficiency of vWF (type 3 von Willebrand disease [vWD]) develop fewer atherosclerotic vessel wall changes than healthy controls.

Methods and Results

This study included 47 individuals with type 3 vWD and 84 healthy controls. Early atherosclerotic changes were assessed by measuring the thickness of the intima-media in the carotid and femoral arteries by B-mode ultrasonography. Advanced atherosclerotic changes were quantified by summing the maximal thickness of atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid and femoral arteries and were expressed as a plaque score. Established risk factors were determined to adjust for possible differences between the groups. We found no substantial difference in intima-media thickness between vWD patients and controls (adjusted difference for carotid artery 0.007 mm, 95% CI -0.022 to 0.036 mm; femoral artery 0.069 mm, 95% CI -0.056 to 0.19 mm). Similar proportions of patients and controls had atherosclerotic plaques (19% and 17%, respectively). No difference was found in the plaque score between groups (adjusted difference -0.22 mm, 95% CI -0.69 to 0.26). Among vWD patients, we found no effect of treatment with vWF concentrates on intima-media thickness or plaque score.

Conclusions

The results of this study indicate that vWF does not play a substantial role in human atherogenesis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of peripheral arterial disease [^11729Xmk]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is atherosclerosis leading to narrowing of the major arteries distal to the aortic arch. The most common presenting symptom is claudication; however, only 10% of patients have classic claudication. Approximately 8 to 12 million Americans have PAD, including 15% to 20% of adults older than 70 years. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) can be used to screen for and diagnose PAD in the primary care setting. An ABI of less than 0.9 is associated with a two- to fourfold increase in relative risk for cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. To improve cardiovascular risk stratification and risk factor modification, the American Diabetes Association recommends ABI screening for patients older than 50 years who have diabetes mellitus, and the American Heart Association recommends screening all patients 65 years and older and those 50 years and older who have a history of diabetes or smoking. Because there is no evidence that screening leads to fewer cardiovascular events or lower all-cause mortality, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening for PAD. Management of claudication includes exercise, smoking cessation, statin therapy, and antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel, and possibly cilostazol in patients with no history of heart failure. Surgical revascularization may be considered in patients with lifestyle-limiting claudication symptoms that do not respond to medical therapy.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116UfGTc]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Treatment and interventions — because PAD manifests systemic atherosclerosis in the lower limbs, treatment targets both lower limb ischemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Interventions to prevent CVD events include smoking cessation, lowering cholesterol levels, managing high blood pressure, and antiplatelet therapy, and patients with a low ABI may already be recommended for these treatments because the major PAD risk factors are used to calculate CVD risk.

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^112J68Ab]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery — femoropopliteal occlusive disease (FPOD) in intermittent claudication (IC) recommendations state the following: We recommend endovascular procedures over open surgery for focal occlusive disease of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) at or involving the origin at the femoral bifurcation. For focal lesions (< 5 cm) in the SFA that have unsatisfactory technical results with balloon angioplasty, we suggest selective stenting. For intermediate-length lesions (5–15 cm) in the SFA, we recommend the adjunctive use of self-expanding nitinol stents (with or without paclitaxel) to improve the midterm patency of angioplasty. We suggest the use of preoperative ultrasound vein mapping to establish the availability and quality of autogenous vein conduit in patients being considered for infragenual bypass for the treatment of IC. We recommend against endovascular therapy (EVT) of isolated infrapopliteal disease for IC because this treatment is of unproven benefit and possibly harmful. We recommend surgical bypass as an initial revascularization strategy for patients with diffuse femoropopliteal disease, small caliber (< 5 mm), or extensive calcification of the SFA, if they have favorable anatomy for bypass (popliteal artery target, good runoff) and have average or low operative risk. We recommend using the saphenous vein as the preferred conduit for infragenual bypass grafts. In the absence of suitable vein, we suggest using prosthetic conduit for femoropopliteal bypass in claudicant patients, if the above-knee popliteal artery is the target vessel and good runoff is present.

### Femoropopliteal endovascular intervention: a review of the current landscape [^115zYWNA]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Superficial femoral artery disease poses significant challenges in patients with peripheral artery disease due to its unique anatomic and physiological characteristics. While conservative measures remain the initial approach for chronic, stable symptoms, endovascular therapies have gained prominence due to their minimally invasive nature, expedited recovery times, and preservation of future treatment options when performed correctly. Options for endovascular interventions include balloon angioplasty (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [standard], drug-coated balloon), stenting (bare metal, drug-eluting, covered stents), with or without adjunct therapy (atherectomy or intravascular lithotripsy). Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated superior outcomes with drug-coated balloons and drug-eluting stents over bare metal stents or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty alone, particularly in long, heavily calcified lesions. However, challenges such as in-stent restenosis, stent fracture, and in-stent thrombosis persist, driving ongoing innovation in device technology and drug formulations on devices. Emerging therapies such as bioresorbable scaffolds and percutaneous bypass devices offer promising alternatives. Further research is needed to refine treatment strategies, minimize risks, and optimize outcomes.

Femoropopliteal disease — clinical severity definitions and assessment — Clinically relevant femoral-popliteal disease is defined as a ≥ 70% diameter stenosis, with moderate lesions defined as 50–69% and mild lesions consisting of < 50% diameter stenosis. The severity and clinical impact of a lesion is also affected by its length, reference vessel diameter, arterial calcification, and quantity of atherosclerotic plaque (plaque burden), and at this time, there are no published data regarding the use of translesional pressure gradients to assess the severity of femoropopliteal peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

Exercise therapy for intermittent claudication (IC) — expected magnitude of benefit is modest, as a recent prospective study found absolute walking distance improvement with a home-based exercise program, the only type available to most patients, was 90 feet, and the effect of such a modest improvement on functional ability and quality of life may be inadequate for many patients.

### Emergency point-of-care ultrasound diagnosis of a femoral artery pseudoaneurysm [^112CEZm9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Iatrogenic femoral artery pseudoaneurysm formation after intervention of the femoral artery may present weeks after intervention. We report a case of a patient with delayed pseudoaneurysm diagnosis that was ultimately diagnosed with bedside ultrasound. Importantly, our case demonstrates a patient who had a left-sided atherectomy and angioplasty with microcatheter access of the right femoral artery.

Case Report

A 68-year-old man with multiple comorbidities presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with right inguinal pain, swelling, and overlying skin changes 17 days after an interventional radiology-guided left-sided femoral artery atherectomy and angioplasty. His first postoperative ED visit at an outside hospital led to the diagnosis of a hematoma vs. abscess, with attempted bedside drainage. On presentation to our ED, a bedside ultrasound confirmed arterial pseudoaneurysm formation of the right femoral artery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? In patients presenting with the constellation of symptoms after arterial site intervention of either side, iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm should be in the differential. Although the patient had atherectomy and angioplasty of the left femoral artery, it is important to highlight that both femoral arteries were accessed during intervention, and thus, both sites are at risk for pseudoaneurysm formation. Emergency sonography can be a useful tool to diagnose, expedite treatment, and avoid potentially harmful invasive procedures in patients presenting with pain and swelling after arterial site intervention.

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^117G1Rnr]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Revascularization for intermittent claudication (IC) — patient selection should prioritize functional impairment and quality of life rather than physiologic or anatomic tests; justification for interventions for IC is not based primarily on physiologic (eg, ABI) measures or anatomic findings, and promoting intervention in an individual with mild disability based on physiologic or imaging studies is strongly discouraged. With intensive medical management, < 5% of patients will develop symptoms of advanced ischemia or will ultimately require amputation, but a significant minority (20%-30%) will develop increased disability over time that warrants intervention. Performing prophylactic interventions in patients with IC that is minimally symptomatic or well tolerated has no benefit, may cause harm, and is never indicated. Determining functional impairment is not straightforward and should be assessed from the patient's perspective; physiologic testing and anatomic imaging correlate relatively poorly with disability (resting ABI is a modest predictor). Numerous studies have demonstrated that both endovascular and surgical therapy relieve claudication (reducing pain, improving walking distance, and gains in QoL and ambulatory function), and both forms of revascularization appear superior to medical therapy for limb-related outcomes, although not necessarily to supervised exercise training. Pharmacologic treatment with cilostazol is a moderately effective and less expensive alternative to invasive treatment and may be appropriate in some patients.

### Role of comorbidities as limiting factors to the effect of hyperbaric oxygen in diabetic foot patients: a retrospective analysis [^116phH39]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Among the 51 non-operated PAD patients of the current study, 21 (41%) had atherosclerotic changes placed below the knee, 30 (58%) had these changes placed both above and below the knee (Fig. 1) in accordance to atherosclerosis of diabetes.

The present study used the arterial scorings of these patients to compare the PAD conditions and outcomes of those who were treated with HBOT. The scorings of each artery from the aorta to the pedal arteries were not associated with the outcomes. Although not significant, the P values related to the superficial femoral and posterior tibial arterial scorings (P = 0.070, P = 0.069, respectively) were distinctly lower than other single arteries (Table 3). On the other hand, depending on the average scorings of the four arterial levels, the results demonstrate that there is a significant relationship to HBOT outcomes at the femoral arterial level (P = 0.048, Table 3), but not at the others. This suggests that wherever atherosclerotic changes were placed, only the femoral arterial locations affect the outcomes of HBOT negatively. Therefore, in the presence of femoral atherosclerotic lesions, attention must be given to vascular interventions before HBOT is initiated. In contrast, PAD below the knee does not seem to be an obstacle to the efficacy of HBOT in the treatment of diabetic foot.

### Effects of initial and long-term lipid-lowering therapy on vascular wall characteristics [^112BvKVS]. Atherosclerosis (2001). Low credibility.

Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of 3 hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors on vascular properties, but little is known about treatment intensification. We compared patients in whom statins were started (INITIAL, n = 30) for hypercholesterolaemia (> 6.5 mmol l(-1)) with a matched patient group of long-time statin users, with similar baseline characteristics for lipids, intima-media thickness (IMT), and pulse wave velocity, in whom treatment with statins was intensified (LONG-TERM, n = 54). At baseline and after 1 year, lipid profile, IMT of the carotid and femoral arteries, aortic distensibility using pulse-wave velocity and various properties of the peripheral vascular bed using a recently developed bio-impedance method were measured. After 1 year the relative changes in lipid profile were significantly better in the INITIAL compared with the LONG-TERM-group. The relative changes in IMT of the mean internal carotid and common femoral arteries significantly differed between the INITIAL and LONG-TERM-group (-8 and +11%, -11 and +22%, respectively). After 1 year, in both groups, most other vascular wall characteristics were unaltered compared with baseline. In conclusion, the beneficial structural alterations of the vascular wall were greater after starting than after intensifying already existing lipid-lowering treatment. This suggests that other effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors than lipid-lowering alone must be involved in vascular changes.

Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

2.5 Study endpoints through 2 years

At 24 months, the efficacy endpoint was primary patency at 24 months following the index procedure, defined as freedom from CD‐TLR and freedom from restenosis as determined by DUS‐derived peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) ≤ 2.4. Each component of the endpoint was independently adjudicated by the blinded CEC (for CD‐TLR) or by the core laboratories (for restenosis). CD‐TLR was defined as re‐intervention at the target lesion due to symptoms or decrease in ankle‐brachial index (ABI) ≥ 20% or > 0.15, when compared with post‐procedure baseline ABI. At 24 months, the safety composite endpoint was freedom from device‐ and procedure‐related death through 30 days, and freedom from target limb major amputation and clinically driven target vessel revascularization (CD‐TVR) through 24 months post index procedure. Severe calcification was adjudicated by the core laboratory, and defined as: "visible calcium along both sides of the arterial wall, covering 2 cm or greater of the target lesion area, encompassing > 50% of the total target lesion treatment area by visual estimate and/or the calcium is circumferential (360°) in nature (i.e. on both sides of the vessel lumen extending 2 cm or greater on a single AP view), significantly impeding blood flow in the vessel".

Other endpoints included MAEs at 24 months, defined as death from any cause, CD‐TVR, major target limb amputation, and thrombosis at the target lesion site. Thrombosis was defined as a total occlusion due to thrombus formation which is rapidly evolving as confirmed by sudden onset of symptoms and documented by DUS and/or angiography. Additional assessments included individual components of the MAE composite, binary restenosis (PSVR > 2.4) of the target lesion and primary sustained clinical improvement (defined as freedom from target limb amputation, freedom from TVR, and an improvement shift of one Rutherford class at 12 months). Functional assessments included general appraisal through administration of the EuroQOL (EQ‐5D), a 5‐dimension generic health status questionnaire, six‐minute walk test and evaluation of walking capacity using the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ).

### Medical treatment of peripheral arterial disease: a comprehensive review [^116VR4bY]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common manifestation of atherosclerosis that affects more than 10 million people in the United States. The risk factors associated with PAD are similar to those found in patients with coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease. Medical therapy of PAD must include modification of cardiovascular risk factors with application of strict secondary prevention guidelines. For improvement in quality of life, a structured exercise rehabilitation program remains the most effective noninterventional treatment strategy, but it is difficult to employ from economic and patient-compliance perspectives. Newer pharmacologic therapies have demonstrated efficacy in patients with intermittent claudication. Emerging strategies for management of these patients include revascularization and maximal medical therapy for improvement of physical function as well as reduction in risk for subsequent major cardiovascular events. This article will review the clinical data supporting aggressive medical interventions for patients with PAD.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113b1nfo]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Aortic occlusion — diagnosis, presentation, and revascularization strategy: Aortic occlusion most often follows extensive atherosclerotic disease and can be acute or chronic; computed tomography angiography (CTA) is most useful to identify the occlusion, determine cause, and define extent, and occlusion typically occurs below the renal arteries but can arise above this level with renal or visceral malperfusion. Treatment in acute presentations is typically surgical, including open embolectomy for embolus or aorto-iliac and femoral reconstruction for atherosclerotic occlusion. Chronic occlusion can occasionally be asymptomatic due to collateralization, but more commonly presents with lower extremity claudication and may include buttock claudication, central core muscle weakness, and impotence in males from pelvic malperfusion. Revascularization options include endovascular, open aortic or extra-anatomic bypass, and hybrid approaches; no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown an advantage for any procedure, and open aortic reconstructions have improved long-term patency compared with less invasive options but at higher perioperative risk.

### Lower extremity bypass vs endovascular therapy for young patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease [^114bXtun]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The uncertainty continues over the best approach to patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Medical therapy and risk factor modification is part of any treatment regimen; with this there is little disagreement. However, with the introduction of lesser invasive percutaneous technologies, the discussion regarding surgical and endovascular therapies has become more and more complicated. Unfortunately, there is a relative shortage of robust outcomes data to support many of our specific treatment recommendations. Younger patients are an especially troublesome patient cohort. They have consistently shown poorer outcomes after any intervention compared with older patients and may represent a subset of more aggressive atherosclerotic disease. Our debaters will discuss their preferred approaches to these difficult patients in the context of the currently available supporting literature.

### Statin prescription is essential in peripheral vascular disease [^111tN2JH]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Hypercholesterolemia is an important and easily modifiable risk factor for peripheral arterial disease (PAD), but is frequently not adequately addressed by vascular interventionists. Patients with PAD often have extensive atherosclerotic disease elsewhere and have a 1-year mortality rate as high as 20%, mainly from cardiovascular events. This case discussion briefly addresses the evidence for treating hypercholesterolemia in this subgroup of patients. Statins not only lower cholesterol, but also are antiinflammatory, antiproliferative, and antithrombogenic, and improve endothelial function. Current guidelines are reviewed and an approach to initiation of statins and their management is discussed.

### Endoluminal atherosclerotic plaque debulking using enzymatic and ultrasonic energy [^113BSaBG]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Current procedures to treat severe atherosclerosis are traumatic to the arterial wall and often result in restenosis due to neointimal hyperplasia. We developed a novel therapy using a specially designed double occlusion balloon catheter, ultrasonic wire, and enzymatic digestion solution to atraumatically debulk atherosclerotic plaques.

Materials and Methods

A combination of different enzymes, chemicals, and treatment conditions were evaluated for its effect at reducing atherosclerotic plaque harvested from human carotid artery endarterectomies ex vivo. The optimized digestion solution was examined in harvested intact human superficial femoral arteries in situ. A conventional Yorkshire/Landrace and a genetically modified Yucatan minipig homozygous for a nonfunctional LDLR mutation were used to evaluate the endovascular therapy in nonatherosclerotic and atherosclerotic environments in vivo.

Results

Ex vivo, the technology successfully digested human carotid artery plaques by 75%. In situ, the therapy successfully reduced plaque area in harvested superficial femoral arteries by 46%. In vivo, the endovascular therapy was technically feasible and demonstrated initial safety with no thrombosis, dissection, or aneurysmal dilatation in a nonatherosclerotic porcine model. In an atherosclerotic porcine model, the therapy demonstrated initial efficacy by successfully reducing atherosclerotic plaque while preserving the arterial wall with an intact internal elastic lamina.

Conclusions

Using human plaque, human artery, and a normal and atherosclerotic pig model, we demonstrated that delivery of our therapy to the vasculature is technically feasible, appears safe, and shows initial efficacy. Our percutaneous plaque debulking method is a unique and promising therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis and warrants further study.

Society for Vascular Surgery guideline — exercise therapy for intermittent claudication (IC) issues the following directives. We recommend as first-line therapy a supervised exercise program consisting of walking a minimum of three times per week (30–60 min/session) for at least 12 weeks to all suitable patients with IC. We recommend home-based exercise, with a goal of at least 30 minutes of walking three to five times per week when a supervised exercise program is unavailable or for long-term benefit after a supervised exercise program is completed. In patients who have undergone revascularization therapy for IC, we recommend exercise (either supervised or home based) for adjunctive functional benefits. We recommend that patients with IC be followed up annually to assess compliance with lifestyle measures (smoking cessation, exercise) and medical therapies as well as to determine if there is evidence of progression in symptoms or signs of PAD. Yearly ankle-brachial index (ABI) testing may be of value to provide objective evidence of disease progression.

### The next 10 years in the management of peripheral artery disease: perspectives from the 'PAD 2009' conference [^117BWhGb]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To briefly inform on the conclusions from a conference on the next 10 years in the management of peripheral artery disease (PAD).

Design Of The Conference

International participation, invited presentations and open discussion were based on the following issues: Why is PAD under-recognised? Health economic impact of PAD; funding of PAD research; changes of treatment options? Aspects on clinical trials and regulatory views; and the role of guidelines.

Results and Conclusions

A relative lack of knowledge about cardiovascular risk and optimal management of PAD patients exists not only among the public, but also in parts of the health-care system. Specialists are required to act for improved information. More specific PAD research is needed for risk management and to apply the best possible evaluation of evidence for treatment strategies. Better strategies for funding are required based on, for example, public/private initiatives. The proportion of endovascular treatments is steadily increasing, more frequently based on observational studies than on randomised controlled trials. The role of guidelines is therefore important to guide the profession in the assessment of most relevant treatment.

### Comparison of atorvastatin 5 and 20 mg / D for reducing F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in atherosclerotic plaques on positron emission tomography / computed tomography: a randomized, investigator-blinded, open-label, 6-month study in Japanese adults scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention [^111XZPDU]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is a useful tool for the detection of local inflamed atherosclerotic lesions.

Objective

This study used hybrid PET/computed tomography (CT) to examine the effects of 2 doses of atorvastatin on (18)F-FDG uptake in atherosclerotic plaques in Japanese adults with stable angina pectoris who were scheduled to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, open-label study in patients with dyslipidemia (total cholesterol ≥ 220 mg/dL and/or LDL-C ≥ 140 mg/dL) who were scheduled to undergo PCI for stable angina pectoris and had not received any lipid-lowering drugs within 1 year before enrollment. Patients were randomly allocated to receive atorvastatin 5 or 20 mg/d for 6 months. At baseline (the day after PCI), (18)F-FDG uptake in the ascending aorta and femoral artery was determined using PET/CT imaging, and the mean target-to-background ratio (TBR) was calculated in individual plaques. The same regions were assessed by PET/CT after 6 months of treatment. Changes from baseline to follow-up in the lipid profile, serum malondialdehyde-modified LDL-C (MDA-LDL-C), and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were also examined. Drug adherence, adverse events, and changes in medications were monitored at monthly outpatient visits.

Results

Of 32 patients initially screened, 2 were excluded due to newly diagnosed cancer; thus, 30 patients were randomly assigned to treatment, 15 in each group. Patients were predominantly male (18 [60%]), with a mean (SD) age of 54 (11) years, mean body weight of 65 (12) kg, and mean total cholesterol, HDL-C, and triglyceride concentrations of 240 (29), 48 (14), and 180 (102) mg/dL, respectively. After 6 months, the 20-mg group had significant reductions from baseline in mean (SD) TBR in the ascending aorta (from 1.15 [0.14] to 1.05 [0.12]; percent change, -7.9% [9.4%]; P = 0.007) and the femoral artery (from 1.12 [0.11] to 1.02 [0.11]; percent change, -9.9% [13.8%]; P = 0.012). The corresponding changes from baseline were not statistically significant in the 5-mg group. The differences in percent change in TBR in the 2 locations were not significant between groups. When data from the 2 groups were combined, the overall reduction in TBR from baseline to 6 months was significant in both the ascending aorta (P = 0.003) and the femoral artery (P = 0.021). The decreases in TBR in both arteries were significantly correlated with reductions in LDL-C (ascending aorta: r(2) = 0.230 [P = 0.012]; femoral artery: r(2) = 0.338 [P = 0.003]), MDA-LDL-C (ascending aorta: r(2) = 0.183 [P = 0.028]; femoral artery: r(2) = 0.247 [P = 0.010]), and hs-CRP (ascending aorta: r(2) = 0.132 [P = 0.048]; femoral artery: r(2) = 0.271 [P = 0.007]). One patient in the 5-mg group and 2 patients in the 20-mg group had ∼2-fold increases in serum aminotransferases on a single occasion; however, no specific musculoskeletal or hepatic adverse events were observed, and aminotransferase values decreased to within normal ranges without changes in the atorvastatin dose.

Conclusion

Six months of treatment with atorvastatin 20 mg, but not 5 mg, was associated with a significant reduction in TBR in the ascending aorta and femoral artery in these Japanese adults with dyslipidemia undergoing PCI for stable angina pectoris.

AIOD in IC — special populations, imaging, and bypass considerations include that in younger patients (age < 50 years) with IC, we recommend a shared decision-making approach to engage patients and inform them of the possibility of inferior outcomes with either endovascular or surgical interventions. We recommend either axial imaging (eg, CT, MR) or catheter-based angiography for evaluation and planning of surgical revascularization for AIOD. When performing surgical bypass for aortoiliac disease, concomitant aneurysmal disease of the aorta or iliac arteries should be treated as appropriate (exclusion) and is a contraindication to end-to-side proximal anastomoses. For any bypass graft originating from the CFA, the donor iliac artery must be free of hemodynamically significant disease or any pre-existing disease should be corrected before performing the bypass graft.

Revascularization Strategies

Revascularization of occlusive lesions in PAD becomes more challenging with increasing arterial length and decreasing arterial diameter (Figure 1). With the exception of aortoiliac (common femoral) artery disease, surgical bypass is no longer the recommended frontline treatment for medically refractory PAD in American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Endovascular interventions are now the dominant therapy, conducted roughly 4 times more frequently than bypass surgery. Stenoses of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and contiguous popliteal artery, constituting the femoropopliteal (FP) segment, are the most common cause of symptomatic PAD, accounting for more than 70% of cases.

Revascularization of occlusive lesions in peripheral artery disease (PAD) becomes more challenging with decreasing arterial diameter (left) and increasing lesion length (right).

The FP arterial segment represents a unique challenge for revascularization, with several important distinctions from the coronary circulation. The FP segment is extremely long and subject to highly dynamic forces of flexion, extension, and torsion associated with leg and knee movement. These mechanical deformations predispose the vessel to chronic injury, increased smooth muscle cell proliferation, accelerated atherosclerosis, and restenosis. When self-expanding nitinol stents are deployed, their chronic outward force accentuates these issues and may increase risk of in-stent restenosis. Considering the complexity of the anatomy and dynamics of FP disease, clinically durable therapies have proven elusive. Concurrently, there has been a steady rise in PAD interventions, with a 25% increase in procedures in the United States from 2011 to 2016.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects over 8 million people in the United States alone. Although great strides have been made in reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease the prevalence of PAD is expected to rise with the age of global population. PAD characterized by narrowing of arterial blood can be asymptomatic or cause limb threatening claudication. It has been classically treated with bypass, but these techniques have been supplanted by endovascular therapy. Plain old balloon angioplasty has been successful in helping revascularize lesions, but its effect has not been durable because of restenosis. This prompted the creation of several technologies aimed at reducing restenosis. These advances slowly improved outcomes and the durability of endovascular management. Among the main tools used in current endovascular practice are drug-delivery devices aimed at inhibiting the inflammatory and proliferative pathways that lead to restenosis. This article examines the current drug-delivery technologies used in the superficial femoral artery.

Evidence review and ERCs — writing committee members review the literature, assess quality of evidence for or against tests, treatments, or procedures, and use evidence-based methodologies drawing on all available data; searches focus on randomized controlled trials but also include registries, nonrandomized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and expert opinion, with only selected references cited; independent Evidence Review Committees (ERCs) include methodologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, and biostatisticians, use PICOTS (population, intervention, comparator, outcome, timing, setting), and are limited by practical considerations to evidence relevant to key questions that can affect the strength of recommendations.

Drug therapy for patients with PVD includes several options. In a recent meta-analysis, 17 antiplatelet therapy was evaluated for risk reduction in serious vascular events including stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or death from a vascular cause. Among patients with PVD, antiplatelet therapy was associated with an absolute risk reduction of 22 events per 1, 000 patients treated for two years. 25 The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation trial demonstrated that ramipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with PVD by 25 percent. 26, 27 Patients did not have to be hypertensive in the HOPE trial, and the reduction in morbidity and mortality was beyond what was expected for the amount of blood pressure reduction.

If these results can be replicated, most patients with PVD would benefit from ramipril or any ACE inhibitor shown to have this effect, provided the physician monitors serum creatinine levels for deterioration when occult renal artery stenosis is present. Anticoagulants have not shown any benefit in treating patients with intermittent claudication. 28 Heparin has been shown to be beneficial in reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with acute limb ischemia while they are being evaluated for further treatment.
12. Beyond medical therapy for intermittent claudication, patients who progress to critical or acute limb ischemia face several treatment options. These include endovascular stenting, intra-arterial thrombolytic drugs, angioplasty, angioplasty combined with brachytherapy, and bypass grafting. To date, there are no firm evidence-based criteria for deciding which patients will benefit from a given procedure. Factors to be considered in such situations are location of lesion, patient-related risks, surgery-related risks, type of clot, and contra-indications to thrombolysis. 12 Antiplatelet therapy is recommended for patients who have undergone bypass grafting. 12 One agent, ticlopidine, demonstrated increased saphenous graft patency in patients who were followed for two years after surgery. 29.
