## Question

A 42-year-old woman comes to her primary care physician because of an irritating sensation in her nose. She noticed recently that there seems to be a lump in her nose. Her past medical history is significant for pain that seems to migrate around her body and is refractory to treatment. She has intermittently been taking a medication for the pain and recently increased the dose of the drug. Which of the following processes was most likely responsible for development of this patient's complaint?
A. Decreased lipoxygenase pathway activity
B. Decreased prostaglandin activity
C. Increased allergic reaction in mucosa
D. Increased lipoxygenase pathway activity

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pathophysiologic mechanism best explains the development of a nasal mass in a patient with chronic pain who recently increased NSAID dosing, considering options related to lipoxygenase activity, prostaglandin activity, and allergic reactions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical phenotype and whether it fits a known NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease pattern. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic mechanism of NSAIDs and how COX-1 inhibition perturbs arachidonic acid metabolism. Next, I will examine the evidence for a shunt toward the 5-lipoxygenase pathway and the downstream mediators that could drive nasal polyps. After that, I should review corroborating clinical and translational data in AERD, including lipidomic findings and receptor-level consequences. Finally, I will weigh the competing options and conclude with the most likely mechanism supported by the literature.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype. The patient is a middle-aged woman with a nasal mass and a history of chronic pain requiring NSAIDs, recently escalated, which raises concern for NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), a classic triad of asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and hypersensitivity reactions to COX-1–inhibiting NSAIDs. Importantly, AERD is nonallergic and mechanistically driven by eicosanoid dysregulation rather than IgE-mediated allergy, so I need to keep that distinction in mind as I proceed [^116dpq1T] [^11743yBH].

> I need to check the pharmacologic mechanism next. NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (and often COX-2), which reduces prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis. In AERD, baseline PGE2 is already relatively low, so further COX-1 inhibition removes a key brake on the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway, shunting arachidonic acid toward leukotriene production and amplifying type 2 inflammation, edema, and polyp growth. This is the central pathobiology of AERD and directly links NSAID use to nasal disease in this phenotype [^11743yBH] [^116dpq1T] [^111xbaUg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify the downstream effectors. The 5-LO pathway generates cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) and LTB4, which promote eosinophil and mast cell activation, mucosal edema, mucus hypersecretion, and fibroproliferative changes that underlie nasal polyposis; clinically, AERD patients show markedly elevated urinary LTE4 and increased cysteinyl leukotriene production during NSAID challenge, consistent with this shunt biology and the observed nasal mass in this case [^114p5Eih] [^116dpq1T] [^11743yBH].

> Next, I should review corroborating translational data. Let me consider lipidomic studies in AERD: during COX-1 inhibition, patients demonstrate increased cysteinyl leukotrienes and a relative deficiency of counterregulatory mediators such as 15-HETE and lipoxin A4, which normally restrain type 2 inflammation. Lower baseline 15-HETE predicts greater nasal ILC2 accumulation and worse clinical outcomes, reinforcing the concept that a COX–LOX imbalance, rather than a primary allergic process, drives disease severity and polyp biology [^115PZ4VP] [^1172znP4] [^116dpq1T].

> I will now examine the competing options systematically. Option A proposes decreased lipoxygenase activity, which would be expected to reduce leukotrienes and thus would not explain a proinflammatory nasal mass. Conversely, the evidence shows increased 5-LO activity in AERD, so A is inconsistent with the data and I should rule it out [^116dpq1T] [^113sFUCg]. Option B suggests decreased prostaglandin activity; wait, let me verify — this is partially correct in that PGE2 is reduced by NSAIDs, but the pathologic consequence is disinhibition of the 5-LO pathway, so "decreased prostaglandin activity" alone is incomplete and misleading as a final mechanism for the nasal mass, making B insufficient [^113sFUCg] [^116dpq1T]. Option C posits increased allergic reaction in mucosa; I should double-check — AERD is a nonallergic, pseudoallergic syndrome, so attributing this to a primary allergic process would misclassify the pathophysiology, even though type 2 inflammation is prominent in the airway mucosa [^116dpq1T] [^11743yBH]. Option D states increased lipoxygenase pathway activity, which aligns with the COX-1 inhibition–induced shunt, the rise in cysteinyl leukotrienes, and the polyp-promoting milieu in AERD, making it the most mechanistically coherent choice here [^113sFUCg] [^11743yBH].

> But wait, what if the nasal mass is unrelated to NSAIDs and represents a neoplasm or another noninflammatory process? I should confirm that the vignette's timing with NSAID escalation, the chronic pain context implying NSAID exposure, and the classic AERD phenotype strongly favor an inflammatory polyp rather than a neoplasm; moreover, the mechanistic literature directly connects COX-1 inhibition to 5-LO–driven nasal disease in AERD, which strengthens the causal interpretation in this case [^116dpq1T] [^11743yBH].

> Conclusion: The most likely process responsible for the nasal mass in this patient is increased lipoxygenase pathway activity due to NSAID-induced COX-1 inhibition, which reduces PGE2 and unleashes 5-LO–mediated leukotriene production, driving eosinophilic inflammation, mucosal edema, and nasal polyp formation consistent with AERD pathophysiology [^113sFUCg] [^116dpq1T] [^114p5Eih].

The most likely process responsible for the patient's nasal complaint is **increased lipoxygenase pathway activity** [^116dpq1T] due to NSAID-induced COX inhibition, which shunts arachidonic acid toward leukotrienes and causes nasal inflammation and polyp formation [^111xbaUg]. This mechanism is supported by the clinical pattern of NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) [^11743yBH], characterized by chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and aspirin sensitivity [^116dpq1T]. The other options are less consistent with this presentation: decreased lipoxygenase or prostaglandin activity would not explain the inflammatory mass, and an allergic reaction alone does not account for the NSAID trigger and polyp phenotype [^116dpq1T].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of NSAID-induced nasal symptoms

NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and **shunting arachidonic acid metabolism toward the lipoxygenase pathway** [^116dpq1T], which increases leukotriene production [^111xbaUg]. Leukotrienes are potent pro-inflammatory mediators that cause vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, mucus production, and recruitment of inflammatory cells, leading to nasal congestion, polyp formation, and chronic rhinosinusitis [^114HsJkh].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting increased lipoxygenase pathway activity

Several studies and clinical guidelines support the role of increased lipoxygenase pathway activity in NSAID-induced nasal symptoms:

- **Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD)**: AERD is characterized by chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, asthma, and hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs. The pathogenesis involves COX inhibition leading to increased leukotriene production via the lipoxygenase pathway, causing inflammation and polyp formation [^116dpq1T] [^11743yBH].

- **Leukotriene modifiers**: Leukotriene receptor antagonists (e.g. montelukast) and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors (e.g. zileuton) are effective in managing nasal symptoms in AERD, further supporting the role of the lipoxygenase pathway in this condition [^notfound].

- **Clinical guidelines**: The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines recognize the involvement of the lipoxygenase pathway in NSAID-induced respiratory symptoms and recommend leukotriene modifiers as part of the management strategy [^notfound].

## Comparison with other proposed mechanisms

| **Mechanism** | **Relevance to patient's symptoms** | **Supporting evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Decreased lipoxygenase pathway activity | - Unlikely <br/> - Would reduce leukotriene production and inflammation | - Contradicted by clinical evidence of increased leukotrienes in AERD [^116dpq1T] [^11743yBH] |
| Decreased prostaglandin activity | - Partially relevant <br/> - COX inhibition reduces prostaglandins <br/> - But this alone does not explain the inflammatory mass | - Prostaglandins have anti-inflammatory roles <br/> - Their reduction alone does not account for polyp formation [^113sFUCg] |
| Increased allergic reaction in mucosa | - Unlikely <br/> - No clear evidence of allergic reaction in the patient's history <br/> - NSAID-induced symptoms are non-allergic | - NSAID-induced nasal symptoms are mediated by leukotrienes <br/> - Not IgE-mediated allergies [^116dpq1T] [^114HsJkh] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Understanding the role of increased lipoxygenase pathway activity in NSAID-induced nasal symptoms has important clinical implications. Management strategies include:

- **Avoidance of NSAIDs**: Patients with known NSAID sensitivity should avoid NSAIDs to prevent exacerbation of nasal symptoms [^116dpq1T].

- **Leukotriene modifiers**: Montelukast and zileuton are effective in managing nasal symptoms by blocking leukotriene receptors or inhibiting leukotriene synthesis [^116WWEKS].

- **Aspirin desensitization**: In selected patients, aspirin desensitization followed by chronic aspirin therapy may reduce nasal polyp burden and improve symptoms [^notfound].

---

Increased lipoxygenase pathway activity is the most likely process responsible for the patient's nasal complaint, driven by NSAID-induced COX inhibition and leukotriene overproduction. This mechanism aligns with the clinical features of AERD and is supported by clinical evidence and guidelines [^116dpq1T] [^116KtDab].

Arachidonic acid metabolism

Arachidonic acid (AA) is a 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid and is the main precursor of eicosanoids, mediating important functions in homeostasis, inflammation and immunoregulation. Under normal conditions AA is not freely available and its concentration within the cell is very low. The availability of free AA is essential for the biosynthesis of eicosanoids. Upon activation of the cell and by the action of various phospholipases (preferentially cytosolic phospholipase A 2) AA is released from the membrane phospholipids. Therefore, once released, AA is rapidly metabolized through three enzymatic pathways namely cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LO), and cytochrome oxidases (hydrolase, epoxygenase) and one non-enzymatic pathway.

Lipoxygenase pathway

AA, which is esterified on plasma membrane phospholipids, is released and converted into leukotriene (LT) A 4 through 5-LO activity (Figure 1). LTA 4 is subsequently converted by LTA 4 hydrolase into LTB 4 and by LTC 4 synthase, which conjugates reduced glutathione into LTC 4. This is metabolized into LTD 4, which is then metabolized into LTE 4. LTC 4, LTD 4 and LTE 4 are designated as cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs). LTs are synthesized upon cellular activation and the intracellular expression and distribution of 5-LO varies considering the cell type. In the airways, 5-LO is present in several types of leukocytes and becomes activated during allergic inflammation. CysLTs activate three receptors with differential selectivity (CysLT 1, CysLT 2 and GPR17) and the stimulation of these receptors, principally CysLT 1, account for most of its effects. This receptor is expressed in a large variety of cells which include monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, neutrophils, T cells, B lymphocytes, pluripotent hematopoietic cells, interstitial cells of the nasal mucosa (NM), airway smooth muscle cells, bronchial fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells and its activation contributes to most of the effects of CysLTs that are relevant to the pathophysiological changes observed in patients with asthma.

### Fatty acid desaturation and lipoxygenase pathways support trained immunity [^117EHC8e]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

On the other hand, BCG may also induce the modulation of long-chain PUFA-derived LM via the regulation of LXRs. Macrophage LXRα expression was shown to be induced by a NOD2 ligand, which is a relevant intracellular receptor in the host response elicited by mycobacteriaand for BCG-induced trained immunity. Indeed, LXR activity supports BCG-induced trained immunity since LXR antagonism blocks BCG-induced inflammatory responses to TLR2 restimulation. In this line, we also observed a decrease in the response to TLR4 restimulation upon LXR inhibition of BCG-trained macrophages. LXRs are regulators of both lipid metabolism and inflammation. LXR decreases inflammatory responses since its activation can promote membrane lipid remodeling and increase membrane rigidity, thus blunting the TLR signaling cascade. In mice exposed to LPS, LXR agonist administration led to a decrease in inflammatory gene expression, and LXR-deficient macrophages show a defect in efferocytosis and a more pronounced pro-inflammatory phenotype. The impact of LXR signaling on macrophage phenotype appears to be context-dependent but it is an attractive possible regulator of LM synthesis, necessary for the induction of BCG-trained immunity.

Downstream metabolism of long-chain PUFA involves the transformation into bioactive signaling lipids through oxidation by the action of COX, LOX, CP450, and non-enzymatic pathways. Thromboxane and PGs, derived from AA through COX activity, are released by myeloid cells and modulate their migration, differentiation, and effector function. C. albicans and BCG increase COX-2 expression and PGE 2 production –. Indeed, acute stimulation of human monocytes with BCG increased PGE 2 intracellular concentrations, but after the differentiation period, PGE 2 concentrations were unchanged between trained and naive macrophages. However, despite this acute increase in PGE 2 concentrations, inhibition of COX activity or inhibition of prostanoid receptors did not modulate inflammatory responses of restimulated macrophages. In contrast, PGE 2 exogenous supplementation decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production induced by LPS five days after the stimulation with the LM. This result is in line with the well-known anti-inflammatory effects of PGE 2, and with the concept that "the beginning programs the end" in inflammation resolution. Also, trained immunity programs rely on the potentiation of glycolysis and oxidative respiration, and PGE 2 has been shown to suppress both pathways. Taken together, the COX pathway plays an important immunological role but not in the induction of BCG-trained immunity.

### Fatty acid desaturation and lipoxygenase pathways support trained immunity [^115u3w1t]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Infections and vaccines can induce enhanced long-term responses in innate immune cells, establishing an innate immunological memory termed trained immunity. Here, we show that monocytes with a trained immunity phenotype, due to exposure to the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, are characterized by an increased biosynthesis of different lipid mediators (LM) derived from long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Pharmacological and genetic approaches show that long-chain PUFA synthesis and lipoxygenase-derived LM are essential for the BCG-induced trained immunity responses of human monocytes. Furthermore, products of 12-lipoxygenase activity increase in monocytes of healthy individuals after BCG vaccination. Grasping the underscoring lipid metabolic pathways contributes to our understanding of trained immunity and may help to identify therapeutic tools and targets for the modulation of innate immune responses.

### Receptors for pro-resolving mediators are increased in Alzheimer's disease brain [^114RhUa4]. Brain Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

We and others have shown that the resolution pathway is disturbed in AD 47, 85, 92, a disease characterized by a chronic inflammatory process in the brain. Thus, decreased levels of the SPMs neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), and its precursor DHA, were shown in post‐mortem AD brain tissue 47, and, more recently, we demonstrated decreased levels of the SPMs lipoxin A4 (LXA 4), maresin 1 (MaR1) and resolvin (Rv) D5 in AD brain 85, 92, as well as reduced levels of LXA 4 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from AD patients 85.

The abnormally high levels of Aβ peptide in AD conceivably induce inflammation as a protective host response including the activation of glial cells, as shown in in vitro studies 18. Conversely, activation of glia causes increased Aβ peptide formation resulting in a vicious circle 31, and ultimately chronic inflammation in which persistent activation caused by long‐lasting increases in Aβ induces the release of free radicals, cytokines, chemokines, leukotrienes and prostaglandins that can impair the function of and eventually kill neurons. The resolution is an active process that "normally" terminates inflammation during an infection or local injury and is intimately linked to the regenerative processes that promote healing of the tissue. Thus, inflammation is downregulated and the affected tissue shows restorative and regenerative activities such as increased phagocytosis of cellular and molecular debris together with increased trophic activity 72. These actions are orchestrated by the SPMs produced through an enzymatic pathway involving the activities of cyclooxygenase‐2 (COX‐2) and 5‐ and 15‐lipoxygenases (LOX) 64.

### Leukotriene and prostaglandin synthesis pathways in osteoarthritic synovial membranes: regulating factors for interleukin 1beta synthesis [^112fMZDo]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the mechanisms responsible for the cross-talk between lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways in human osteoarthritic (OA) synovial explants, and to confirm the arachidonic acid (AA) shunting phenomenon and its influence on interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) synthesis.

Methods

Synovial membrane explants were cultured in the absence or presence of different drugs that inhibit COX and/or LOX activities. Concentrations of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), lipoxin A4 (LXA4), and IL-1beta were measured.

Results

When membrane explants were incubated with naproxen (COX inhibitor) under unstimulated conditions, the production of LTB4 was dose-dependently enhanced, reaching a 5-fold increase over the control. This shunt could be partially reversed by the addition of exogenous PGE2. Under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, both licofelone (COX/LOX inhibitor) at therapeutic concentrations and NDGA (LOX inhibitor) inhibited LTB4 production, whereas naproxen did not amplify the LPS-induced LTB4 production. Conversely, using NDGA, it was found that a shunt of AA from the LOX to the COX pathway did not occur. Under LPS conditions, both naproxen and licofelone inhibited LXA4, inducing an increase in the LTB4/LXA4 ratio with naproxen treatment but not with licofelone. Under these conditions, naproxen treatment induced a higher level of IL-1beta production.

Conclusion

We demonstrated in OA synovium that a shunt from AA to the LOX pathway occurred and that treatment with a nonselective COX inhibitor could increase the production of LTB4 and secondarily the synthesis of IL-1beta. Therefore treatment with licofelone, which can act on both COX and LOX pathways, may have some interesting properties in the treatment of OA.

### The arachidonic acid pathway and its role in prostate cancer development and progression [^116aAT2B]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

The arachidonic acid pathway incorporates phospholipase, cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and epoxygenase enzymes. This pathway has been shown to have a major role in the development and progression of a number of cancers, including prostate cancer. We discuss the current status of research of this pathway in the area of prostate cancer, ranging from preclinical in vitro studies to human clinical trials.

Materials and Methods

We performed an online search of the current and past peer reviewed literature on prostate cancer and arachidonic acid, phospholipase, cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, epoxygenase, platelet activating factor, prostaglandin and eicosanoid. We retrieved and evaluated all full-length articles published in English from the 1980s to January 2007.

Results

Epidemiological evidence suggested that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may decrease the risk of prostate cancer. This effect, presumably through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2, has been validated in preclinical studies. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition has also decreased the rate of prostate specific antigen increase in men with biochemical recurrence after treatment for prostate cancer. Although lipoxygenase and secretory phospholipase A2 inhibition was also effective for decreasing prostate cancer growth in preclinical studies, to our knowledge these strategies have not yet been used in clinical trials. Cytosolic phospholipase A2, platelet activating factor and epoxygenase need further investigation to determine a role in prostate cancer.

Conclusions

Evolving data suggest a significant role for some areas of the arachidonic acid pathway in prostate cancer. Inhibiting 1 or a number of these enzymes in combination may hold promise for future prostate cancer treatment.

### ALOX12 mutation in a family with dominantly inherited bleeding diathesis [^116nd2Gv]. Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

The arachidonic acid (AA) cascade plays a significant role in platelet aggregation. AA released from membrane phospholipids is metabolized by cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway to thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) or by 12S-lipoxygenase (ALOX12) to 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE). In contrast to a well-known role of the COX pathway in platelet aggregation, the role of ALOX12 is not well understood. Platelets of ALOX12-deficient mice exhibit increased sensitivity for ADP-induced aggregation. However, recent evidence strongly suggests a significant role of ALOX12 in platelet aggregation and calcium signaling. 12-HPETE potentiates thrombin- and thromboxane-induced platelet aggregation, and calcium signaling. Inhibition experiments of ALOX12 demonstrated decreased platelet aggregation and calcium signaling in stimulated platelets. We studied a family with a dominantly inherited bleeding diathesis using next-generation sequencing analysis. Platelet aggregation studies revealed that the proband's platelets had defective aggregation responses to ADP, TXA 2 mimetic U46619, collagen, and AA, normal affinity of TXA 2 receptor for U46619, and normal induction of GTPase activity upon stimulation with U46619. However, the production of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP 3) was only increased up to 30% of the control upon U46619 stimulation, suggesting a defect in phospholipase C-β2 (PLCB2) activation downstream from TXA 2 receptors. Affected family members had no mutation of PLCB2, but had a heterozygous c.1946A > G (p. Tyr649Cys) mutation of ALOX12. ALOX12 activity in platelets from the affected members was decreased to 25–35% of the control. Our data strongly suggested that a heterozygous c.1946A > G ALOX12 mutation was a disease-causing mutation; however, further experiments are required to confirm the pathogenesis of ALOX12 mutation in platelet aggregation.

### Fatty acid desaturation and lipoxygenase pathways support trained immunity [^112Yz4Cm]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In contrast, inhibition of 5-LOX or 12-LOX enzymes decreased BCG-enhanced cytokine production (Figs. 2b, 4a). 5-LOX inhibition decreased TNFα and IL-6 production, while 12-LOX inhibition decreased IL-6 secretion of BCG-trained macrophages. On the other hand, 15-LOX inhibition potentiated IL-6 production of BCG-trained macrophages and increased TNFα secretion of control cells. Following these observations, we assessed whether exogenous supplementation of different LOX-derived LM is sufficient to increase responsiveness to secondary stimulation (Figs. 3c, 4b–d). Monocytes were exposed to 5-HETE, 7-HDHA, and leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4), products of 5-LOX activity (Fig. 4b); 15-HETE and 17-HDHA, products of 15-LOX (Fig. 4c); 12-HETE, 12-HEPE, and 14-HDHA, product of 12-LOX (Fig. 4d) for 24 h and left to differentiate for 5 days. 7-HDHA, 15-HETE, 17-HDHA, 12-HETE and 12-HEPE supplementation triggered increased TNFα and IL-6 production upon LPS restimulation of differentiated macrophages. Although LTB 4, 5-HETE and 14-HDHA were enriched in BCG exposed monocytes, exogenous supplementation of these lipids did not modulate cytokine production upon restimulation (Fig. 4b–d). It is important to highlight that 15-LOX inhibition had an inverse proportion with cell responsiveness while supplementation with 15-LOX products proved to be positively correlated with cytokine production. This discrepancy might be due to off-target effects of the employed 15-LOX inhibitor, or other not metabolic product-related effects of 15-LOX as recently identified for example for 12-LOX. Moroever, we did not use combinations of 15-LOX products in our study.

### Endogenous metabolites of vitamin E limit inflammation by targeting 5-lipoxygenase [^115VsvqH]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

5-LO has been discussed as potential target of vitamin E before. Thus, Goetzl reported in 1980 that the most abundant vitamin E form in mammalians, α-T (1a), modulates the lipoxygenation of AA in leukocytes. Other forms of vitamin E were described to inhibit cellular LT formation in vitro by suppressing Ca 2+ -influx, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling and movement of 5-LO to FLAP. However, the concentrations of the vitamin E forms required to suppress 5-LO product formation are not reached in human plasma, and it has been speculated that endogenous vitamin E is biotransformed to active metabolites, as established for other fat-soluble vitamins.

Hepatic ω- and β-oxidation of vitamin E produces long-chain metabolites (LCMs), which differ in oxygenation (ω-alcohol vs. ω-carboxylate), saturation, and length of the phytyl side chain as well as in methylation and phase II metabolism of the chromanol core(Supplementary Fig. 1a). While the importance of bioactive metabolites is unquestioned for vitamins A and D, vitamin E-derived LCMs have only recently been proposed as signaling molecules. δ-Carboxychromanols have been exemplarily investigated and described to inhibit 5-LO, and cyclooxygenase (COX), another key enzyme of pro-inflammatory eicosanoid biosynthesis. Since these metabolites were detected neither in human nor rodent plasma unless vitamin E was supplemented at pharmacological doses, the physiological role of LCMs and their mode of action remained enigmatic. Two LCMs derived from α-T (1a) were recently discovered that occur at low nanomolar concentrations in human plasma, and inhibit pro-inflammatory signal transduction at supra-physiological LCM concentrations. Here, we identify 13-((2 R)-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-yl)-2,6,10-trimethyltridecanoic acid (α-13′-carboxychromanol, α-T-13′-COOH, 4a) as allosteric and selective high-affinity inhibitor of 5-LO, which is substantially produced in a human liver organoid and reaches plasma concentration in humans and mice at which LT formation in human leukocytes is efficiently inhibited (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Moreover, α-T-13′-COOH (4a) accumulates in leukocytes and at sites of inflammation and suppresses acute inflammation in murine peritonitis. Conclusively, our data strongly suggest that α-T-13′-COOH (4a) is a highly potent bioactive metabolite of α-T (1a), which essentially contributes to the anti-inflammatory properties of α-T (1a) by targeting 5-LO.

### Roles of prostaglandins and leukotrienes in acute inflammation caused by bacterial infection [^115Bv1pU]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Prostanoids, including prostaglandins and thromboxanes, are generated by the phospholipase A2/cyclooxygenase pathway, and leukotrienes are generated by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway from arachidonic acid. At physiological concentrations, vasodilator prostaglandins enhance the vascular permeability effects of histamine and bradykinin, and leukotrienes are important mediators of leukocyte accumulation during acute inflammation. On the other hand, prostaglandin metabolites such as cyclopentenone prostaglandins contribute to the resolution of acute inflammation through inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB activation. Thus, arachidonic acid oxygenation products mediate diverse effects that induce and resolve acute inflammation caused by bacterial infection.

### COX-2 / PGE2 upregulation contributes to the chromosome 17p-deleted lymphoma [^114CwjdJ]. Oncogenesis (2023). Medium credibility.

The unbalanced lipoxygenase pathway and cyclooxygenase pathway in lymphoma patients with del(17p) suggest new susceptibility

Given that there are multiple tumor suppressor genes like p53 and PHF23 on chromosome 17p, we wondered how much ALOX15B repression and the resulted aberrant AA metabolism would contribute to del(17p) cancer. GSEA results showed that the genes upregulated in sh Alox8 cells were significantly positively enriched in human chromosome 17p-deleted DLBCL cells (NES = 1.74, FDR q = 0.03). And in contrast, the genes downregulated in sh Alox8 cells were significantly negatively enriched in del(17p) DLBCL (NES = −1.48, FDR q = 0.03) (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that Alox8 loss partially mimicked the molecular characteristics of del(17p). The cyclooxygenase pathway was upregulated in both Alox8 deficient and 11B3-deleted mouse lymphoma cells, indicated by increased levels of Ptgs2 expression and its product PGE2 (Figs. 1 E and 1F). Here, we further tested the expressions of PTGS2 in human del(17p) tumors. Since the expression levels of genes on chromosome 17p are reduced in 17p-deleted tumors, we used the corrected expression levels of chromosome 17p13 genes to indicate 17p deletions. By analyzing the transcriptomes of 48 DLBCL samples in the TCGA cohort, we found that the expression levels of PTGS2 were significantly negatively correlated with those of chromosome 17p13 genes (Pearson = −0.46, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4B). A similar correlation was also observed in the TCGA-AML cohort (Pearson = −0.33, p < 0.001) (Fig. 4C). The negative correlation between 17p genes and PTGS2 was consistent with our hypothesis that the cyclooxygenase pathway of AA metabolism was upregulated in del(17p) cancers.

### Aspirin and multiple sclerosis [^113AyQNq]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

ASA and salicylate, the active metabolite of ASA, are known to cause hearing loss and tinnitus at high doses (for example, 6–8 g/day). The mechanisms behind these effects are unclear, but salicylate seems to have effects centrally on GABAergic neurotransmission, as well as more peripherally by affecting cochlear function. Moreover, a strong linear relationship exists between unbound salicylate plasma concentration and a resultant decrease in auditory sensitivity, and the salicylate toxicity model is used by auditory scientists to investigate mechanisms underlying tinnitus.

Certain asthmatic patients have a sensitivity to ASA that manifests itself as a respiratory/asthma-type attack. Jenkins et al. performed a systematic review and found that the pooled incidence of ASA-induced asthma was 21% in adults and 5% in children. This is higher than the value of approximately 10% that has been published elsewhere. The mechanism of this reaction in ASA sensitive-individuals is thought to occur due to COX inhibition resulting in decreased PGE 2 and thus unabated activation of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. This, in turn, increases production of leukotrienes and mast cell release of histamine, leading to airway hyperreactivity.

Prostaglandin-mediated vasodilation is necessary for proper renal plasma flow, especially in individuals with underlying renal disease, congestive heart failure, or cirrhosis. Through inhibition of renal COX-2, ASA and other NSAIDs can cause volume-dependent renal failure and that resulting from interstitial nephritis and nephritic syndrome.

### Targeting rap1b signaling cascades with CDNF: mitigating platelet activation, plasma oxylipins and reperfusion injury in stroke [^113rVUbT]. Molecular Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

To address these concerns, we designed a series of experiments to investigate the effects of CDNF on platelet activity, lipid mediator biosynthesis, and neuroinflammatory responses in stroke patients and rats (Figure 1 A). Through the analysis of mitochondria membrane potential (TREM), superoxide levels, and calcium flux in washed human platelets, we demonstrated that the CDNF maintains the mitochondria homeostasis, decreases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and downregulates intracellular calcium transients during the process of arachidonic acid (AA)-induced platelet activation. Using a combination of immunoprecipitation (IP) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we identified the CDNF interacting with small cytoplasmic GTP binding protein Rap1b in AA-treated platelets. By downregulating Rap1b activity, CDNF suppressed the ERK/cPLA 2 signaling pathway, which subsequently decreased cPLA 2 activation and thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) production in AA-treated platelets. In addition, the co-culture of BV2 microglial cells with CDNF-treated platelets from stroke patients exhibited reduced polarization toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. In rat cortical stroke model, subcutaneous (s.c.) delivery of CDNF was shown to suppress stroke-induced platelet activation, aggregation responses, and subsequent neuroinflammation. Notably, CDNF treatment not only reduced TXB 2 production in platelets but also normalized the levels of stroke-upregulated COX, 12-lipoxygenase (LOX), and CYP450-derived oxylipins to baseline levels. Given that systemic treatment with CDNF reduced platelet-mediated inflammatory responses after cortical ischemic stroke, it demonstrated the capacity to decrease infarction volume, alleviate neurological deficits, and further mitigate ischemia-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. These findings indicate that targeting platelet activation and its immune function with CDNF could be a promising strategy for the therapy in ischemic stroke.

### Novel key players in the development of tau neuropathology: focus on the 5-lipoxygenase [^113d21oM]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Tauopathies belong to a large group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau. Tau is a microtubule binding protein which is necessary for their assembly and stability. However, tau affinity for microtubules mainly depends on its phosphorylation status, which is the result of a delicate balance between kinases and phosphatases activity. Any significant changes in this equilibrium can promote tau fibrillation, aggregation, neuronal dysfunction, and ultimately neuronal loss. Despite intensive research, the molecular mechanism(s) leading to tau hyperphosphorylation are still unknown and there is no cure for these diseases. Development of an effective strategy that successfully prevents tau excessive phosphorylation and/or tau aggregation may offer a real therapeutic opportunity for these less investigated neurodegenerative conditions. Beside tau, chronic brain inflammation is a common feature of all tauopathies and 5-lipoxygenase, an inflammatory enzyme, is upregulated in brain regions affected by tau pathology. Recently, in vitro studies and preclinical investigations with animal models of tauopathy have implicated 5-lipoxygenase in the regulation of tau phosphorylation through activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 pathway, supporting the novel hypothesis that this protein is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of tauopathies. In this article, we will discuss the contribution of the 5-lipoxygenase signaling pathway in the development of tau neuropathology, and the promising potential that drugs targeting this enzyme activation hold as a novel disease-modifying therapeutic approach for tauopathies.

### Prostaglandin E2 receptors in asthma and in chronic rhinosinusitis / nasal polyps with and without aspirin hypersensitivity [^111ouTp5]. Respiratory Research (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase pathways with special reference to aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease. Simplified pictogram of biosynthetic pathways of prostaglandin (PG) E 2 and cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs). Arachidonic acid (AA) is metabolized by the cyclooxygenase (COX) or 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathways. COX enzymes generate PGH 2 which through PGE 2 synthase is converted into PGE 2. PGE 2 couples to four subtypes of G-protein-coupled membrane receptors denominated E-prostanoid (EP) receptors. The activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors generates cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This mediator negatively regulates the 5-LO pathway by activating protein kinase A (PKA). AA is also metabolized by the 5-LO pathway to generate leukotriene (LT) A 4. LTA 4 is subsequently metabolized by LTC 4 synthase, which conjugates reduced glutathione into LTC 4. LTC 4 is metabolized into LTD 4, which is then metabolized into LTE 4. LTC 4, LTD 4 and LTE 4 are designated as CysLTs. CysLTs bind to CysLT 1, CysLT 2 and GPR17 receptors. In aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) the inhibition of COX pathway accounts for a reduced production of cAMP since the production of PGE 2 is diminished. This is a simplified pictogram where some pathways and compounds generated are not mentioned.

### Advanced glycation end-products decreases expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase through oxidative stress in human coronary artery endothelial cells [^111yFaq3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

To explore where increased O 2 − originated from in AGEs-treated cells, we verified that the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential could cause the increase of O 2 − in AGEs-treated cells. In the meantime, this result suggests that AGEs may induce mitochondrial dysfunction, which in turn, may be partially responsible for the increase in O 2 − production detected in AGEs-treated cells. Interestingly, treatment with TTFA, a mitochondrial inhibitor, effectively blocked AGEs-induced the increase of O 2 production and the decrease of eNOS. Clearly, treatment with AGEs substantially increases NOX activity, whereas it decreases CAT and SOD activities. This may impair the internal cellular response to oxidative stress in AGEs treated cells. Thus AGEs-increased O 2 − production may result from mitochondrial dysfunction and compromised cellular redox enzymes. Similar results were obtained from the antioxidants SeMet and Specific O 2 − scavenger MnTBAP, which blocked AGEs's effects on O 2 − production in AGEs-treated cells.

Beside above reason on O 2 − production, xanthine oxidase and lipoxygenases. SOD facilitate the decrease of O 2 − by converting O 2 − to of H 2 O 2, and then CAT and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) coordinate the conversion of H 2 O 2 to water. SeMet is the form reported to be the major component of dietary selenium, and undergoes an intramolecular transsulfuration reaction to form selenocysteine. It is able to directly interact with some oxidant molecules or oxidant-generating ions, which, in turn, increases the activity of internal antioxidant enzymes GPX and thioredoxin reductase. These two antioxidants effectively blocked AGEs-induced eNOS downregulation and ROS production. Thus, our findings provide a suggestion that antioxidant therapy may be an effective strategy in treating vascular diseases related to AGEs.

Inflammatory also play an important role in the development of vascular damage associated to hyperglycemia. During inflammation, inducible nitric oxide synthase activation generates an overabundance of NO in the circulation and induced the cardiovascular dysfunction. High levels of NO availability without inflammatory stress can promote insulin resistance. Nair M et al. shown that endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by glyLDL is possibly involved in eNOS downregulation. In addition, insulin plays an important role in the regulation of vascular homeostasis and maintenance of endothelial function. Insulin signaling might cause activation of two separate and parallel pathways: PI3K/AKT/eNOS and Ras/Raf/MAPK pathways. AKT phosphorylates eNOS at Ser1177, resulting in increased nitric oxide production and vasodilation. The MAPK pathway results in endothelin-1 production and vasoconstriction and mitogenic effects.

### The role of human 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) in carcinogenesis-a question of canonical and non-canonical functions [^1173RLtz]. Oncogene (2024). Medium credibility.

Perspective

Although there is strong evidence that 5-LO plays an important role in the development of cancer, the global inhibition of LT formation and signaling has not yet shown the desired success in clinical trials. The inhibitors lacked clinical efficacy or even worsened patient outcome. This is probably due to the fact that global inhibition of LT formation affects not only tumor-derived 5-LO but also the leukocytic enzyme at the same time, thus impairing the anti-tumor immune response of the patients. Recent data show now that in addition to 5-LO-derived oxylipins, a number of non-canonical activities of 5-LO seem to have a major influence on cancer cell function and the microenvironment of tumors. Therefore, further studies should focus on pharmacological strategies that specifically target these non-canonical functions of 5-LO or specifically interfere with tumor cell-derived 5-LO expression while sparing the leukocytic enzyme. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of the 5-LO orchestrated tumor-immune interactions is needed to develop new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of 5-LO expressing solid tumors.

### Lipoxygenase pathways in atherogenesis [^116U2iZ9]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

15-lipoxygenase-1 (also known as 12/15-LO in mice) and 5-LO/5-LO-activating protein (FLAP) cascades play central roles in low-density lipoprotein oxidation and leukotriene biosynthesis, respectively. Several genetic and expression studies unraveling an association of the 5-LO/FLAP pathway to human cardiovascular disease have surfaced recently. Experimental studies in 12/15-LO knockout, 15-LO-1 transgenic, and 5-LO knockout mice on atherosclerotic backgrounds combined with gene expression data in human coronary artery disease have created compelling links that these pathways participate in the etiologic progression. However, a few conflicting studies and several unexplained mechanistic issues need to be resolved prior to assigning firm roles for LOs in cardiovascular disease. Development of novel pharmacologic tools to dissect the individual enzymes and receptors in the LO pathways should improve understanding of the individual components in the inflammatory aspects of atherosclerosis disease progression.

### A.S.P.E.N. position paper: clinical role for alternative intravenous fat emulsions [^111mrF7A]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Fatty acids classification and inflammatory pathways — introduction/background: Fatty acids (FAs) are categorized by chain length as 2–4 carbons for short-chain FA, 6–12 carbons for medium-chain FA, and ≥ 14 carbons for long-chain FA; saturated FAs have no double bonds, monounsaturated FAs (MUFA) have 1 double bond, and polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) have 2 or more double bonds. Unsaturated FAs include 3 principal families — ω-3, ω-6, and ω-9 — with the first double bond at the third, sixth, or ninth carbon, respectively; the ω-6 and ω-3 FAs are metabolized through 2 different pathways but use the same enzymes with a preference of ω-3 > ω-6 > ω-9. Clinically, ω-3 FAs are relatively less proinflammatory than ω-6 FAs and some ω-3 FAs may actually have anti-inflammatory effects; more of one FA than another in the diet can drive production toward proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory metabolites, and some evidence suggests certain long-chain FAs may impair immune function via effects on phagocytosis and chemotaxis, increasing infection risk.

### Genome-wide association study of leukotriene modifier response in asthma [^116WWEKS]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The leukotriene pathway is an important therapeutic target for asthma therapy. Leukotriene-modifying agents (LTMs) improve asthma by either selectively preventing leukotriene production from arachidonic acid via 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) inhibition (e.g. zileuton), or by preventing leukotrienes from binding to the major cysteinyl leukotriene receptor, CysLT1 (e.g. montelukast, pranlukast and zarfirlukast). LTMs are effective in improving lung function, asthma symptoms and quality of life in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis by reducing airway hyper-responsiveness and eosinophilia.

Despite their general efficacy, patient responses to LTMs are not consistent, with some individuals failing to respond to treatment. The presence of significant inter-individual variability in the treatment response to LTMs suggests that variation in patient genetics may underlie this phenomenon. Historically, variable response to leukotriene inhibition formed the basis for the first reported asthma pharmacogenetic study. In an effort to characterize this pharmacogenetic relationship, researchers initially focused on candidate genes within pharmacological pathways for LTM response, including arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), the gene encoding 5-LO, in addition to ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), member 1 (ABCC1), cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CYSLTR1), cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2 (CYSLTR2), leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H), leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S), and others. Studies of ALOX5 have identified multiple single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with symptomatic improvement and changes in measures of lung function during LTM therapy. Two studies of the LTC4S gene identified promoter and intronic SNPs associated with improved response to LTMs; in addition, regulatory variants in CYSLT2 (but not CYSLT1) that were significantly associated with increased morning peak expiratory flow in patients taking montelukast were identified. SNPs associated with LTM plasma levels and differential responsiveness to LTMs have also been reported for solute carrier organic anion transporter family, member 2B1 (SLCO2B1) and ABCC1. Importantly, we have previously demonstrated that variants in multiple genes contribute to the response of both leukotriene inhibitors (e.g. zileuton) and leukotriene receptor antagonists (e.g. montelukast).

### Aspirin resistance [^115qY1BE]. Thrombosis Research (2007). Low credibility.

Aspirin resistance refers to less than expected suppression of thromboxane A(2) production by aspirin and has been reported to be independently associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Possible causes of aspirin resistance include poor compliance, drug interaction, inadequate aspirin dose, increase turnover of platelets, genetic polymorphisms of cyclo-oxygenase-1, and upregulation of alternate (non-platelet) pathways of thromboxane production. Laboratory methods used to detect aspirin resistance include those that measure thromboxane A(2) production and thromboxane A(2)-dependent platelet function. However, since there is currently no standardised approach to the diagnosis and there are no proven effective treatments for aspirin resistance that improve outcome, patients with cardiovascular disease receiving aspirin should not be routinely tested for aspirin resistance. Instead physicians should be aware of the factors that may impair aspirin function, ensure that they use an appropriate dose of aspirin and optimise compliance with aspirin therapy. Further research exploring the mechanisms of aspirin resistance is needed in order to better define and develop a standardised test for aspirin resistance that is specific, reliable, can be readily applied in routine laboratories and correlate with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.

### Aspirin-intolerant asthma: role of cyclo-oxygenase enzymes [^111xbaUg]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Aspirin-induced asthma and rhinitis (AIAR) appear to be precipitated by the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (COX). By inhibiting COX pathway aspirin diverts arachidonic acid metabolites to the lipoxygenase pathway. There are two isoforms of COX, namely COX-1 and COX-2. Metabolites derived from COX-1 are involved in cellular housekeeping functions. COX-2 can be induced in cells exposed to proinflammatory substances and growth factors. Recent studies have reported that patients with AIAR have decreased activity of COX-2 and lower production of PGE(2) in the upper airway and peripheral blood cells. Considering the protective effect of exogenous PGE(2) on aspirin-induced bronchoconstriction and the interdependence of PGE(2) and cisteinyl leukotriene production, a reduced PGE(2) synthesis may render aspirin-sensitive patients more susceptible to the inhibitory effect of NSAIDs drugs and also lead to an increase in cysteinyl leukotriene release.

### Adipose tissue 12 / 15 lipoxygenase pathway in human obesity and diabetes [^112jSzTe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key contributor to chronic inflammation in obesity. The 12/15-lipoxygenase pathway (ALOX) is present in adipose tissue (AT) and leads to inflammatory cascades that are causal for the onset of insulin resistance in rodent models of obesity.

Objective

The pathophysiology of the ALOX 12/15 pathway in human AT is unknown. We characterized the ALOX pathway in different AT depots in obese humans with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Design

This study includes a cross-sectional cohort of 46 morbidly obese (body mass index > 39 kg/m(2)) nondiabetic (n = 25) and T2D (n = 21) subjects.

Setting

This study was conducted at Eastern Virginia Medical School (Norfolk, Virginia) in collaboration with Sentara Metabolic and Weight Loss Surgery Center (Sentara Medical Group, Norfolk, Virginia).

Patients

Twenty-five obese (body mass index 44.8 ± 4.4 kg/m(2)) nondiabetic (hemoglobin A1c 5.83% ± 0.27%) and 21 obese (43.4 ± 4.1 kg/m(2)) and T2D (hemoglobin A1c 7.66% ± 1.22%) subjects were included in the study. The subjects were age matched and both groups had a bias toward female gender.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Expression of ALOX isoforms along with fatty acid substrates and downstream lipid metabolites were measured. Correlations with depot-specific inflammatory markers were also established.

Results

ALOX 12 expression and its metabolite 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid were significantly increased in the VAT of T2D subjects. ALOX 15A was exclusively expressed in VAT in both groups. ALOX 12 expression positively correlated with expression of inflammatory genes IL-6, IL-12a, CXCL10, and lipocalin-2.

Conclusions

ALOX 12 may have a critical role in regulation of inflammation in VAT in obesity and T2D. Selective ALOX 12 inhibitors may constitute a new approach to limit AT inflammation in human obesity.

### Icosapent ethyl (Vascepa) [^116ZDTr3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased β-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity.

The mechanisms of action contributing to reduction of cardiovascular events with VASCEPA (icosapent ethyl) are not completely understood but are likely multi-factorial. Increased EPA lipid composition from carotid plaque specimens and increased circulating EPA/arachidonic acid ratio have been observed following EPA treatment. EPA inhibits platelet aggregation under some ex vivo conditions. However, the direct clinical meaning of individual findings is not clear.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In a 12-week, dose-ranging study in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and in the event-driven REDUCE-IT®trial, VASCEPA 4 grams per day reduced median TG from baseline relative to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Absorption

After oral administration, VASCEPA is de-esterified during the absorption process and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters the systemic circulation mainly via the thoracic duct lymphatic system. Peak plasma concentrations of EPA were reached approximately 5 hours following oral doses of VASCEPA.

VASCEPA was administered with or following a meal in all clinical studies; no food effect studies were performed. Take VASCEPA with or following a meal.

Distribution

The mean volume of distribution at steady state of EPA is approximately 88 liters. The majority of EPA circulating in plasma is incorporated in phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and < 1% is present as the unesterified fatty acid. Greater than 99% of unesterified EPA is bound to plasma proteins.

Elimination

Metabolism

EPA is mainly metabolized by the liver via beta-oxidation similar to dietary fatty acids. Beta oxidation splits the long carbon chain of EPA into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination of EPA.

Excretion

The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) of EPA is approximately 89 hours. VASCEPA does not undergo renal excretion.

### PPAR α agonism enhances immune response to radiotherapy while dietary oleic acid results in counteraction [^11752XW8]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Proteomic analyses reveal that in addition to HRT upregulation of antigen presentation, FF alters arachidonic acid metabolism

As PUFAs, particularly omega-3 and omega-6 FAs, are relevant in the synthesis of eicosanoids (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids, etc.), which play a role in the regulation of inflammation and the immune response, we next examined the differential expression of these proteins using proteomic analyses with mass spectrometry. Pathway analyses of tumors taken from the in vivo experiments (Figs. 2 and 3) showed that HRT increased proteins related to pathways involved in antigen processing and presentation, regulation of response to cytokines, and extracellular matrix organization. These features are consistent with previous literature (refs.; Supplementary Fig. S5A). Downregulated features in the HRT group included regulation of DNA metabolism, protein assembly, and positive cell-cycle regulation (Supplementary Fig. S5B).

To examine the impact of pharmacologic treatment of FF on proteomic profiles, we compared enrichment patterns of HRT + FF to HRT alone and observed upregulation of KEGG pathways for asthma and arachidonic acid metabolism (Fig. 4A). GO biological processes for B-cell activation, adaptive immune response, and granulocyte migration and eicosanoid biosynthetic processes were also increased (Fig. 4B). Upon comparison of the proteomic profiles of OAD + HRT + FF and CD + HRT + FF, unsupervised clustering shows well-defined groups (Supplementary Fig. S5C) with upregulated GO pathways including interleukin-4 production, cellular response to oxygen levels, and positive regulation of apoptotic signaling pathways in the OAD group (Supplementary Fig. S5D). In connection with the metabolomic findings, lipoxygenase enzymes commonly expressed in leukocytes and involved in catalyzing leukotriene production (ALOX5 and ALOX15) were increased when FF was added to HRT (Fig. 5C). Given that arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) converts arachidonic acid into leukotrienes, whereas arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15) converts polyunsaturated omega FAs into various metabolites (15 S-HETE and 13S-HODE; ref.), these data collectively suggest the pharmacologic treatment with FF increases FA catabolism and leukotriene production.

### Platelet activation and partial desensitization are associated with viral xenophagy in patients with severe COVID-19 [^114NiSi4]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Characteristics of the patients with COVID-19 at admission and outcome

A total of 29 patients admitted to the ICU for severe COVID-19 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were included in the study. Their clinical and biological characteristics at admission are detailed in Table 1. Patients admitted for a non–COVID-19 sepsis in the ICU (sepsis group, n = 9) were also included in the study (supplemental Table 1). Eighty percent of these patients were admitted for bacterial pneumonia and 20% for urinary sepsis.

Increased soluble platelet activation markers and decreased platelet reactivity in patients with severe COVID-19

Specific soluble platelet activation markers, including soluble GPVI (sGPVI), soluble P-selectin (sCD62P), and soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), were significantly increased in plasma of patients with COVID-19 compared with healthy controls (Figure 1A-C). Consistent with increased plasma concentration of sGPVI, the number of copies of this collagen receptor was significantly decreased at the surface of platelets from patients with severe COVID-19 (Figure 1B). This result complies with a shedding of GPVI known to occur during platelet activation. The plasma concentration of eicosanoids derived from the metabolism of arachidonic acid during platelet activation through the cyclooxygenases and the lipoxygenases pathways was then analyzed. The plasma level of thromboxane B2 (TxB2), the stable metabolite of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), and the lipoxygenase product 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) was very high in patients with severe COVID-19 and low in controls (Figure 1D). Other lipoxygenase products such as 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), and 14-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (14-HDoHE) were also significantly elevated in patients compared with healthy controls (Figure 1D).

### The role of human 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) in carcinogenesis-a question of canonical and non-canonical functions [^114Jt3KV]. Oncogene (2024). Medium credibility.

5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO), a fatty acid oxygenase, is the central enzyme in leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis, potent arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediators released by innate immune cells, that control inflammatory and allergic responses. In addition, through interaction with 12- and 15-lipoxgenases, the enzyme is involved in the formation of omega-3 fatty acid-based oxylipins, which are thought to be involved in the resolution of inflammation. The expression of 5-LO is frequently deregulated in solid and liquid tumors, and there is strong evidence that the enzyme plays an important role in carcinogenesis. However, global inhibition of LT formation and signaling has not yet shown the desired success in clinical trials. Curiously, the release of 5-LO-derived lipid mediators from tumor cells is often low, and the exact mechanism by which 5-LO influences tumor cell function is poorly understood. Recent data now show that in addition to releasing oxylipins, 5-LO can also influence gene expression in a lipid mediator-independent manner. These non-canonical functions, including modulation of miRNA processing and transcription factor shuttling, most likely influence cancer cell function and the tumor microenvironment and might explain the low clinical efficacy of pharmacological strategies that previously only targeted oxylipin formation and signaling by 5-LO. This review summarizes the canonical and non-canonical functions of 5-LO with a particular focus on tumorigenesis, highlights unresolved issues, and suggests future research directions.

### Lipoxygenase modulation to reverse carcinogenesis [^113Hobrc]. Cancer Research (2001). Low credibility.

New studies of the relationship between polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolismand carcinogenesis have led to novel molecular targets for cancer chemoprevention research. These targets include procarcinogenic lipoxygenases (LOXs), including 5-, 8-, and 12-LOX, and anticarcinogenic LOXs, including 15-LOX-1 and possibly 15-LOX-2. Recent studies indicate that 15-LOX-1 is down-regulated in colorectal cancer cells and that the ability of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, a class of clinically active cancer chemopreventive agents, to induce apoptosis and growth inhibition in these cells was dependent on the induction of 15-LOX-1 and its metabolic product 13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid. Consistent with the colorectal studies, 15-LOX very recently has shown anticarcinogenic activity in esophageal and prostatic carcinogenesis. Inhibitors of other LOXs (e.g., 5-LOX) have preclinical anticarcinogenic activity and are being developed for clinical chemoprevention study. These and other LOX data led us to propose that the various LOX pathways exist in a dynamic balance that shifts during carcinogenesis toward 5-, 8-, and 12-LOX (and cyclooxygenase-2) and away from 15-LOX. A novel approach for cancer chemoprevention would involve LOX modulators, i.e., agents that can induce the anticarcinogenic and/or inhibit the procarcinogenic LOXs, thereby shifting the balance of LOX activities from procarcinogenic to anticarcinogenic metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

### Genetics and pharmacogenetics of the leukotriene pathway [^1168WhRY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Leukotrienes are now established contributors to the inflammatory process in asthma, and leukotriene modifiers are mainstays in the therapy of asthma. This review focuses on published association studies implicating the role of leukotriene pathway genes in asthma pathogenesis and treatment response, specifically focusing on those genetic variants associated with asthma affection status, the development of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, and pharmacogenetic response. Although published studies have been limited by small sample sizes and a lack of independent replication, multiple loci within multiple leukotriene pathway genes have now been associated in more than 1 study related to asthma or asthma treatment response. Those specific variants include 2 variants in the 5-lipoxygenase gene (ALOX5) that are both associated with response to 5-lipoxygenase inhibition and to leukotriene receptor antagonists, variants in genes encoding the 2 established cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists (CYSLTR1 and CYSLTR2) that are both associated with asthma susceptibility in at least 2 independent populations, and a leukotriene C(4) synthase promoter polymorphism (LTC4s) that has been associated with asthma affection status and asthma-exacerbated respiratory disease. Despite these successes, genetic investigations into this pathway remain in their formative stages. Future studies aimed at providing a broader scope of investigation through increased sample sizes and through genome-wide approaches are needed.

### Safety of anti-inflammatory treatment – new ways of thinking [^116gnYch]. Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

The development of osteoarthritis may be accompanied by increased production of leukotrienes (LTs) and prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid. These products contribute to joint damage, pain and inflammation. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 are responsible for the production of PGs. Inhibition of these enzymes by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective COX-2 inhibitors reduces the levels of PGs, resulting in a reduction in pain and inflammation. However, this inhibition can cause alternative processing of arachidonic acid via the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathway, resulting in increased production of proinflammatory and gastrotoxic LTs. Licofelone is a competitive inhibitor of 5-LOX, COX-1 and COX-2 that is currently being developed for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Licofelone decreases the production of both LTs and PGs, and thereby reduces inflammation and pain with low gastrotoxicity. Unlike selective COX-2 inhibitors, coadministration of licofelone and aspirin does not appear to be associated with an increase in gastrointestinal adverse events, at least under experimental conditions. Furthermore, there is evidence from animal models to suggest that licofelone may stop disease progression.

Product composition differences — SO is mainly composed of LA (ω-6 FA) and oleic acid (ω-9 FA), and no more than 10% of ALA is present (ω-3 FA), whereas FO-ILEs contain high amounts of ω-3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), EPA, and DHA, and EPA is known to compete with ARA at the cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase pathways, leading to production of fewer proinflammatory active as well as proresolving substances.

### Oxylipid profile of low-dose aspirin exposure: a pharmacometabolomics study [^117HEsVV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Secondly, we observed that aspirin significantly decreased almost all of the oxylipids measured in our samples (26 out of 30), independently of their fatty acid precursors or their synthesizing enzymes. This finding may seem surprising, as one might have thought that inhibition of 1 enzymatic branch (COX) would divert fatty acid substrates towards other branches of the pathways, leading to higher levels of LOX‐ or CYP‐derived products. However, oxylipid metabolism does not seem to follow a simple mass‐action rule, at least when measured globally in serum, and our findings are in agreement with a previous report. In a murine inflammatory model, a single high dose of aspirin significantly lowered plasma levels of COX‐, LOX‐, and CYP‐derived AA metabolites. 13, 40 The authors concluded that the COX, LOX, and CYP pathways "do not proceed in a parallel way but communicate in a dynamic manner". In contrast, Shinde et al 14, 41 reported that aspirin significantly decreased TXB2 levels in plasma of healthy volunteers, but not the levels of CYP‐, LOX‐, or AA‐derived metabolites. However, they measured oxylipids 2 hours after a single high dose of aspirin, which might explain our differing results.

To unravel the key points at which metabolic regulation has changed in the oxylipid pathways, we next examined aspirin‐induced changes in pairwise correlations of metabolite levels. We observed that, except for the direct COX‐ metabolites, correlations between oxylipids did not change significantly upon aspirin administration, even though metabolite levels were altered. We postulated that this coordinated change in oxylipid levels could result from an effect of aspirin on the upstream parts of the biosynthetic pathways and found that LA levels were indeed significantly lowered by aspirin treatment. Further, we observed a high correlation between LA levels and its oxylipid products in serum. Therefore, based on our findings, we postulate that, for LA‐derived oxylipids, aspirin‐induced decrease in precursor availability might account for the observed decrease in circulating oxylipid levels. The correlations were poor between AA levels and its oxylipid products, suggesting that free AA is not a major source of synthesis for circulating oxylipids.

### Hematopoietic stem cell function requires 12 / 15-lipoxygenase-dependent fatty acid metabolism [^116S64Ro]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Fatty acid metabolism governs multiple intracellular signaling pathways in many cell types, but its role in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is largely unknown. Herein, we establish a critical role for 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX)-mediated unsaturated fatty acid metabolism in HSC function. HSCs from 12/15-LOX-deficient mice are severely compromised in their capacity to reconstitute the hematopoietic compartment in competitive and serial reconstitution assays. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 12/15-LOX is required for the maintenance of long-term HSC quiescence and number. The defect in HSCs is cell-autonomous and associated with a selective reduction in 12/15-LOX-mediated generation of bioactive lipid mediators and reactive oxygen species and with a decrease in canonical Wnt signaling as measured by nuclear beta-catenin staining. These results have implications for development, aging, and transformation of the hematopoietic compartment.

### Effect of ketoprofen and ATB-352 on the immature human intestine: identification of responders and non-responders [^112ceYTo]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

A possible explanation for such a distinct mucosal response to ketoprofen versus indomethacin relies on a recent finding suggesting distinct mechanisms of action for these 2 NSAIDs. Indeed, as for the majority of NSAIDs, indomethacin exerts its anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting the main arachidonic acid metabolism pathway, namely the production of prostaglandins, through the inhibition of COX activities. However, the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin leads to higher arachidonic acid metabolism by the alternative 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway responsible for leukotriene production, including leukotriene B4 (LTB4), an important inflammatory mediator. In addition to increasing microvascular permeability and promoting neutrophil infiltration, LTB4 also stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species by the release of superoxide by neutrophils and hydrogen peroxide by macrophages suggesting a potential source of inflammatory-related damage observed by indomethacin on the immature intestine. In contrast, ketoprofen appears to act as a dual COX and 5-LO inhibitor, blocking the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, thus providing the basis for a possible explanation for the observed divergence between the 2 treatments on the immature intestine at least for a subset of individuals. Further work is nevertheless needed to better understand the mechanisms regulating this intestinal responder/non-responder phenomenon. No correlation with the sex of the individual or gestational age can explain the phenomenon. However, genetic susceptibilities associated to NSAID metabolism have been identified in relation to gastrointestinal bleeding, while identification of genetic variants in lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenases have been reported in association with the risk of digestive neoplasia suggesting that the implication of such polymorphisms in the differential intestinal response to ketoprofen cannot be ruled out at this time.

### Leukotriene pathway genetics and pharmacogenetics in allergy [^111GrBGy]. Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

Leukotrienes (LT) are biologically active lipid mediators known to be involved in allergic inflammation. Leukotrienes have been shown to mediate diverse features of allergic conditions including inflammatory cell chemotaxis/activation and smooth muscle contraction. Cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC(4), LTD(4) and, LTE(4)) and the dihydroxy leukotriene LTB(4) are generated by a series of enzymes/proteins constituting the LT synthetic pathway or 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway. Their function is mediated by interacting with multiple receptors. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) and LT synthesis inhibitors (LTSI) have shown clinical efficacy in asthma and more recently in allergic rhinitis. Despite growing knowledge of leukotriene biology, the molecular regulation of these inflammatory mediators remains to be fully understood. Genes encoding enzymes of the 5-LO pathway (i.e. ALOX5, LTC4S and LTA4H) and encoding for LT receptors (CYSLTR1/2 and LTB4R1/2) provide excellent candidates for disease susceptibility and severity; however, their role remains unclear. Preliminary data also suggest that 5-LO pathway/receptor gene polymorphism can predict patient responses to LTSI and LTRA; however, the exact mechanisms require elucidation. The aim of this review was to summarize the recent advances in the knowledge of these important mediators, focusing on genetic and pharmacogenetic aspects in the context of allergic phenotypes.

### Chemoprevention of lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1165bsKz]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Arachidonic pathway and lung cancer chemoprevention — pathway biology and preclinical evidence are outlined: Arachidonic acid is metabolized to prostaglandins and prostacyclin (PGI2) by the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, whereas leukotrienes are formed via the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway; COX-2 is induced by inflammatory and mitogenic stimuli, can be selectively inhibited, and has been demonstrated in premalignant and malignant bronchial cells with higher levels associated with a poor prognosis in NSCLC; preclinical murine studies with the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib yielded conflicting results (no reduction in metastases versus decreased growth and metastasis), and although COX-2 expression enhances tumorigenesis, not all preclinical carcinogenesis models have shown chemopreventive efficacy; 5-LOX converts arachidonic acid to leukotrienes that are proinflammatory and enhance cell adhesion, and evidence indicates 5-LOX is expressed in lung cancers, 5-LOX inhibitors reduced the multiplicity and incidence of lung tumors in mice, and 5-LOX metabolites may play a role in angiogenesis.

### Fatty acid desaturation and lipoxygenase pathways support trained immunity [^1171q37e]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Monocytes trained in vitro with BCG display increased concentrations of lipoxygenase-derived metabolites

Trained immunity inducers, such as β-glucan and BCG, trigger long-term metabolic reprogramming of monocytes and macrophages. However, the role of LM in the induction of trained immunity has not yet been comprehensively investigated. We used an established in vitro model of trained immunity, in which human peripheral blood monocytes were exposed to β-glucan or BCG for 24 h and left to rest for the following 5 days in the absence of any stimulus. In contrast, to induce immune tolerance, monocytes were exposed to LPS on day 0 of culture.

We investigated changes in LM content at two different time points: after 24 h of treatment and at day 6 of culture, in the absence of restimulation (Fig. 1, S 2, S 3). The concentration of free PUFA arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was not altered by the different stimulations at the evaluated timepoints. However, despite donor variation, we observed clear trends in the concentrations of different LM at 24 h of exposure (Fig. 1). BCG triggered the increased production of eicosanoids and docosanoids, primarily associated with 12- and 15-LOX activity, namely 15-HETE and 12-HETE (Fig. 1a), 15-HEPE, 12-HEPE (Fig. 1b), and 14-HDHA (Fig. 1c). 5-HETE, a product of 5-LOX activity was also enriched in BCG-exposed monocytes (Fig. 1a). PGE 2, a product of COX activity, was likewise significantly increased in BCG-exposed monocytes (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, recent publications on 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) inhibitors highlight the role of PGE 2 on cell and tissue regeneration. Overall, BCG stimulated an increase in the biosynthesis of LM, particularly 12- and 15-LOX products. In contrast, LPS promoted the depletion of most species, particularly 12-LOX derived products as observed by the significantly decreased concentrations of 12-HETE, 12-HEPE and 14-HDHA, in comparison with BCG-stimulated monocytes. The LM enrichment induced by BCG was triggered early on during monocyte stimulation and were not persistent after the differentiation of trained cells at day 6 of culture. In contrast, at day 6, LPS-stimulated cells tended to show decreased levels of different LM, such as 17-HDHA, 15-HEPE, and 5-HEPE (Fig. S2, S3). In accordance, a previous study compared human monocytes and differentiated macrophages and observed a decrease in LM synthesis capacity and release in differentiated cells, possibly pinpointing an exhaustion of PUFA precursor pools (Fig. S2, S3).

### Dissecting the role of 5-lipoxygenase in the homocysteine-induced Alzheimer's disease pathology [^114PSJkR]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

The 5LO is widely expressed in the cardiovascular system, that is, aorta, coronary, and carotid arteries, as well as in macrophages and neutrophils. Interestingly, its expression levels are increased in aortas of old animals when compared with young ones. This enzymatic pathway is also widely expressed in the CNS, where it localizes mainly in neuronal cells of the hippocampus and cortex, and, similar to the vasculature, its levels increase significantly with aging. The expression of 5LO is susceptible to hormonal regulation, since higher levels are observed in conditions of melatonin deficiency and/or hyperglucocorticoidemia, both of which are common in elderly subjects. Although in general upregulation of 5LO might serve a physiological purpose, during the aging process, it may also increase the vulnerability of the cardiovascular system and CNS to different insults/stressors. Given that older subjects are at greater risk of health complications and mortality stemming from altered inflammatory and immune functions, and aging, via the upregulation of 5-LO, can be an important risk factor, the effects of stressors on this enzymatic pathway are of particular importance.

### Toxoplasma gondii infection decreases intestinal 5-lipoxygenase expression, while exogenous LTBControls parasite growth [^1136vNsB]. Infection and Immunity (2022). Medium credibility.

5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) is an enzyme required for the production of leukotrienes and lipoxins and interferes with parasitic infections. In vitro, Toxoplasma gondii inhibits leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) production, and mice deficient in 5-LO are highly susceptible to infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the pharmacological inhibition of the 5-LO pathway and exogenous LTB 4 supplementation during experimental toxoplasmosis. For this purpose, susceptible C57BL/6 mice were orally infected with T. gondii and treated with LTB 4 or MK886 (a selective leukotriene inhibitor through inhibition of 5-LO-activating protein [FLAP]). The parasitism, histology, and immunological parameters were analyzed. The infection decreased 5-LO expression in the small intestine, and treatment with MK886 reinforced this reduction during infection; in addition, MK886-treated infected mice presented higher intestinal parasitism, which was associated with lower local interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production. In contrast, treatment with LTB 4 controlled parasite replication in the small intestine, liver, and lung and decreased pulmonary pathology. Interestingly, treatment with LTB 4 also preserved the number of Paneth cells and increased α-defensins expression and IgA levels in the small intestine of infected mice. Altogether, these data demonstrated that T. gondii infection is associated with a decrease in 5-LO expression, and on the other hand, treatment with the 5-LO pathway product LTB 4 resulted in better control of parasite growth in the organs, adding to the knowledge about the pathogenesis of T. gondii infection.

### Lower serum 15-HETE level predicts nasal ILC2 accumulation during COX-1 inhibition in AERD [^1172znP4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The samples from patients included in this study were from our prior reported study. A total of 8 patients with AERD who were not previously treated with biologic therapy underwent COX-1 inhibitor challenge and desensitization at the University of California San Diego and Scripps Clinic Allergy Divisions. Patients were confirmed to have AERD based on a history of asthma, nasal polyps, and reactions to aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as characteristic reactions to COX-1 inhibitor challenge. Nasal scrapings and blood were collected at baseline and at the time of a clinician-confirmed reaction and postreaction time points. ILC2s were identified within nasal scrapings as lineage-negative CRTH2-positive lymphocytes, as we have previously reported. We assessed serum levels of 161 eicosanoid mediators and detected 42 mediators. Lipids associated with distinct pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism, including the lipoxygenase (LOX) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) pathways and nonenzymatic oxidation, were analyzed and correlated with nasal ILC2 levels.

### COX-2 / PGE2 upregulation contributes to the chromosome 17p-deleted lymphoma [^114kaq2W]. Oncogenesis (2023). Medium credibility.

Deletions of chromosome 17p, where TP53 gene locates, are the most frequent chromosome alterations in human cancers and associated with poor outcomes in patients. Our previous work suggested that there were p53 –independent mechanisms involved in chromosome 17p deletions-driven cancers. Here, we report that altered arachidonate metabolism, due to the deficiency of mouse Alox8 on chromosome 11B3 (homologous to human ALOX15B on chromosome 17p), contributes to the B cell malignancy. While the metabolites produced from lipoxygenase pathway reduced, chromosome 11B3 deletions or Alox8 loss, lead to upregulating its paralleling cyclooxygenase pathway, indicated by the increased levels of oncometabolite prostaglandin E2. Ectopic PGE2 prevented the apoptosis and differentiation of pre-B cells. Further studies revealed that Alox8 deficiency dramatically and specifically induced Cox-2(Ptgs2) gene expression. Repressing Cox-2 by its shRNAs impaired the tumorigenesis driven by Alox8 loss. And, in turn, tumor cells with Alox8 or 11B3 loss were sensitive to the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. This correlation between COX-2 upregulation and chromosome 17p deletions was consistent in human B-cell lymphomas. Hence, our studies reveal that the arachidonate metabolism abnormality with unbalanced ALOX and COX pathways underlies human cancers with 17p deletions and suggest new susceptibility for this disease.

### Genetic contribution of the leukotriene pathway to coronary artery disease [^111CvQAY]. Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Class four leukotrienes (LTs) are potent pro-inflammatory mediators synthesized from arachidonic acid, an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (Peters-Golden and Henderson). The rate-limiting step in this pathway is catalyzed by the enzyme arachidonic acid 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5). The biologically active LTs are synthesized by subsequent conversion to LTB 4 and the cysteinyl LTs (LTC 4, LTD 4, and LTE 4) via enzymatic reactions by LTA4 hydrolase (LTA4H) and LTC4 synthase (LTC4S), respectively (Peters-Golden and Henderson). LTs then affect the function of target cells, including monocytes and other pro-inflammatory leukocytes, through receptor-mediated signal transduction.

While LTs have long been known to be involved in chronic allergic inflammatory conditions, such as asthma, the LT pathway has also recently garnered attention for its potential role in coronary artery disease (CAD)-related traits. This stems from a series of biochemical, genetic, and pharmacological studies over the last few years that have provided evidence for the pro-atherogenic role of LTs (Back and Hansson; Mehrabian and Allayee; Tymchuk et al.). For example, genetic deficiency for ALOX5 in mice protects against aortic lesion formation and leads to other metabolic disturbances (Mehrabian et al.). Other mouse studies have reported the involvement of LT pathway genes in atherosclerosis-related traits as well, including the LT receptors and ALOX5 activating protein (ALOX5AP) (Ahluwalia et al; Aiello et al; Heller et al; Jawien et al; Subbarao et al.).

### COX-2 / PGE2 upregulation contributes to the chromosome 17p-deleted lymphoma [^112e1qJ1]. Oncogenesis (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Metabolism reprogramming has been shown to be a hallmark of cancer as early as a century ago when Warburg's effect was first described. Besides numerous studies on glucose metabolism, there are emerging evidences showing that altered lipid metabolism has significant effects on tumorigenesis not only through providing essential cellular components but also as signaling molecules. AA, a polyunsaturated fatty acid with a 20-carbon chain, can be converted into multiple bioactive lipids through three distinct metabolism pathway, the lipoxygenase pathway, the cyclooxygenases pathway and the cytochrome P450 pathway. Some of these AA-derived products have been shown to be involved in inflammation, cancer and other human diseases. In this study, we have illustrated that cyclooxygenases/prostaglandins, upregulated by lipoxygenase ALOX15B loss, contributed to the tumor formation and maintenance of Alox8 -deficient lymphoma. COX-2 is known to be generally absent in most normal cells but is highly enriched in many malignant cells like colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancers; and PGE2, the major bioactive metabolite of COX genes, can promote the proliferation of cancer cells, enhance their stemness and protect them from apoptosis. Furthermore, the high expression of PTGS2, encoding COX-2, is also correlated with poor prognosis in lymphomas. In contrast, ALOX15B is recognized to have an anti-carcinogenic effect as its downregulated expression in various cancers and its loss driving lymphoma development. Our work revealed that these two enzymes can crosstalk. Loss of Alox8 specifically induced Ptgs2 expression, inhibiting which would prevent Alox8 -deficient B progenitor cells transformed into lymphoma, and suppress Alox8 -deficient lymphoma cell growth. PTGS2 is suggested to be induced in response to various cellular and environmental stresses. There are some signal pathways like NF-κB and PI3K/AKT pathway reported to regulate PTGS2 gene transcription. We found that Alox8 loss activated the PI3K-mTOR pathway (data not shown). But, whether the upregulated PI3K-mTOR pathway is downregulated Alox8 cell induces PTGS2 gene expression needs future study.

### Critical role of 5-lipoxygenase and heme oxygenase-1 in wound healing [^114xvtx7]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Lipid mediators derived from 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) metabolism can activate both pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways, but their role in wound healing remains largely unexplored. In this study we show that 5-LO knockout (5-LO(-/-)) mice exhibited faster wound healing than wild-type (WT) animals, and exhibited upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Furthermore, HO-1 inhibition in 5-LO(-/-) mice abolished the beneficial effect observed. Despite the fact that 5-LO(-/-) mice exhibited faster healing, in in vitro assays both migration and proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) were inhibited by the 5-LO pharmacologic inhibitor AA861. No changes were observed in the expression of fibronectin, transforming growth factor (I and III), and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Interestingly, AA861 treatment significantly decreased ROS formation by stimulated fibroblasts. Similar to 5-LO(-/-) mice, induction of HO-1, but not superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD-2), was also observed in response to 5-LO (AA861) or 5-LO activating protein (MK886) inhibitors. HO-1 induction was independent of nuclear factor (erythroid derived-2) like2 (Nrf-2), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) products, or lipoxin action. Taken together, our results show that 5-LO disruption improves wound healing and alters fibroblast function by an antioxidant mechanism based on HO-1 induction. Overexpression of HO-1 in wounds may facilitate early wound resolution.

### Nanomolar EP4 receptor potency and expression of eicosanoid-related enzymes in normal appearing colonic mucosa from patients with colorectal neoplasia [^116tMPNX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer related deaths. Adenocarcinomas constitute the majority of CRC and the carcinogenesis of this type of CRC is a multifactorial process, in which an accumulation of mutations leads to the formation of colorectal neoplasia (CRN), initially as benign adenomas and subsequently malignant adenocarcinomas. Genetics and chronic colonic inflammation are known risk factors for developing CRC, involving altered activity of the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism including prostaglandins. The specific mechanisms, however, are poorly understood.

Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), and non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors ameliorate CRC development. NSAIDs attenuate the inflammatory response mainly by inhibiting enzyme activity of COX isozymes, COX-1 and COX-2, thus preventing conversion of AA into the prostanoids PGD 2, PGE 2, PGF 2α, PGI 2 and thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2), Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Model of the metabolization of arachidonic acid (AA). AA is metabolized by 3 different groups of enzymes: cyclooxygenases (COX), lipoxygenases (LOX) and epoxygenases (cytochrome P450). The COX pathway consists of 2 isozymes: COX-1 and COX-2. Both isozymes metabolize AA into PGG 2 and then into PGH 2, which is further converted to the prostaglandins (PGs) PGD 2, PGE 2, PGF 2α, PGI 2 and thromboxane A 2, (TXA 2) by their respective synthases. Each product binds to its specific membrane receptor. The CYP-450 pathway converts AA by epoxygenases and ω-hydroxylase into other downstream products, not shown. The LOX pathway consists of 3 main enzymes termed 5-LOX, 12-LOX and 15-LOX (isozymes 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2). They metabolize AA into hydroperoxyl-eicosatetraenoic acids (HPETEs), which are further reduced to hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). The 5-LOX enzyme differs by also metabolizing 5-HPETE into leukotriene A 4 by means of 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP). *Enzymes already investigated in our laboratory; data published. Receptors/enzymes investigated in this study are underlined with red

### Targeting metabolomics in primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy: uncovering novel insights into disease pathogenesis [^112ZFXt7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

It has been well acknowledged that the biosynthesis of PGE2 from arachidonic acid (AA) involved a cascade of enzymatic reactions catalyzed by phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase (COX), and prostaglandin E synthase. The primary therapeutic aim of PHO is to reduce circulating PGE2 levels. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are conventional options due to their COX-inhibiting properties, therefore reducing the PGE2 levels. Several clinical studies have confirmed NSAIDs' efficacy in PHO. However, the limitations and side effects of NSAIDs (such as gastrointestinal reactions) make it challenging for long-term use. Therefore, exploring alternative therapies aimed at reducing PGE2 levels is urgent and necessary. Currently, inhibitors targeting enzymes related to AA metabolic pathways are an important area of drug discovery. AA, an n-6 essential fatty acid, is the direct precursor of bioactive lipid metabolites of eicosanoids. It is hydrolyzed to PLA2, which is in turn further metabolized by COXs and lipoxygenases (LOXs) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes to a spectrum of bioactive mediators that include prostanoids, leukotrienes (LTs), epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (diHETEs), eicosatetraenoic acid, and lipoxins. The potential disruption of eicosanoid metabolism by the accumulation of PGE2 in PHO, whether through metabolic or transport dysfunction, remains uncertain. This uncertainty raised the possibility of competitive inhibition or feedback regulation affecting the metabolism of other mediators in the AA cascades, such as LTs or hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, potentially exacerbating the clinical symptoms of PHO. Elucidating these metabolic processes is essential for comprehending the clinical manifestations and underlying mechanisms of PHO and discovering novel therapeutic strategies for symptomatic relief.

Metabolomics is an emerging "omics" method that provides an in-depth investigation of the global small molecules in various biological specimens. It is an essential tool for better understanding pathogenesis, disease diagnosis, and prognosis prediction in many diseases. Despite being a systemic metabolic disorder, PHO has a paucity of metabolomic studies. This study utilized a targeted metabolomic approach to analyze a spectrum of metabolites implicated in the prostaglandin metabolic pathway, explicitly focusing on oxylipins and eicosanoids. Through precise quantitative analysis, we could comprehensively assess the alteration in oxylipin networks resulting from the accumulation of PGE2 as an etiology of PHO. The findings of this work might provide a novel insight for understanding the pathogenesis of PHO, potentially revealing new approaches for therapeutic intervention.

### Opioid… [^115uVDcL]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Opioids act by binding to opioid receptors, which are found principally in the central and peripheral nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. These receptors mediate both the psychoactive and the somatic effects of opioids. Partial agonists, like the anti-diarrhea drug loperamide and antagonists, like naloxegol for opioid-induced constipation, do not cross the blood–brain barrier, but can displace other opioids from binding to those receptors in the myenteric plexus. Chronic pain which occurs only periodically, such as that from nerve pain, migraines, and fibromyalgia, frequently is better treated with medications other than opioids. Paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including ibuprofen and naproxen are considered safer alternatives.

They are frequently used combined with opioids, such as paracetamol combined with oxycodone and ibuprofen combined with hydrocodone, which boosts the pain relief but is also intended to deter recreational use. Reinforcement disorders Tolerance Tolerance is a process characterized by neuroadaptations that result in reduced drug effects. While receptor upregulation may often play an important role other mechanisms are also known. Tolerance is more pronounced for some effects than for others; tolerance occurs slowly to the effects on mood, itching, urinary retention, and respiratory depression, but occurs more quickly to the analgesia and other physical side effects. Tolerance is a physiologic process where the body adjusts to a medication that is frequently present, usually requiring higher doses of the same medication over time to achieve the same effect.

It is a common occurrence in individuals taking high doses of opioids for extended periods, but does not predict any relationship to misuse or addiction.
4. Long-term opioid use can cause opioid-induced hyperalgesia, which is a condition in which the patient has increased sensitivity to pain. All of the opioids can cause side effects. Common adverse reactions in patients taking opioids for pain relief include nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, itching, dry mouth, dizziness, and constipation. Nausea and vomiting Tolerance to nausea occurs within 7–10 days, during which antiemetics are very effective. Due to severe side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, haloperidol is now rarely used. A related drug, prochlorperazine is more often used, although it has similar risks.

Vomiting is due to gastric stasis, besides direct action on the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, the vomiting centre of the brain. Vomiting can thus be prevented by prokinetic agents. If vomiting has already started, these drugs need to be administered by a non-oral route.
- Prokinetic agents
- Anti-cholinergic agents Evidence suggests that opioid-inclusive anaesthesia is associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting. Patients with chronic pain using opioids had small improvements in pain and physically functioning and increased risk of vomiting. Constipation Opioid-induced constipation develops in 90 to 95% of people taking opioids long-term.

### Leukotrienes and kidney diseases [^113Vq5Hd]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Leukotrienes are members of the eicosanoid family of bioactive oxygenated fatty acids, containing 20 carbon atoms, and generated by a range of highly regulated biosynthetic pathways. An initial event, common to most of these pathways, is the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α, officially termed PLA2G4A), resulting in its translocation to cellular membranes, where it hydrolyzes phospholipids to generate arachidonic acid. Free arachidonic acid may then be oxidized by the cyclooxygenases COX-1 and COX-2, followed by additional enzymatic transformations, to generate the families of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Alternatively, arachidonic acid may be oxidized by 5-lipoxygenase (5LO, officially termed ALOX5), followed by additional enzymes, to form leukotrienes, lipoxins and resolvins. Eicosanoids act by binding to specific G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), triggering a broad range of physiological and immunological activities. Several comprehensive reviews provide detailed description of these transformations, the structure and regulation of the enzymes involved, the eicosanoid receptors, and available drugs and other agents that inhibit biosynthesis of specific eicosanoids, or act as receptor antagonists.

Two types of leukotrienes, leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) and leukotriene C 4 (LTC 4) are generated in mast cells and other immune cells by colocalization at the nuclear envelope of four components, thereby forming an active biosynthetic machinery: cPLA2α, 5LO, 5LO-activating protein (FLAP, officially termed ALOX5AP) and leukotriene C 4 synthase (LTC 4 S). Arachidonic acid released by cPLA2α is oxidized by FLAP-activated 5LO to yield leukotriene A 4 (LTA 4), a short-lived intermediate that rapidly undergoes two alternative transformations. Its epoxide ring is either hydrolyzed by cytoplasmic LTA 4 hydrolase (LTA 4 H), a fifth component of leukotriene biosynthetic machinery, to yield LTB 4. Alternatively, LTC 4 S conjugates LTA 4 with glutathione to form LTC 4. LTB 4 and LTC 4 are actively effluxed from cells by the transporters MRP4 and MRP1, respectively. Following efflux, the glutathione residue of LTC 4 may undergo partial and consecutive proteolysis by two outer cytoplasmic membrane-anchored proteases: γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and dipeptidase, generating LTD 4 and LTE 4. LTC 4, D 4 and E 4 are collectively termed cysteinyl leukotrienes.

### Arachidonate cascade, apoptosis, and vitamin E in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from hemodialysis patients [^114D7CNZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress are enhanced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from hemodialysis (HD) patients because of upregulation of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of the arachidonate cascade. 5-Lipoxygenase activity is specifically inhibited by vitamin E both in vitro and in vivo regardless of its administration route.

Methods

The effect of arachidonate cascade enzymes and vitamin E on oxidative stress and apoptosis was investigated in PBMCs from 16 maintenance HD patients treated for at least 6 months with cuprammonium rayon membranes in a two-step crossover study: after a 4-week treatment with vitamin E-coated cuprammonium rayon membranes and again after a 4-week treatment with oral vitamin E. Control PBMCs were obtained from 16 healthy volunteers.

Results

Membrane lipoperoxidation, cellular luminescence, membrane fluidity, and leukotriene B(4) content were significantly greater in PBMCs from HD patients; lipoxygenase was upregulated, but prostaglandin H synthase (PHS) was not affected. Regardless of administration route, vitamin E partially controlled lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress through direct inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase. Cultured PBMCs from HD patients showed a significant increase in apoptotic cells compared with controls. Vitamin E markedly reduced cell luminescence, membrane fluidity, and apoptosis, whereas the PHS inhibitor indomethacin was ineffective. Similar results were obtained with control PBMCs induced to apoptosis by hydrogen peroxide.

Conclusion

Reported data suggest that the 5-lipoxygenase branch of the arachidonate cascade is only responsible for membrane peroxidation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis of PBMCs of HD patients, and administration of vitamin E may be helpful in the control of oxidative stress-related disease in these subjects.

### A role for leukotriene antagonists in atopic dermatitis? [^113d3e88]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing skin condition that affects over 2% of the population. The pathophysiology of this disease is not completely understood, but immunologic abnormalities and the subsequent release of inflammatory mediators play a central role. Treatment with glucocorticoids has long been the standard of care, but their use is limited by their adverse effect profile. Leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) are metabolites of arachidonic acid produced through the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. They play an important role in inflammatory and atopic conditions. LT modulating agents have been used with success in asthma. Recently, there has been increased interest in the potential utility of LT antagonists in atopic dermatitis. In vitro and in vivo data have demonstrated that LTs may play a key role in atopic dermatitis. The 2 different types of LT-modulating agents are 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors and LT receptor antagonists. Since the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor acts at an earlier step in the LT synthetic pathway, it has the ability to alter the production of all the LTs, including LTB4, while the receptor antagonists target only the cysteinyl LTs, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4. This reduction of LTB4 activity may point to a therapeutic advantage in using LT synthesis inhibitors as opposed to LT receptor antagonists for atopic dermatitis. Clinical evidence of the use of LT agents in atopic dermatitis is limited, but initial results have been promising and these agents may one day serve as corticosteroid-sparing treatments for atopic dermatitis.

### Modulation of amyloid-β production by leukotriene B4 via the γ-secretase pathway [^111tbETn]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Inflammatory mechanisms have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and among them, the pro-inflammatory 5-lipoxygenase (5LO) enzyme. While previous work has shown that 5LO modulates the amyloidotic phenotype of AD, the exact metabolic product responsible for this biological action remains unknown. In this study, we challenged neuronal cells with leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a major 5LO product, and found that it increased amyloid-β formation whereby elevating the steady-state levels of the γ-secretase proteins, suggesting that LTB4 is the mediator of the 5LO effect. Therapies that by blocking 5LO activation suppress the formation of LTB4 or its action represent novel AD therapeutic opportunities.

### Mesalamine (Canasa) [^115wsodM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon.

### Synthetic curcuminoids modulate the arachidonic acid metabolism of human platelet 12-lipoxygenase and reduce sprout formation of human endothelial cells [^114Uexqq]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Platelet 12-lipoxygenase (P-12-LOX) is overexpressed in different types of cancers, including prostate cancer, and the level of expression is correlated with the grade of this cancer. Arachidonic acid is metabolized by 12-LOX to 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [12(S)-HETE], and this biologically active metabolite is involved in prostate cancer progression by modulating cell proliferation in multiple cancer-related pathways inducing angiogenesis and metastasis. Thus, inhibition of P-12-LOX can reduce these two processes. Several lipoxygenase inhibitors are known, including plant and mammalian lipoxygenases, but only a few of them are known inhibitors of P-12-LOX. Curcumin is one of these lipoxygenase inhibitors. Using a homology model of the three-dimensional structure of human P-12-LOX, we did computational docking of synthetic curcuminoids (curcumin derivatives) to identify inhibitors superior to curcumin. Docking of the known inhibitors curcumin and NDGA to P-12-LOX was used to optimize the docking protocol for the system in study. Over 75% of the compounds of interest were successfully docked into the active site of P-12-LOX, many of them sharing similar binding modes. Curcuminoids that did not dock into the active site did not inhibit P-12-LOX. From a set of the curcuminoids that were successfully docked and selected for testing, two were found to inhibit human lipoxygenase better than curcumin. False-positive curcuminoids showed high LogP (theoretical) values, indicating poor water solubility, a possible reason for lack of inhibitory activity or/and nonrealistic binding. Additionally, the curcuminoids inhibiting P-12-LOX were tested for their ability to reduce sprout formation of endothelial cells (in vitro model of angiogenesis). We found that only curcuminoids inhibiting human P-12-LOX and the known inhibitor NDGA reduced sprout formation. Only limited inhibition of sprout formation at approximately IC(50) concentrations has been seen. At IC(50), a substantial amount of 12-HETE can be produced by lipoxygenase, providing a stimulus for angiogenic sprouting of endothelial cells. Increasing the concentration of lipoxygenase inhibitors above IC(50), thus decreasing the concentration of 12(S)-HETE produced, greatly reduced sprout formation for all inhibitors tested. This universal event for all tested lipoxygenase inhibitors suggests that the inhibition of sprout formation was most likely due to the inhibition of human P-12-LOX but not other cancer-related pathways.

### 5-lipoxygenase activity increases susceptibility to experimental paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection [^116woQ4Y]. Infection and Immunity (2013). Low credibility.

Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis caused by the thermodimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Leukotrienes and lipoxins are lipid mediators produced after 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) activation that exhibit pro- and anti-inflammatory roles, respectively. Here, we have investigated the contribution of 5-LO enzymatic activity in PCM using an experimental model of P. brasiliensis infection. B6.129 wild-type (B6.129) and 5-LO-deficient (5-LO(-/-)) mice were intravenously inoculated with a virulent strain of P. brasiliensis (Pb18), and the survival rate of the infected mice was investigated on different days after yeast infection. 5-LO(-/-) mice exhibited an increased survival rate associated with a decreased number of CFU. The resistance of 5-LO(-/-) during PCM was associated with augmented nitric oxide (NO) production and the formation of compact granulomas. In addition, the absence of 5-LO was associated with a diminished number of CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells, higher levels of gamma interferon and interleukin-12, and increased T-bet (a T-box transcription factor that directs Th1 lineage commitment) mRNA levels in the lungs. Taken together, our results show for the first time that 5-LO enzymatic activity increases susceptibility to P. brasiliensis, suggesting that this pathway may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention during PCM.

### COX-2 / PGE2 upregulation contributes to the chromosome 17p-deleted lymphoma [^1148mSk3]. Oncogenesis (2023). Medium credibility.

Deletions of chromosome 17p, where TP53 gene locates, are the most frequent chromosome alterations in human cancers and associated with poor outcomes in patients. Our previous work suggested that there were p53-independent mechanisms involved in chromosome 17p deletions-driven cancers. Here, we report that altered arachidonate metabolism, due to the deficiency of mouse Alox8 on chromosome 11B3 (homologous to human ALOX15B on chromosome 17p), contributes to the B cell malignancy. While the metabolites produced from lipoxygenase pathway reduced, chromosome 11B3 deletions or Alox8 loss, lead to upregulating its paralleling cyclooxygenase pathway, indicated by the increased levels of oncometabolite prostaglandin E2. Ectopic PGE2 prevented the apoptosis and differentiation of pre-B cells. Further studies revealed that Alox8 deficiency dramatically and specifically induced Cox-2(Ptgs2) gene expression. Repressing Cox-2 by its shRNAs impaired the tumorigenesis driven by Alox8 loss. And, in turn, tumor cells with Alox8 or 11B3 loss were sensitive to the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. This correlation between COX-2 upregulation and chromosome 17p deletions was consistent in human B-cell lymphomas. Hence, our studies reveal that the arachidonate metabolism abnormality with unbalanced ALOX and COX pathways underlies human cancers with 17p deletions and suggest new susceptibility for this disease.

### Interactions between nitric oxide and lipid oxidation pathways: implications for vascular disease [^112Rgpkb]. Circulation Research (2001). Low credibility.

Nitric oxide ((.)NO) signaling pathways and lipid oxidation reactions are of central importance in both the maintenance of vascular homeostasis and the progression of vascular disease. Because both of these pathways involve free radical species that can also react together at extremely fast rates, convergent interactions between these pathways are expected. Biochemical and cell biology studies have defined multiple interactions of (.)NO with oxidizing lipids that could lead to either vascular protection or potentiation of inflammatory vascular injury. For example, low levels of (.)NO generated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase can terminate propagating lipid radicals and inhibit lipoxygenases, reactions that would be protective. Alternatively, if generated at elevated levels, for example, after inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in inflammation, (.)NO can be converted to prooxidant species, such as peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) and nitrogen dioxide ((.)NO(2)), that can potentiate inflammatory injury to vascular cells. Finally, both enzymatic and nonenzymatic lipid oxidation reactions can influence (.)NO bioactivity by directly scavenging (.)NO or altering the induction and catalytic activity of nitric oxide synthase enzymes. In this review, we summarize the biochemical interactions between (.)NO and lipid oxidation reactions and discuss the recognized and potential roles of these reactions in the vasculature.

### Classification… [^1174ft51]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

A wide range of treatments are used for chronic pain; drug therapy including opioid and non-opioid drugs, cognitive behavioral therapy and physical therapy are the most common interventions. Medications such as aspirin and ibuprofen are used for mild pain whereas morphine and codeine are prescribed for severe pain. Non-pharmacological treatments, such as behavioral therapy and physiotherapy, are often used as complementary approaches due to their limited effectiveness when used alone. There is currently no definitive cure for chronic pain, and research continues into new management and therapeutic options, such as nerve blocks and radiation therapy.

Pathophysiology The mechanism of continuous activation and transmission of pain messages, leads the body to an activity to relieve pain, this action causes the release of prostaglandin and increase the sensitivity of that part to stimulation; Prostaglandin secretion causes unbearable and chronic pain. Under persistent activation, the transmission of pain signals to the dorsal horn may produce a pain wind-up phenomenon. This triggers changes that lower the threshold for pain signals to be transmitted. In addition, it may cause non-nociceptive nerve fibers to respond to, generate, and transmit pain signals. Researchers believe that the nerve fibers that cause this type of pain are group C nerve fibers; these fibers are not myelinated and cause long-term pain. These changes in neural structure can be explained by neuroplasticity.

When there is chronic pain, the somatotopic arrangement of the body is abnormally changed due to continuous stimulation and can cause allodynia or hyperalgesia. In chronic pain, this process is difficult to reverse or stop once established. EEG of people with chronic pain showed that brain activity and synaptic plasticity change as a result of pain, and specifically, the relative activity of beta wave increases and alpha and theta waves decrease. Inefficient management of dopamine secretion in the brain can act as a common mechanism between chronic pain, insomnia and major depressive disorder and cause its unpleasant side effects. Astrocytes, microglia and satellite glial cells also lose their effective function in chronic pain. Increasing the activity of microglia, changing microglia networks, and increasing the production of chemokines and cytokines by microglia may exacerbate chronic pain.

It has also been observed that astrocytes lose their ability to regulate the excitability of neurons and increase the spontaneous activity of neurons in pain circuits. Many of the often-used medications for chronic pain carry risks for side effects and complications. For example, chronic use of opioids is associated with decreased life expectancy and increased mortality of patients relative to non-users. Acetaminophen, a frequently used drug in chronic pain management, can cause hepatotoxicity when taken in excess of four grams per day, and even therapeutic doses administered to pain patients with chronic liver disease may cause hepatotoxicity. Also, this disease causes many complications and increases the possibility of death of patients and suffering from other chronic diseases and obesity.

### Anti-inflammatory actions of lipoxin A4 and aspirin-triggered lipoxin are SOCS-2 dependent [^111yWtMU]. Nature Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

Control of inflammation is crucial to prevent damage to the host during infection. Lipoxins and aspirin-triggered lipoxins are crucial modulators of proinflammatory responses; however, their intracellular mechanisms have not been completely elucidated. We previously showed that lipoxin A4 (LXA4) controls migration of dendritic cells (DCs) and production of interleukin (IL)-12 in vivo. In the absence of LXA4 biosynthetic pathways, the resulting uncontrolled inflammation during infection is lethal, despite pathogen clearance. Here we show that lipoxins activate two receptors in DCs, AhR and LXAR, and that this activation triggers expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-2. SOCS-2-deficient DCs are hyper-responsive to microbial stimuli, as well as refractory to the inhibitory actions of LXA4, but not to IL-10. Upon infection with an intracellular pathogen, SOCS-2-deficient mice had uncontrolled production of proinflammatory cytokines, decreased microbial proliferation, aberrant leukocyte infiltration and elevated mortality. We also show that SOCS-2 is a crucial intracellular mediator of the anti-inflammatory actions of aspirin-induced lipoxins in vivo.

### The involvement of 5-lipoxygenase activating protein in anxiety-like behavior [^114EPgaq]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

The 5-lipoxygenase is an enzyme widely expressed in the central nervous system, where its activity is dependent on the presence the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) for the formation of leukotrienes, potent bioactive lipid mediators. Emerging evidence has shown that the FLAP/leukotriene pathway may play a role in neuropsychiatric disease contexts. In this study we investigated whether genetic deficiency of FLAP (FLAPKO) modulated some behavioral aspects in mice, and if this effect was age-dependent. While we observed that FLAPKO mice at 3 and 6 months of age did not different from wild type animals in the elevated plus maze, at 12 months of age they manifested a significant increase in anxiety-like behavior. By contrast, we observed no differences between FLAPKO mice and their controls at any of the three ages considered when they were tested for working memory in the Y maze paradigm. Additionally, while we found that cFOS protein and message levels were reduced in the brains of animals lacking FLAP, no changes for other transcription factors were detected. Taken together our findings suggest a novel role for FLAP in the pathogenesis of anxiety-like behavior. Future studies of FLAP neurobiology may be attractive for development of anxiolytic therapeutics.

### Persisting eicosanoid pathways in rheumatic diseases [^113h6KLT]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

An unmet clinical need exists for early treatment of rheumatic diseases and improved treatment strategies that can better maintain remission with reduced ongoing subclinical inflammation and bone destruction. Eicosanoids form one of the most complex networks in the body controlling many physiological and pathophysiological processes, including inflammation, autoimmunity and cancer. Persisting eicosanoid pathways are thought to be involved in the development of rheumatic diseases, and targeting this pathway might enable improved treatment strategies. Several enzymes of the arachidonic acid cascade as well as eicosanoid receptors (all part of the eicosanoid pathway) are today well-recognized targets for anti-inflammatory drugs that can reduce symptoms of inflammation in rheumatic diseases. In this Review, we outline the evidence supporting pivotal roles of eicosanoid signalling in the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases and discuss findings from studies in animals and humans. We focus first on rheumatoid arthritis and discuss the upregulation of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways as most data are available in this condition. Research into the roles of eicosanoids in other rheumatic diseases (osteoarthritis, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, systemic lupus erythematosus and gout) is also progressing rapidly and is discussed. Finally, we summarize the prospects of targeting eicosanoid pathways as anti-inflammatory treatment strategies for patients with rheumatic diseases.

### Subphenotypes of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory disease-exacerbated respiratory disease identified by latent class analysis [^116dpq1T]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

According to the current recommendations nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)‐exacerbated respiratory disease (abbreviated as NERD) is a proper term to describe the distinct phenotype of aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid; ASA) and other NSAIDs hypersensitivity, which involves upper and lower airway mucosa. 1

It is characterized by eosinophilic inflammation of upper and lower airways, an onset in early adulthood and a predilection for females. Respiratory symptoms are exacerbated by intake of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAID's). 2 Diagnosis is confirmed by aspirin challenge tests. 3 NERD usually has a severe course accompanied by chronic rhinosinusitis with recurrent nasal polyps, often requiring multiple sinus surgeries. 2, 4 Atopy is rather frequent in this population.

A recent meta‐analysis has indicated that 7% of asthmatics are aspirin‐sensitive but that the prevalence doubles in severe asthmatics. 5 A more insightful analysis of individual patients has shown this group to be nonhomogeneous. 6, 7

There is a consensus on the nonallergic mechanism responsible for asthmatic attacks in NERD, involving abnormal metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) by cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LO) pathways. 2 Following ingestion of NSAIDs, COX‐1 inhibition decreases biosynthesis of PGE 2 leading to enhanced or disinhibited synthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs). CysLTs released from eosinophils and mast cells cause abrupt onset moderate‐to‐severe bronchoconstriction and sometimes extrapulmonary signs of facial edema and skin erythema. 2 Transcellular metabolism of AA derivatives in the airway during multi‐cellular interaction generates various eicosanoids able to regulate inflammation and functional responses. The broken balance between anti‐inflammatory mediators known as lipoxins, 8, 9 PGE 2, 10, 11 and potentially pro‐inflammatory mediators such as cysLTs and PGD 2 12 has been linked to both severe asthma and NERD. 13

### The role of human 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) in carcinogenesis-a question of canonical and non-canonical functions [^113U7CgD]. Oncogene (2024). Medium credibility.

Functions of 5-LO

Oxylipin formation (canonical function)

The 5-LO pathway was discovered in the seventies of the last century where it was found that arachidonic acid (ARA) can be oxidized at carbon C(5) which finally leads to the generation of 5(S)-HETE, 5-oxo-ETE and the LTs. Later, the enzymes actually involved in the pathway among them 5-LO, its down-stream LT synthases LTA 4 hydrolase and LTC 4 synthase as well as other enzymes involved in the generation of leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) and the cysteinyl-containing leukotrienes LTC 4, D 4 and E 4 were characterized. Investigation of the biological functions of these lipid mediators revealed that LTs are mediators of inflammatory and allergic responses, are part of the innate immune system and are involved in host defense reactions. Although ARA is by far the preferred substrate, 5-LO can also metabolize certain oxidized ARA derivatives (e.g. 12- and 15-HETE) as well as the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (Fig. 1). In particular, the formation of DHA-derived oxylipins is often low. 5-LO was also reported to be involved in the generation of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) such as lipoxins and resolvins. Figure 1 shows the biosynthesis pathway of 5-LO-dependent oxylipins. However, whereas formation of LTs, 5-HETE and 5-oxo-ETE and their signaling via the respective receptors (BLT1, CysLT1, CysLT2, OXER1) by cells and tissues has been clearly demonstrated, the endogenous biological role of many of the SPMs has recently been challenged: Most of the 5-LO-derived lipoxins and resolvins are hardly produced by leukocytes and only dihydroxylated SPMs such as RvE4 and RvD5 have been consistently detected, the proposed receptors are not validated up to now, and many publications reporting SPM analyses in biological samples used flawed procedures for peak identification and quantification by LC-MS/MS.

### Mesalamine (Pentasa) [^113RRaYN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways (i.e., prostanoids) and through the lipoxygenase pathways (i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids), is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon.

12.2	Pharmacodynamics

The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have not been fully characterized.

### Knock-out of 5-lipoxygenase in overexpressing tumor cells-consequences on gene expression and cellular function [^1129WukZ]. Cancer Gene Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

It is not surprising that 5-LO activity is tightly controlled in cancer cells since biosynthesis of lipid mediators is accompanied by the accumulation of highly reactive lipid species. These lipids can severely damage DNA and RNA structures and also trigger apoptotic and ferroptotic cell death programs. Furthermore, 5-LO products such as LTB 4 and 5-oxo-ETE can draw unwanted attention to the tumor due to their potent chemoattractant properties on neutrophils and monocytes. It can be speculated that 5-LO expression and activity in cancer cells is subject to environmental changes thereby adjusting enzyme expression to current needs. Indeed, unpublished data from our group show that cancer cells can upregulate 5-LO expression and activity upon cell stress.

So the question is, why do tumors still take the trouble of expressing this enzyme? Which benefits might come with it and is it the enzymatic activity of 5-LO that gives an advantage to the cells or do noncanonical functions such as the influence on Wnt signaling and miRNA processing play a role?

In the past, a number of reports employing pharmacological tools such as 5-LO and FLAP inhibitors as well as LT receptor antagonists have shown to have an impact on cancer cell proliferation. These studies have to be treated with care since a majority of the inhibitors used are known to have off-target activities with potencies comparable to LT inhibition. Among these are the attenuation of prostaglandin and epoxyeicosatrienoic acid formation as well as the activation of PPARγ. Furthermore, the compounds were shown to attenuate cell viability independent from 5-LO. It is therefore not possible to draw any conclusions on the share of LT signaling in carcinogenesis from these publications.

Instead of pharmacological inhibition, a number of studies has used antisense technologies to attenuate 5-LO activity. These data show that 5-LO can influence tumor cell proliferation and viability. Curiously, cellular functions such as migration, invasion and establishment of multicellular tumor spheroids have never been investigated in these studies. Since antisense technologies are only able to knock-down the protein of interest residual low expression of this protein remains which might be still sufficient to maintain certain cellular functions. In order to avoid this, 5-LO was knocked-out from the cancer cell lines with the help of CRISPR/Cas-editing in the present study. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this has been done in human cancer cells. Then, the influence on cancer cell gene expression and cellular functions was investigated.

### Airway lipoxin A4 generation and lipoxin A4 receptor expression are decreased in severe asthma [^111CvN53]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Rationale

Airway inflammation is common in severe asthma despite antiinflammatory therapy with corticosteroids. Lipoxin A(4) (LXA(4)) is an arachidonic acid-derived mediator that serves as an agonist for resolution of inflammation.

Objectives

Airway levels of LXA(4), as well as the expression of lipoxin biosynthetic genes and receptors, in severe asthma.

Methods

Samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were obtained from subjects with asthma and levels of LXA(4) and related eicosanoids were measured. Expression of lipoxin biosynthetic genes was determined in whole blood, bronchoalveolar lavage cells, and endobronchial biopsies by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and leukocyte LXA(4) receptors were monitored by flow cytometry.

Measurements and Main Results

Individuals with severe asthma had significantly less LXA(4) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (11.2 ± 2.1 pg/ml) than did subjects with nonsevere asthma (150.1 ± 38.5 pg/ml; P < 0.05). In contrast, levels of cysteinyl leukotrienes were increased in both asthma cohorts compared with healthy individuals. In severe asthma, 15-lipoxygenase-1 mean expression was decreased fivefold in bronchoalveolar lavage cells. In contrast, 15-lipoxgenase-1 was increased threefold in endobronchial biopsies, but expression of both 5-lipoxygenase and 15-lipoxygenase-2 in these samples was decreased. Cyclooxygenase-2 expression was decreased in all anatomic compartments sampled in severe asthma. Moreover, LXA(4) receptor gene and protein expression were significantly decreased in severe asthma peripheral blood granulocytes.

Conclusions

Mechanisms underlying pathological airway responses in severe asthma include lipoxin underproduction with decreased expression of lipoxin biosynthetic enzymes and receptors. Together, these results indicate that severe asthma is characterized, in part, by defective lipoxin counterregulatory signaling circuits.

### 15-lipoxygenase-1 mediates nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced apoptosis independently of cyclooxygenase-2 in colon cancer cells [^112SVM2v]. Cancer Research (2000). Low credibility.

We previously found (I. Shureiqi et al. Carcinogenesis (Lond.), 20: 1985–1995, 1999; I. Shureiqi et al, J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 92: 1136–1142, 2000) that (a) 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) protein and its product 13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-S-HODE) are decreased; and (b) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced 15-LOX-1 expression is critical to NSAID-induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells expressing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). We used the NSAIDs sulindac sulfone (COX-2-independent) and NS-398 (a COX-2 inhibitor) to assess NSAID upregulation of 15-LOX-1 in relation to COX-2 inhibition during NSAID-induced apoptosis in the DLD-1 (COX-2-negative) colon cancer cell line. We found that: (a) NSAIDs up-regulated 15-LOX-1, which preceded apoptosis; and (b) 15-LOX-1 inhibition blocked NSAID-induced apoptosis, which was restored by 13-S-HODE but not by its parent, linoleic acid. NSAIDs can induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells via up-regulation of 15-LOX-1 in the absence of COX-2.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug… [^116reT8r]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Inflammation Differences in anti-inflammatory activity between the various individual NSAIDs are small, but there is considerable variation among individual patients in therapeutic response and tolerance to these drugs. About 60% of patients will respond to any NSAID; of the others, those who do not respond to one may well respond to another. Pain relief starts soon after taking the first dose, and a full analgesic effect should normally be obtained within a week, whereas an anti-inflammatory effect may not be achieved for up to three weeks. If appropriate responses are not obtained within these times, another NSAID should be tried. An estimated 10–20% of people taking NSAIDs experience indigestion. In the 1990s, high doses of prescription NSAIDs were associated with serious upper gastrointestinal adverse events, including bleeding. NSAIDs, like all medications, may interact with other medications.

For example, concurrent use of NSAIDs and quinolone antibiotics may increase the risk of the adverse central nervous system effects of quinolones including seizure. Gastrointestinal The main adverse drug reactions associated with NSAID use relate to direct and indirect irritation of the gastrointestinal tract. NSAIDs cause a dual assault on the GI tract: the acidic molecules directly irritate the gastric mucosa, and inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 reduces the levels of protective prostaglandins. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the GI tract causes increased gastric acid secretion, diminished bicarbonate secretion, diminished mucus secretion and diminished trophic effects on the epithelial mucosa. Numerous "gastro-protective" drugs have been developed to prevent gastrointestinal toxicity in people who need to take NSAIDs regularly. Gastric adverse effects may be reduced by taking medications that suppress acid production such as proton pump inhibitors, or by treatment with a drug that mimics prostaglandin to restore the lining of the GI tract. Renal NSAIDs are also associated with a fairly high incidence of adverse drug reactions on the kidney and over time can lead to chronic kidney disease. The mechanism of these kidney ADRs is due to changes in kidney blood flow. Prostaglandins normally dilate the afferent arterioles of the glomeruli. Since NSAIDs block this prostaglandin-mediated effect of afferent arteriole dilation, particularly in kidney failure, NSAIDs cause unopposed constriction of the afferent arteriole and decreased RPF and GFR. Common ADRs associated with altered kidney function include:

- Sodium and fluid retention
- Hypertension. Allergy and allergy-like hypersensitivity reactions A variety of allergic or allergic-like NSAID hypersensitivity reactions follow the ingestion of NSAIDs.

These hypersensitivity reactions differ from the other adverse reactions listed here, which are toxicity reactions, i.e., unwanted reactions that result from the pharmacological action of a drug, are dose-related, and can occur in any treated individual; hypersensitivity reactions are idiosyncratic reactions to a drug. Some NSAID hypersensitivity reactions are truly allergic in origin: 1) repetitive IgE-mediated urticarial skin eruptions, angioedema, and anaphylaxis following immediately to hours after ingesting one structural type of NSAID but not after ingesting structurally unrelated NSAIDs; and 2).

### A possible role for 15-lipoxygenase in atherogenesis [^113gERYH]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

It is well accepted that high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis. The cellular and molecular mechanisms linking the two however, have not been fully resolved. One of the processes involved in atherogensis that has been intensively studied in this regard is the oxidation of LDL. Oxidation may convert LDL into an atherogenic form, which incites an inflammatory and proliferative response characteristic of the atherosclerotic lesion. One of the potential mediators in this process is the lipid peroxidating enzyme 15-lipoxygenase, which has been shown to be induced in the atherosclerotic lesion and is capable of oxidizing LDL. In this article, we review the motivation for looking at mechanisms of LDL oxidation and the proposed involvement of 15-lipoxygenase in the pathogenesis of the disease.

### 5-lipoxygenase pathway in experimental abdominal aortic aneurysms [^112UXLFJ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The impact of leukotriene production by the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway in the pathophysiology of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) has been debated. Moreover, a clear mechanism through which 5-LO influences AAA remains unclear.

Approach and Results

Aneurysm formation was attenuated in 5-LO(-/-) mice, and in lethally irradiated wild-type mice reconstituted with 5-LO(-/-) bone marrow in an elastase perfusion model. Pharmacological inhibition of 5-LO-attenuated aneurysm formation in both aortic elastase perfused wild-type and angiotensin II-treated LDLr(-/-) (low-density lipoprotein receptor) mice, with resultant preservation of elastin and fewer 5-LO and MMP9 (matrix metalloproteinase)-producing cells. Separately, analysis of wild-type mice 7 days after elastase perfusion showed that 5-LO inhibition was associated with reduced polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration to the aortic wall. Importantly, 5-LO inhibition initiated 3 days after elastase perfusion in wild-type mice arrested progression of small AAA. Human AAA and control aorta corroborated these elastin and 5-LO expression patterns.

Conclusions

Inhibition of 5-LO by pharmacological or genetic approaches attenuates aneurysm formation and prevents fragmentation of the medial layer in 2 unique AAA models. Administration of 5-LO inhibitor in small AAA slows progression of AAA. Targeted interruption of the 5-LO pathway is a potential treatment strategy in AAA.

### 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid mediates angiotensin II-induced phospholipase D activation in vascular smooth muscle cells [^112akWb8]. Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Angiotensin II (Ang II) activates cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) and phospholipase D (PLD) in rabbit vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Ang II also activates ras/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in VSMCs; this activation is mediated by 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and 12(S)-HETE, which are metabolites of arachidonic acid generated by cytochrome P450 4A and lipoxygenase, respectively, produced on activation of cPLA(2). The purpose of this study was to determine if Ang II-induced PLD activation in VSMCs is mediated through the ras/extracellular signal-regulating kinase (ERK) pathway by arachidonic acid metabolites that are generated consequent to cPLA(2) stimulation. Inhibitors of PLD (C(2) ceramide), phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (propranolol), and diacylglycerol lipase (RHC 80267) attenuated Ang II-induced arachidonic acid release. Ang II-induced PLD activation, as measured by [(3)H]phosphatidylethanol production, was inhibited by C(2) ceramide but not by propranolol or RHC 80267. Ang II-induced PLD activation was decreased by the inhibitor methyl arachidonylfluorophosphate (MAFP) and the antisense oligonucleotide of cPLA(2). Inhibitors of lipoxygenases (baicalein) and cytochrome P450 4A (ODYA) attenuated Ang II-induced PLD activation. 20-HETE and 12(S)-HETE increased PLD activity. Inhibitors of ras farnesyltransferase (FPT III and BMS-191563) and MAP kinase kinase (UO126) attenuated the increase in PLD activity elicited by 20-HETE and Ang II. PLD2 was the main isoform activated by Ang II in VSMCs. These data suggest that the CYP4A metabolite 20-HETE, which is generated from arachidonic acid after cPLA(2) activation by Ang II, stimulates the ras/MAP kinase pathway, which in turn activates PLD2 and releases further arachidonic acid for prostaglandin synthesis through the phosphatidate phosphohydrolase/diacylglycerol lipase pathway.

### Emerging therapies for severe asthma [^112kXeG2]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Arachidonic acid pathway blockers

Pro-inflammatory cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTs) are synthesized from arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase (LO) and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) in inflammatory airway cells. In addition to inhibiting the production of the cysteinyl LTs, 5-LO and FLAP inhibitors such as GSK-2190915 prevent the formation of LTB 4, which may be of value in neutrophilic asthma. Prostaglandin (PG)D 2 is released from mast cells and other inflammatory cells and elevated bronchoalveolar lavage concentrations of PGD 2 are reported in severe asthma. PGD 2 activates the CRTH2 receptor (chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th 2 cells) resulting in inflammation and a number of antagonists of the CRTH2 receptor are being assessed for the treatment of asthma.

### Impacts of vaping and marijuana use on airway health as determined by exhaled breath condensate (EBC) [^115k9Lg2]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion of impacted oxylipins

Users of any type of tobacco product observed higher numbers of upregulated oxylipins and higher degrees of upregulation, with only 1 downregulated oxylipin unique to e-cigarette users. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing smoke tobacco exposition induces pronounced inflammatory signs in murine model, measure in bronchoalveolar lavage samples, it also affects the oxylipins profile, with high levels of proinflammatory oxylipins and other oxygenated lipids in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage. It is consistent with previously conducted studies that documented significant increases in proinflammatory oxylipins up to four-fold in plasma in smoking subjects with peripheral artery disease compare with non-smoking group, and a less inflammatory profile was described after the cessation.

On the other hand, cannabis users had fewer upregulated oxylipins and less upregulation overall, and had higher numbers of downregulated compounds, likely a consequence of the presence of cannabinoids that modulate the immune response despite the presence of reactive oxygen species. Cannabinoids have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing proinflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage and reducing oxidative stress in lung tissue, mechanisms mediated in part through the adenosine A2A receptor pathway in murine models. Along with the cannabinoids compounds such as cannabis terpenoids have shown an important role in attenuating oxidative stress by inhibiting inflammatory pathways in murine lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, CBD reduces oxidative damage in murine pulmonary hypertension models in lung tissues, which could explain the oxylipin response observed in cannabis users.

Specifically, the up-regulation found by e-devices users was mainly caused by 14(15)-EpETE and 19-HETE, both compounds metabolized by the cytochrome P450 pathway, suggesting their activation by specific components of vaping liquids. Furthermore, the up-regulation of 9(10)-EpOME, in THC/CBD vapers, involves the same enzymatic activation (cytochrome P450).

This pattern contrasts with in tobacco smokers, where up-regulated 15-HETE, 5-oxoETE, and 20-HETE, are compounds more related to lipoxygenase activity, and would suggest a relationship with nicotine use by combustion.

Cannabis product users (including smokers and vapers) activated the lipoxygenase pathway, showed by 5-HEPE and 14(15)-DiHETE, and highlights the influence of cannabis on oxylipin profiles and differences with nicotine users.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induce apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells by restoring 15-lipoxygenase-1 expression [^117TCXfR]. Cancer Research (2001). Low credibility.

In previous studies, we have found that expression of 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) and its main product, 13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, are decreased in human colorectal cancers and that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can therapeutically induce 15-LOX-1 expression to trigger apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells. NSAIDs similarly induce apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells, although the mechanisms of these effects remain to be defined. In the present study, we tested whether 15-LOX-1 is down-regulated in human esophageal cancers using paired normal and tumor human surgical samples and whether NSAIDs can up-regulate 15-LOX-1 to restore apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells. We found that: (a) 15-LOX-1 was down-regulated in human esophageal carcinomas; (b) NSAIDs induced 15-LOX-1 expression during apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells; and (c) 15-LOX-1 inhibition suppressed NSAID-induced apoptosis, which was restored by 13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid but not by its parent compound, linoleic acid. These findings demonstrate that 15-LOX-1 is down-regulated in human esophageal carcinomas and that NSAIDs induce apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells via up-regulation of 15-LOX-1. They also support the concept that the loss of the proapoptotic role of 15-LOX-1 in epithelial cancers is not limited to human colorectal cancers.

### Migraine… [^113vLPH6]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

A migraine management plan often includes lifestyle modifications to cope with migraine triggers and reduce the impact of comorbidities. Non-pharmacological preventive therapies include stress management, sleep improvement, dietary interventions, and aerobic exercise. Initial recommended treatment for acute attacks is with over-the-counter pain medications and anti-nausea medications. The approval of CGRP inhibitors is seen as a major advance in migraine treatment: According to the American Headache Society, CGRP targeting therapies are a first-line option for migraine prevention. Specific medications such as triptans or ergotamines may be used by those experiencing headaches that do not respond to over-the-counter pain medications. Commonly prescribed prophylactic medications include beta blockers, anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, various other off-label classes of medications, and CGRP inhibitors.

Medications inhibit migraine pathophysiology through various mechanisms, such as blocking calcium and sodium channels, activation of serotonin by 5-HT receptor agonists, and blocking of CGRP transmission in the trigeminovascular system. Prodrome phase Prodromal or premonitory symptoms occur in about 60% of those with migraine, with an onset that can range from two hours to two days before the start of pain or the aura. These symptoms may include a wide variety of phenomena, including altered mood, irritability, depression or euphoria, fatigue, craving for certain food, difficulty speaking or reading, yawning, stiff muscles, constipation or diarrhea, and sensitivity to smells or noise. This may occur in those with either migraine with aura or migraine without aura. Neuroimaging indicates the limbic system and hypothalamus as the origin of prodromal symptoms in migraine.

Success of the surgical migraine treatment by decompression of extracranial sensory nerves adjacent to vessels suggests that some people with migraine may have an anatomical predisposition for neurovascular compression that may be caused by both intracranial and extracranial vasodilation due to migraine triggers. This, along with the existence of numerous cranial neural interconnections, may explain the multiple cranial nerve involvement and consequent diversity of migraine symptoms. Five genes are specific risk to migraine with aura, PALMD, ABO, LRRK2, CACNA1A and PRRT2, and 13 genes are specific to migraine without aura. Using the accumulated genetic risk of the common variations, into a so-called polygenetic risk, it is possible to assess e.g. the treatment response to triptans. In some cases, factors reported as triggers may be more appropriately considered as premonitory symptoms resulting from changes in brain activity during the prodromal phase of migraine. Determining whether and when something acts as a true causal trigger, and when it is a symptom of already-occurring changes, is an ongoing area of study. Studies of the brain's structure and function indicate that brain activity changes during the 48 hours before the pain phase of migraine. During this initial phase of a migraine attack, people may report prodromal/premonitory symptoms such as fatigue, yawning, difficulty concentrating, mood changes, dizziness, neck pain, light sensitivity, food cravings, and nausea. Such symptoms may continue into the pain phase and postdrome. Some studies suggest that PSs may be linked to activity in particular neuroanatomical pathways and areas of the brain.

### Fatty acid desaturation and lipoxygenase pathways support trained immunity [^1157ZXhg]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

It is important to note that in humans there are three described 12/15 lipoxygenases, ALOX12, ALOX15 and ALOX15B. In macrophage populations, the expression of ALOX12 is low or even null. Nevertheless, others have also shown a significant production of 12-HETE in human monocytes. Moreover, the decrease of BGC-enhanced cytokine production induced by 12-LOX inhibition points to the role of this enzyme. Also, it is possible that the increase in 12-lipoxygenated products we observed in vitro and in vivo BCG-exposed monocytes is reflective of increased 15-LOX activity. 15B-LOX is constitutively expressed and produces almost exclusively oxygenated products at carbon 15; on the other hand, in addition to 15-lipoxygenated products, 15-LOX is also able to catalyze the synthesis of oxygenated products at carbon 12. ALOX15 expression is mainly enhanced in M2 macrophagesand in macrophages that contribute to the resolution of inflammation. Yet, pharmacological inhibition of 15-LOX did not decrease BCG-enhanced cytokine production, which questions the possible role of this enzyme in the production of 12-lipoxygenated products in BCG-exposed monocytes. In summary, further studies are necessary to pinpoint the exact enzymes involved in LM production in BCG-trained immunity.

In conclusion, LM, in particular LOX products, are essential for the induction of trained immunity. LOX-derived products increased macrophage responsiveness, similar to other key metabolites in trained immunity, such as fumarate and mevalonate, while inhibition of the long-chain PUFA synthesis pathway dampened cytokine production. Furthermore, circulating monocytes of BCG-vaccinated individuals, which were previously shown to produce increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon heterologous stimulation, were enriched in 12-LOX products. In summary, the monocyte lipidome appears to directly influence the trained immunity phenotype, and its composition likely reflects immune memory. Further studies are warranted to decipher and correlate complex lipid species, such as esterified LOX products, with short- and mid-term immune memory as well as the exact enzymes and possible macrophage sub-population responsible for our findings. Nevertheless, this study highlights the relevance of the LOX pathway in trained immunity, and future studies should explore the LOX pathway as a therapeutic tool for the potentiation of the innate immune system or a target to decrease maladaptive inflammatory programs.

### Zileuton [^114p5Eih]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Zileuton is an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase and thus inhibits leukotriene (LTB4, LTC4, LTD4and LTE4) formation. Both the R(+) and S(-) enantiomers are pharmacologically active as 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors in in vitro and in vivo systems. Leukotrienes are substances that induce numerous biological effects including augmentation of neutrophil and eosinophil migration, neutrophil and monocyte aggregation, leukocyte adhesion, increased capillary permeability, and smooth muscle contraction. These effects contribute to inflammation, edema, mucus secretion, and bronchoconstriction in the airways of asthmatic patients. LTB4, a chemoattractant for neutrophils and eosinophils, and cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) can be measured in a number of biological fluids including bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), blood, urine and sputum from asthmatic patients.

Zileuton is an orally active inhibitor of ex vivo LTB4formation in several species, including mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, sheep, and monkeys. Zileuton inhibits arachidonic acid-induced ear edema in mice, neutrophil migration in mice in response to polyacrylamide gel, and eosinophil migration into the lungs of antigen-challenged sheep. In a mouse model of allergic inflammation, zileuton inhibited neutrophil and eosinophil influx, reduced the levels of multiple cytokines in the BALF, and reduced serum IgE levels. Zileuton inhibits leukotriene-dependent smooth muscle contractions in vitro in guinea pig and human airways. The compound inhibits leukotriene-dependent bronchospasm in antigen and arachidonic acid-challenged guinea pigs. In antigen-challenged sheep, zileuton inhibits late-phase bronchoconstriction and airway hyperreactivity. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Zileuton is an orally active inhibitor of ex vivo LTB4formation in humans. The inhibition of LTB4formation in whole blood is directly related to zileuton plasma levels. In patients with asthma, the IC50is estimated to be 0.46 μg/mL, and maximum inhibition ≥ 80% is reached at a zileuton concentration of 2 μg/mL. In patients with asthma receiving zileuton immediate-release tablets 600 mg four times daily, peak plasma levels averaging 5.9 μg/mL were associated with a mean LTB4inhibition of 98%. Zileuton inhibits the synthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes as demonstrated by reduced urinary LTE4levels.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells [^117NzL3y]. Leukemia (2019). Medium credibility.

Activation of Smoothened (Smo) by Ptch in the Hedgehog signaling pathway also activates Gli family transcription factors which stimulate transcription of target genes such as GLI1, PTCH1, BCL2, CYCLIN D, and MYC. Chronic phase CML cells have high levels of mRNAs transcribed from genes in the Hedgehog signaling pathway suggesting a possible role in leukemia development. Hedgehog signaling is activated in CML LSCs by upregulation of Smo persisting despite TKI-therapy suggesting this pathway is BCRABL1 -independent. Inhibiting Smo has no effect on normal HSCs but inhibits CML LSCs. One study reported exposing CML LSCs to cyclopamine, a Smo inhibitor, reduced their numbers and inhibited growth. Another study reported PF-04449913, a Smo antagonist, causes cycling of CML LSCs and sensitizes them to TKIs.

The PI3K signaling pathway is important in maintaining normal stem cells and CML LSCs. One study reported PI3K signaling upregulates in CML LSCs and correlates with P210 BCRABL1 levels. Normally, AKT phosphorylates FOXO transcription factors where it is sequestered in the cytoplasm. TKI-therapy promotes FOXO nucleus re-localization and restores transcriptional activity. Levels of BCL6, ATM, and CDKN1C, believed to be important for survival of CML LSCs, are increased by FOXO expression. Another study reported inhibition of mTORC1 has no effect on CML LSCs whereas inhibiting PI3K increases susceptibility of CML LSCs to TKI-mediated inhibition. Other data suggest arachidonate-15 lipoxygenase (Alox15) is essential for the maintenance of LSCs in a mouse model of CML. Inhibiting Alox15 expression increases PTEN expression, a negative regulator of PI3K-AKT, and downregulates expression of β-catenin, PI3K, and AKT.

The JAK/STAT signaling pathway may also be important in CML. BCRABL1 activates STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. Downstream oncogenic signaling and JAK2 knockdown reduce P210 BCRABL1 levels in BCRABL1- transfected mouse myeloid cells expressing BCRABL1 -positive cell lines, including BV173, KBM-7, and K562-R. JAK2 -inhibition causes apoptosis of imatinib resistant CD34-positive CML cells from persons in chronic and acute phases. Combining imatinib and interferon-γ decreases STAT5 phosphorylation whilst increasing phosphorylation of STAT1. This increases LSC survival, likely by upregulating expression of BCL6. Ruxolitinib, a JAK2 -inhibitor, with nilotinib may decrease CML LSCs whilst sparing normal stem cells. This remains to be proved. Signaling pathways in CML LSC are displayed in Fig. 2.

### Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase by MK886 augments the antitumor activity of celecoxib in human colon cancer cells [^116Mwfpx]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) are key enzymes involved in arachidonic acid metabolism. Their products, prostaglandins and leukotrienes, are involved in colorectal tumor development. We aimed at evaluating whether combined blocking of the COX-2 and 5-LOX pathways might have additive antitumor effects in colorectal cancer. The expression/activity of COX-2 and 5-LOX were assessed in 24 human colorectal cancer specimens. The effects of the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib and the 5-LOX inhibitor MK886 on prostaglandin E(2) and cysteinyl leukotriene production, tumor cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and Bcl-2/Bax expression were evaluated in the Caco-2 and HT29 colon cancer cells. We also investigated the effect of the enzymatic inhibition on mitochondrial membrane depolarization, one of the most important mechanisms involved in ceramide-induced apoptosis. Up-regulation of the COX-2 and 5-LOX pathways was found in the tumor tissue in comparison with normal colon mucosa. Inhibition of either COX-2 or 5-LOX alone resulted in activation of the other pathway in colon cancer cells. Combined treatment with 10 micromol/L celecoxib and MK886 could prevent this activation and had additive effects on inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, inducing cell apoptosis, decreasing Bcl-2 expression, increasing Bax expression, and determining mitochondrial depolarization in comparison with treatment with either inhibitor alone. The administration of the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1 could prevent some of these antineoplastic effects. In conclusion, our study showed that inhibition of 5-LOX by MK886 could augment the antitumor activity of celecoxib in human colorectal cancer.

### NOD2-mediated innate immune signaling regulates the eicosanoids in atherosclerosis [^113Cgk3e]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The activity of eicosanoid pathways is critical to the inflammatory and immune responses that are associated with the progression of atherosclerosis. Yet, the signals that regulate these pathways are poorly understood. Here, we address whether the innate immune signals of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD) 2 affect eicosanoids metabolism in atherosclerosis.

Approach and Results

Analysis of human carotid plaques revealed that NOD2 was abundantly expressed at both mRNA and protein levels by endothelial cells and macrophages. Stimulation of NOD2 in ex vivo-cultured carotid plaques by muramyl dipeptide, an extrinsic ligand of NOD2, led to release of prostaglandin E2, upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1, and to downregulation of cyclooxygenase-1. NOD2 was coexpressed with cyclooxygenase-2 in lesional macrophages. NOD2-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression in macrophages was dependent on p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and was mediated by interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α. Selective lipidomic analysis of the eicosanoids released by the carotid plaques characterized the metabolites of 12-, 5-, and 15-lipoxygenase as the predominant eicosanoids that were produced by the atherosclerotic lesion in the absence of additional stimuli. Unlike the prostaglandin E2 pathway, metabolic activity of the lipoxygenase pathways was not altered on the short-term activation of NOD2 in carotid plaques.

Conclusions

These results suggest that atherosclerosis may involve enhanced NOD2-mediated innate immunity. Activation of NOD2 preferentially upregulates the prostaglandin E2 pathway. Nevertheless, lipoxygenase pathways, such as 12-lipoxygenase, predominate the basal synthesis and metabolism of eicosanoids in atherosclerotic plaques. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of eicosanoids in atherosclerosis.

### Myc expression drives aberrant lipid metabolism in lung cancer [^112Lw6Kk]. Cancer Research (2016). Low credibility.

MYC-mediated pathogenesis in lung cancer continues to attract interest for new therapeutic strategies. In this study, we describe a transgenic mouse model of KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma that affords reversible activation of MYC, used here as a tool for lipidomic profiling of MYC-dependent lung tumors formed in this model. Advanced mass spectrometric imaging and surface analysis techniques were used to characterize the spatial and temporal changes in lipid composition in lung tissue. We found that normal lung tissue was characterized predominantly by saturated phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylglycerols, which are major lipid components of pulmonary surfactant. In contrast, tumor tissues displayed an increase in phosphatidylinositols and arachidonate-containing phospholipids that can serve as signaling precursors. Deactivating MYC resulted in a rapid and dramatic decrease in arachidonic acid and its eicosanoid metabolites. In tumors with high levels of MYC, we found an increase in cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) activity with a preferential release of membrane-bound arachidonic acid, stimulating the lipoxygenase (LOX) and COX pathways also amplified by MYC at the level of gene expression. Deactivating MYC lowered cPLA2 activity along with COX2 and 5-LOX mRNA levels. Notably, inhibiting the COX/5-LOX pathways in vivo reduced tumor burden in a manner associated with reduced cell proliferation. Taken together, our results show how MYC drives the production of specific eicosanoids critical for lung cancer cell survival and proliferation, with possible implications for the use of COX and LOX pathway inhibitors for lung cancer therapy.

### Opioid… [^115XnTcm]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Opioids act by binding to opioid receptors, which are found principally in the central and peripheral nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. These receptors mediate both the psychoactive and the somatic effects of opioids. Partial agonists, like the anti-diarrhea drug loperamide and antagonists, like naloxegol for opioid-induced constipation, do not cross the blood–brain barrier, but can displace other opioids from binding to those receptors in the myenteric plexus. Chronic pain which occurs only periodically, such as that from nerve pain, migraines, and fibromyalgia, frequently is better treated with medications other than opioids. Paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including ibuprofen and naproxen are considered safer alternatives.

They are frequently used combined with opioids, such as paracetamol combined with oxycodone and ibuprofen combined with hydrocodone, which boosts the pain relief but is also intended to deter recreational use. Reinforcement disorders Tolerance Tolerance is a process characterized by neuroadaptations that result in reduced drug effects. While receptor upregulation may often play an important role other mechanisms are also known. Tolerance is more pronounced for some effects than for others; tolerance occurs slowly to the effects on mood, itching, urinary retention, and respiratory depression, but occurs more quickly to the analgesia and other physical side effects. Tolerance is a physiologic process where the body adjusts to a medication that is frequently present, usually requiring higher doses of the same medication over time to achieve the same effect.

It is a common occurrence in individuals taking high doses of opioids for extended periods, but does not predict any relationship to misuse or addiction.
4. Long-term opioid use can cause opioid-induced hyperalgesia, which is a condition in which the patient has increased sensitivity to pain. All of the opioids can cause side effects. Common adverse reactions in patients taking opioids for pain relief include nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, itching, dry mouth, dizziness, and constipation. Nausea and vomiting Tolerance to nausea occurs within 7–10 days, during which antiemetics are very effective. Due to severe side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, haloperidol is now rarely used. A related drug, prochlorperazine is more often used, although it has similar risks.

Vomiting is due to gastric stasis, besides direct action on the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, the vomiting centre of the brain. Vomiting can thus be prevented by prokinetic agents. If vomiting has already started, these drugs need to be administered by a non-oral route.
- Prokinetic agents
- Anti-cholinergic agents Evidence suggests that opioid-inclusive anaesthesia is associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting. Patients with chronic pain using opioids had small improvements in pain and physically functioning and increased risk of vomiting.

### Trigeminal neuralgia… [^117FMBoo]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Treatment includes medication or surgery. The anticonvulsant carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine is usually the initial treatment, and is effective in about 90% of people. Side effects are frequently experienced that necessitate drug withdrawal in as many as 23% of patients. Other options include lamotrigine, baclofen, gabapentin, amitriptyline, and pimozide. Opioids are not usually effective in the typical form. In those who do not improve or become resistant to other measures, a number of types of surgery may be tried. The pain also tends to occur in cycles with remissions lasting months or even years. Pain attacks are known to worsen in frequency or severity over time in some people. Pain may migrate to other branches over time, but in some people remains very stable.

Rapid spreading of the pain, bilateral involvement, or simultaneous participation with other major nerve trunks may suggest a systemic cause. Systemic causes could include MS or expanding cranial tumors. The severity of the pain makes washing the face, shaving, and performing good oral hygiene more difficult. The pain has a significant impact on activities of daily living, especially as those affected live in fear of when they are going to get their next attack of pain and how severe it will be. It can lead to severe depression and anxiety. Not all people, though, have the symptoms described above; several variants of TN occur, one of which is atypical trigeminal neuralgia, based on a recent classification of facial pain.

In these instances, a more prolonged, lower-severity background pain can be present for over 50% of the time and is described more as a burning or prickling, rather than a shock. Trigeminal pain can also occur after an attack of herpes zoster. Postherpetic neuralgia has the same manifestations as in other parts of the body. Herpes zoster oticus typically presents with inability to move many facial muscles, pain in the ear, taste loss on the front of the tongue, dry eyes and mouth, and a vesicular rash. Less than 1% of varicella zoster infections involve the facial nerve and result in this occurring. Trigeminal deafferentation pain, also termed anesthesia dolorosa, or colloquially as phantom face pain, is from unintentional damage to a trigeminal nerve following attempts to fix a nerve problem surgically. TDP is usually constant with a burning sensation and numbness and is very difficult to treat, as further surgeries are usually ineffective and possibly detrimental to the person.

Causes The trigeminal nerve is a mixed cranial nerve responsible for sensory data such as tactition, thermoception, and nociception originating from the face above the jawline; it is also responsible for the motor function of the muscles of mastication. Several theories exist to explain the possible causes of this pain syndrome. The nerve was once thought to be compressed in the opening from the inside to the outside of the skull; but leading research indicates that it is an enlarged or lengthened blood vessel – most commonly the superior cerebellar artery – compressing or throbbing against the microvasculature of the trigeminal nerve near its connection with the pons. Such a compression can injure the nerve's protective myelin sheath and cause erratic and hyperactive functioning of the nerve.

### Oxylipid profile of low-dose aspirin exposure: a pharmacometabolomics study [^113te6Gi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Omega‐6 fatty acids such as linoleic acid (LA) (C18:2), dihomo‐γ‐linolenic acid (C20:3), or AA (C20:4) and omega‐3 fatty acids such as α‐linolenic acid (C18:3), eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5), or docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6) are essential polyunsaturated fatty acids. The oxidation products of polyunsaturated fatty acids, so‐called oxylipids, are highly potent mediators of both pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory processes. 12 Oxylipids can be formed via COXs, lipoxygenases (LOXs), cytochrome P‐450 monooxygenases (CYPs), and by nonenzymatic oxidation. Oxylipids have myriad functions that are still being elucidated. Aberrant oxylipid signaling has been shown to lead to a number of pathologies important to cardiovascular disease including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, thrombosis, and hemostasis. 13 For example, coronary artery disease patients have higher plasma levels of CYP‐mediated AA metabolites (namely, the oxylipids epoxyeicosatrienoic acid). 14 While some studies have described the effects of aspirin on individual oxylipids, 15, 16, 17 to our knowledge, the systematic effect of aspirin on oxylipid as a class has not been described. Given the complexity of the oxylipid metabolic network, a systematic approach will offer insight into how the entire oxylipid network responds to drug exposure.

Pharmacometabolomics is an emerging field that aims to use metabolomics tools to define the mechanisms of action for drugs and the biochemical basis for variation in response to treatment. 18, 19 Metabolic profiles integrate genetic and environmental influences and provide unique information that can help explain the drug–response phenotype. 20, 21 In the present investigation, we have used a robust, broad‐spectrum mass spectroscopy (MS)‐based metabolomics platform to measure the concentrations of multiple oxylipids in serum samples from 156 healthy volunteers of the Heredity and Phenotype Intervention (HAPI) Heart Study before and after 14 days of low‐dose (81 mg/day) aspirin treatment. We aim to characterize the effect of low‐dose aspirin therapy on the oxylipid metabolic pathways, to investigate sex differences in aspirin‐induced oxylipid changes, and to determine whether oxylipids are associated with aspirin‐induced inhibition of platelet aggregation.

### Lower serum 15-HETE level predicts nasal ILC2 accumulation during COX-1 inhibition in AERD [^115PZ4VP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Utilizing broad lipidomic analysis, we assessed serum eicosanoid mediator levels at baseline and during COX-1 inhibition, and we correlated the mediator levels with airway ILC2 accumulation and symptom scores. We found that baseline 15-HETE levels were negatively correlated with increases in airway ILC2 accumulation such that lower levels of baseline 15-HETE predicted increased nasal ILC2 accumulation at reaction. Notably, a previous study demonstrated that patients with low levels of 15-HETE at baseline had poorer clinical outcomes after aspirin therapy. In our study, baseline 15-HETE levels were not associated with symptom scores at reaction, whereas in the previous study 15-HETE levels were correlated with symptoms after 4 weeks of aspirin therapy. It is possible that the rapid accumulation of ILC2s (and possibly other inflammatory cells) in patients with lower 15-HETE might predispose them to worse outcomes at later time points, although this remains to be investigated.

A potential mechanism postulated by Jerschow et al to explain how low levels of 15-HETE might influence clinical outcomes involves the metabolism of 15-HETE to anti-inflammatory lipoxins via the 5-LO pathway. After aspirin treatment, 5-LO converts 15-HETE to the "aspirin-triggered" 15-epimer counterparts of the lipoxins A 4 and B 4, which have anti-inflammatory properties in addition to those of the lipoxins A 4 and B 4. Intriguingly, lipoxin A 4 has been demonstrated to directly inhibit human ILC2 activation in the presence of PGD 2 and IL-33. Despite this, we did not detect serum lipoxins or resolvins at any time point regardless of symptom severity, although the serum levels may not reflect tissue levels. Thus, it is also possible that 15-HETE might directly or indirectly inhibit chemotaxis of ILC2s, as has been described with inhibition of leukotriene B4–induced neutrophil chemotaxis by 15-HETE. One limitation of our work is that we confined the eicosanoid analysis to peripheral blood, whereas mediator changes in airway fluid and urine could provide further important insights into lipid changes in patients with AERD.

### Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: a syndrome of mast cell-mediated PgD2 overproduction [^115WhMNL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

There is, however, another more intriguing mechanism by which aspirin could benefit patients with AERD in the face of higher CysLT production. Specifically, perhaps all aspirin is accomplishing is exactly what would be predicted from its mode of action; that is, inhibition of cyclooxygenase. Consistent with cyclooxygenase inhibition, the current study also demonstrates lower thromboxane and PgD2 production. Both thromboxane and PgD2 act through the thromboxane receptor to cause bronchospasm. But it is particularly intriguing to consider whether blockade of PgD2 acting through its type 2 receptor (DP2 or CRTH2) could be the primary basis for the clinical benefits observed with aspirin. CRTH2 is expressed on Th2 effector lymphocytes, innate lymphoid type 2 cells, basophils, and eosinophils, and drives recruitment and activation of these cells. The increases in circulating CRTH2 + eosinophils and basophils in the circulation that was observed in the current study would be consistent with the "stranding" of these and likely other CRTH2 + cells in the circulation and result in their failure to ingress into respiratory tissue and affect inflammation.

It is then reasonable to speculate that both aspirin and 5-LO inhibitors benefit AERD through the same final common pathway; namely, the blockade of PgD2 production. The LTE4 receptor is highly expressed on epithelial cells and mast cells. Engagement of these receptors on epithelial cells, in part through their secretion of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin), can indirectly drive mast cell activation and PgD2 production. But CysLTs, including especially LTE4, also act directly on mast cells to cause PgD2 production. Thus, an intriguing solution to the paradox of both 5-LO inhibitors producing decreased CysLT expression and aspirin administration's increased CysLT expression being beneficial in AERD would be that both agents ultimately act to decrease PgD2.

In summary, this study points to the central role of the mast cell in the pathogenesis of AERD, with mast cell–derived PgD2 potentially being a central pathogenic mediator. And any mechanism that blocks PgD2 pathways, including CysLT synthesis inhibitors, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, or perhaps in the future, CRTH2 antagonists, can form the basis for clinical improvement.

### Sputum macrophage diversity and activation in asthma: role of severity and inflammatory phenotype [^115oSUQz]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Macrophages control innate and acquired immunity, but their role in severe asthma remains ill-defined. We investigated gene signatures of macrophage subtypes in the sputum of 104 asthmatics and 16 healthy volunteers from the U-BIOPRED cohort.

Methods

Forty-nine gene signatures (modules) for differentially stimulated macrophages, one to assess lung tissue-resident cells (TR-Mφ) and two for their polarization (classically and alternatively activated macrophages: M1 and M2, respectively) were studied using gene set variation analysis. We calculated enrichment scores (ES) across severity and previously identified asthma transcriptome-associated clusters (TACs).

Results

Macrophage numbers were significantly decreased in severe asthma compared to mild-moderate asthma and healthy volunteers. The ES for most modules were also significantly reduced in severe asthma except for 3 associated with inflammatory responses driven by TNF and Toll-like receptors via NF-κB, eicosanoid biosynthesis via the lipoxygenase pathway and IL-2 biosynthesis (all P < .01). Sputum macrophage number and the ES for most macrophage signatures were higher in the TAC3 group compared to TAC1 and TAC2 asthmatics. However, a high enrichment was found in TAC1 for 3 modules showing inflammatory pathways linked to Toll-like and TNF receptor activation and arachidonic acid metabolism (P < .001) and in TAC2 for the inflammasome and interferon signalling pathways (P < .001). Data were validated in the ADEPT cohort. Module analysis provides additional information compared to conventional M1 and M2 classification. TR-Mφ were enriched in TAC3 and associated with mitochondrial function.

Conclusions

Macrophage activation is attenuated in severe granulocytic asthma highlighting defective innate immunity except for specific subsets characterized by distinct inflammatory pathways.

### Nasal polyposis and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^11743yBH]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is characterized by eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, asthma, and upper-/lower-respiratory tract reactions to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Persistent, severe disease, anosmia, and alcohol sensitivity is typical. AERD is mediated by multiple pathways, including aberrant arachidonic acid metabolism leading to elevated leukotriene E4 and decreased prostaglandin E2. Mast cell mediators (prostaglandin D2) and unique properties of eosinophils and type 2 innate lymphoid cells, along with receptor-mediated signaling, also contribute to AERD pathogenesis. Pharmacologic therapies are a cornerstone of AERD treatment and include leukotriene modifiers, corticosteroids, biologics, and aspirin.

### Human bronchial fibroblasts express the 5-lipoxygenase pathway [^112Y474q]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

We next investigated the in vitro effects of a range of factors associated with asthma and fibrosis that might modulate the LT pathway in fibroblasts (Table 3). At the concentrations used and in 24-hour incubations, there were no meaningful effects of leukotrienes B 4 and D 4, the CysLT 1 antagonist MK-571, histamine, bradykinin, EGF, or pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ) on the expression of 5-LO pathway proteins and LT receptors. In the light of the ability of IL-13 to up-regulate CysLT 1 in HFL-1 cells, and the contrasting failure of IL-4 to induce CysLT 1 or the 5-LO/LTC 4 synthase pathway in nasal polyp fibroblasts, it would be of interest to investigate the effects of these Th2-type cytokines on 5-LO pathway enzymes and LT receptors in primary lung fibroblasts. The impact of glucocorticoids on the 5-LO pathway is variable, with paradoxical upregulation of 5-LO and FLAP being seen in leukocytes. The lack of effect of dexamethasone on 5-LO pathway enzymes in HBF (Table 4) is consistent with their lack of effect on leukocyte production of leukotrienes and the failure of glucocorticoid therapy to alter LT levels in vivo.

Lung fibroblasts from asthmatic subjects have been reported to display persistent phenotypic anomalies compared to normal fibroblasts, including exaggerated proliferative responses even in the absence of mitogens. We hypothesized that asthmatic fibroblasts might also have an upregulated 5-LO pathway or enhanced LT receptor expression. An enhanced capacity for LT synthesis has been observed in the mast cells and PBL of asthmatics compared with normal cells, associated with increased expression of FLAP and other 5-LO pathway enzymes. However, in HBF, there were no differences between the normal and asthmatic donors in basal immunofluorescence for 5-LO pathway enzymes or LT receptors (Table 2), or in their capacity to synthesize LTB 4 and cysteinyl-LTs, nor did any differences emerge when cells from the two groups were treated with TGF-β 1 or with calcium ionophore A23187. This may reflect the relatively small numbers of subjects in our study (n = 5 in each group), or such differences might exist in vivo but be lost during cell culture even within 5–7 passages.

### COX-2 / PGE2 upregulation contributes to the chromosome 17p-deleted lymphoma [^114wUUA1]. Oncogenesis (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Prostaglandin E2 is specifically enriched in del(17p) and Alox8 -deficient cells

Our previous work has shown that arachidonic acid (AA) was accumulated in murine B-cell lymphomas with Alox8 -knockdown or chromosome 11B3 deletion, which is syntenic to human chromosome 17p13. Here, we collected peripheral white blood cells from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients at West China Hospital, and measured AA amount through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We found that cellular AA levels were significantly higher in del(17p) CLL (n = 3) than no del(17p) ones (n = 5) (Fig. 1A). Given that AA can be oxygenated into diverse bioactive lipid metabolites, we wondered how these elevated AA levels would alter the AA-derived metabolites in del(17p) tumors. Therefore, we profiled the AA metabolites, produced through either lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase pathway, in primary mouse B-cell lymphomas with or without 11B3 loss by LC-MS. As Fig. 1B shown, two AA derivatives oxygenated by the cyclooxygenase pathway, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2), were increased in 11B3-deleted lymphoma cells, while multiple metabolites produced from arachidonate lipoxygenases, including hydroxyeicosatetraenoates (HETEs) were reduced in 11B3-deleted cells compared to Trp53 loss only lymphoma cells. Interestingly, the levels of several other ALOX products, such as several hydroxy docosahexaenoic acids (HDoHEs) derived from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were decreased. Altogether, the AA metabolism is largely disrupted in del(17p) tumor cells, with a downregulated lipoxygenase pathway and upregulated cyclooxygenase pathway.

### Steroids for pediatric adenotonsillectomy pain – A prospective multicenter randomized trial [^116gf9DR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids are widely used for postoperative pain management, and their use specifically in AT has been studied for more than 50 years. Any surgical procedure, including AT, leads to mechanical tissue damage and distortion of nerve terminals, with a subsequent tissue inflammatory response that includes bradykinin release and nociceptive pain receptor activation. Corticosteroid effects are primarily anti‐inflammatory. They suppress bradykinin release, reduce inflammatory mediators, and inhibit cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, which reduces prostaglandin production. Currently recommended regimens for postoperative AT pain control include the use of ibuprofen and acetaminophen targeting only the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, thus addressing only a portion of the inflammatory response.

Compared to NSAIDS, glucocorticoids exhibit superior anti‐inflammatory efficacy. A wide array of postoperative corticosteroid regimens have been studied in both adults and children undergoing AT, with benefits seen in children given three postoperative doses of dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg)or a 7‐day course of prednisolone (0.25 mg/kg/day). The postoperative administration of three doses of 0.5 mg/kg dexamethasone was shown to decrease postoperative parental phone calls by 9% and the risk of postoperative AT hemorrhage by 7% in a retrospective review of 1200 children. At a dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day, a 7‐day course of prednisolone showed no significant benefits on postoperative day 1. However, the regimen was associated with decreased pain scores on day 7, along with improvement in diet, activity, reepithelialization on endoscopic examination, fever, and sleep disturbance.

### 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein: a potential link between innate and adaptive immunity in atherosclerosis and adipose tissue inflammation [^1178U2mQ]. Circulation Research (2007). Low credibility.

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a major antiinflammatory mediator in atherosclerosis. Transgenic ApoE(-/-) mice with a dominant-negative TGFbeta type II receptor (dnTGFbetaRII) on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells display aggravated atherosclerosis. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms involved in this enhanced inflammatory response. Gene array analyses identified the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) among the most upregulated genes in both the aorta and adipose tissue of dnTGFbetaRII transgenic ApoE(-/-) mice compared with their ApoE(-/-) littermates, a finding that was confirmed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Aortas from the former mice in addition produced increased amounts of the lipoxygenase product leukotriene B(4) after ex vivo stimulation. FLAP protein expression in both the aorta and adipose tissue was detected in macrophages, but not in T cells. Four weeks of treatment with the FLAP inhibitor MK-886 (10 mg/kg in 1% tylose delivered by osmotic pumps) significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesion size and T-cell content. Finally, FLAP mRNA levels were upregulated approximately 8-fold in adipose tissue derived from obese ob/ob mice. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest a key role for mediators of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in inflammatory reactions of atherosclerosis and metabolic disease.

### Fatty acid desaturation and lipoxygenase pathways support trained immunity [^112yRBuh]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

LOX-derived LM increases monocyte responsiveness in vitro

We next explored the role of COX- and LOX- activity in the establishment of trained immunity. The inhibition of the COX pathway did not ablate BCG-induced enhanced cytokine production (Fig. 3a). Although expression of COX2 was increased in monocytes 4 h following BCG treatment (Fig. 3b), pharmacological inhibition of COX-1, COX-2, or CP450 did not decrease TNFα or IL-6 secreted upon LPS restimulation. Instead, aspirin increased the production of TNFα in both control and BCG-trained monocytes (Figs. 2b, 3a). Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of prostanoid receptors EP2–4 or DP2 did not modulate BCG-induced cytokine production (Fig. S5A). Interestingly, exogenous supplementation of monocytes with the COX product PGE 2, which was increased upon BCG 24 h stimulation, decreased TNFα and IL-6 production after LPS restimulation (Fig. 3c, d).

### Lipid mediators in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^114HsJkh]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a syndrome of severe asthma and rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis with exacerbations of baseline eosinophil-driven and mast cell-driven inflammation after nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ingestion. Although the underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood, dysregulation of the cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism is thought to be key. Central features of AERD pathogenesis are overproduction of proinflammatory and bronchoconstrictor cysteinyl leukotrienes and prostaglandin (PG) D 2 and inhibition of bronchoprotective and antiinflammatory PGE 2. Imbalance in the ratio of these lipid mediators likely leads to the increased eosinophilic and mast cell inflammatory responses in the respiratory tract.

### A metabolic associated fatty liver disease risk variant in MBOAT7 regulates toll like receptor induced outcomes [^111FxnST]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We measured if MBOAT7 inhibition impacts the activity of this pathway. MBOAT7 inhibition led to increased LOX activity at baseline and on stimulation with TLR4 (Fig. S3G), and COX activity upon stimulation with TLR4 (Fig. S3H), while it has no effect on PLA2 activity (Fig. S3I).

We investigated if MBOAT7 deficiency-induced eicosanoids production is responsible for the elevated cytokine production. To this end, we tested the impact of pharmacological inhibitors of key enzymes in the eicosanoids production pathway, namely phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (AACOCF3), 12/15-LOX (PD146176), 5-LOX (L655)and the pan-COX inhibitor indomethacin. Inhibition of key enzymes in the eicosanoids production pathway did not have a profound impact on cytokine secretion (Fig. S3J). Collectively, these data support a rate-limiting role for MBOAT7 in arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediator production in MDMs. While eicosanoids are partially involved in the pro-inflammatory effect of MBOAT7 depletion, other mechanisms likely mediate this effect.

Taken together, our studies revealed the AA metabolism alterations in del(17p) cancers. The deficiency of the co-deleted 17p TSG ALOX15B led to a repressed lipoxygenase pathway and an enhanced cyclooxygenase pathway for AA metabolism (Fig. 5). Moreover, this metabolism abnormality implied a new susceptibility to this recalcitrant malignancy.

### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction update-2016 [^114LQVnT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

Leukotriene pathway inhibitors in exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) — leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) and lipoxygenase inhibitors — attenuate EIB with variable effect, with 30% to 80% attenuation and about 50% of patients responding; diagnostic/protection thresholds referenced include FEV1 decrease > 10%, > 15%, or > 20%. For LTRAs, montelukast is approved by the FDA for adolescents and adults, acts within 1 to 2 hours and provides 24 hours of bronchoprotective activity. Lipoxygenase inhibitors can attenuate EIB when given orally but have relatively short duration and are not currently recommended for this indication.

### Multiomic analysis of familial adenomatous polyposis reveals molecular pathways associated with early tumorigenesis [^116NA3jn]. Nature Cancer (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

We performed a comprehensive multiomic (transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and lipidome) analysis of FAP polyps and adjacent tissues, which represent a valuable model of precancerous progression to CRC. Multiomic analyses revealed numerous molecular and pathway changes in benign polyps relative to mucosa reflecting early changes in early cancer formation (Figs. 2 and 3). Extensive alterations across a number of components in the proteome, lipidome and metabolome were evident; lipidomic and metabolomic changes included arachidonic acid, amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleotides, immune-related lipids and hormones, while proteomic and transcriptomic changes in key pathways were involved in cancer, humoral and cellular immune response, cytokine signaling and cell stress and injury. Many key pathways were involved in cellular homeostasis, metabolism and energy production and organismal survival such as the immune system and were highly relevant to CRC. Key metabolites and lipids included carbohydrates (for example, lactose synthesis), lipids (for example, PC biosynthesis) and amino acids (for example, arginine and proline metabolism).

The transition of polyps to dysplasia was characterized by proteomic and transcriptomic alterations that were predominantly downregulated; functional enrichment was nearly entirely composed of downregulated pathways. Lipid dysregulation in TAG metabolism suggests an energy metabolism shift and putative role for TAGs as an energy source in polyp growth leading to dysplasia. Immune genes were generally downregulated across polyp transitions and the immune response appeared to be activated early during colon hypergrowth, likely reflecting more potent immune surveillance during early disease stages. Arachidonic acid signaling was also upregulated early during polyp formation, contributing to inflammation. While aspirin and NSAIDs are commonly used as prophylactic treatment for persons with FAP, the mechanism of action and optimal timing of this intervention are not known. Of note, we detected significantly decreased expression of key genes in the arachidonic acid signaling pathway. One of them was PLA2, encoding phospholipase A2, which converts DAG or phospholipids to arachidonic acid. Another was ALOX5, encoding lipoxygenase, which uses arachidonic acid to produce 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and leukotriene A4, which has an established pathological role in inflammation and infection. On the other hand, increased arachidonic acid signaling molecules were detected at the metabolic level, together with the dysregulation of key genes in the pathway, emphasizing the value of profiling key transitions at multiple molecular scales.

### COX-2 / PGE2 upregulation contributes to the chromosome 17p-deleted lymphoma [^1122dPH5]. Oncogenesis (2023). Medium credibility.

Upregulation of cyclooxygenase pathway is required for Alox8 loss-driven lymphomagenesis

Because of the disrupted AA metabolism balance between the lipoxygenase pathway and the cyclooxygenase pathway in Alox8 -deficient tumors and the known oncogenic functions of PGE2 in various cancers, we hypothesized that the enhanced cyclooxygenase pathway might mediate the tumor-promoting function of Alox8 loss. Two independent shRNA against Ptgs2 were cloned and validated by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3B). Ptgs2 shRNAs were cloned into a retrovirus-based vector carrying Myc cDNA and tandem shRNAs (sh Alox8.2865 -sh Ptgs2.562 or sh Alox8.2865 -sh Ptgs2.3383), with which Alox8 and Ptgs2 would be simultaneously repressed in the same cell with Myc overexpression. These tandem shRNA constructs were introduced into B progenitor pre-B cells, followed by transplantation into sub-lethally irradiated recipient C57BL/6 mice. The recipient mice were monitored daily by palpation, and the tumor-free survivals were recorded. Kaplan–Meier curve showed that recipient mice transplanted with sh Alox8.2865 -sh Ren transduced pre-B cells developed lymphomas with a median latency of 17 days, similar to those with sh Alox8.2865 only. However, compared to control sh Alox8 -sh Ren recipient mice, mice carrying sh Alox8 -sh Ptgs2 pre-B cells developed lymphomas with significantly longer tumor latencies (Fig. 3C; Median onset 27 and 39 days, respectively). Intriguingly, although the resulting lymphoma cells containing sh Alox8 -sh Ptgs2 as enriched GFP + cells in enlarged lymph nodes, these cells have upregulated Ptgs2 gene expression to a similar level as that in control sh Alox8 -sh Ren lymphoma cells (data not shown) and displayed similar histological features (Supplementary Fig. 3 A, B), suggesting that sh Ptgs2 suppressive effect on Ptgs2 mRNA level had been bypassed or compensated during lymphomagenesis. Altogether, these results strongly indicated that the cyclooxygenase pathway upregulation, following Alox8 loss, was required for lymphomagenesis driven by Alox8 deficiency.

### A novel β-oxa polyunsaturated fatty acid downregulates the activation of the ikappaB kinase / nuclear factor kappaB pathway, inhibits expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules, and depresses inflammation [^117PsrFZ]. Circulation Research (2006). Low credibility.

Several novel polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that contain either an oxygen or sulfur atom in the beta-position were found to exhibit more selective antiinflammatory properties than their natural PUFA counterparts. One of these, beta-oxa-23:4n-6, unlike natural PUFAs, lacked ability to stimulate oxygen radical production in neutrophils but caused marked inhibition of agonist-induced upregulation of leukocyte adhesion to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression. In addition, beta-oxa-23:4n-6 inhibited acute and chronic inflammatory responses in mice as well as the upregulation of adhesion molecule expression in arterial endothelium. This action of beta-oxa-23:4n-6 required a functional 12- but not 5-lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenases, consistent with its metabolism via the 12-lipoxygenase pathway. Whereas beta-oxa-23:4n-6 did not affect the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases by tumor necrosis factor, activation of the IkappaB kinase/nuclear factor kappaB pathway was selectively inhibited. These novel PUFAs could form the basis for a potential new class of pharmaceuticals for treating inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis.

### Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: a syndrome of mast cell-mediated PgD2 overproduction [^113sFUCg]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

It was assumed that aspirin desensitization would work by recapitulating the pathways mediated by 5-LO inhibition, namely, reduction in CysLT production. However, in this issue of the Journal, Cahill and colleagues (pp.) investigated the effects of aspirin therapy on biomarkers of AERD. Surprisingly, this study demonstrated the paradox that high-dose aspirin administration after desensitization increases numerous markers of allergic (type 2) inflammation, and specifically actually further increased CysLT production. Thus, the two medical treatments we have for AERD have exactly opposite effects on what has been thought to be this central pathogenic mediator.

Finding an explanation for the increase in type 2 inflammation is more straightforward. In AERD, PgE2 (prostaglandin E2) primarily mediates anti-inflammatory effects and, specifically, constrains the activation of eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, and other immune cells. The severe hypersensitivity reactions that occur in AERD in response to aspirin reflect the loss of this PgE2 inhibitory pathway, as can be demonstrated by the ability of PgE2 homologs to block reactions. In the current study, the authors further support this concept by demonstrating that high-dose aspirin lowers PgE2 concentrations, and thereby enhances several aspects of allergic inflammation, including enhanced mast cell activation with higher levels of tryptase and the CysLTs.

But how is it possible to reconcile this increased production of CysLTs with the clinical benefits observed? In addition to CysLT overproduction, AERD is also characterized by exquisite sensitivity to CysLTs, with CysLT challenges driving enhanced bronchospasm, eosinophil recruitment, and worsening of bronchial hyperreactivity. These effects are particularly profound with LTE4 challenges, likely reflecting LTE4 acting through the recently described LTE4 receptor (LTE4R). One explanation for a clinical benefit of aspirin in the face of increased CysLT production would be if aspirin downregulated CysLT receptors or signaling. Reduced CysLT receptor 1 expression does occur, although this is less likely to explain any therapeutic benefit given the usual disappointing results with LT receptor antagonists. Nor would this explain the specific decreases in sensitivity to LTE4 challenges, arguing perhaps for decreased expression of LTE4R. Reduced LTE4R transcript expression was not reported in the studies performed on peripheral blood in this study. But modulation of LTE4R expression has not been studied in nasal polyps or lung samples, studies clearly needing to be performed. A mechanism for reduced LT receptor expression could be mediated through the reported influences of aspirin on immune and signaling pathways (e.g. stat6 and cytokine production).
