## Question

Is Hiprex associated with formaldehyde?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Hiprex (methenamine hippurate) is associated with formaldehyde. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the active ingredient in Hiprex is and how it is formulated. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action in the urinary tract and whether formaldehyde is indeed generated. Next, I will check that formaldehyde is the actual antimicrobial moiety and not a secondary byproduct. After that, I should review safety interactions and laboratory interferences that hinge on formaldehyde release. Finally, I will synthesize a clear clinical conclusion and counseling points grounded in labeling and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the product and its composition to avoid any confusion at the outset. Hiprex is the brand name for methenamine hippurate tablets USP; it consists of methenamine (hexamethylenetetramine) paired with hippuric acid as the salt form, which matters because hippurate can help maintain an acidic urinary environment that is required for the drug to work properly [^115dx72o] [^111xqJVd].

> Now, I need to check the mechanism of action exactly as stated in regulatory labeling. In acid urine, the methenamine component is hydrolyzed to ammonia and the bactericidal agent formaldehyde; this is explicitly described in the FDA labeling for both methenamine hippurate (Hiprex) and methenamine mandelate, which I'm using here cross-referentially to corroborate the same core mechanism of methenamine across salt forms [^111xqJVd] [^114AyQWc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which component is doing the antimicrobial heavy lifting. At first glance, I almost said hippuric acid was the principal antibacterial, but wait, the labels are clear that the antibacterial activity of Hiprex is due to formaldehyde released from the methenamine moiety in acidic urine, while hippuric acid has modest antibacterial properties and primarily helps maintain the required acidic pH for methenamine conversion to formaldehyde [^111xqJVd] [^114AyQWc].

> I should confirm that formaldehyde is the active antimicrobial species and that its activity is nonspecific across common uropathogens. The labeling indicates broad activity because formaldehyde's action is nonspecific, with activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, though maintaining urine pH at or below approximately 5.5 is critical for efficacy and for inhibiting urea-splitting organisms that would otherwise alkalinize the urine and reduce formaldehyde generation [^111xqJVd] [^114AyQWc].

> Next, I should review clinically relevant safety interactions that depend on formaldehyde being present in the urine. I need to ensure I highlight the classical contraindicated combination with sulfonamides because formaldehyde can precipitate with certain sulfonamides in acidic urine, and I should also note core contraindications listed for Hiprex and the risk of bladder irritation at very high methenamine doses described in labeling [^1133YdKb] [^111eA1Xe].

> Wait, let me verify laboratory interferences that would only make sense if formaldehyde is released in the urinary tract. Formaldehyde in urine can artifactually alter several assays, including fluorometric urinary catecholamines, VMA, and 5-HIAA, and can also cause spuriously low urine estriol values when acid hydrolysis methods are used in pregnancy testing, with enzymatic hydrolysis circumventing the issue; these interferences are consistently described in methenamine labels and the Hiprex labeling's pregnancy testing precautions, which further corroborates urinary formaldehyde generation in vivo [^113mMVLj] [^113F4y36].

> Let me think about the clinical implications to ensure counseling is aligned with how the drug actually works. Because antibacterial activity depends on urinary acidification and intraluminal formaldehyde release, patients should be advised on maintaining acidic urine and on the limited role of Hiprex as prophylaxis or suppression after eradication of acute infection, consistent with FDA indications and with contemporary guideline positions that consider methenamine hippurate as an effective nonantibiotic alternative for preventing recurrent lower UTIs in appropriately selected women [^115gsEMv] [^1175TKBM] [^115r3sm4] [^116E419A].

> In conclusion, I should double-check that my bottom line directly answers the question. Yes — Hiprex (methenamine hippurate) is a formaldehyde-releasing agent; its therapeutic effect is mediated by formaldehyde produced from methenamine in acidic urine, and this is explicitly documented in FDA-approved labeling, with downstream interaction and laboratory cautions that only make sense in the presence of urinary formaldehyde, which collectively provides convergent clinical and mechanistic evidence for this association [^111xqJVd] [^114AyQWc] [^1133YdKb] [^113mMVLj] [^113F4y36].

---

Yes, Hiprex (methenamine hippurate) is directly related to formaldehyde because its antibacterial effect depends on **urinary formaldehyde release** when urine pH is ≤ 5.5 [^114AyQWc]. This formaldehyde is the **active bactericidal agent** in the urine, not in systemic circulation [^111xqJVd]. Patients with formaldehyde allergy or sensitivity should avoid Hiprex due to potential reactions, and it is contraindicated with sulfonamides because formaldehyde can precipitate with them in urine [^113HTFEh] [^1133YdKb] [^113mMVLj].

## Chemical relationship between hiprex and formaldehyde

- **Methenamine component**: Methenamine is a heterocyclic compound that hydrolyzes in acidic urine to release formaldehyde and ammonia, providing the antibacterial effect of Hiprex [^111xqJVd].

- **Hippuric acid component**: Hippuric acid helps maintain acidic urine, promoting formaldehyde release from methenamine [^111xqJVd].

- **Formaldehyde release**: In urine pH ≤ 5.5, methenamine hydrolyzes to formaldehyde, which exerts bactericidal activity [^114AyQWc] [^111xqJVd].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of action

**Antibacterial activity** is mediated by formaldehyde, which denatures bacterial proteins and nucleic acids, thereby killing or inhibiting bacteria in the urinary tract [^111xqJVd]. This effect is **urine pH-dependent**, requiring acidic urine (pH ≤ 5.5); alkalinization reduces efficacy [^114AyQWc] [^115gsEMv].

---

## Clinical implications of formaldehyde release

- **Therapeutic efficacy**: Formaldehyde release is essential for preventing recurrent UTIs, with efficacy comparable to antibiotics in some studies [^116u8kr5] [^111uX36B].

- **Safety considerations**: Formaldehyde is a known irritant and sensitizer; patients with formaldehyde allergy or sensitivity should avoid Hiprex.

- **Contraindications**: Hiprex is contraindicated with sulfonamides because formaldehyde can form insoluble precipitates in urine [^1133YdKb] [^113mMVLj].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guideline support comes from AUA/CUA/SUFU 2025 [^117EbA4b], EAU 2025 [^115r3sm4], and AAFP 2024 [^116E419A], which recommend **methenamine hippurate** for **recurrent UTI prophylaxis** in appropriate patients. Patient selection favors individuals without urinary tract abnormalities [^115r3sm4] and with **adequate renal function** to achieve effective urinary formaldehyde concentrations [^1133YdKb].

### Methenamine mandelate [^114AyQWc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Methenamine mandelate, USP, is readily absorbed but remains essentially inactive until it is excreted by the kidney and concentrated in the urine. An acid urine is essential for antibacterial action, with maximum efficacy occurring at a pH of 5.5 or less. In such conditions, mandelic acid exerts its antibacterial action and also contributes to the acidification of the urine. Mandelic acid is excreted both by glomerular filtration and tubular excretion.

The methenamine component, in an acid urine, is hydrolyzed to ammonia and to the bactericidal agent formaldehyde. There is equally effective antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, as the antibacterial actions of mandelic acid and formaldehyde are nonspecific. Reports indicate methenamine mandelate, USP, may be ineffective in some infections with Proteus vulgaris and urea-splitting strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and A. aerogenes. Since urea-splitting strains may raise the pH of the urine, particular attention to supplementary acidification is required. However, results in any single case will depend significantly on the underlying pathology and the overall management.

### Hiprex [^111xqJVd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Microbiology: Hiprex (methenamine hippurate tablets USP) has antibacterial activity due to the methenamine component being hydrolyzed to formaldehyde in acid urine. Hippuric acid, the other component, possesses some antibacterial activity and also helps maintain acidic urine. The drug is generally active against E. coli, enterococci, and staphylococci, whereas Enterobacter aerogenes is generally resistant. It is crucial to maintain sufficiently acidic urine to inhibit urea-splitting organisms such as Proteus and Pseudomonas.

Human pharmacology: Within 1/2 hour after ingestion of a single 1-gram dose of Hiprex, antibacterial activity becomes evident in the urine. Continuous antibacterial activity in urine is observed when Hiprex is administered at the recommended dosage schedule of 1 gram twice daily. Over 90% of the methenamine moiety is excreted in the urine within 24 hours following administration of a single 1-gram dose. Similarly, the hippurate moiety is rapidly absorbed and excreted, reaching the urine by both tubular secretion and glomerular filtration. This action may be important in older patients or in those with some degree of renal impairment.

### Hiprex [^1133YdKb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Hiprex (methenamine hippurate tablets USP) is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency, severe hepatic insufficiency, or severe dehydration. Methenamine preparations should not be given to patients taking sulfonamides, because some sulfonamides may form an insoluble precipitate with formaldehyde in the urine.

### Hiprex [^113F4y36]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Prescribing Hiprex in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection, or a prophylactic indication, is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Precautions**:
	1. Care should be taken to maintain an acid pH of the urine, especially when treating infections due to urea-splitting organisms such as Proteus and strains of Pseudomonas.

	2. In a few instances in one study, the serum transaminase levels were slightly elevated during treatment but returned to normal while the patients were still taking Hiprex. Because of this report, it is recommended that liver function studies be performed periodically on patients taking the drug, especially those with liver dysfunction.

	3. **Use in pregnancy**: In early pregnancy, the safe use of Hiprex is not established. In the last trimester, safety is suggested but not definitely proven. No adverse effects on the fetus were seen in studies in pregnant rats and rabbits. Hiprex taken during pregnancy can interfere with laboratory tests of urine estriol, resulting in unmeasurably low values when acid hydrolysis is used in the laboratory procedure. This interference is due to the presence in the urine of methenamine and/or formaldehyde. Enzymatic hydrolysis, in place of acid hydrolysis, will circumvent this problem.

	4. This product contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine), which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible individuals.

### 'Real-world' compensatory behaviour with low nicotine concentration e-liquid: Subjective effects and nicotine, acrolein and formaldehyde exposure [^113UuVcs]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

The published protocol describes the procedure and measures in detail. Participants were eligible to participate if they were aged 18 or older, experienced and exclusive daily e-cigarette users (with daily use for more than three months), currently using a second- or third-generation e-cigarette, using a nicotine concentration e-liquid of 12 mg/ml or higher (to ensure participants were familiar with higher levels of nicotine) or sub-ohming at any nicotine level, and non-smokers as confirmed by carbon monoxide (CO) levels in expired breath of 10 parts per million (p.p.m.) or less. We excluded pregnant or lactating females, smokers or users of marijuana or other illicit drugs, and those with a serious medical condition (self-reported). Participants met with the researcher on five separate occasions (at baseline and the end of each of the four experimental conditions).

At baseline, participants provided written informed consent, demographic characteristics, and smoking/vaping history, then sampled four e-liquids (tobacco, fruit, bakery, and menthol), selecting one to be used for the next four weeks. Participants were provided with an eVic Supreme™ by Joytech fitted with a 'Nautilus Aspire' tank housing a BVC atomizer (1.6 Ohm) and seven 10-ml bottles of e-liquid for the week (6 or 18 mg/ml according to condition).

For each puff, the eVic records the time of the puff, puff length (in seconds), atomizer resistance, voltage, and wattage. To ensure device familiarity before changes were permitted, the first two weeks were always fixed at 4.0 V (10 W) with the widest airflow setting on the tank. Changes to voltage and a…

### Hidden formaldehyde in cosmetic products [^113U7D6U]. Contact Dermatitis (2024). Low credibility.

Formaldehyde is a common cause of contact allergy. Hidden formaldehyde, which refers to formaldehyde in products without formaldehyde releasers, has previously been detected in cosmetic products.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this study was to investigate the content and causes of hidden formaldehyde in leave-on cosmetic products.

- **Methods**: The formaldehyde release from 142 cosmetic products, primarily creams, was analyzed using the chromotropic acid (CA) method. The study included 130 products with no formaldehyde releasers on the ingredient list and 12 products with formaldehyde releasers. Products without formaldehyde releasers positive to CA, that is, with formaldehyde ≥ 2.5ppm, were additionally analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Formaldehyde release from selected raw materials and packaging was also investigated.

- **Results**: Hidden formaldehyde was found in 23 of the 130 products (18%) without formaldehyde releasers on the ingredient list. The average formaldehyde content was 105 ppm (range: 0.5–507 ppm) in products with hidden formaldehyde and 355 ppm (range: 75–637 ppm) in eight products with formaldehyde releasers, selected for HPLC analysis. Impurities of formaldehyde in dihydroxyacetone may be a cause of hidden formaldehyde in self-tanners. No clear pattern was found for the other products with hidden formaldehyde.

- **Conclusions**: Changes in regulation are needed to prevent allergic contact dermatitis from hidden formaldehyde in cosmetic products.

### Formaldehyde exposure and patterns of concomitant contact allergy to formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers [^111hhLV4]. Contact Dermatitis (2010). Low credibility.

Formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers are widely used in consumer products and may often cause contact allergy.

- **Objective**: To investigate the prevalence of concomitant contact allergy to formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers in dermatitis patients, and to determine the sources of formaldehyde exposure based on personal and occupational products obtained from dermatitis patients.

- **Methods**: Patch test data from referred dermatitis patients with a positive patch test reaction to formaldehyde or formaldehyde-releasers were analysed. For the period 2000–2008, the formaldehyde content in products obtained from formaldehyde-allergic patients was analysed by chromotropic acid test and/or acetylacetone test.

- **Results**: Patients allergic to a formaldehyde-releaser often had simultaneous contact allergy to formaldehyde; other combinations were also prevalent. In patients who reacted to more than two formaldehyde-releasers, nearly all reacted simultaneously to formaldehyde. Seventy-five percent of the formaldehyde-allergic patients used a product that contained formaldehyde. The main source of formaldehyde exposure was cosmetics (78%).

- **Conclusions**: Concomitant contact allergy to formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers remains common. Furthermore, contact allergy to a formaldehyde-releaser was nearly always concomitant with another formaldehyde-releaser. Formaldehyde was commonly found in personal products used by formaldehyde-allergic patients.

### Histology without formalin [^117UVwSL]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Because formalin is toxic, carcinogenic, and a poor preserver of nucleic acids, for more than 20 years, there have been numerous attempts to find a substitute, with as many different alternative fixatives, none totally successful. Formaldehyde, known for its fast penetration, is a slow and reversible fixative requiring 24 to 48 hours to completely bind to tissue. Thus, any surgical specimen arriving at the laboratory between 8 AM and 4 PM and processed conventionally for the slides to be ready the following day will only be between 30% and 66% bound, and even less fixed when dehydration starts, resulting in an additional and also incomplete alcoholic fixation. This causes infiltration problems and can affect subsequent tests, especially immunohistochemistry.

Formaldehyde fixation is tissue thickness independent between 16 micrometers and 4 mm but is faster at temperatures above room temperature. The fixation of specimens with less than 24 hours in formalin can be improved if the fixing stations in conventional tissue processors are set at 40 degrees Celsius.

If safety measures are improved to offer a work environment with a time-weighted average level of 0.4 ppm, and the contact with formalin is reduced to a minimum by discouraging its neutralization and limiting the recycling practice to filtering methods, formalin could remain as the routine fixative, with modified methacarn for those specimens requiring nucleic acids studies. This is a preferred solution than having to validate all the standard and special procedures, including those approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, if formalin is completely replaced.

### Ex vivo anti-microbial efficacy of various formaldehyde releasers against antibiotic resistant and antibiotic sensitive microorganisms involved in infectious keratitis [^112EqMzv]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

In this study, we tested the anti-microbial efficacy of five formaldehyde releasers (FARs) against five different relevant pathogens. A main point of this study has been to delineate potential differences in efficacy between the different compounds. The effect of FARs differed among microorganisms, compounds, and their concentrations.

SMG proved to be the most effective overall. Compared to the control group, the most prominent bactericidal effect for 60-minute incubations was obtained for 100 mM SMG against MRSA (kill rate 96%, SD 5%) and PA (kill rate 96%, SD 3%). This is particularly important, as these two species are particularly prevalent antibiotic-resistant organisms. For VRE, the best effect was obtained with DMDM 100 mM at 60 minutes (kill rate 91%, SD 7%).

As expected, based on the relationship between contact time and kill rate, using a 120-minute incubation time, the kill rate exceeded 90% in 11 different cases. These include: DAU 100 mM and SMG 100 mM for all bacteria tested (MRSA, MSSA, PA, VRE), DAU 40 mM for VRE, SMG 40 mM for MRSA, and DMDM 100 mM for PA. Greater killing effects were not always observed by extending the exposure time from 60 minutes to 120 minutes for a given concentration. When comparing kill rates between 60 minutes and 120 minutes at the same concentration, inconsistencies were noted.

The reasons for these inconsistencies are unclear. Possible explanations include the occurrence of polymerization effects due to released free formaldehyde (i.e. formaldehyde polymerizing with itself), as well as possible reactions with the FAR products resulting in the formation of undefined compounds.

### Hiprex [^113ridBz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including Hiprex, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When Hiprex is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be informed that, although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Hiprex or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### Quantitative analysis of histone modifications: Formaldehyde is a source of pathological n(6)-formyllysine that is refractory to histone deacetylases [^1167C5eJ]. PLoS Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

In addition to physiological secondary modifications, proteins are subjected to reactions with endogenous electrophiles generated by oxidative stress, inflammation, and normal cell metabolic processes. These adventitious or pathological modifications typically arise from the reaction of the nucleophilic side chains of lysine, histidine, and cysteine with reactive electrophiles such as malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), and glyoxal generated by the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and carbohydrates, among other biomolecules. The resulting adducts, which can alter protein function and lead to protein degradation, are associated with a variety of pathological processes and human diseases. Among these pathological adducts, N6-formylation of lysine has recently emerged as an abundant protein modification. While originally described in chromatin proteins, it has since been identified as an adduct arising in proteins subjected to nitrosative and oxidative stresses.

In chromatin proteins, N6-formyllysine has the potential to interfere with the functions of other post-translational modifications that perform signaling functions, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and ADP ribosylation, with some locations modified in more than one way. The chemical similarities of N6-formyllysine and N6-acetyllysine suggest a disruptive role for the former in signaling by histone acetylation. Indeed, N6-formyllysine has been detected at conserved sites of lysine acetylation and methylation in histones.

### Effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing urinary tract infections: an updated systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113jJpAM]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

This systematic review, meta-analysis, and trial sequential analysis evaluated the effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs) compared to antibiotics. Our findings indicate no significant differences in the incidence of symptomatic UTI episodes between the methenamine hippurate and antibiotic groups.

Similarly, both interventions demonstrated equivalent efficacy in reducing positive urine cultures. However, asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) was notably higher in the methenamine hippurate group (RR 1.91; 95% CI 1.29, 2.81; p = 0.0001; I² = 0%).

The increased ABU in the methenamine hippurate group may be attributed to its mechanism of action, which relies on the urinary environment to release formaldehyde for bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects. While this mechanism effectively reduces symptomatic episodes, it may not eliminate bacteria as systemically or thoroughly as antibiotics. Antibiotics, with their broader and more systemic antimicrobial activity, likely contribute to the lower rates of ABU observed in this analysis. This finding emphasizes the need for further studies investigating the relationship between ABU and long-term outcomes in patients using methenamine hippurate.

Regarding adverse effects, the analysis revealed fewer adverse events in the antibiotic group, contrary to expectations given the well-documented side effects of antibiotics, including gastrointestinal disturbances and allergic reactions. This unexpected result may stem from the limited reporting of adverse effects in the included studies.

### Ex vivo anti-microbial efficacy of various formaldehyde releasers against antibiotic resistant and antibiotic sensitive microorganisms involved in infectious keratitis [^116BuviZ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

DAU is an allantoin derivative, where allantoin reacts with four equivalents of formaldehyde under basic conditions to form the parent compound. Thus, it has a theoretical yield of 4 mol of FA per mole of DAU. Dilution encourages the decomposition reaction, overcoming possible steric interference and facilitating the separation of the formaldehyde moiety from the mother compound. However, the actual FA yield of DAU is less than the expected 4 mol. Lehmann et al. demonstrated that DAU exists as a mixture of isomers, with "compound BHU" (1-(3,4-bis-hydroxymethyl-2,5-dioxo-imidazolidin-4-yl)-1,3-bis-hydroxymethyl-urea) as the dominant form (30–40%). It is hypothesized that the remainder consists of many polymers of allantoin-formaldehyde condensation products. Thus, this complex mixture of compounds could account for the lower than expected FA yield.

### SPL drug information for methenamine hippurate [^114KDtJ4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of methenamine hippurate PO (also known as Hiprex) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Animal studies using the hippurate salt have failed to reveal evidence of fetal harm. The safe use of methenamine hippurate in early pregnancy is not established. In the last trimester, the safety of methenamine hippurate is suggested but not definitively proven. The drug methenamine hippurate PO (also known as Hiprex) is classified under category A in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

### Hiprex [^1175TKBM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Hiprex is indicated for prophylactic or suppressive treatment of frequently recurring urinary tract infections when long-term therapy is considered necessary. This drug should only be used after eradication of the infection by other appropriate antimicrobial agents.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Hiprex and other antibacterial drugs, Hiprex should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Formaldehyde-releasers in cosmetics in the United States and in Europe [^1126AhPS]. Contact Dermatitis (2010). Low credibility.

Frequencies of sensitization to formaldehyde among US patients patch tested for suspected contact dermatitis are higher than in Europe. Cosmetics are an important source of contact with formaldehyde.

- **Objectives**: To acquire data on the frequency of use of formaldehyde-releasers in cosmetics sold in the United States and Europe and their use concentrations. To assess whether any observed differences may contribute to the discrepancies in sensitization rates.

- **Methods**: Enquiries with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Cosmetics Association, and the Dutch Cosmetics Association were conducted. This also included reading the labels of skin care cosmetics in a local drugstore.

- **Results**: The FDA provided data on the presence of formaldehyde and releasers. Nearly one fifth of all cosmetics contain a releaser. In 25% of 496 examined skin care products, releasers were present. In comparable FDA data categories, the percentage was 24. No data were found on use concentrations of the releasers in cosmetics in either the United States or Europe.

- **Conclusions**: The percentages of stay-on skin care products containing a formaldehyde-releaser are virtually identical in the United States (FDA data) and our local drugstore sample. However, this does not necessarily imply that cosmetics play no part in the differences in formaldehyde sensitization rates.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: Multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^116u8kr5]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

In the ALTAR trial, we have demonstrated high levels of efficacy from methenamine hippurate in terms of UTI prevention and have shown that this efficacy is comparable to the guideline-recommended prophylaxis (that is, long course, low dose antibiotic treatment). The increased rates of antimicrobial resistance development associated with the antibiotic arm, as shown in the primary uropathogen E. coli, might encourage patients and clinicians to consider methenamine hippurate as a first-line treatment for UTI prevention in women.

### Host-microbe co-metabolism via MCAD generates circulating metabolites including hippuric acid [^117JeN7P]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The human gut microbiome produces numerous drug-like small molecules that impact various aspects of human biology. These molecules are produced in the gut via metabolism of diet- and host-derived molecules such as glycans, proteins, and amino acids. Microbiota-dependent metabolites impact physiology locally in the gut, where their concentrations are the highest. However, a subset are absorbed across the intestinal wall and circulate throughout the body, where they may influence host physiology at organs distal to the gut. Despite extensive recent literature documenting the impact of microbial metabolites on the host, significant gaps exist in our knowledge about these molecules. Chief among these are the lack of clarity on how microbiota-generated metabolites intersect with host metabolism, and the identity and fate of the major products. Such insight is essential to understand how host genetics influence the spectrum of microbial metabolites within an individual and will identify novel biomarkers for microbial functions in the gut.

Gut microbial metabolites enter host circulation, where they are metabolized by enzymes involved in phase I (modification via oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis) and phase II metabolism (conjugation with glutathione, sulfate, glucuronic acid, or amino acids — typically glycine or glutamine), classically known for their roles in drug metabolism. Products of phase I and phase II metabolism of microbial metabolites include indoxyl sulfate, a host-microbe co-metabolite of tryptophan whose plasma levels rise as the kidneys fail.

### Human and preclinical studies of the host-gut microbiome co-metabolite hippurate as a marker and mediator of metabolic health [^116ZNTPB]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Human obesity is an epidemic that raises the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Gut microbiome dysbiosis is now recognized as a key feature of these disorders. The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem, harboring thousands of microbial species and strains. It is a dynamic system described as a continuum between core and rare participants, with an overall ecosystem structure alternately described in terms of gradients or enterotypes across populations. The microbiome collectively encodes up to 10 million different microbial genes. Microbial gene richness has been proposed as a marker of ecological diversity mirroring improvements in metabolic health. Many factors affect the gut microbiota, including diet, age, lifestyle, dietary supplements such as sweeteners, and drugs. Although the microbiota directly impacts various biological processes of the host through the production or degradation of a multitude of compounds, the vast majority of molecules involved in this chemical crosstalk remain elusive.

Hippurate is one of the most abundant microbial–host co-metabolites, produced by conjugation from glycine and microbial benzoate in the liver and kidney through phase 2 detoxification. Hippurate has been shown to be positively associated with microbial diversity but negatively with blood pressure, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, visceral fat mass, and Crohn's disease. This suggests the potential role of hippurate in metabolic health.

Despite recent progress, there is a critical need for an in-depth characterization of the complex nutrition–microbiome–host interactions.

### Determination of formaldehyde in formaldehyde-releaser patch test preparations [^113EiKQ5]. Contact Dermatitis (2010). Low credibility.

Positive patch test reactions to formaldehyde-releasers in patients co-reacting to formaldehyde are often attributed to formaldehyde allergy. However, the formaldehyde content of patch test materials has not been extensively studied.

- **Objectives**: To demonstrate and quantify free formaldehyde in commercial patch test materials and in prepared aqueous solutions of formaldehyde releasers.

- **Materials**: Free formaldehyde was measured by (13)C NMR spectroscopy in (i) all formaldehyde-releasers in water available from Chemotechnique and Brial, (ii) 5 releasers in petrolatum, (iii) 12 prepared aqueous solutions of formaldehyde-releasers, and (iv) water that had been in contact with petrolatum test samples.

- **Results**: In none of the five petrolatum test substances was free formaldehyde found. In all nine commercial aqueous patch test substances and 9 of the 12 prepared solutions, free formaldehyde was demonstrated with concentrations ranging from 0.019% to 0.37% (detection limit 0.01%). Contact of the petrolatum test samples with water resulted in the release of formaldehyde.

- **Conclusions**: Most aqueous solutions of formaldehyde-releasers contain free formaldehyde. Petrolatum-based patch test materials with formaldehyde-releasers do not contain free formaldehyde but probably start releasing it upon contact with water. Therefore, in future studies, determination of free and releasable formaldehyde may be preferable.

### Ex vivo anti-microbial efficacy of various formaldehyde releasers against antibiotic resistant and antibiotic sensitive microorganisms involved in infectious keratitis [^111cS116]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: The bactericidal effect of five different formaldehyde-releasing agents was studied. Key chemicals included:
	- Sodium hydroxymethylglycinate 50% (SMG) [Suttocide™, Ashland, Columbus OH, USA].
	- 2-nitro-1-propanol (NP).
	- Diazolidinyl urea (DAU) [Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, USA].
	- 1,3-bis(hydroxymethyl)-5,5-dimethyl-2,4-imidazolidinedione (DMDM).
	- 2-(hydroxymethyl)-2-nitro-1,3-propanediol (NT) [Chemistry Connection LLC, Conway AR, USA].

	- BBL™ Trypticase™ Soy Broth, BBL™ Trypticase™ Soy Agar, Difco™ Sabouraud Dextrose Broth, and Difco D/E Neutralizing Broth [Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA] were used for bacterial growth. Adult bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. (St. Louis, MO, USA). All FARs dilutions were made with balanced salt solution, BSS Plus® [Alcon Laboratory Inc. Forth Worth, TX, USA], and were prepared within 60 minutes of the experiments, except for NT and NP, which were prepared 24 hours before the experiment due to their prolonged formaldehyde release.

- **Bacteria strains**: The following microorganisms were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA): methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [ATCC 33592], Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), and Candida albicans (ATTC 11651). VRE was a clinical isolate #10988 from Columbia University Medical Center, Department of Surgery.

### Trends in formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releaser contact allergies as compared with market exposure in Thailand [^115RXFic]. Contact Dermatitis (2023). Low credibility.

Formaldehyde and formaldehyde releasers (FRs) are common preservatives in cosmetics and household products. While their contact allergy trends are decreasing in Europe and America, trend data for Asia remains limited.

- **Objectives**: The first objective was to determine the prevalences of and trends in contact allergies to formaldehyde and FRs. The second objective was to establish how often formaldehyde and FRs were mentioned on the labels of products sold in the Thai market.

- **Methods**: Twenty years of data on patch test results for formaldehyde and FRs were reviewed. Their frequency of mention on the labels of 5,855 products was analyzed.

- **Results**: The trends in contact allergy to formaldehyde and FRs were decreasing. The overall prevalence of formaldehyde contact allergy was 2.5%. The most common FR to cause contact allergy was quaternium-15. Formaldehyde and FRs were identified as ingredients in 10.2% of the products surveyed. Dimethylol dimethyl hydantoin was the most common FR, found in 5.2% of products. The highest use of formaldehyde and FRs, 15.5%, was in hair care products.

- **Conclusion**: Although contact allergy trends in Thailand were decreasing, the proportion of products with FRs remained high. Comprehensive and universal legislation is needed to control the presence of formaldehyde and FRs.

### Ten-year trends in contact allergy to formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers [^115tHPnr]. Contact Dermatitis (2018). Low credibility.

Preservatives such as formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers are common causes of contact allergy. The objective of this study was to examine trends in contact allergy to formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers in patch-tested patients in Denmark over a 10-year period (2007–2016) and to investigate relevant sources of formaldehyde among these patients.

A cross-sectional registry study on patch test data from patients tested with formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers (N = 8463) was performed. The presence of released formaldehyde in products from formaldehyde-allergic patients was identified through chemical analyses using the chromotropic acid or acetylacetone test.

The results showed that the prevalence of contact allergy to formaldehyde at 1% concentration was 1.5%, ranging between 0.97% and 2.3%, with a decreasing trend observed over this 10-year period. Contact allergy to formaldehyde at 2% concentration was found in 2.4% of patients, with no significant trend observed. Quaternium-15 was the formaldehyde-releaser most often positive (0.86%). Patients allergic to formaldehyde frequently had simultaneous positive patch test reactions to formaldehyde-releasers (36%). Almost 63% of the patients with formaldehyde allergy used products that released formaldehyde, with cosmetics being the most common sources.

In conclusion, although contact allergy to formaldehyde at 1% concentration decreased over this 10-year period, contact allergies to formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers overall remain frequent in patients. In most cases, formaldehyde-allergic patients are exposed to one or more products containing formaldehyde. There is a need for improved regulation on permitted amounts of free formaldehyde.

### Efficacy of methenamine with methylthioninium in the treatment of dysuria: A randomized clinical study [^116rsVv4]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). High credibility.

The evaluation of excellent clinical response obtained at 12 h, 36 h, 48 h, and 72 h showed that the test drug was superior in alleviating pain, burning, and burning on urination from 36 to 48 h. At 72 h, the difference between the groups was no longer statistically significant.

- **Evaluation of symptom resolution**:
	- Evaluating the time to reach the absence of symptoms according to patients' reports, 52.41% of group 1 achieved complete resolution of pain within 72 h, while 47.59% were censored, compared to 49.28% of group 2 without pain and 50.71% censored. The mean time for complete resolution of pain was 59.42 h (95% CI 56.32 h, 62.52 h) in group 1 and 64.63 h (95% CI 62.52 h, 66.74 h) in group 2, log-rank p value = 0.2858.
	- For burning, 55.17% of group 1 achieved complete resolution within 72 h, with 44.83% censored, while in group 2, 55% achieved complete resolution and 45% were censored. The mean time for complete healing of burning was 60.08 h (95% CI 57.22 h, 62.94 h) in group 1 and 64.29 h (95% CI 62.30 h, 66.27 h) in group 2, log-rank p value = 0.5232.
	- Regarding burning on urination, 57.93% of group 1 achieved complete resolution within 72 h, with 42.07% censored. In group 2, 57.14% achieved complete resolution and 42.86% were censored. The mean time for complete healing of burning on urination was 58.01 h (95% CI 54.96 h, 61.07 h) in group 1 and 63.51 h (95% CI 61.28 h, 65.75 h) for group 2, log-rank p value = 0.3235.

### Methenamine hippurate for preventing urinary tract infections [^116x9SpR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Methenamine salts are often used for the prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing UTIs.

- **Search strategy**: Published and unpublished randomized controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, contents, reference lists of review articles, and retrieved trials. The manufacturers of methenamine salts were contacted for unpublished studies, and contact was made with known investigators in the area.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and quasi-randomized trials of methenamine hippurate used for the prevention of UTIs in all population groups were eligible for inclusion. A comparison with a control (no treatment) group was a prerequisite for selection.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers (BL and TB) performed independent assessments and data extraction using a standardized format. Discrepancies, methodological, and interpretative issues were discussed with JS or JC. An exploration of heterogeneity, as well as a detailed description of results grouped by population, was conducted.

- **Main results**: Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. All trials were included in a descriptive analysis, with seven trials included in meta-analyses. Four trials (199 patients) studied symptomatic bacteriuria and six trials (341 patients) studied bacteriuria as an outcome measure. Overall, trial quality was poor. The direction of six of the pooled trials was towards a favorable treatment effect from methenamine hippurate.

### Formaldehyde and formaldehyde releasers: How much avoidance of cross-reacting agents is required [^115EXsSb]. Contact Dermatitis (2004). Low credibility.

We investigated whether individuals allergic to formaldehyde and various formaldehyde-releasing preservatives must avoid exposure to another closely related formaldehyde-releasing allergen to which they were patch test negative. We found that in over 86% of cases, a broad restriction of all formaldehyde-releasing preservatives was not required if the patch test was negative. Usually, the patch test is predictive of which materials need to be totally avoided. Restriction of exposure to all of the formaldehyde-releasing preservatives may be overly restrictive.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of methenamine hippurate in preventing UTI.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (from 1950), EMBASE (from 1980), reference lists of articles, and abstracts from conference proceedings without language restriction. Manufacturers of methenamine salts were contacted for unpublished studies, and contact was made with known investigators. The date of the last search was June 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of methenamine hippurate used for the prevention of UTIs in all population groups were eligible. A comparison with a control/no treatment group was a prerequisite for selection.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model, and the results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). An exploration of heterogeneity and a detailed description of results, grouped by population, was undertaken.

- **Main results**: Thirteen studies (2032 participants) were included. Six studies (654 patients) reported symptomatic UTI, and eight studies (796 patients) reported bacteriuria. Overall, study quality was mixed. The overall pooled estimates for the major outcomes were reported.

### Effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing urinary tract infections: an updated systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111GqZrm]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed and reported in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement guidelines.

We conducted a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane CENTRAL, along with Google Scholar for additional internet sources, from their inception until March 2024, for randomized controlled trials of methenamine hippurate versus antibiotic/placebo trials in women with recurrent urinary tract infections. A highly sensitive search strategy was employed to better identify randomized trials in the databases. The references from all included studies, as well as previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses, were manually searched for additional studies. The prospective meta-analysis protocol was registered on PROSPERO under protocol CRD42024512556.

Eligibility criteria for study selection included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing adult women (aged ≥ 18 years) with a history of recurrent or confirmed urinary tract infections. Studies were eligible if they compared the efficacy of methenamine hippurate with placebo/no treatment or any antibiotic and reported at least one of the clinical outcomes of interest. Non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs), studies without a methenamine arm or without a comparison to placebo/antibiotics, and studies involving women with catheters were excluded.

### Skincare products containing low concentrations of formaldehyde detected by the chromotropic acid method cannot be safely used in formaldehyde-allergic patients [^113HTFEh]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Formaldehyde is a well-known contact sensitizer, and formaldehyde releasers are widely used as preservatives in skincare products. It has been found that formaldehyde at concentrations allowed by the European Cosmetics Directive can cause allergic contact dermatitis. However, we still lack information on whether formaldehyde at low concentrations affects dermatitis in formaldehyde-allergic individuals.

- **Objectives**: To study the effects of low concentrations of formaldehyde on irritant contact dermatitis in formaldehyde-allergic individuals.

- **Methods**: Fifteen formaldehyde-allergic individuals and a control group of 12 individuals without contact allergy to formaldehyde and formaldehyde releasers were included in the study. The individuals performed the repeated open application test (ROAT) over 4 weeks with four different moisturizers, releasing formaldehyde in concentrations that had been determined as > 40, 20–40, 2.5–10, and 0 ppm by the chromotropic acid (CA) spot test. Dimethyloldimethylhydantoin was used as a formaldehyde releaser in the moisturizers. The ROAT was performed on areas of experimentally induced sodium lauryl sulfate dermatitis. The study was double-blind, controlled, and randomized.

- **Results**: Nine of the 15 formaldehyde-allergic individuals experienced reappearance or worsening of dermatitis on the areas that were treated with moisturizers containing formaldehyde. No such reactions were observed in the control group (P < 0.001) or for the moisturizers without formaldehyde in the formaldehyde-allergic individuals (P < 0.001).

### Formaldehyde in cosmetics in patch tested dermatitis patients with and without contact allergy to formaldehyde [^113vFk7C]. Contact Dermatitis (2016). Low credibility.

Formaldehyde is a well-known contact sensitizer, and formaldehyde releasers are widely used preservatives in cosmetics. The objective of this study was to survey the release of formaldehyde in cosmetics brought by patients investigated due to suspected allergic contact dermatitis. It also aimed to compare this with information provided by manufacturers on packaging and to investigate whether formaldehyde-allergic patients are potentially exposed to more cosmetics releasing formaldehyde compared to dermatitis patients without a contact allergy to formaldehyde.

Cosmetics from 10 formaldehyde-allergic and 30 non-allergic patients (controls), matched for age and sex, were investigated using the chromotropic acid spot test. This is a semiquantitative method for measuring the release of formaldehyde.

- **Results**:
	- Formaldehyde was found in 58 of 245 (23.7%) products.
	- Twenty-six of 126 (20.6%) leave-on products released formaldehyde, and 17 of 26 (65.4%) of these were not declared to contain formaldehyde or formaldehyde releasers.
	- Among rinse-off products, 32 of 119 (26.8%) were formaldehyde-releasing, and nine of 32 (28.0%) were not labeled as containing formaldehyde or formaldehyde releasers.
	- Notably, five of 10 formaldehyde-allergic patients brought leave-on products with ≥ 40 ppm formaldehyde, compared with 4 of 30 in the control group (p = 0.029).

- **Conclusions**:
	- Cosmetic products used by formaldehyde-allergic patients that are not declared to contain formaldehyde or formaldehyde-releasing preservatives should be carefully analyzed.

### Patterns of positive patch test reactions to formaldehyde and formaldehyde releasers at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health from 2007 to 2020 [^113xpHK9]. Contact Dermatitis (2021). Low credibility.

Formaldehyde is an important contact sensitizer. Formaldehyde-releasing substances induce positive reactions in formaldehyde-allergic patients, but there are also reactions independent of formaldehyde allergy. In an earlier study, stronger formaldehyde reactions led to more positive reactions to quaternium-15.

- **Objectives**: To analyze patterns of positive patch test reactions to formaldehyde and different formaldehyde releasers.

- **Methods**: Patch test files of 1,497 patients investigated during the period November 2007 to August 2020 were retrospectively reviewed for positive reactions to formaldehyde and its releasers. During the study period, almost all (≥ 99.3%) patients were tested with a formaldehyde dilution series and six formaldehyde releasers.

- **Results**: Ninety-three patients tested positive for formaldehyde; 80% of these had positive reactions to at least one formaldehyde releaser, most often benzylhemiformal. There were only nine independent contact allergies to formaldehyde releasers. There were only two reactions to 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol, and they occurred in formaldehyde-negative patients. In patients with extreme (+++) reactions to formaldehyde, concomitant positive reactions to any of the other 11 investigated formaldehyde releasers were more common than in patients with milder formaldehyde reactions.

- **Conclusions**: Strong formaldehyde reactions were associated with positive reactions to formaldehyde releasers.

### Methenamine mandelate [^113mMVLj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **General precautions**: Dysuria may occur, usually at higher than recommended dosages, which can be controlled by reducing the dosage and acidification. When urine acidification is contraindicated or unattainable, as with some urea-splitting bacteria, the drug is not recommended.

- **Drug interactions**: Formaldehyde and sulfamethizole form an insoluble precipitate in acid urine; therefore, methenamine mandelate, USP, should not be administered concurrently with sulfamethizole.

- **Drug and laboratory test interactions**: Formaldehyde interferes with fluorometric procedures for the determination of urinary catecholamines and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), causing erroneously high results. It also causes falsely decreased urine estriol levels by reacting with estriol when acid hydrolysis techniques are used; however, estriol determinations using enzymatic hydrolysis are unaffected by formaldehyde. Additionally, formaldehyde causes falsely elevated 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels when the Porter-Silber method is used and falsely decreased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) levels by inhibiting color development when nitrosonaphthol methods are used.

- **Pregnancy**: Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with methenamine mandelate, USP. It is also not known whether methenamine mandelate, USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Methenamine mandelate, USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Since introduction, published reports on the use of methenamine mandelate in pregnancy remain limited.

### Formaldehyde-releasers: Relationship to formaldehyde contact allergy. Contact allergy to formaldehyde and inventory of formaldehyde-releasers [^116jgYeq]. Contact Dermatitis (2009). Low credibility.

This article is one in a series of review articles on formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers, including discussions on formaldehyde in cosmetics, clothes, and metalworking fluids and miscellaneous uses. Thirty-five chemicals have been identified as formaldehyde-releasers. Although an additional seven are mentioned in the literature, the data is inadequate to conclusively consider them as such. Several nomenclature mistakes and outdated information are discussed.

- **Applications and exposure scenarios**: Formaldehyde and formaldehyde allergy are reviewed in terms of applications, exposure scenarios, legislation, and patch testing problems.
- **Frequency and relevance**: The frequency of sensitization, relevance of positive patch test reactions, and clinical patterns of allergic contact dermatitis from formaldehyde are analyzed. Prognosis, thresholds for elicitation, analytical tests for determining formaldehyde in products, and the frequency of exposure to formaldehyde and its releasers are also examined.

The frequency of contact allergy to formaldehyde is consistently higher in the United States (8–9%) compared to Europe (2–3%). Patch testing with formaldehyde presents challenges; the currently used 1% solution may cause both false-positive and false-negative reactions (up to 40%). Determining the relevance of patch test reactions is often challenging. The safe concentration of formaldehyde for sensitive patients remains unknown. Levels of 200–300 p.p.m. free formaldehyde in cosmetic products have been shown to induce dermatitis from short-term use on normal skin.

### Formaldehyde-releasers: Relationship to formaldehyde contact allergy. Metalworking fluids and remainder. Part 1 [^116wNx4P]. Contact Dermatitis (2010). Low credibility.

This article is part of a series of reviews on formaldehyde-releasers and their relationship to formaldehyde contact allergy. In this part, formaldehyde-releasers used in metalworking fluids (MWF) and a group of releasers not covered in previous articles are discussed.

- **Overview**: The composition and functions of MWF, the role of biocides in them, and adverse reactions to MWF are examined.
- **Releasers in MWF**: Releasers that have caused contact allergy are presented with details such as CAS numbers, synonyms, molecular formulas, chemical structures, applications, results of patch test studies, and the amount of formaldehyde released by them.

In Part 2 of the article, the focus is on the relationship between formaldehyde-releasers used in MWF and formaldehyde contact allergy, as well as data on various releasers not previously mentioned, followed by a discussion of Parts 1 and 2 of the article.

### Patch testing with formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers: Multicentre study in Spain (2005–2009) [^112VwdDE]. Contact Dermatitis (2011). Low credibility.

Formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers are common causes of allergic contact dermatitis.

- **Objectives**: To determine the frequency of sensitization to formaldehyde and seven formaldehyde-releasers, and to establish and characterize groups of patients according to the results of patch testing.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a 5-year retrospective study in six Spanish hospitals, focusing on patients with positive patch test reactions to formaldehyde or any of seven formaldehyde-releasers.

- **Results**: The most frequent allergens identified were formaldehyde (1.72%), imidazolidinyl urea (1.05%), quaternium-15 (0.88%), and diazolidinyl urea (0.79%). Patients with sensitization to only formaldehyde exhibited a higher frequency of occupational dermatitis (25%) compared to those sensitized solely to formaldehyde-releasers (9.5%). The most common sites of dermatitis included the hands (31.7%) for patients with sensitization to only formaldehyde, and the face and legs (31.3% and 24.6%, respectively) for those with sensitization to only formaldehyde-releasers. Additionally, we identified a subgroup of 25 patients sensitized to both imidazolidinyl urea and diazolidinyl urea, of whom only 6 (24%) were also sensitized to formaldehyde.

- **Conclusions**: Including imidazolidinyl urea and diazolidinyl urea in the baseline series of the Spanish Contact Dermatitis and Skin Allergy Research Group (GEIDAC) should facilitate better classification and management of patients allergic to formaldehyde.

### Formaldehyde-releasers in cosmetics: Relationship to formaldehyde contact allergy. Part 2. Patch test relationship to formaldehyde contact allergy, experimental provocation tests, amount of formaldehyde released, and assessment of risk to consumers allergic to formaldehyde [^114PcebH]. Contact Dermatitis (2010). Low credibility.

This is the second part of an article on formaldehyde-releasers in cosmetics. The patch test relationship between the releasers in cosmetics and formaldehyde contact allergy is reviewed, assessing whether products preserved with formaldehyde-releasers may contain enough free formaldehyde to pose a threat to individuals with contact allergy to formaldehyde. There is a clear relationship between positive patch test reactions to formaldehyde-releasers and formaldehyde contact allergy: 15% of all reactions to 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol and 40–60% of the reactions to the other releasers are caused by a reaction to the formaldehyde in the test material.

There is only fragmented data on the amount of free formaldehyde in cosmetics preserved with formaldehyde donors. However, all releasers (with the exception of 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol, for which adequate data are lacking) can, under the right circumstances of concentration and product composition, release more than 200 p.p.m. formaldehyde, which may result in allergic contact dermatitis. Whether this is actually the case in any particular product cannot be determined from the ingredient labeling. Therefore, we recommend advising patients allergic to formaldehyde to avoid leave-on cosmetics preserved with quaternium-15, diazolidinyl urea, DMDM hydantoin, or imidazolidinyl urea, acknowledging that many would tolerate some products.

### Formaldehyde 2% is not a useful means of detecting allergy to formaldehyde releasers- results of the ESSCA network, 2015–2018 [^112bregf]. Contact Dermatitis (2021). Low credibility.

Studies suggest that patch testing with formaldehyde releasers (FRs) provides significant additional information beyond formaldehyde 1% aqueous solution and should be considered for inclusion in the European baseline series (EBS). However, it is unclear if this applies to formaldehyde 2% aqueous solution.

- **Objectives**: To determine the frequency of sensitization to formaldehyde 2% aqueous solution and co-reactivity with FRs, and to establish whether there is justification for including FRs in the EBS.

- **Materials and methods**: A four-year, multi-center retrospective analysis was conducted on patients with positive patch test reactions to formaldehyde 2% aqueous solution and five FRs.

- **Results**: A maximum of 15,067 patients were tested for reactions to formaldehyde 2% aqueous solution and at least one FR. The percentage of isolated reactions to FRs without co-reactivity to formaldehyde 2% aqueous solution for each FR was as follows: 46.8% for quaternium-15 1% petroleum; 67.4% for imidazolidinyl urea 2% petroleum; 64% for diazolidinyl urea 2% petroleum; 83.3% for 1,3-dimethylol-5,5-dimethyl hydantoin (DMDM) hydantoin 2% petroleum; and 96.3% for 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol 0.5% petroleum. These results demonstrate that co-reactivity varies between FRs and formaldehyde, ranging from virtually non-existent in 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol 0.5% petroleum (Cohen's kappa: 0, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.02 to 0.02), to only weak concordance for quaternium-15 (Cohen's kappa: 0.22, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.28), where a Cohen's kappa value of 1 would indicate full concordance.

- **Conclusions**: Formaldehyde 2% aqueous solution is an inadequate screen for contact allergy to the formaldehyde releasers, which should be considered for inclusion in any series dependent on the frequency of sensitization.

### Occupational contact allergy to formaldehyde and formaldehyde releasers [^1158p5Mk]. Contact Dermatitis (2008). Low credibility.

Formaldehyde allergy is common and usually derives from formaldehyde-releasing biocides in cosmetic and other products.

- **Objectives**: To analyze patterns of patch test reactions to formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing compounds and the sources of sensitization.

- **Patients/methods**: At the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, we screened the patch test files for allergic reactions to formaldehyde and 12 formaldehyde-releasing compounds. All patients with contact allergy to any of the substances were included, and their records were reviewed.

- **Results**: Between January 2001 and May 2007, we had patch tested 81 patients with formaldehyde allergy and 18 with independent allergy to some formaldehyde releaser. Of the formaldehyde allergies, 60 were new sensitizations, 25 of which were considered to be occupational. The most common source of occupational sensitization was metalworking fluids followed by creams and related products. Exposure to formaldehyde-releasing preservatives in liquid soaps and other rinse-off products was common in both occupational and non-occupational cases. Reactions to formaldehyde-releasing compounds were seen in 79% of the formaldehyde-allergic patients.

- **Conclusions**: Occupational formaldehyde allergy was common and occurred in metalworkers, hairdressers, masseurs, and workers using protective creams, detergents, and liquid soaps. When compared with studies on general dermatological patients, contact allergy to formaldehyde releasers without formaldehyde allergy was rare.

### Formaldehyde-releasers in cosmetics: Relationship to formaldehyde contact allergy. Part 1. Characterization, frequency and relevance of sensitization, and frequency of use in cosmetics [^111F9WkZ]. Contact Dermatitis (2010). Low credibility.

In this part of a series of review articles on formaldehyde-releasers and their relationship to formaldehyde contact allergy, formaldehyde-releasers in cosmetics are discussed. In this first part of the article, key data are presented, including the frequency of sensitization and their use in cosmetics. In Europe, low frequencies of sensitization have been observed for all releasers: 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol 0.4–1.2%, diazolidinyl urea 0.5–1.4%, imidazolidinyl urea 0.3–1.4%, and quaternium-15 0.6–1.9% (for DMDM hydantoin, no recent data are available). All releasers score (far) higher prevalences in the United States; the possible explanations for this are discussed. The relevance of positive patch test reactions has been insufficiently investigated. In the United States, approximately 20% of cosmetics and personal care products (stay-on products: 17%, rinse-off products 27%) contain a formaldehyde-releaser. The use of quaternium-15 is decreasing. For Europe, there are no comparable recent data available. In the second part of the article, the patch test relationship of the releasers in cosmetics to formaldehyde contact allergy will be reviewed, and it will be assessed whether products preserved with formaldehyde-releasers may contain enough free formaldehyde to pose a threat to individuals who have contact allergy to formaldehyde.

### Formaldehyde-releasers: Relationship to formaldehyde contact allergy. Part 2: Metalworking fluids and remainder [^111tAhbQ]. Contact Dermatitis (2010). Low credibility.

We have reviewed formaldehyde-releasers used in metalworking fluids (MWFs) in this and a previous part of a two-part article. These biocides do not appear to be frequent or important sensitizers. Even in highly selected patient groups of metalworkers, mean prevalence rates of sensitivity are low: 0.2% for tris(hydroxymethyl)nitromethane, 1.6% for tris(N-hydroxyethyl)hexahydrotriazine, 1.9% for Bioban P-1487 and Bioban CS-1246, and 2.8% for Bioban CS-1135. In the case of the Biobans, many reactions may have been irritant.

Only N, N'-methylenebis(5-methyloxazolidine) has a fairly high mean score of 4.0% in metalworkers. With the exception of Bioban P-1487, there is a clear relationship between positive patch test reactions to the releasers and formaldehyde sensitivity: 40–70% of reactions to releasers occur in patients sensitive to formaldehyde and may therefore be caused by formaldehyde allergy.

There is a lack of reliable data on the clinical relevance of contact allergy to the formaldehyde releasers in MWF. In most studies, no data on relevance were provided and, in those that did, relevance was often found for a very small minority of the reactions. Also discussed here are the formaldehyde-releasers MDM hydantoin, methenamine, N-methylolchloracetamide, paraformaldehyde, and Preventol D2.

### Occupational allergic contact dermatitis to formaldehyde released by work clothes [^115asB6t]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Low credibility.

Formaldehyde (FA) is one of the oldest and still widely used preservatives. It is a common allergen and has been included in the standard series since the 1930s. FA is commonly found in consumer products such as cosmetics, household detergents, pharmaceuticals, industrial products, and in occupational exposures such as protective gloves. FA can also be released from clothing.

### Efficacy of methenamine with methylthioninium in the treatment of dysuria: A randomized clinical study [^117Kvxvw]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). High credibility.

Dysuria is a symptomatic manifestation of several urological and gynecological diseases, characterized by a sensation of pain, burning, or stinging during urination. Approximately 3% of adults over 40 experience dysuria, causing distress, although the prevalence may be higher depending on the underlying condition. The most frequent cause of acute dysuria is urinary tract infections (UTIs), affecting about 12% of adult women each year, especially those under 30. UTIs account for nearly 40% of cases in emergency departments (ED) in Brazil and lead to more than 1 million ED visits per year in the United States. Nonetheless, any inflammation or irritation of the urethra or bladder, including urethritis, sexually transmitted diseases, stones, tumors, food, medications, and menopause, can induce dysuria.

Management of dysuria depends on the underlying cause; however, relief of discomfort may require additional symptomatic treatment. Phenazopyridine, formerly known as an antiseptic, is an analgesic widely used for urinary tract symptoms. Nevertheless, limited evidence regarding its efficacy and concerns about its safety generate a demand for alternative treatment options. Methenamine hippurate and methylthioninium chloride possess antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties and have been used in the prophylaxis of UTIs with a low risk of developing drug resistance. However, to our knowledge, a comparison with phenazopyridine and an evaluation of dysuria not limited to UTIs had not been conducted prior to this study.

In this study, we hypothesized that the combination of methenamine 250 mg and methylthioninium chloride 20 mg is superior to phenazopyridine in…

### Hiprex [^115gsEMv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

**Dosage and administration**: 1 tablet (1.0 g) twice daily (morning and night) for adults and pediatric patients over 12 years of age. For pediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years, administer 1/2 to 1 tablet (0.5 to 1.0 g) twice daily (morning and night). The antibacterial activity of Hiprex is greater in acid urine, so restriction of alkalinizing foods and medications is desirable. If necessary, as indicated by urinary pH and clinical response, supplemental acidification of the urine should be instituted. The efficacy of therapy should be monitored by repeated urine cultures.

### Preservatives in cosmetics: Reactivity of allergenic formaldehyde-releasers towards amino acids through breakdown products other than formaldehyde [^114iHCM7]. Contact Dermatitis (2010). Low credibility.

Compounds slowly releasing formaldehyde, known as formaldehyde-releasers, are commonly employed as preservatives in cosmetics instead of free formaldehyde, which is a strong skin sensitizer. It has long been accepted that sensitization to formaldehyde-releasers is attributable to released formaldehyde. However, clinical studies show the existence of patients allergic to formaldehyde-releasers but not to formaldehyde itself.

- **Objectives**: To prove that, for certain formaldehyde-releasers, reactive intermediates other than formaldehyde could be involved in the formation of the hapten-protein antigenic complex, a key step of the sensitization process, thus explaining their sensitizing potential.

- **Materials/methods**: DMDM hydantoin, 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol, and methenamine were synthesized, (13) C-labelled at the position(s) precursor of formaldehyde. Their reactivity towards amino acids was followed by one-dimensional and two-dimensional (13) C-nuclear magnetic resonance.

- **Results**: Many adducts formed by reacting formaldehyde-releasers with amino acids resulted from a direct interaction of the releaser or from the reaction of a breakdown product, not merely from a reaction involving released formaldehyde. DMDM hydantoin was reactive per se, while 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol and methenamine decomposed in water, producing bromoethanol and diaminomethane, respectively, which were reactive towards some of the amino acids tested.

- **Conclusion**: The reactivity of distinctive formaldehyde-releasers towards amino acids is not limited to formaldehyde release.

### Job-related formaldehyde exposure and ALS mortality in the United States [^111kksQ4]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Animal models and in vitro experiments suggest neurotoxic effects of formaldehyde that may be relevant for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Formaldehyde induces neuronal τ protein misfolding and aggregation, leading to neuronal apoptosis. It also increases mitochondrial membrane permeability and causes oxidative damage partly by reducing superoxide dismutase activity, mechanisms implicated in ALS.

Studies have had mixed findings regarding formaldehyde exposure and ALS mortality. A large prospective study found an elevated risk that did not quite reach statistical significance, but it found a strong dose–response relationship with total years of exposure. Two studies found no significant association, although one suggested an elevated risk among the very highly exposed. We examine here the association of ALS mortality with job-related formaldehyde exposure in the National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS), a US-representative cohort with occupation data collected prospectively.

### The resurgence of methenamine hippurate in the prevention of recurrent UTIs in women- a systematic review [^114rYxfR]. Current Opinion in Urology (2023). High credibility.

The prevalence and management difficulty of recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women necessitates the re-evaluation of nonantimicrobial agents due to rising antimicrobial resistance. This review aimed to assess randomized controlled trials (RCTs) utilizing methenamine hippurate as a treatment or preventative measure for rUTIs in adult women.

Relevant databases were searched for RCTs following Cochrane methodology and adhering to the PRISMA checklist. The trials compared the efficacy of methenamine hippurate with an antibiotic or placebo for rUTI prophylaxis in women. Six trials were examined, involving 322 patients taking methenamine and 419 receiving antibiotics. The trials spanned from 12 to 24 months. Findings indicated that methenamine was effective in extending the mean interval between symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) episodes, maintaining symptom- and infection-free status, and decreasing UTI episode frequency. Recent studies demonstrated that methenamine reduced the incidence of rUTIs and was not inferior to antibiotics in this respect.

In conclusion, methenamine hippurate's outcomes aligned with those of antibiotic prophylaxis, suggesting its potential as a viable nonantibiotic alternative for women with rUTIs.

### Microbial phenotypic heterogeneity in response to a metabolic toxin: Continuous, dynamically shifting distribution of formaldehyde tolerance in Methylobacterium extorquens populations [^114tfo9V]. PLOS Genetics (2019). Low credibility.

Tolerant subpopulation behavior is observable at the single-cell level. As a final step in confirming single-cell phenotypic heterogeneity in formaldehyde tolerance, we observed the growth of single cells directly using high-resolution time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy of cultures embedded in agar pads. This method allowed us to observe the division times and potential morphological aberrations of individual cells and their progeny in microcolonies over the first 9 hours of growth.

Because the cells tolerant to 4 mM formaldehyde are only present at a frequency of approximately 10⁻⁴ in the initial population, we conducted formaldehyde exposure at a lower concentration, 2.5 mM formaldehyde, at which plating experiments (see below) suggested that ~1–4% of cells would be able to grow. Indeed, we found that 11 out of 546 cells (1.97%) were able to grow at that formaldehyde concentration, compared to 100% of the 256 cells observed in the no-formaldehyde condition (Fig 6).

In addition, all of the cells that grew in the presence of formaldehyde did so normally: we found no significant effect of formaldehyde on cell division time (median doubling time at 0 mM: 2.58 hours; at 2.5 mM: 2.58 hours; p = 0.262 by Mann-Whitney U-test). We did observe that cells in formaldehyde took slightly longer to complete the first division (median lag time was 1.25 hours later in formaldehyde; p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U); this may indicate minor cell damage or a modest inhibitory effect of formaldehyde in the medium, or it may have resulted from slight differences in the preparation of the cells.

### Microbial phenotypic heterogeneity in response to a metabolic toxin: Continuous, dynamically shifting distribution of formaldehyde tolerance in Methylobacterium extorquens populations [^115ipLY9]. PLoS Genetics (2019). Low credibility.

Given our evidence against genetic mutants, a fourth hypothesis was that the observed growth was due to a small subpopulation of cells that were phenotypically (but not genetically) highly tolerant to formaldehyde. Stress-tolerant individuals may arise in microbial populations stochastically, or they may do so in response to an environmental signal.

To investigate whether the hypothesized formaldehyde-tolerant cells were present in the original population or were induced during the course of formaldehyde exposure, we monitored the abundance of formaldehyde-tolerant colony-forming units (CFUs) over time. Specifically, we repeated the 4 mM formaldehyde exposure experiment and plated the cells harvested at each timepoint on selective agar culture medium (4 mM formaldehyde, allowing the growth of only tolerant cells) and permissive medium (without formaldehyde, to enumerate all cells).

We found that at the beginning of the experiment, the M. extorquens population already contained a detectable subpopulation of cells that were able to form colonies in the presence of 4 mM formaldehyde. This subpopulation comprised only a small portion of the total number of cells (a frequency of ~10⁻⁴ in the total population of ~2×10⁶ cells) (Fig 2, orange diamond symbols and lines). While the total abundance of cells decreased at an exponential rate between 0 and 20 hours, the formaldehyde-tolerant subpopulation increased at a constant rate for nearly the entire course of the experiment.

### Methenamine hippurate compared with trimethoprim for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections: A randomized clinical trial [^112wdkz3]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). High credibility.

The objective was to find an alternative treatment to a low-dose antibiotic for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) and to evaluate the difference in rates of reinfection within one year when treated with methenamine hippurate for prophylaxis compared with trimethoprim.

- **Methods**: We present a non-blinded randomized trial comparing methenamine hippurate with trimethoprim for the prevention of recurrent UTI at 12 months after starting treatment. Women over 18 who had at least two culture-positive UTI in the prior six months or three in the prior year were included. Ninety-two patients met enrollment criteria and were randomized to receive daily prophylaxis with methenamine hippurate or trimethoprim for a minimum of six months. Both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, if patients received the alternative drug after randomization, were analyzed using Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test, and a logistic and multivariate regression model. The primary outcome of this study was culture-proven UTI recurrence by 12 months after initiating prophylaxis.

- **Results**: In the intent-to-treat analysis, we found no difference between groups in recurrent UTI, with a 65% (28 out of 43) recurrence in the trimethoprim group versus 65% (28 out of 43) in the methenamine hippurate group (p = 1.00). In the per-protocol analysis, 65% (26 out of 40) versus 65% (30 out of 46) of patients had UTI recurrences in the trimethoprim group versus the methenamine hippurate group (p = 0.98).

- **Conclusions**: Methenamine hippurate may serve as an alternative for preventing recurrent UTI, with similar efficacy to trimethoprim.

### Effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing urinary tract infections: an updated systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117JSgfm]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common global health issue, particularly affecting women, with approximately 7 million women seeking outpatient care annually for uncomplicated UTIs. These infections, caused by bacterial invasion of the urinary tract, include conditions such as cystitis and pyelonephritis. Due to anatomical factors, women are more susceptible to UTIs, and recurrence is a significant concern, with up to 27% of women experiencing a repeat infection within six months. This recurrence contributes to both clinical and economic burdens.

Antibiotics, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin, are commonly prescribed for acute UTI treatment but come with side effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances and allergic reactions. More critically, widespread antibiotic use is fueling the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which complicates treatment. Long-term antibiotic use in treating UTIs leads to high overall resistance to commonly used antibiotics, such as ampicillin (39.6%), trimethoprim (23.8%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (22.4%). Despite this, the approach to managing UTIs predominantly involves antibiotics; however, there are ongoing concerns about overuse, antibiotic resistance, and potential aftereffects.

Guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and the European Association of Urology (EAU) focus on optimizing UTI management. Challenges remain in antibiotic selection, treatment duration, and the management of reinfections. Recent studies, including a meta-analysis by.

### Use of methenamine for urinary tract infection prophylaxis: Systematic review of recent evidence [^111uX36B]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). High credibility.

Antibiotic resistance is an unavoidable consequence of antibiotic use, and growing rates of resistance are an urgent issue. Methenamine is a non-antibiotic alternative used for urinary tract infection (UTI) prophylaxis. The objective of this review is to evaluate recently published literature regarding the efficacy and safety of methenamine for UTI prophylaxis.

- **Methods**: PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL databases were queried in March 2023 using the following search terms: urinary tract infection, cystitis, bacteriuria, or dysuria, and methenamine. Studies prior to 2012 were excluded from this review to focus on the appraisal of the most recent evidence. Prospective and controlled retrospective trials were included for review.

- **Results**: A total of seven studies (three prospective and four retrospective) met the inclusion criteria for review. Two of the three prospective studies demonstrated no or non-inferior differences in clinical efficacy to prevent recurrent UTIs between methenamine and antibiotic prophylaxis, and the third showed decreased rates of UTI with methenamine use in patients with short-term indwelling catheters compared with cranberry alone. The retrospective studies consistently supported the efficacy and safety of methenamine for UTI prophylaxis in a variety of populations and clinical settings. Adverse effects reported with methenamine were similar to comparators and included nausea, abdominal pain, and headache.

- **Conclusions**: The use of methenamine for UTI prophylaxis was shown to be effective in a variety of settings without an increased risk.
