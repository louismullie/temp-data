## Question

In which type of bacteremias is indicated to order TTE

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking in which types of bacteremias it is indicated to order transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility guideline anchors to establish a universal baseline. Then, I should verify organism-specific indications, especially Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcal species. Next, I will examine device-related and prosthetic valve contexts. After that, I need to consider special scenarios like spondylodiscitis or septic arthritis. Finally, I should review exceptions where TTE may be deferred and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with timing and escalation rules.

> Let me first confirm the universal baseline. Major guidelines consistently recommend TTE as first-line imaging in suspected infective endocarditis (IE), typically triggered by positive blood cultures or a new murmur, with escalation to TEE if TTE is nondiagnostic or suspicion remains high, so TTE is broadly indicated in bacteremias when IE is on the differential [^116XsTUj] [^116TKFuc] [^112aBst3].

> Now, I should verify organism-specific indications. The 2023 ESC endocarditis guideline explicitly advises obtaining echocardiography in Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and some Streptococcus species bacteremias because these organisms carry a meaningful risk of IE even when clinical stigmata are absent, so TTE is indicated in these bacteremias to screen for endocarditis [^113s2xZF].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for S. aureus. Multiple high-quality sources support echocardiography in S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) given the ~30% prevalence of IE and the frequency of occult cases. ACC/AHA guidance also highlights TEE consideration in SAB without a known source, reinforcing that TTE is at minimum indicated and often insufficient alone in higher-risk SAB presentations [^114bUiGY] [^112JsJjC] [^11481Hjh].

> Hold on, I should confirm device-related contexts. In prosthetic valves, intracardiac devices, or cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) infections, TTE is still first-line, but TEE is frequently required due to poor sensitivity of TTE for perivalvular abscesses and lead vegetations; thus, TTE is indicated, but I need to ensure a low threshold to add TEE in these settings [^111bueur] [^113CHqZv] [^111GNUNY].

> I need to check special anatomic scenarios. In spondylodiscitis or septic arthritis with positive blood cultures for typical IE pathogens, ESC 2023 recommends TTE and/or TEE to exclude IE because hematogenous spread to valves can occur even when cardiac symptoms are subtle, so TTE is indicated in these bacteremias as part of the workup [^112APjzX] [^112Kqw1s] [^114kuT3a].

> But wait, what if the bacteremia is low risk and the patient is clinically stable? Let me consider exceptions. Emerging data suggest that in carefully selected low-risk SAB patients — no prosthetic material, nosocomial acquisition, no persistent bacteremia, no metastatic signs, and early source control — routine TTE may be safely omitted without excess relapse, though this remains controversial and not universally adopted; I should emphasize that current guidelines still recommend TTE in essentially all SAB while acknowledging evolving risk-stratification tools like VIRSTA and POSITIVE/PREDICT scores [^115Xb2dH] [^113Fyd4e] [^11481Hjh].

> Next, I should review timing and escalation. TTE should be obtained early in the course of bacteremia, ideally within days of diagnosis, and if TTE is negative or nondiagnostic but clinical suspicion persists, TEE should follow; repeat TTE or TEE is reasonable if clinical status changes or if initial studies are equivocal, aligning with ESC and AHA guidance on dynamic reassessment [^116XsTUj] [^116UivVi] [^111S5Pqu].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer. TTE is indicated in bacteremias caused by organisms with a nontrivial risk of IE, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcal species, as well as in bacteremias associated with prosthetic valves, intracardiac devices, spondylodiscitis, or septic arthritis with typical IE pathogens. TTE is also indicated when IE is suspected from positive blood cultures or a new murmur regardless of organism, with escalation to TEE when TTE is nondiagnostic or suspicion remains high [^113s2xZF] [^116XsTUj] [^116TKFuc].

> I should double-check that I am not overgeneralizing. For low-virulence organisms with a clearly identified nonendovascular source and no risk factors, the pretest probability of IE may be low enough that TTE adds little and may be deferred in select cases, but this is exception territory and should be individualized; in most bacteremias without a definitive noncardiac source, TTE remains appropriate to exclude occult endocarditis and establish baseline cardiac morphology [^112ShAkW] [^116XsTUj].

---

TTE is indicated in bacteremias with **moderate-to-high risk of infective endocarditis** [^116XsTUj], particularly Staphylococcus aureus [^114bUiGY], Enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcal species [^113s2xZF], as well as in bacteremias with **prosthetic valves, intracardiac devices, or persistent bacteremia** [^111bueur] [^116UivVi]. TTE is also recommended when there is a new murmur, embolic events, or persistent fever without a clear source [^116TKFuc] [^112pQRzy]. For low-risk bacteremias (e.g. uncomplicated coagulase-negative staphylococci or clearly nonendovascular sources), routine TTE is not required [^112ShAkW] [^11295vKa]. If TTE is negative but suspicion remains high, TEE should be performed [^116UivVi] [^111S5Pqu].

## Indications for TTE in bacteremia

### High-risk bacteremias

- **Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB)**: TTE is indicated in all cases due to the high incidence of IE (approximately 20–30%) [^114bUiGY] and frequent absence of clinical signs [^111Q9ZCo].

- **Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia**: TTE is recommended due to the significant risk of IE [^113s2xZF].

- **Streptococcal bacteremia**: Particularly viridans streptococci and Streptococcus gallolyticus, given their association with IE [^113s2xZF].

---

### Moderate-risk bacteremias

Moderate-risk bacteremias include **prosthetic valve or intracardiac device-related bacteremias**, for which TTE is indicated to evaluate for IE and complications [^111bueur] [^113CHqZv]. TTE is also indicated for **persistent bacteremia** — when bacteremia persists beyond 48–72 hours without a clear source — to exclude IE [^116XsTUj].

---

### Clinical scenarios warranting TTE

- **New murmur or embolic events**: TTE is indicated when a new murmur, embolic events, or persistent fever occur without a clear source [^116TKFuc] [^112a7pwd].

- **Suspected infective endocarditis (IE)**: TTE is the first-line imaging modality in suspected IE [^116XsTUj] [^112aBst3].

---

## Situations where TTE may not be indicated

Routine TTE is generally not indicated for **low-risk bacteremias**, such as uncomplicated coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia with a clear nonendovascular source [^112ShAkW] [^11295vKa]. It is also not indicated for **transient bacteremia** with nonpathogenic organisms or documented nonintravascular sources [^112ShAkW] [^11295vKa].

---

## Role of TEE when TTE is inconclusive

If TTE is negative or inconclusive but clinical suspicion for IE remains high, **TEE should be performed** [^116UivVi] [^111S5Pqu]. TEE has higher sensitivity for detecting small vegetations, abscesses, and prosthetic valve infections [^112cWWrv] [^111amoCr].

### A scenario-based survey of expert echocardiography recommendations for patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia at varying risk for endocarditis [^114j5fRd]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Respondents were advised to consider the following conditions as applying to each scenario: TTE and TEE were equally accessible; no specific contraindication to TEE was present; there were no clinical features of an intracardiac complication of endocarditis (eg, heart failure or atrioventricular conduction disturbance); and no new complications of SAB arose unless stated.

For each scenario, respondents were asked to select their preferred echocardiography strategy from 6 options, as if they had been asked to provide a recommendation on day 3 to 5 after the onset of bacteremia. The 6 echocardiography strategies were TEE as the only study; both TTE and TEE; TTE first, followed by TEE only if the TTE result is negative for endocarditis; TTE first, followed by TEE only if the TTE result is positive for endocarditis; TTE as the only study; and no echocardiography. The first 3 strategies all have a negative likelihood ratio for native valve endocarditis of less than 0.10 (eTable 1, eTable 2, and eMethods in the Supplement) and are subsequently referred to as highly exclusionary echocardiography strategies. No information regarding the diagnostic performance of any echocardiography strategy was provided to respondents.

Respondents were also asked to provide nonidentifying demographic details including country of clinical practice, medical specialty, years of postfellowship experience, and annual SAB caseload. We also sought each respondent's assessments of the risk and consequence of relapse after inadvertent treatment of clinically occult S aureus native valve infective endocarditis with short-course antibiotic therapy.

The survey was initially piloted among a small group of local and international contacts who provided feedback on the number and framing of survey questions and the appropriateness of the presented echocardiography strategy descriptions. Once finalized, the survey was distributed via the email lists of various national specialty societies and via direct email contacts between September 2018 and March 2019. The survey was made available to respondents in 3 languages (English, French, and Spanish). Overall response rates or predictors were not calculable, but list-specific response rates were estimated for lists with known distribution numbers.

Detection of metastatic infectious foci

Echocardiography

Using a risk stratification for diagnostic investigations is only helpful if there are diagnostic modalities that can reliably detect metastatic infections. For either diagnosing or excluding endocarditis in SAB, standard clinical practice is to perform echocardiography in patients with SAB, as a significant portion of patients with SAB have endocarditis in absence of clinical signs. Scoring systems have been developed to determine the necessity of (transesophageal) echocardiography. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) should be performed with low threshold in patients with negative TTE but persistent suspicion of endocarditis and in patients with prosthetic heart valves and/or cardiac implantable electronic devices. On the other hand, the combined absence of certain risk factors and prognostically unfavorable features of bacteremia can probably obviate the need of TEE. Future research should focus on how clinical prediction scores can be improved to reduce the number of patients classified as high risk for endocarditis – and thus requiring TEE – while maintaining acceptable negative predictive value. It must be said, however, that such trials will be difficult to conduct as the event rates are low in the very low risk patient group and will therefore require large numbers to demonstrate any difference between the strategies.

Another question is whether there are subgroups of patients with SAB in whom echocardiography can be safely omitted altogether. For example, patients with a very low a priori risk of endocarditis, or patients with transient bacteremia already receiving extended courses of parenteral antibiotics for other sites of infection might not always require TTE. Scenario-based research has shown that clinicians already actively engage in risk stratification when applying echocardiography strategies. It is important to note, however, that TTE is widely available, safe, inexpensive, and standard of care for patients with SAB. Thus, any decision to withhold echocardiography from SAB patients will need to be shown not to cause harm in high quality, adequately powered, and broadly generalizable trials.

### A scenario-based survey of expert echocardiography recommendations for patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia at varying risk for endocarditis [^111iyJeR]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

During the survey period, 656 respondents from 24 countries provided echocardiography recommendations for at least 1 survey scenario, giving a total of 4837 echocardiography recommendations (median [interquartile range], 96 [85–106] responses per scenario). Most respondents were infectious diseases physicians, and more than half reported an annual caseload of more than 20 cases of SAB (Table 1). Response rates were estimable for the mailing lists of the Australasian Society of Infectious Diseases (255 complete and partial responses from roughly 700 clinician members [approximately 35%]) and the Emerging Infections Network (204 complete and partial responses from roughly 1300 physicians with an adult infectious diseases practice [approximately 15%]).

Table 1.
Characteristics of the 656 Respondents Providing at Least 1 Echocardiography Recommendation

There was little consensus among respondents as to the preferred echocardiography strategy in any of the 50 scenarios. Poor interrater agreement was evident across the 6 response categories, with a modified Fleiss κ statistic of only 0.06 (bootstrapped 95% CI, 0.05–0.07). In only 1 scenario was a single echocardiography strategy chosen by at least 50% of respondents: a patient aged 91 years with brief nosocomial SAB without sepsis or any clinical focus of infection, for whom 45 of 90 respondents (50%) preferred the strategy of TTE as the only study. Every 1 of the 6 strategies was selected by at least 1 respondent in 44 of the 50 scenarios (the strategy of no echocardiography was the only omission in 4 of the remaining scenarios).

### Use of transthoracic echocardiography in the management of low-risk Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: results from a retrospective multicenter cohort study [^1142JcY6]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to develop a prediction model to identify patients with low-risk Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB), in whom infective endocarditis (IE) can be ruled out based on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).

Background

S. aureus is a major cause of bacteremia and often leads to IE. Current guidelines recommend performing transesophageal echocardiography on all patients or treating all patients empirically with prolonged intravenous antibiotics; however, this approach is resource intensive, many physicians do not adhere to guidelines, and recent studies suggest that low-risk patients may not require transesophageal echocardiography.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 833 consecutive hospitalized patients with SAB from 7 academic and community hospitals in Toronto, Canada, over a 3-year period (2007 to 2010). Patients who received a TTE within 28 days of bacteremia (n = 536) were randomly divided into derivation and validation cohorts. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine high-risk criteria for IE in the derivation cohort, and criteria were then applied to the validation cohort to determine diagnostic properties.

Results

Four high-risk criteria predicted IE: indeterminate or positive TTE (p < 0.001), community-acquired bacteremia (p = 0.034), intravenous drug use (p < 0.001), and high-risk cardiac condition (p < 0.004). In the validation cohort, the presence of any 1 of the high-risk criteria had 97% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI]: 87% to 100%) and 99% negative predictive value (95% CI: 96% to 100%) for IE. The negative likelihood ratio was 0.05 (95% CI: 0.007 to 0.35).

Conclusions

A normal TTE ruled out IE in patients without community-acquired SAB, high-risk cardiac conditions, and intravenous drug use. This study provides evidence that clinical risk stratification combined with a normal TTE may be adequate to rule out IE in most patients with SAB.

Discussion

The 2 major findings of this survey are (1) that expert clinicians appear to engage in active and precise stratification by risk of endocarditis when making echocardiography recommendations for patients with SAB and (2) that there is considerable disagreement between clinicians as to the single preferred echocardiography strategy and the need for a highly exclusionary strategy among lower-risk patients.

A number of previous studies have presented mechanisms for the estimation of endocarditis risk in SAB, but there has been little prior research into whether clinicians can or do use this form of risk estimation to inform relevant clinical decisions such as the use of echocardiography. Although we did not point out to respondents that the clinical scenarios were based on a risk-stratification scoring system or provide any numerical score or estimate of endocarditis risk, respondents nevertheless appeared to alter their echocardiography recommendations in a very finely graded (and arguably appropriate) fashion. This result not only supports the relevance of endocarditis risk stratification to the management of SAB but also the ability of (expert) clinicians to implement this type of assessment in their clinical decisions.

While clinicians did appear finely attuned to endocarditis risk when analyzed in aggregate, there was sizeable disagreement as to the most appropriate choice of echocardiography strategy for any given scenario. The variation in recommendations was particularly marked for scenarios describing patients with a VIRSTA score of less than 5 points (corresponding to an endocarditis risk of < 10%), for which recommendations were evenly divided between highly exclusionary strategies and those less able to exclude the diagnosis of endocarditis.

This variation in (hypothetical) practice mirrors previous survey and cohort data examining the use of echocardiography in SAB. Studies of routine infectious diseases consultation have reported that the application of TEE varies from 5% to 46% of patients with SAB treated by infectious diseases physicians, although these reports did not control for clinical differences between the included cohorts. Studies of endocarditis risk factors in SAB have suggested that clinicians do not pursue TEE nearly as often in patients with few risk factors for endocarditis as they do for patients at higher risk, but a previous multicenter cohort studyfound that the variation in the use of echocardiography between 3 geographically linked hospitals was inadequately explained by the prevalence of major risk factors for endocarditis. Such clinician-driven variation is also reflected in a recent survey of North American infectious diseases physicians, in which 20% of respondents indicated that they would routinely pursue TEE after a negative TTE result (regardless of the clinical circumstance), with the remainder selecting patients for follow-up TEE depending on unstated clinical factors.

### Clinical criteria and the appropriate use of transthoracic echocardiography for the exclusion of infective endocarditis [^115MaVmp]. Heart (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines currently suggest that transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) be carried out in all patients with suspected endocarditis, but the use of TTE where there is a low probability of infective endocarditis has a poor diagnostic yield. This screening approach may no longer be appropriate.

Objective

To examine whether clinical criteria might aid decision making with respect to the use of TTE in possible endocarditis.

Design

A retrospective review of patient records.

Setting

Cardiology department of a tertiary referral centre.

Patients

500 consecutive hospital inpatients referred for TTE to exclude endocarditis.

Main Outcome Measures

Evidence of endocardial vegetations on TTE and the presence of predetermined clinical criteria that may predispose to, or be suggestive of, endocarditis.

Results

Evidence of infective endocarditis was detected on echocardiography in 43 of the 500 patients (8.6%). In 239 patients (48%), vegetations and certain prespecified clinical criteria were both absent. These criteria were: vasculitic/embolic phenomena; the presence of central venous access; a recent history of injected drug use; presence of a prosthetic valve; and positive blood cultures. The collective absence of these five criteria indicated a zero probability of TTE showing evidence of endocarditis.

Conclusions

The use of simple clinical criteria during the decision making process may avoid many unnecessary TTE examinations in hospital inpatients with a low probability of endocarditis.

### Enterobacter bacteremia… [^1132fWuP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- During a six-year period, 147 patients had Enterobacter bacteremia, with an incidence of 1. 25 per 1, 000 admitted patients. We chose a random group of 50 cases for analysis. The disease was community acquired in 24% of the cases and nosocomially acquired in the remaining 76%. The bacteremia was unimicrobial in 70% and part of a polymicrobial bacteremia in 30%. The species most commonly causing bacteremia was Enterobacter cloacae. Portals of entry, in decreasing order of frequency, were unknown, surgical wound, respiratory tract, and urinary tract. The most common clinical finding was fever. Shock occurred in 30% of the patients, and only two patients had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Of the Enterobacter isolates, 12% were resistant to gentamicin.

Overall mortality was 42%; factors associated with a poor prognosis were inadequacy of antimicrobial chemotherapy, septic shock, type of underlying disease, clinical condition, and requirement of intensive care.

Key Points

Question

Which echocardiography strategies do expert clinicians recommend for patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia at varying risk for endocarditis?

Findings

In this survey study of 656 respondents from 24 countries, the echocardiography recommendations of expert clinicians for a variety of S aureus bacteremia scenarios were closely aligned to the burden of endocarditis risk factors. Substantial disagreement was seen between respondents as to the single best echocardiography strategy, particularly for scenarios with a low risk of infective endocarditis.

Meaning

Experts demonstrate active and precise risk stratification when recommending echocardiography strategies for patients with S aureus bacteremia, but disagreement exists as to the appropriate investigation of lower-risk cases.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116TKFuc]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) — diagnosis recommendations emphasize that in at‑risk patients with unexplained fever, blood culture samples should be obtained, and in recent onset left‑sided valve regurgitation, at least 2 sets of blood culture samples should be obtained. In patients with suspected IE, the Modified Duke Criteria should be used for diagnosis, and patients with IE should be evaluated and managed with consultation with a multispecialty Heart Valve Team. For imaging, in patients with suspected IE, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is recommended to identify vegetations, characterize the hemodynamic severity of valvular lesions, assess ventricular function and pulmonary pressures, and detect complications. If TTE is nondiagnostic, complications have developed or are clinically suspected, or intracardiac device leads are present, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is recommended; TTE and/or TEE are recommended for reevaluation when there is a change in clinical signs or symptoms or high risk of complications. In patients undergoing valve surgery for IE, intraoperative TEE is recommended. For stable IE patients considered for an early change to oral antibiotic therapy, a baseline TEE before switching to oral therapy and a repeat TEE 1 to 3 days before completion of the oral antibiotic regimen should be performed. Additional advanced imaging recommendations include that CT imaging is reasonable when anatomy cannot be clearly delineated by echocardiography in suspected paravalvular infections, and in nosocomial Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with a known extracardiac source, TEE might be considered to detect concomitant staphylococcal IE.

Limitations

Our study has a number of limitations that arise from the design and distribution of the survey instrument. The scenarios presented to respondents are clearly simplifications of a complex disease process. Although we included endocarditis risk factors identified in the analysis of the largest relevant published data set, there may be other important pieces of clinical information respondents may use to guide their echocardiography decision-making. This may include whether a patient would be fit for cardiac surgery, a complex consideration that was not captured in our scenarios other than through the variables describing patient age and health care–associated acquisition of bacteremia. We also deliberately did not include scenarios describing patients with intracardiac prosthetic devices owing to the differences in the diagnostic performance of echocardiography, incidence of perivalvular complications, and relapse rate compared with patients without these prostheses. It is also worth reiterating that, although consistent with a large observational literature, the VIRSTA score has not been externally validated. In this study, we have used it primarily as a risk stratification tool and a source of relevant clinical parameters rather than a numerical risk calculator.

The echocardiography strategies from which respondents could choose also simplify the interpretation of multipart echocardiography results into a binary framework. Additional considerations, such as the image quality of TTE and its identification of nondiagnostic structural abnormalities, may be relevant for echocardiography decision-making.

Furthermore, the distribution mechanism and estimated response rates to the survey make assessment of its representativeness uncertain. Our results are perhaps best understood as the opinions of an interested and motivated subgroup, which nevertheless contains substantial disagreement as to the most appropriate echocardiography strategy for various SAB scenarios. The opinions of cardiologists were clearly underrepresented in our results owing to the low number of responses. As with any survey posing hypothetical scenarios, it is also possible that the collected responses are not representative of the real-world practice even of those who provided responses.

### Low-risk Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia patients Do not require routine diagnostic imaging: a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study [^112X6bVp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is divided into uncomplicated and complicated disease. This dichotomous classification insufficiently reflects the heterogeneity of SAB and thus prevents a more precise clinical diagnosis that, in certain patients, would allow for more personalized treatment. Moreover, risk factors for metastatic infection and confirmed metastatic infection have traditionally been considered equivalent in this classification. The disadvantage of this classification is that it is not conducive to the detection of metastatic infections, whereas adequate control of these infectious foci is associated with lower mortality.

Recently, a risk stratification model for categorizing SAB patients as "high risk" or "low risk" for metastatic infection has been proposed to allow for a more personalized diagnostic workup and avoid unnecessary diagnostic imaging. Risk factors relate to host factors, features of bacteremia, and clinical course. In this 2-step system, high-risk SAB patients should undergo a more extensive diagnostic workup to identify or exclude infective endocarditis (IE) and other metastatic infections; in low-risk patients, diagnostic imaging can remain limited.

Although distinct patient groups are at increased risk of metastatic infections and risk-based imaging is used in daily practice, studies to determine which patients require specific investigations are limited. Most of these studies focused on the need for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in IE, usually as a follow-up examination after transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Two studies examined clinical risk factors for a complicated course, including metastatic infection, and found that 10%–20% of low-risk patients still had a complicated course. However, neither study had the primary objective of examining the safety of omitting diagnostic imaging in low-risk patients. Moreover, the usefulness of these studies in guiding imaging studies is complicated by the fact that definitions of complicated disease included both risk factors, metastatic disease, and poor clinical outcome. Therefore, in a large multicenter study, we investigated how often metastatic infections are found in low-risk SAB patients, what their clinical relevance is, and whether omitting routine imaging is associated with worse outcomes.

Figure.
Recommendations in Favor of a Highly Exclusionary Echocardiography Strategy by Scenario VIRSTA Score

Proportions are accompanied by Wilson score 95% confidence intervals (error bars). NE indicates no echocardiography; TEE, transesophageal echocardiography alone; TTE, transthoracic echocardiography alone; TTE+TEE, both TTE and TEE; TEE|TTE−, TTE first, followed by TEE only if the TTE result is negative for endocarditis; and TEE|TTE+, TTE first, followed by TEE only if the TTE result is positive for endocarditis.

The results of the multivariable analysis for the binary outcome of the recommendation of a highly exclusionary strategy are presented in Table 2. In addition to the association with VIRSTA score, this analysis also identified the presence of an extracardiac focus requiring prolonged treatment as having an independent association with recommendation against a highly exclusionary strategy (odds ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.45–0.58). This negative association was stronger for prosthetic joint infection (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.26–0.35) than for vertebral osteomyelitis (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.56–0.76). Weaker associations were observed for respondent demographic characteristics. Respondent location in continental Europe was associated with recommendation of highly exclusionary strategy (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3–2.5) compared with location in Australia or New Zealand. Annual caseload and years of postfellowship experience were not associated with choice of an exclusionary strategy on univariate analysis and were not included in the multivariable analysis (see eTable 1 in the Supplement). The associations between individual components of the VIRSTA score and recommendations in favor of a highly exclusionary strategy were closely aligned with the points value assigned to these components in the score's original description (Table 3).

Infective endocarditis — echocardiography recommended use states that TTE is recommended for initial evaluation of suspected endocarditis with positive blood culture results or a new murmur, for reevaluation of IE at high risk for progression or complication or with a change in clinical status or cardiac examination results, and for evaluation of hemodynamic consequences of IE, and repeat TEE at the end of antimicrobial therapy serves as a baseline for future comparisons; TEE is recommended to diagnose IE and its complications when clinical suspicion is intermediate or high regardless of negative results on TTE, and as the first-line modality when complications of IE are suspected or when prosthetic valve endocarditis is clinically suspected; repeat TEE after a few days (4–7 days) if clinical suspicion for IE remains high despite negative results on baseline TEE.

### Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography for the indication of suspected infective endocarditis: vegetations, blood cultures and imaging [^113ff649]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to detect vegetations and the relationship between blood cultures and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).

Methods

Five hundred eleven TTE and TEE pairs performed to evaluate endocarditis were retrospectively analyzed. Vegetation on TTE, prosthetic valve, change in regurgitation, and blood cultures were correlated with vegetation on TEE.

Results

TTE detected 45% of vegetations seen on TEE. There was no difference for prosthetic valves. Prosthetic valves (odds ratio, 1.7; P = 0.03) and increased regurgitation (odds ratio, 1.7; P = 0.01) were associated with vegetations on TEE; staphylococcal bacteremia and fungemia were not. Negative blood cultures were associated with negative results on TEE (P < .0001), but 27% of patients with prosthetic valves had culture-negative endocarditis or nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, and 6% had abscesses missed by TTE.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates a limited capacity of TTE to detect vegetations. TEE may be an appropriate initial study to evaluate prosthetic valves. TEE for culture-negative endocarditis deserves further study.

### Guidelines for the use of echocardiography in the evaluation of a cardiac source of embolism [^1138qKvG]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Endocarditis complications — diagnostic performance and modality selection: Sensitivity and specificity for abscess diagnosis have been estimated at 28% and 98%, respectively, for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and 87% and 95%, respectively, for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Similarly, sensitivity and specificity for native leaflet or cusp perforation diagnosis have been estimated at 45% and 98%, respectively, for TTE and 95% and 98%, respectively, for TEE. Aggressive microorganisms like staphylococci may cause paravalvular abscesses in both native and prosthetic valves, with a predilection for the aortic valve. Therefore, TEE is considered a first-line modality when suspecting endocarditis complications (perforation, abscess), prosthetic valve endocarditis, Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, intracardiac devices (i.e., pacemakers), and when transthoracic echocardiographic images are suboptimal, whereas TTE is the first-line modality for other situations and may be sufficient to suggest searching for another source of infection if the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is low and the test results are negative. In the setting of intermediate or high clinical suspicion for endocarditis, negative results on TTE should always be followed by TEE.

### A scenario-based survey of expert echocardiography recommendations for patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia at varying risk for endocarditis [^114G6Pp1]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

The study protocol and survey instrument were approved by the Monash University human research ethics committee. Respondents indicated their consent to participate by checking a mandatory radio button on the survey information page. This study followed the American Association for Public Opinion Research disclosure checklist.

We developed an anonymous web-based multiple-choice survey (eResults in the Supplement) to assess the echocardiography recommendations of expert clinicians for a set of 50 text-based SAB scenarios based on the VIRSTA score. Scenarios were generated by varying patient age, the risk factors for endocarditis contained in the VIRSTA score, and the presence of an extracardiac focus of infection requiring prolonged treatment (either a prosthetic joint infection or vertebral osteomyelitis) to generate clinically plausible text-based descriptions of a SAB episode (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Respondents were not informed that the scenarios were based on an endocarditis prediction score, nor that the scenarios were constructed specifically to vary their risk of endocarditis.

Although the VIRSTA score includes the presence or absence of intracardiac prosthetic devices (prosthetic valves or cardiac rhythm management devices), the presence of these devices has implications beyond an increased risk of endocarditis, affecting the diagnostic performance of echocardiography (particularly transthoracic echocardiography [TTE]), the chance of medical cure, and the development of other surgical indications. To aid interpretability, we chose to present only scenarios without these devices. For similar reasons related to excessive complexity of interpretation, we also chose not to include scenarios with symptomatic cerebral emboli or S aureus meningitis.

Each respondent was presented with 8 scenarios randomly selected without replacement from the overall pool of 50 scenarios: 2 of 15 very low-risk scenarios (VIRSTA score ≤ 2), 3 of 16 low-risk scenarios (VIRSTA score 3 or 4), and 3 of 19 moderate- to high-risk scenarios (VIRSTA score ≥ 5). This selection process ensured that each respondent addressed a range of endocarditis risk and emphasized the low- and very low-risk scenarios where we anticipated the greatest variability in responses.

Infective endocarditis — foundational diagnostic steps and echocardiography use: In patients with the recent onset of left-sided valve regurgitation, at least 2 sets of blood culture samples should be obtained, and in suspected infective endocarditis, the Modified Duke Criteria should be used for diagnosis. Patients with infective endocarditis should be evaluated and managed with consultation with a multispecialty Heart Valve Team. In suspected infective endocarditis, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is recommended to define vegetations and hemodynamics, and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is recommended when TTE is nondiagnostic, when complications are present or suspected, or when intracardiac device leads are present. In patients undergoing valve surgery for infective endocarditis, intraoperative TEE is recommended, and for those considered for an early change to oral antibiotic therapy for stable disease, a baseline TEE before switching and a repeat TEE 1 to 3 days before completion of the oral antibiotic regimen should be performed.

### Clinical management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a review [^11481Hjh]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Several management strategies may improve outcomes in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.

Objectives

To review evidence of management strategies for S. aureus bacteremia to determine whether transesophageal echocardiography is necessary in all adult cases and what is the optimal antibiotic therapy for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteremia.

Evidence Review

A PubMed search from inception through May 2014 was performed to identify studies addressing the role of transesophageal echocardiography in S. aureus bacteremia. A second search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from January 1990 through May 2014 was performed to find studies addressing antibiotic treatment for MRSA bacteremia. Studies reporting outcomes from antibiotic therapy for MRSA bacteremia were included. All searches, which were limited to English and focused on adults, were augmented by review of bibliographic references from included studies. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system with consensus of independent evaluations by at least 2 of the authors.

Findings

In 9 studies with a total of 4050 patients, use of transesophageal echocardiography was associated with higher rates of a diagnosis of endocarditis (14%-28%) compared with transthoracic echocardiography (2%-15%). In 4 studies, clinical or transthoracic echocardiography findings did not predict subsequent transesophageal echocardiography findings of endocarditis. Five studies identified clinical or transthoracic echocardiography characteristics associated with low risk of endocarditis (negative predictive values from 93% to 100%). Characteristics associated with a low risk of endocarditis include absence of a permanent intracardiac device, sterile follow-up blood cultures within 4 days after the initial set, no hemodialysis dependence, nosocomial acquisition of S. aureus bacteremia, absence of secondary foci of infection, and no clinical signs of infective endocarditis. Of 81 studies of antibiotic therapy for MRSA bacteremia, only 1 high-quality trial was identified. In that study of 246 patients with S. aureus bacteremia, daptomycin was not inferior to vancomycin or an antistaphylococcal penicillin, each in combination with low-dose, short-course gentamicin (clinical success rate, 44.2% [53/120] vs 41.7% [48/115]; absolute difference, 2.4% [95% CI, -10.2% to 15.1%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

All adult patients with S. aureus bacteremia should undergo echocardiography. Characteristics of low-risk patients with S. aureus bacteremia for whom transesophageal echocardiography can be safely avoided have been identified. Vancomycin and daptomycin are the first-line antibiotic choices for MRSA bacteremia. Well-designed studies to address the management of S. aureus bacteremia are needed.

### Low-risk Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia patients Do not require routine diagnostic imaging: a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study [^115Xb2dH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

A nonrandomized study on the added value of [18 F]FDG-PET/CT in patients with SAB suggested a survival benefit in low-risk patients. Sixty-one percent of low-risk patients had infectious foci on [18 F]FDG-PET/CT. However, the precise localization of these foci in this patient group and the part that affected treatment were not described. Furthermore, patients with prosthetic material and treatment delay were not considered to be at high risk, and patients with existing clinical signs of metastatic infection were also included.

Most clinical decision rules for imaging in SAB focus on IE and aim to determine the necessity of TEE. While current guidelines recommend performing TTE in all SAB patients, emerging evidence suggests that TTE may not be necessary for well-defined low-risk SAB patients. A cost-effectiveness analysis has also shown that in patients with a low probability of IE (< 2%), treating bacteremia without echocardiography can be cost-effective. Moreover, scenario-based research also indicated that clinicians feel confident in using risk stratification when deciding on echocardiography strategies. Consistent with these findings, our study revealed that echocardiography was not performed in all patients. TTE was performed in 58.9% and TEE was performed in 18.0% of the patients; 1 showed valvular vegetations (tricuspid valve; Table 4, Supplementary Table E). Importantly, we observed similar 90-day relapse-free survival in patients who did not undergo echocardiography compared with those who did. This suggests that risk stratification can be a valuable tool in deciding whether to perform TTE. Additionally, incorporating variables such as time to blood culture positivity, which clinicians can readily access at the time of SAB diagnosis, can enhance the precision of risk stratification models and improve accuracy when identifying patients who may not require invasive imaging.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^112aBst3]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Echocardiography in suspected infective endocarditis (IE) — initial testing, escalation, and limitations are as follows: Echocardiography is central to the diagnosis and management of patients with IE, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be done initially in all cases of suspected IE. If image windows are suboptimal (for example, chronic obstructive lung disease, prior surgery, or morbid obesity), then transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) should be performed as soon as possible after TTE. When clinical suspicion of IE or its complications is high (eg, prosthetic valve or new atrioventricular block), a negative TTE will not definitely rule out IE or its potential complications, and TEE should be performed first; TEE has been shown to be significantly more sensitive than TTE for the detection of vegetations and abscesses. In patients with prosthetic valves, transthoracic images are greatly hampered by structural components and are inadequate to assess the perivalvular area. Operationally, many patients are not candidates for immediate TEE because of having eaten within the preceding 6 hours or because institutions cannot provide 24-hour TEE services; when TEE is not clinically possible or must be delayed, early TTE should be performed without delay. Many findings identified by TEE also can be detected on TTE, and concurrent TTE images can serve as a baseline for rapid and noninvasive comparison should clinical deterioration occur. For tricuspid vegetations or right ventricular outflow tract abnormalities, visualization may be enhanced by choosing TTE rather than TEE, and many cardiologists believe TTE is superior to TEE for quantifying hemodynamic dysfunction manifested by valvular regurgitation, ventricular dysfunction, and elevated left and right ventricular filling pressures and pulmonary artery pressure. Both TTE and TEE may produce false-negative results if vegetations are small or have embolized, and even TEE may miss initial perivalvular abscesses early in illness. When TTE is negative and clinical suspicion remains low, then other clinical entities should be considered; if TTE shows vegetations but the likelihood of complications is low, subsequent TEE is unlikely to alter initial medical management.

### Embolic risk management in infective endocarditis: predicting the 'embolic roulette' [^115Mt1qT]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic parameters in embolic risk prediction

The individual patient embolic risk and the moment of the EE remain difficult to assess. Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) play an essential role in evaluating the embolic risk of patients with IE.

Vegetations have the following cardinal features on echocardiography: isoechoic tissue, independent movement, preferentially congregate on the leading edge of the valve, on the lower-pressure side of the valve (most common location of mitral valve involvement would be the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve on the atrial side). In prosthetic valves, however, they will most commonly be located at the junction between the sewing ring and the valvular annulus. Vegetations are also associated with valvular regurgitation, the vast majority cause failure of leaflet coaptation and may also perforate the valve, which will appear as an endocardial discontinuity (often results in multiple, aliased regurgitant jets on the high-pressure side of the affected valve). If regurgitation jet is not present, usually it argues against IE.

The size of the vegetation, increased mobility, the inhomogeneous appearance with reduced echogenicity are predictive factors of embolic risk.

The description of the dimensions and shape is much more detailed using TEE, being the essential imaging method in this context.TEE enhances the sensitivity of TTE to about 85–90% for the diagnosis of vegetation and the additive value of TEE is even more important for the diagnosis of abscess and other forms of perivalvular extension. In a study by Pérez-García et al, major diameter measured by real-time three-dimensional (3D)-TEE had better embolic predictive performance than two-dimensional (2D)-TEE. In another study of 119 subjects with S. aureus bacteraemia receiving both TTE and TEE, IE was diagnosed in 29 (24%), for whom endocardial involvement was evident in 25 (86%) by TEE, versus only 6 (21%) by TTE (p < 0.001).

### The relative roles of transthoracic compared with transesophageal echocardiography in children with suspected infective endocarditis [^115EWgVu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The study evaluated the additional benefit of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) versus transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in pediatric cases with suspected bacterial endocarditis.

Background

In adult patients, TTE has a lower sensitivity and specificity than TEE for the detection of vegetations or aortic root abscess formation. Few data are available about the relative benefits of TEE over TTE in the pediatric age group.

Methods

Patients were included if they had positive blood cultures for typical microorganisms and had a TTE and TEE within 14 days of each other. The patients had to meet the Duke criteria for a positive diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis. The TTE and TEE data were analyzed using the McNemar test for the significance of change.

Results

Twenty-one patients fulfilled the criteria, at a median age of 9.5 years. Congenital heart disease was present in 13 patients; 4 patients were previously healthy and 4 patients had other medical problems. Nine patients had surgical confirmation of bacterial endocarditis. Fifteen patients had a positive cardiac finding, with 12 vegetations, 2 vegetations plus aortic root abscess, and 1 isolated abscess. There was excellent agreement between TTE and TEE in those cases with positive cardiac findings, with a p = 0.32, kappa 0.89. Using positive TEE cardiac findings as the gold standard, the sensitivity for TTE was 86% for all 15 events and 93% for the detection of a vegetation.

Conclusions

In pediatric cases, TTE has a high degree of sensitivity for the detection of supportive evidence of endocarditis, and TEE should be reserved for patients with a poor transthoracic window.

### Isolated pulmonary valve endocarditis with rapid progression: a case report and literature review [^111SkVST]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

As the AHA (American Heart Association) guidelines recommend, both TTE (transthoracic echocardiography) and TEE (transesophageal echocardiography) are indispensable in many patients with IE during initial evaluation and subsequent follow-up, and they provide complementary information. It is estimated that the sensitivity and specificity of TTE are 30–63% and 91–100%, respectively, and those of TEE are 87–100% and 91–100%, respectively Even if our patient's blood culture remained negative, TTE would provided additional information to evaluate the severity of IE. Robbins et al. found that vegetation size could predict the response to medication alone The response to medication of vegetations < 10 mm was 100% versus 63% in vegetaion > 10 mm, and surgery was unavoidable for the remaining patients. In their assumption, as bacterial colonies deepen, their metabolism and proliferation become slower, leading to certain antibiotics being less effective. All this evidence indicates that our patient might benefit more from surgery than from conservative treatment alone.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) in congenital heart disease — diagnosis and initial testing emphasizes early culture acquisition and echocardiography. A delay in diagnosis of IE carries the risk of significant morbidity and mortality, and a high index of suspicion for IE in any patient with operated or unoperated congenital heart disease is a key to early diagnosis. Echocardiography is crucial; while transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is useful, its sensitivity may be too low to exclude IE, and if the TTE is equivocal or in the presence of a prosthetic valve or complex congenital cardiovascular anatomy, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is indicated. In all cases of IE, cultures should be obtained early before antibiotics are initiated, and congenital heart disease patients with fever and potential IE should have blood cultures drawn before antibiotic therapy to avoid subsequent false-negative cultures.

Infective endocarditis (IE) echocardiography — transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) versus transesophageal echocardiography (TEE): TTE has a sensitivity between 50% and 90% and a specificity > 90% for native valve vegetations, but in prosthetic valve endocarditis TTE sensitivity is 36% to 69%; by contrast, the sensitivity of TEE in native valve endocarditis ranges from 90% to 100%, with sensitivity slightly lower in prosthetic valves. TTE exhibits superior imaging over TEE for the anterior aspect of a prosthetic aortic valve and allows measurement of aortic transvalvular velocity/gradient not always possible on TEE. TTE and TEE are complementary, and TEE should be used as an adjunct in patients with echocardiographic features of IE on TTE to rule out abscesses that may alter management.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia — consideration of TEE to evaluate for infective endocarditis (IE): Because the frequency of IE among patients with S. aureus bacteremia is reported to be approximately 30%, with many cases not being clinically suspected, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may be considered in this setting to rule out IE, and even when a known extracardiac source such as an infected joint or joint prosthesis is identified, TEE might be considered given known cases of seeding of valve tissue in this setting.

Diagnostic Imaging

Diagnostic imaging was performed in 298 (79.0%) patients (529 investigations), including TTE in 222 (58.9%), TEE in 68 (12.9%), 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography with combined computed tomography ([18 F]FDG-PET/CT) in 68 (12.9%), CT in 80 (15.1%), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 24 (4.5%), and ultrasound in 67 (12.7%), as shown in Supplementary Table D. A total of 241 patients (63.9%) underwent at least 1 imaging study because of SAB. Of the 529 radiological investigations, 383 (72.4%) were requested to identify SAB-related infectious foci. Echocardiography (91.7%) and [18 F]FDG-PET/CT (92.6%) were predominantly requested because of SAB, whereas CT (6.3%) and MRI (25.0%) were mostly performed for suspected stroke, malignancies, or coronavirus disease 2019. Median time interval until any of the diagnostic imaging modalities was 3 days (interquartile range, 1–5). Multilevel logistic regression analysis showed that bedside consultation (81.2% versus 60.8%; odds ratio [OR], 2.876; 95% CI, 1.512–5.470; P < .001) and ICU admission (19.5% versus 10.1%; OR, 2.753; 95% CI, 1.139–6.654; P.025) were independently associated with the use of imaging (Table 2). The intraclass correlation coefficient among hospitals was low (0.35%), indicating that only 0.35% of the probability of diagnostic imaging usage is explained by between-hospital variability. Focusing on SAB-specific diagnostic imaging showed that bedside consultation (64.7% versus 83.8%; OR, 2.562; 95% CI, 1.437–4.568; P < .001) and follow-up blood culture positivity < 48 hours (18.9% versus 28.8%; OR, 1.862; 95% CI, 1.063–3.262; P.03) were independently associated with imaging.

### Diagnostic accuracy of transthoracic echocardiography for infective endocarditis findings using transesophageal echocardiography as the reference standard: a meta-analysis [^111emiRX]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Echocardiography is important for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE), for which transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is superior to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies was performed with the objective of evaluating diagnostic properties of TTE, with transesophageal findings of IE as the reference standard in patients with suspected IE.

Results

The literature search yielded 377 unique articles, of which 16 met the inclusion criteria. The 16 studies included 2,807 patients, of whom 793 (28%) had vegetations on TEE. For detecting vegetations, harmonic TTE had sensitivity of 61% (95% CI, 45%-75%) and specificity of 94% (95% CI, 85%-98%) with a negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of 0.42 (95% CI, 0.26–0.61). NLR for harmonic TTE can be improved by including only patients without prosthetic valves (NLR = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.22–0.55) or by having strict criteria for conclusively negative results on TTE (NLR = 0.17; 95% CI, 0.10–0.28). In the setting of patients without prosthetic valves, harmonic TTE had likelihood ratios of 0.14 (95% CI, 0.09–0.23) for a conclusively negative result, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.53–0.81) for an indeterminate result, and 14.60 (95% CI, 3.37–70.40) for a positive result.

Conclusions

Modern harmonic TTE still has the potential to miss many vegetations detected on TEE. When limited to patients without prosthetic valves, a conclusively negative TTE under optimal view greatly decreases likelihood of IE. All other transthoracic results are not useful for ruling out IE, and subsequent TEE is almost always required.

### The role of transthoracic echocardiography in excluding left sided infective endocarditis in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia [^113kQWGC]. The Journal of Infection (2005). Low credibility.

In all patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia a transoesophageal echocardiogram is recommended to exclude infective endocarditis. We determined that a finding of normal to trivial valvular regurgitation on transthoracic echocardiogram in these patients significantly reduced the probability of infective endocarditis. Furthermore, in the absence of embolic phenomena the likelihood of infective endocarditis was less than 2%. This probability could be further reduced if the echocardiogram was performed greater than 5 days after the bacteraemia. Therefore, in the assessment of patients with S. aureus bacteraemia a transoesophageal echocardiogram is not always required to exclude infective endocarditis.

Infective endocarditis (IE) echocardiography — basic principles include being acquainted with patient's clinical history and pretest probability for IE (low, intermediate, high) and interpreting/reporting findings accordingly. Review previous echocardiograms to determine IE predisposing factors and confirm newly discovered periprosthetic leaks or native valve regurgitation. Echocardiography has diagnostic and prognostic value in IE and also has postdiagnostic interval monitoring value in clinical decision making. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) exhibits low sensitivity but high specificity for IE diagnosis, whereas transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) exhibits both high sensitivity and specificity; TEE identifies anatomic detail of vegetations, may determine embolic risk, and identifies perivalvular complications. TTE and TEE modalities are complementary.

### Clinical importance of transthoracic echocardiography with direct input from treating physicians [^116SZomB]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The recent report that appropriately performed echocardiographic examinations result in active changes in management in only one third of patients has challenged the validity of current appropriate use criteria. Limited information exists about the clinical importance of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to guide management and rule out important alternative pathology.

Methods

The clinical impact of inpatient TTE performed at the Mayo Clinic over a 20-week period between October 14, 2013, and March 3, 2014, was investigated. Studies were included if they were ordered within 72 hours of admission, and treating physicians participated in a real-time survey regarding the clinical importance of TTE. Appropriate use was determined by two independent investigators, with differences adjudicated by a third investigator. Clinical impact was derived from physicians' survey responses and independently confirmed by chart review.

Results

Of the 539 transthoracic echocardiographic examinations included in this study, 512 (95%) were appropriate, 16 (3%) may be appropriate and 11 (2%) rarely appropriate. Although only 48% of participating physicians actively changed management on the basis of findings on TTE, 97% responded that TTE answered their clinical questions, and 95% would still order TTE in similar clinical contexts.

Conclusions

Most early inpatient transthoracic echocardiographic studies at our institution were appropriate and answered specific clinical questions important for management decisions in the opinion of the treating physician. Confirming a plan of care already in place and ruling out alternative pathology may be as important clinically as uncovering new findings or changing management.

### Is transesophageal echocardiography overused in the diagnosis of infective endocarditis? [^112pCjHR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Because of its greater sensitivity, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is often misused as a screening tool for the exclusion of infective endocarditis (IE) in patients with small clinical probability of the disease. This study examined the role of using TEE exclusively at a Canadian tertiary care center for the diagnosis of IE and determined which clinical variables are most often associated with positive or negative echocardiographic results supporting or refuting the diagnosis.

### Improving the appropriate use of transthoracic echocardiography: the echo WISELY trial [^111tNqUj]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Appropriate use criteria (AUC) have defined transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) indications for which there is a clear lack of benefit as rarely appropriate (rA).

Objectives

This study sought to investigate the impact of an AUC-based educational intervention on outpatient TTE ordering by cardiologists and primary care providers.

Methods

The authors conducted a prospective, investigator-blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled trial of an AUC-based educational intervention aimed at reducing rA outpatient TTEs. The study was conducted at 8 hospitals across 2 countries. The authors randomized cardiologists and primary care providers to receive either intervention or control (no intervention). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of rA TTEs.

Results

One hundred and ninety-six physicians were randomized, and 179 were included in the analysis. From December 2014 to April 2016, the authors assessed 14,697 TTEs for appropriateness, of which 99% were classifiable using the 2011 AUC. The mean proportion of rA TTEs was significantly lower in the intervention versus the control group (8.8% vs. 10.1%; odds ratio [OR]: 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57 to 0.99; p = 0.039). In physicians who ordered, on average, at least 1 TTE per month, there was a significantly lower proportion of rA TTEs in the intervention versus the control group (8.6% vs. 11.1%; OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.99; p = 0.047). There was no difference in the TTE ordering volume between the intervention and control groups (mean 77.7 ± 89.3 vs. 85.4 ± 111.4; p = 0.83).

Conclusions

An educational intervention reduced the number of rA TTEs ordered by attending physicians in a variety of ambulatory care environments. This may prove to be an effective strategy to improve the use of imaging.

### Prospective evaluation of the clinical application of the American college of cardiology foundation / American Society of Echocardiography appropriateness criteria for transthoracic echocardiography [^115mgMYp]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2008). Low credibility.

We sought to prospectively evaluate the clinical application of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Society of Echocardiography Appropriateness Criteria (AC) for transthoracic echocardiography in a single-center university hospital. Indications for transthoracic echocardiograms (TTE) were prospectively determined for consecutive studies by 2 reviewers and categorized, according to the AC for TTE, as appropriate (A) or inappropriate (I). The overall level of agreement in characterizing appropriateness between reviewers was high (kappa = 0.83). Among the 1,553 studies for which a primary indication was determined, 89% were covered in the AC for TTE. Of these studies, 89% were A, and 11% were I. New important TTE abnormalities were more common on A compared with I studies (40% vs. 17%, p < 0.001), and noncardiac specialists more frequently ordered I studies (13% vs. 9%, p = 0.04). In conclusion, the AC for TTE encompasses the majority of clinical indications for TTE and appears to reasonably stratify TTE ordering. However, revisions will be needed to fully capture and stratify appropriate clinical practice.

Chronic Q fever endocarditis — echocardiography and diagnostic considerations: Valvular vegetations are usually small and are detected by echocardiogram in approximately 12% of cases, so cardiologists should be made aware of suspected chronic Q fever because lesions might be missed. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is more sensitive than a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and TEEs should be performed in patients with suspected endocarditis who have TTEs that are negative or not definitive; however, a negative echocardiogram, whether TTE or TEE, does not rule out chronic Q fever endocarditis. In a retrospective series, the most common echocardiographic abnormality was new or discovered or worsening valvular insufficiency, and among those with a known prior acute Q fever, the median onset time for endocarditis was 2.5 months (range: 1–66 months) after acute illness.

Introduction

The diagnosis of infective endocarditis is typically based on clinical presentation, positive blood cultures, and echocardiography findings. In particular, echocardiography is central to the diagnosis and management of patients with infective endocarditis. If adequate echocardiographic findings cannot be observed secondary to artifacts, an alternative imaging tool should be considered. In the present case, we describe a patient with infective endocarditis that could not be diagnosed using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in children with structurally normal hearts suspected of having infective endocarditis (IE). We hypothesized that the diagnostic yield of TTE is minimal in low-risk patients with normal hearts. We performed a retrospective chart review of TTEs performed for concern for endocarditis at a pediatric tertiary care referral center in Portland, Oregon. Three hundred patients met inclusion criteria (< 21 years old, completed TTE for IE from 2005 to 2015, no history of congenital heart disease or endocarditis). We recorded findings that met the modified Duke criteria (MDC) including fever, positive blood culture, and vascular/immunologic findings; presence of a central line; whether or not patients were diagnosed with IE clinically; and if any changes to antibiotic regimens were made based on TTE. Ten patients (3%) had echocardiograms consistent with IE. When compared to the clinical diagnosis of IE, the positive predictive value (PPV) of one positive blood culture without other major/minor MDC was 0. Similarly, the PPV of two positive blood cultures without other major/minor criteria was 0.071. Patients should be evaluated using the MDC to assess the clinical probability of IE prior to performing a TTE. Patients with a low probability for IE should not undergo TTE as it has a low diagnostic yield and patients are unlikely to be diagnosed with disease.

Cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) infection — imaging diagnosis with echocardiography: transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a useful imaging modality, and the sensitivity of TEE for endocarditis and perivalvular extension of infection is superior to that of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Reported performance shows that the sensitivity of TTE for detecting endocarditis was only 32%, and the specificity was 100% when compared with TEE; the addition of TEE resulted in one false-positive result (specificity 99%). TEE should be considered for all patients who have documented or suspected bloodstream infection or CIED pocket infection. Device pocket infection often demonstrates intravascular lead involvement in 88% of patients, and TEE is helpful in assessing unrecognized bloodstream infection.

### Cardiac implantable electronic devices and bloodstream infections: management and outcomes [^111mytp1]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Cumulative mortality of those with BSI was ∼50% at 4 years (Figure 2), being nearly seven times higher compared with that of patients who never experienced a BSI (Structured Graphical Abstract).

There is uncertainty about the optimal diagnostic tool for device endocarditis. Although the Novel 2019 International CIED Infection Document presented additional criteria for device endocarditis and merged the modified Duke criteria with the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) criteria, none represent a validated and standardized tool for the diagnosis in this specific setting. A recent study by Boix-Palop et al. evaluated patients with late-onset BSI, defined as episodes of clinically significant bacteraemia occurring more than 1 year after implantation or device manipulation. They reported 187 (2.9%) cases of clinically significant bacteraemia out of 6313 patients. In this patient cohort, 41% never underwent cardiac imaging, 41% had a TTE, 18% had both TTE and TEE, and < 10% a PET-CT scan. Unlike the study by Boix-Palop, which included a large group of patients with prosthetic valves (57%), in which the medical community is significantly more attentive to endocarditis or systemic infection, our study cohort consisted exclusively of patients with de novo ICD or CRT-D implantation and BSI. In line with past literature, the rate of cardiac imaging in our cohort was as low as 47% and, when performed, TTE was prevalent. This is a surprisingly low rate, especially considering that over half of patients had a Gram-positive pathogen, well-known for resulting in a higher risk for device infection as compared with other pathogens. On the other hand, recommendations for a more systematic use of second- and third-level cardiac imaging was given only in 2020. The lack of cardiac imaging was likely a factor in missing the diagnosis of endocarditis related to the need for other than microbiological criteria for a device infection/endocarditis as recently indicated by the Novel 2019 International CIED Infection Document.

### Applicability of echocardiographic strict negative criteria for suspected infective endocarditis [^117AZtUZ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Echocardiography is the cornerstone imaging technique in the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) but is often misused in clinical practice. Recently, strict negative criteria have been proposed to avoid unnecessary follow-up echocardiograms. We aimed to evaluate the use of echocardiography in real-world clinical daily practice and the usefulness of these criteria in the diagnosis of IE. We retrospectively retrieved every echocardiogram performed in our center for suspected IE between 2014 and 2018, including 905 transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs). Of these, 451 (49.8%) fulfilled the strict negative criteria (group 1). In this group, IE was seldom diagnosed (n = 4, 0.9%). In 338 patients (37.4%) no signs of IE were evident, but they did not fulfill the strict negative criteria (group 2). A follow-up echocardiogram and definitive diagnosis of IE were more frequent (n = 48, 14.2% and n = 20, 5.9%). Finally, in 116 patients (12.8%) the initial TTE showed typical or suggestive signs of IE, in whom the diagnosis was confirmed in 48 patients (41.4%). A definitive diagnosis of IE was established in a minority of the study population (n = 72, 8%). Only 1 readmission for underdiagnosis of IE was noted on group 2. We conclude that in a real-life setting only a minority of patients in whom IE was suspected had a definitive diagnosis. An initial TTE for suspected IE fulfilling the strict negative criteria predicts both a low probability of requesting a follow-up study and of a definitive diagnosis of IE.

RESULTS

Among the 1140 episodes with positive blood cultures for streptococci, 851 episodes were included (Figure 1). Streptococci from the S mitis group (excluding S pneumoniae) were the most frequently isolated (325 [38%]), followed by S anginosus group (131 [15%]) and S agalactiae (94 [11%]) (Table 1). A total of 607 (71%) episodes exhibited bacteremia caused by non-β-hemolytic streptococci.

Flowchart of included episodes.

Table 1.
Comparison of Episodes With or Without Infective Endocarditis Among 851 Episodes With Streptococcal Bacteremia

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), TEE, 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18 F-FDG PET/CT), and cardiac computed tomography were performed in 447 (53%), 220 (26%), 48 (6%), and 15 (2%) episodes, respectively, with 471 (55%) episodes undergoing at least 1 type of cardiac imaging. ID consultation was provided in 684 (80%) episodes.

One hundred seventy-one (20%) episodes were diagnosed with IE by the Endocarditis Team, with 132 (77%) involving native valves, 35 (20%) prosthetic valves, 6 (4%) cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) lead, and 4 (2%) other intracardiac structures. Four episodes presented with recurrence of bacteremia and IE with the same streptococcal species within 120 days of the initial episode (Supplementary Table 1).

Among the 680 episodes without IE, other sources of bacteremia included bacteremia of unknown focus (153 [18%]), abdominal (149 [18%]), skin and soft tissue (116 [14%]), osteoarticular (90 [11%]), lower respiratory tract (86 [10%]), catheter-related (21 [2%]), and other types of infection (128 [15%]). Nine (1%) episodes presented with a recurrence of bacteremia with the same streptococcal species within 120 days of the initial episode; in every subsequent episode, IE was excluded and a clear focus of infection was diagnosed (Supplementary Table 1). Death occurred within 120 days in 128 episodes (19%); in none of these episodes was the cause of death a recurrence of IE.

### Low-risk Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia patients Do not require routine diagnostic imaging: a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study [^114QicJa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

We performed a retrospective multicenter cohort study at 7 hospitals in the Netherlands. We obtained approval from the research ethics boards of all hospital sites.

All adults with low-risk SAB (see definition below) between January 2013 and December 2022 were eligible for inclusion. Supplementary Table A provides exact time periods per hospital.

Exclusion criteria were aged < 18 years, death or deemed suitable for palliative care ≤ 72 hours after the index blood culture, contaminated or polymicrobial blood cultures, or immediate transfer to another hospital. If follow-up blood cultures were missing, we considered them to be negative. Blood cultures were considered contaminated when S. aureus grew in only 1 blood culture bottle, the cultures were documented as contaminated by the treating physician or clinical microbiologist, no antibiotic treatment was initiated, and no relapse of S. aureus bacteremia occurred. Follow-up was 90 days after discontinuation of antibiotic treatment to determine infection-related mortality, all-cause mortality, and relapse. Infection-related mortality was assessed as previously described.

Low-Risk SAB

Low-risk SAB was defined as 1 or more blood cultures positive for S. aureus in the absence of all of the following risk factors: community acquisition, implanted prosthetic material (vascular and intracardiac prostheses [except for coronary artery stents], prosthetic joints, and osteosynthesis material), failure to remove central venous catheter (CVC), positive blood cultures more than 48 hours after initiation of antibiotics with in vitro susceptibility to the isolated S. aureus (appropriate treatment), fever (≥ 38°C) more than 72 hours after initiation of appropriate antibiotic treatment, treatment delay (signs of infection for more than 48 hours before initiation of appropriate antibiotic treatment), and clinical signs of metastatic infection (Supplementary Table B).

SAB Management

The Dutch national guideline provides recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of SAB patients. Clinical microbiologists are required to report all S. aureus blood culture results to the treating physician promptly, ideally within 4 hours. Follow-up blood cultures are recommended every 48 hours until negative. Bedside consultation by an infectious diseases (ID) physician should be standard care for all patients with SAB. The guideline recommends a TTE in all patients. Patients with uncomplicated SAB should be treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics for 2 weeks after initial negative blood cultures. We considered 14 ± 4 days of antibiotics appropriate, given the variation in prescription practices between hospitals. In patients with metastatic infection, antibiotic treatment for 4–6 weeks, depending on focus of infection, is required.

### A scenario-based survey of expert echocardiography recommendations for patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia at varying risk for endocarditis [^116xwSpB]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Echocardiography to detect infective endocarditis is regarded as a key quality indicator in the care of patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, but its application varies markedly between reported series. Understanding the reasons for this variation in practice is important to improve the use of this investigation.

Objective

To identify expert clinicians' preferred echocardiography strategy for a variety of S aureus bacteremia scenarios in a hypothetical setting free from extrinsic constraints.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Anonymous web-based survey study comprising 50 text-based scenarios describing patients with S aureus bacteremia and various combinations of risk factors for endocarditis. Other variables included patient age and the presence of an extracardiac focus of infection warranting prolonged treatment. The survey was emailed to participants between September 2018 and March 2019. Each respondent was asked to recommend 1 of 6 echocardiography strategies for up to 8 randomly selected scenarios. Respondents were primarily infectious diseases physicians, and more than half reported an annual caseload of more than 20 cases of S aureus bacteremia.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The proportion of respondents selecting each of the 6 echocardiography strategies was calculated alongside Wilson score confidence intervals. Modified Fleiss κ statistics were used to described interrespondent variability. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess the associations between respondent- and scenario-level variables and the recommendation of an echocardiography strategy with a low negative likelihood ratio for infective endocarditis (ie, a highly exclusionary strategy).

Results

A total of 656 respondents from 24 countries provided 4837 echocardiography recommendations across the 50 scenarios. Echocardiography recommendations were associated with scenarios' burden of endocarditis risk (multivariate odds ratio per point of the VIRSTA score, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.4–1.5; P < .001). Poor interrespondent agreement was seen across all scenarios (modified Fleiss κ, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.05–0.07) but was most notable for scenarios with a lower risk of endocarditis (modified Fleiss κ, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.03–0.05). The presence of an extracardiac focus of infection was also associated with the choice of echocardiography strategy (odds ratio for highly exclusionary strategy, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.45–0.58). Respondent location in continental Europe was associated with recommendations in favor of a highly exclusionary strategy (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3–2.5) compared with location in Australia or New Zealand.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, expert clinicians demonstrated active stratification by risk of endocarditis when making echocardiography recommendations for hypothetical patients with S aureus bacteremia. Substantial disagreement existed as to whether patients at lower risk of endocarditis should undergo transesophageal echocardiography-based echocardiography strategies.

### Echocardiography has low utility in cancer patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia: findings from a retrospective study [^112TiF6T]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

To describe the incidence of infective endocarditis (IE) detected on echocardiography in cancer patients with confirmed Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB).

Methods

We retrospectively identified 95 cases of SAB in cancer patients from January 2007-March 2016. Echocardiography was ordered at the discretion of the treating team, and positive findings defined according to the Modified Duke Criteria. Complicated bacteraemia was defined by prolonged bacteraemia, presence of intracardiac device/prosthetic valve, or signs of metastatic infection.

Results

Major predisposing risk factors for IE (intracardiac device, prosthetic valve, valvular disease, diabetes mellitus, renal dialysis) were present in 27% of cases. Fifty-one of 95 (54%) had a central venous catheter and 17 (18%) patients had complicated bacteraemia. Echocardiography was performed in 75/95 (79%) episodes, with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) alone in 56, transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) alone in 4 and both in 15. Echocardiography was diagnostic for IE in 2 patients (1 TTE, 1 TOE), including one result that led to the diagnosis of IE in a clinically unsuspected case. Four further cases of IE were diagnosed on clinical findings, resulting in an overall rate of IE of 6% (6/95). Five of these cases occurred in patients with complicated bacteraemia or ≥ 1 risk factor for IE. No patient was readmitted due to IE.

Conclusion

IE is infrequent in cancer patients with uncomplicated SAB and no risk factors for IE. Performing echocardiography routinely in all cancer patients with SAB rarely alters diagnosis or affects antibiotic management and therefore should be reserved for patients with specific risk factors.

### Guidelines for the use of echocardiography in the evaluation of a cardiac source of embolism [^114NQYZC]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Approach to test selection — unless clinical findings suggest a specific cause of embolism (e.g., atrial fibrillation, mitral stenosis, endocarditis), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) results are often negative, and it has been suggested that TTE may be unnecessary in cryptogenic stroke with negative clinical evaluation or when transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is already planned; however, others believe TTE may occasionally reveal findings not well seen on TEE (such as LV apical thrombi) and may even eliminate the need for TEE.

### Bacteremia antibiotic length actually needed for clinical effectiveness: a pilot RCT (BALANCE) [^113dC9Bx]. ClinicalTrials (2014). Low credibility.

Study Overview Bacteremia is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in critically ill adults. Although bacteria in the bloodstream may arise from variable infectious foci, because of the high attendant morbidity and mortality of bacteremia, these patients collectively represent a critically important group to study. The selection of type, dose and route of antibiotics will be at the discretion of the treating physicians, but the duration of treatment will be determined by randomization group. The randomization assignment will not be communicated to the study research coordinator, study critical care or infectious diseases investigators or clinicians until day 8. The primary outcome for the main trial will be 90-day mortality.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive transesophageal echocardiographic examination: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists [^116n8iYR]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

AUC ratings for some scenarios of TEE as an initial or supplemental test list appropriate uses including use when there is a high likelihood of a nondiagnostic transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) due to patient characteristics or inadequate visualization, re-evaluation of prior TEE findings for interval change when a change in therapy is anticipated, guidance during percutaneous noncoronary cardiac interventions, suspected acute aortic pathology, evaluation of valvular structure and function to assess suitability for an intervention, diagnosis of infective endocarditis with a moderate or high pretest probability, evaluation for cardiovascular source of embolus with no identified noncardiac source, and atrial fibrillation/flutter evaluation to facilitate clinical decision making regarding anticoagulation, cardioversion, and/or radiofrequency ablation. The uncertain scenario is evaluation for cardiovascular source of embolus with a previously identified noncardiac source. Inappropriate scenarios include routine use when a diagnostic TTE is reasonably anticipated to resolve concerns, surveillance for interval change when no change in therapy is anticipated, routine assessment of pulmonary veins in an asymptomatic patient status post pulmonary vein isolation, diagnosing infective endocarditis with a low pretest probability, evaluation for cardiovascular source of embolus with a previously identified noncardiac source, and atrial fibrillation/flutter evaluation when a decision has been made to anticoagulate and not to perform cardioversion.

### Comparison of the 2015 and 2023 Duke-European Society of Cardiology criteria among patients with suspected infective endocarditis [^112oEnC2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Recognizing its limitations, our study incorporated most of the patients retrospectively. Nevertheless, a substantial number of patients had suspicion of IE that was ultimately rejected, distinguishing the current study from previous research that primarily included confirmed IE cases. Moreover, using both the endocarditis team (in prospective cohorts) and expert clinicians (in retrospective cohorts) could potentially result in misclassifications of episodes. The rationale for this approach to assessing IE cases stems from the lack of a definitive reference standard for IE diagnosis. This is primarily because IE demands a comprehensive and specialized approach to ensure precise diagnosis and successful management. In addition, the definition used for suspicion of IE was broad, encompassing patients with very low risk of IE. However, this mirrors actual clinical practice.

Our study was conducted in 2 Swiss hospitals, where infectious diseases specialists evaluate all suspected IE cases, with ready availability of 18 F-FDG PET/CT and cardiac CT to evaluate valvular and paravalvular lesions, and cerebral and thoracoabdominal imaging studies to evaluate embolic events; our findings may therefore have limited generalizability to other healthcare systems. Furthermore, 724 patients (34%) underwent TTE exclusively. While TEE is superior to TTE in detecting IE, in patients with a low risk of IE and high-quality negative TTE findings, it may suffice to exclude IE. This scenario is relevant to nosocomial cases of S. aureus bacteremia lacking known risk factors for IE (such as history of prior IE, presence of CIED or prosthetic valves, persistent bacteremia for ≥ 72 hours, or embolic events), where the risk of IE was low (1%).

In conclusion, the 2023 Duke-ESC clinical criteria revealed significant improvements in sensitivity compared with the 2015 version. However, the 2023 Duke-ESC version shares similar limitations to its predecessors, with approximately one-third of the episodes classified as possible IE. The additional elements introduced by the 2023 Duke-ESC criteria, such as leaflet thickening, osteoarticular septic manifestations, and E. faecalis as a typical pathogen, warrant further evaluation. In our study, their inclusion did not improve the discriminatory efficacy of the criteria; in fact, it may have even diminished it. The coexistence of 2 distinct iterations of the Duke criteria introduces complexity and potential confusion for clinicians. The necessity for judicious criterion selection in the presence of these dual versions could compromise diagnostic consistency and research coherence in the future.

### Prediction rules for ruling out endocarditis in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^113Fyd4e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Strengths of our study include the prospective enrollment with nearly complete data, the multicenter design allowing for an unselected cohort from both general and university hospitals, and the high percentages of TTE, TEE, and follow-up blood cultures.

Study limitations include that not all patients with SAB were enrolled because of the need for informed consent. That patients who refused or were discharged before consent was possible may have resulted in selection bias; in particular, the latter group may comprise the least ill patients, with a lower likelihood of SA-IE. Yet, because most would likely have been classified as low risk by the prediction scores, this would not influence sensitivity and could further increase NPV. Furthermore, our study population is comparable in demographics, rates of echocardiography, prevalence of endocarditis, and mortality to other cohort studies that included all patients without the need for informed consent. As in nearly all studies on SAB, blood culture collection was not standardized, leading to some uncertainty on duration of bacteremia. Despite this, at least 1 follow-up blood culture was taken in 91% of patients. The diagnostic accuracy results were robust in the sensitivity analysis including only patients that had at least 1 follow-up blood culture. Finally, because of a recent change in laboratory software, TTP data were missing from 1 hospital. This smaller population for validation of POSITIVE may have resulted in wider CIs, but is unlikely to bias the diagnostic accuracy point estimates.

In summary, we found that of the 3 proposed prediction sets for risk of IE in patients with SAB, VIRSTA has the highest NPV but at the expense of a high number of patients classified as high risk and thus requiring TEE. Risk scores should therefore not only be evaluated with regard to diagnostic accuracy, but also on their clinical implications. The POSITIVE and PREDICT scores need adjustment before they can be used to rule out endocarditis. Until further adjustment of the POSITVE and PREDICT scores, clinicians can use the VIRSTA score to safely rule out SA-IE without performing a TEE.

American Heart Association recommendations — For suspected infective endocarditis (IE), at least 3 sets of blood cultures obtained from different venipuncture sites should be obtained, with the first and last samples drawn at least 1 hour apart (Class I; Level of Evidence A), and echocardiography should be performed expeditiously in patients suspected of having IE (Class I; Level of Evidence A).

### An approach to improve the negative predictive value and clinical utility of transthoracic echocardiography in suspected native valve infective endocarditis [^1145vsHE]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with suspected native valve infective endocarditis, current guidelines recommend initial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) followed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) if clinical suspicion remains. The guidelines do not account for the quality of initial TTE or other findings that may alter the study's diagnostic characteristics. This may lead to unnecessary TEE when initial TTE was sufficient to rule out vegetation.

Methods

The objective of this study was to determine if the use of a strict definition of negative results on TTE would improve the performance characteristics of TTE sufficiently to exclude vegetation. A retrospective analysis of patients at a single institution with suspected native valve endocarditis who underwent TTE followed by TEE within 7 days between January 1, 2007, and February 28, 2014, was performed. Negative results on TTE for vegetation were defined by either the standard approach (no evidence of vegetation seen on TTE) or by applying a set of strict negative criteria incorporating other findings on TTE. Using TEE as the gold standard for the presence of vegetation, the diagnostic performance of the two transthoracic approaches was compared.

Results

In total, 790 pairs of TTE and TEE were identified. With the standard approach, 661 of the transthoracic studies had negative findings (no vegetation seen), compared with 104 studies with negative findings using the strict negative approach (meeting all strict negative criteria). The sensitivity and negative predictive value of TTE for detecting vegetation were substantially improved using the strict negative approach (sensitivity, 98% [95% CI, 95%-99%] vs 43% [95% CI, 36%-51%]; negative predictive value, 97% [95% CI, 92%-99%] vs 87% [95% CI, 84%-89%]).

Conclusions

The ability of TTE to exclude vegetation in patients is excellent when strict criteria for negative results are applied. In patients at low to intermediate risk with strict negative results on TTE, follow-up TEE may be unnecessary.

Heart Rhythm (2024). High credibility.

Cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) infection — echocardiographic indications and limitations are as follows: In the presence of a CIED, echocardiography is indicated to evaluate for lead or valvular vegetations. While TTE has low sensitivity, TEE sensitivity and specificity are high (95–100%) and intracardiac echocardiography shares high diagnostic accuracy. Clots and sterile fibrinous material can often be seen on leads and may not be related to infection, and failure to see a vegetation on a lead with echocardiography does not rule out lead infection; TEE and intracardiac echocardiography are also helpful during lead extraction procedures.

Multidisciplinary management approach

Each patient with suspected IE was initially discussed with the cardiology team and underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) (figure 1). A transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) was performed following the TTE if study quality was poor or if valvular complications were suspected. The patient was also discussed with the microbiology team and blood cultures taken. If there was a high clinical suspicion of IE, the case was then referred to the ET. The ET consisted of two cardiologists, one microbiologist, one cardiac imaging specialist, one cardiac surgeon and an IE specialist nurse coordinator.

Referral pathway and journey of patients with infective endocarditis. A&E, accident and emergency; MDT, multidisciplinary team; SPECT, single photon emission CT; TOE, transoesophageal echocardiogram; TTE, transthoracic echocardiogram.

New referrals to the ET were discussed immediately after presentation, existing cases at a once-weekly MDT meeting and all cases were reviewed on twice-weekly ward rounds and board rounds led by a consultant microbiologist and cardiologist. The purpose of this collaborative evaluation was to initially characterise patients as definite, probable or excluded cases of IE, as defined by the modified Duke criteria, and to subsequently obtain a consensus on the type, duration and mode of antibiotic therapy. Risk of systemic embolisation, progressive heart failure and irreversible structural damage due to severe infection were assessed in accordance with European guidance to determine if there was an indication for early surgery. All patients requiring surgery were broadly categorised according to indication (embolic, infectious or haemodynamic) and timing (emergency, within 24 hours; urgent, within a few days; elective, after 1–2 weeks of antibiotic therapy). Time to surgery was defined as the time from suspected IE to the operative procedure. Medical therapy was indicated for those at lower risk, or those patients deemed unfit for surgery. Patients were monitored for medical therapy failure and the development of indications for surgical intervention. The clinical course was evaluated daily by the ward team and reviewed by the ET on a twice-weekly ward round. All patients were followed up at 1, 6 and 12 months following discharge from hospital at an endocarditis clinic run by the ET in the outpatient setting.

Key points and recommendations — every standard view in pediatric transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) involves focused and optimized evaluation of specific cardiovascular segments and connections, particularly in the setting of congenital heart disease (CHD), and a protocol should be established outlining the required elements and preferred order for all the standard views of a comprehensive pediatric TTE, understanding that modified views are often needed to evaluate abnormal findings.
