## Question

What is the preferred first line medication for type 2 diabetes in patients with esrd on dialysis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the preferred first-line medication for type 2 diabetes in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why ESRD changes the calculus. Then, I should verify which drug classes are contraindicated or deprioritized in dialysis. Next, I will review which agents have supportive evidence and guideline endorsement in advanced CKD/ESRD. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-conscious recommendation and note alternatives if the preferred agent is not tolerated or available.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and constraints. ESRD on dialysis fundamentally alters pharmacokinetics, glycemic patterns, and hypoglycemia risk; many oral agents are contraindicated or require dose adjustments, and HbA1c can be unreliable, so I need to ensure any recommendation prioritizes safety, low hypoglycemia risk, and robust evidence in this population [^11377zRY] [^116W9ANG].

> Wait, let me verify the status of metformin here, because I initially thought it might still be reasonable in some dialysis patients; hold on, I should verify guideline thresholds. Metformin is contraindicated in ESRD and should be discontinued when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², including in dialysis, due to lactic acidosis risk, so it is not a candidate for first-line therapy in ESRD despite its usual first-line role in earlier CKD stages [^1111tfiL] [^114qJMRm] [^116wHr8J].

> I need to check SGLT2 inhibitors next. Although SGLT2 inhibitors have strong cardiorenal benefits in CKD, their glycemic efficacy wanes as eGFR declines below 45 and they are generally not initiated below about 20–25 mL/min/1.73 m²; moreover, while the FDA removed a dialysis-related warning for dapagliflozin, expert groups note insufficient evidence for benefit once dialysis is initiated, so SGLT2 inhibitors are not the preferred first-line glycemic choice in dialysis patients despite their kidney protection in earlier CKD [^111CwBAi] [^112La1Bp] [^113x77Da].

> Let me consider DPP-4 inhibitors. Sitagliptin and saxagliptin have evidence of glycemic efficacy in ESRD with dose adjustments, and linagliptin requires no dose change; however, they lack the robust cardiovascular and renal outcome benefits seen with GLP-1 receptor agonists, so while they are reasonable options for glycemic control, they are not the preferred first-line when a disease-modifying agent is available [^114PYLBT] [^111sNXSU] [^115HQiwg].

> I will now examine GLP-1 receptor agonists, because I recall they are often prioritized in advanced CKD. Hold on, I should verify dialysis-specific data and guideline positions. GLP-1 RAs reduce hypoglycemia risk, lower A1C, and have demonstrated cardiovascular and renal benefits in CKD populations; importantly, several agents (dulaglutide, semaglutide, liraglutide) are supported down to eGFR 15 mL/min/1.73 m² without dose adjustment, and small studies in dialysis suggest acceptable safety and efficacy with attention to GI tolerability, aligning with ADA guidance that prefers GLP-1 RAs in advanced CKD/ESRD for glycemic management and cardiovascular risk reduction [^114Qx47f] [^113gbWkP].

> But wait, what if insulin is the default in ESRD; should I be recommending insulin instead? Insulin remains commonly used in dialysis due to altered clearance and the need for flexible dosing, yet it carries higher hypoglycemia risk and requires careful titration; thus, while insulin is appropriate when oral/injectable noninsulin options fail or are not tolerated, it is not the preferred first-line choice when a GLP-1 RA can be used safely and effectively in this setting [^11377zRY] [^115Kmypy].

> Let me synthesize and double-check the hierarchy. Given contraindications to metformin, limited glycemic and uncertain benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors in dialysis, and the favorable safety and outcome profile of GLP-1 RAs, the preferred first-line pharmacologic therapy for type 2 diabetes in ESRD on dialysis is a GLP-1 receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit, such as dulaglutide, semaglutide, or liraglutide, recognizing no dose adjustment is required down to eGFR 15 and that GI side effects may necessitate slow titration and monitoring [^114Qx47f] [^114ABhCz] [^113gbWkP].

> Hold on, I should verify alternatives and contingencies. If a GLP-1 RA is not tolerated due to GI effects or is contraindicated, a DPP-4 inhibitor (particularly linagliptin) can provide glycemic control with low hypoglycemia risk, albeit without the cardiorenal outcome benefits; insulin remains the fallback for persistent hyperglycemia or when noninsulin options are unsuitable, with dosing individualized to mitigate hypoglycemia in dialysis [^111sNXSU] [^11377zRY].

> Final recommendation: The preferred first-line medication for type 2 diabetes in patients with ESRD on dialysis is a GLP-1 receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit (e.g., dulaglutide, semaglutide, or liraglutide), given their efficacy, low hypoglycemia risk, and supportive evidence and guidance in advanced CKD/ESRD; if a GLP-1 RA is not tolerated, consider linagliptin or carefully selected insulin as alternatives, with shared decision-making about route, tolerability, and goals of therapy [^114Qx47f] [^114ABhCz] [^111sNXSU].

---

For patients with type 2 diabetes and ESRD on dialysis, **metformin is contraindicated** and **SGLT2 inhibitors are not recommended** due to limited efficacy and safety concerns [^1111tfiL] [^112La1Bp]. The preferred first-line therapy is a **GLP-1 receptor agonist** (e.g. dulaglutide, semaglutide, or liraglutide) because it lowers A1C, reduces hypoglycemia risk, and provides cardiovascular benefit without dose adjustment in dialysis [^114Qx47f] [^114ABhCz]. If GLP-1 RAs are not tolerated or unavailable, insulin is the next best option, with careful dosing to minimize hypoglycemia [^115Kmypy]. DPP-4 inhibitors (e.g. linagliptin) are alternatives when GLP-1 RAs and insulin are unsuitable, though evidence in dialysis is limited [^111sNXSU] [^114PYLBT].

---

## Pharmacological considerations in ESRD

Patients with ESRD on dialysis have unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations, including:

- **Altered drug clearance**: Many medications are cleared renally, necessitating dose adjustments or avoidance in ESRD [^113sHgHn].
- **Increased hypoglycemia risk**: Impaired renal gluconeogenesis and altered insulin metabolism increase hypoglycemia risk [^111sLEHu].
- **Limited evidence**: Many antihyperglycemic agents lack robust evidence in ESRD, complicating treatment decisions [^11377zRY].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Recent guidelines from major diabetes and nephrology organizations provide clear recommendations for managing T2DM in ESRD:

| **Organization** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ADA 2025 | - GLP-1 RAs are preferred in advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), including dialysis, due to lower hypoglycemia risk and cardiovascular benefits [^114Qx47f] [^112aU6uk] |
| KDIGO 2022 | - GLP-1 RAs are recommended when metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors are not tolerated or contraindicated, with no dose adjustment required for most agents [^113Ne721] [^114ABhCz] |
| VA/DoD 2023 | - GLP-1 RAs with proven cardiovascular benefits are recommended for patients with CKD who cannot use SGLT2 inhibitors [^112MMxZH] |

---

## Evidence supporting GLP-1 receptor agonists

GLP-1 RAs have **several advantages** in ESRD:

- **Glycemic control**: Effective A1C reduction without significant hypoglycemia risk [^113gbWkP].
- **Cardiovascular benefits**: Reduced cardiovascular events, a critical consideration given the high CVD risk in ESRD [^114xpm6o].
- **No dose adjustment**: Most GLP-1 RAs (e.g. dulaglutide, semaglutide, liraglutide) do not require dose adjustment in dialysis patients [^114ABhCz].

Clinical trials and real-world studies demonstrate the **safety and efficacy** of GLP-1 RAs in ESRD, with manageable gastrointestinal side effects and no significant increase in hypoglycemia [^113gbWkP] [^114xpm6o].

---

## Alternative pharmacological options

While GLP-1 RAs are preferred, **alternative options** include:

- **Insulin**: Basal insulin is commonly used, but requires careful dosing due to hypoglycemia risk [^115Kmypy].
- **DPP-4 inhibitors**: Linagliptin does not require dose adjustment and can be considered if GLP-1 RAs are not tolerated, though evidence in dialysis is limited [^111sNXSU] [^114PYLBT].
- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Generally not recommended in dialysis due to limited efficacy and safety concerns, though ongoing research may clarify their role [^112La1Bp] [^113x77Da].

---

## Medications to avoid or use with caution

Certain medications should be **avoided or used with caution** in ESRD:

- **Metformin**: Contraindicated due to risk of lactic acidosis [^1111tfiL].
- **Sulfonylureas**: Increased hypoglycemia risk; if used, glipizide is preferred with careful monitoring [^116C1uHH].
- **Thiazolidinediones**: Limited evidence and potential for fluid retention; use with caution [^1114sMd7].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

Given the current evidence and guidelines, the following **practical approach** is recommended:

- **First-line therapy**: GLP-1 RAs (dulaglutide, semaglutide, or liraglutide) are preferred due to efficacy, safety, and cardiovascular benefits [^114Qx47f] [^112aU6uk].
- **Second-line therapy**: Insulin, with careful dosing and monitoring to minimize hypoglycemia [^115Kmypy].
- **Alternative therapy**: Linagliptin if GLP-1 RAs and insulin are not suitable [^notfound].
- **Regular monitoring**: Frequent glucose monitoring and individualized A1C targets are essential given the limitations of A1C in ESRD [^1111tfiL].

---

GLP-1 receptor agonists are the **preferred first-line therapy** for patients with T2DM and ESRD on dialysis, offering effective glycemic control, cardiovascular benefits, and a favorable safety profile without dose adjustment. Insulin and linagliptin are alternatives when GLP-1 RAs are not tolerated or available.

### Could metformin be used in patients with diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease? [^111xtg5n]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes is an important cause of end stage renal failure worldwide. As renal impairment progresses, managing hyperglycaemia can prove increasingly challenging, as many medications are contra-indicated in moderate to severe renal impairment. Whilst evidence for tight glycaemic control reducing progression to renal failure in patients with established renal disease is limited, poor glycaemic control is not desirable, and is likely to lead to progressive complications. Metformin is a first-line therapy in patients with Type 2 diabetes, as it appears to be effective in reducing diabetes related end points and mortality in overweight patients. Cessation of metformin in patients with progressive renal disease may not only lead to deterioration in glucose control, but also to loss of protection from cardiovascular disease in a cohort of patients at particularly high risk. We advocate the need for further study to determine the role of metformin in patients with severe renal disease (chronic kidney disease stage 4–5), as well as patients on dialysis, or pre-/peri-renal transplantation. We explore possible roles of metformin in these circumstances, and suggest potential key areas for further study.

### Dialysis modality choice in diabetic patients with end-stage kidney disease: a systematic review of the available evidence [^112qckDP]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Because of conflicting results in observational studies, it is still subject to debate whether in diabetic patients the dialysis modality selected as first treatment (haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) may have a major impact on outcomes. We therefore aimed at performing a systematic review of the available evidence.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched until February 2014 for English-language articles without time or methodology restrictions by highly sensitive search strategies focused on diabetes, end-stage kidney disease and dialysis modality. Selection of relevant studies, data extraction and analysis were performed by two independent reviewers.

Results

Twenty-five observational studies (23 on incident and 2 on prevalent cohorts) were included in this review. Mortality was the only main outcome addressed in large cohorts. When considering patient survival, results were inconsistent and varied across study designs, follow-up period and subgroups. We therefore found no evidence-based arguments in favour or against a particular dialysis modality as first choice treatment in patients with diabetes and ESKD. However, peritoneal dialysis (PD) as first choice seems to convey a higher risk of death in elderly and frail patients.

Conclusions

The available evidence derived from observational studies is inconsistent. Therefore evidence-based arguments indicating that HD or PD as first treatment may improve patient-centred outcomes in diabetics with ESKD are lacking. In the absence of such evidence, modality selection should be governed by patient preference, after unbiased patient information.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^1166XBdv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care guidelines

In 2008, the first ADA and European Association of the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus guidelines on management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes stated that metformin, along with lifestyle interventions, should be used as first-line therapy. While the guidelines of pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes in the United States have largely remained the same, recent updates in 2019 and 2020 have added additional components in light of compelling data from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials. According to the ADA 2020 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, metformin remains the preferred first-line pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated by the patient. Other glucose-lowering agents may be added to metformin considering patient preferences, hypoglycemic risk, and comorbidities.

While the ADA still recommends metformin as first-line therapy, the updated Standards of Care have become more outcomes-focused rather than solely concentrating on glycemic control. For this reason, in patients with certain comorbidities such as high-risk for or established ASCVD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease, it is recommended to consider GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c or individualized HbA1c target. In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology, in collaboration with the EASD, went one step further in altering their treatment guidelines. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are now recommended as first-line therapy for patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk in Europe. Metformin should be considered as the first line in patients without CVD and at moderate cardiovascular risk.

### Management of type 2 diabetes in chronic kidney disease [^113AA48h]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines emphasize individualized HbA1c targets (table 1). The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Diabetes Work Group recommends a target HbA1c range from < 6.5% to < 8% in non-dialysis-dependent DKD. The American Diabetes Association does not make a specific HbA1c recommendation for patients with kidney disease but recommends a target of < 7% for most patients and < 8% for patients with a limited life expectancy or high risk of complications. For example, an intensive HbA1c target would benefit a younger patient with early-stage CKD and no cardiovascular complications. Whereas an intensive HbA1c target would pose greater risk than benefit for an elderly patient with advanced-stage CKD, cardiovascular complications, and risk of hypoglycemia.

### Management of type 2 diabetes in chronic kidney disease [^114pjSNx]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

The management of patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) encompasses lifestyle modifications, glycemic control with individualized HbA1c targets, and cardiovascular disease risk reduction. Metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors are first-line agents. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are second-line agents. The use of other antidiabetic agents should consider patient preferences, comorbidities, drug costs, and the risk of hypoglycemia. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors are strongly recommended for patients with diabetes, hypertension, and albuminuria. Non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which pose less risk of hyperkalemia than steroidal agents, are undergoing further evaluation among patients with diabetic kidney disease. Here, we discuss important advancements in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

### Antidiabetic therapy in end-stage renal disease [^11377zRY]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

There has been substantial growth in the variety of available antidiabetic agents during the last decade and a half. The role of these newer agents in patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population, and their relative benefits and risks in this population compared to patients without ESRD are not yet clear. This stems from the altered state of glucose homeostasis in ESRD, which places patients at high risk for hypoglycemia and, in certain situations, hyperglycemia. In addition, there is a dearth of evidence to support a benefit of tight glycemic control on either micro- or macrovascular outcomes in ESRD patients; furthermore, the metrics by which glycemic control is conventionally measured are less valid in ESRD. In this review, we will discuss noninsulin and insulin-based therapies as well as unique challenges, contraindications, advantages, and disadvantages to their use in ESRD. We will also review issues pertinent to both hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.

Renal

The benefit of SU use for microvascular outcomes was initially demonstrated by the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS 33) trial, which compared the effects of intensive (N = 2729) versus conventional (N = 1138) glucose control over a 10-year period in newly diagnosed T2D patients. The trial found that intensive treatment with glibenclamide decreased the risk of microvascular complications by 25% (p = 0.0099). Renal safety upon SU use is of particular interest in the Middle East and the GCC region since they have a high prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk factors, and yet the epidemiology is largely understudied and underestimated. So far, the ADVANCE trial has provided evidence that the long-term intensive use of gliclazide prevents ESKD, and real-time observational data indicate that it even confers additional protection from renal complications compared to other SUs (glimepiride in particular) in certain populations. This benefit was still seen after 6 years of follow-up, at which point it showed significant protection against end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34–0.85; p = 0.007). As diabetes is a major risk factor for CKD, specialized expert groups such as the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) team, with the endorsement of both ADA and EASD, recommend that glycemic management for T2D patients with CKD should involve a combination of metformin and a SGLT-2 inhibitor as first-line therapy, with other drugs such as SUs considered only when additional therapies are needed for optimum glycemic control. It is worth mentioning that SGLT-2 inhibitor use is restricted in patients with renal failure, in which case GLP-1 receptor agonists are considered (down to an eGFR of 15 ml/ml). Among SUs, KDIGO prefers glipizide for patients under dialysis, since it is largely metabolized in the liver and poses a lower hypoglycemic risk compared to other SUs. Other groups such as the Association of British Clinical Diabetologists (ABCD) only recommend the use of one SU, gliclazide, and only at a low dose with constant monitoring, given that T2D patients with CKD are at higher risk for severe hypoglycemia. Furthermore, they do not recommend SU use in T2D patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and complicated glycemic control due to fluctuating insulin resistance and metabolism. In advanced CKD (stage 4 and stage 5, or eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m2), reduced kidney clearance of insulin can lower or eliminated insulin needs, but glycemic control remains challenging. This article reviews optimal glycemic targets, monitoring, and current therapeutic recommendations for patients with severe CKD or on dialysis, addressing the lack of efficacy data for many antihyperglycemics in this population.

### Long-term safety and effectiveness of linagliptin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes and renal dysfunction: a post-marketing surveillance study [^113Nb9K5]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2017, the International Diabetes Federation reported that there were an estimated 7.2 million people in Japan (7.7% of the population) with diabetes and that Japan had the fifth largest diabetes-related healthcare expenditure in the world. Because type 2 diabetes (T2D) is responsible for the majority of diabetes cases in Japan, management of this disease has been designated a healthcare priority by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan.

The Japan Diabetes Society recommends monotherapy with an oral antidiabetic drug, insulin or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist as first-line pharmacological treatment for T2D. If monotherapy fails, the recommendation is that combination therapy should be initiated.

T2D is often associated with impaired renal function, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of < 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2, which corresponds to chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 2–5 according to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines. T2D is one of the leading causes of end-stage renal disease. In 2013, diabetic nephropathy was the most common primary disease in patients on dialysis in Japan, with 43.8% of patients starting dialysis due to this condition.

### Diabetic kidney disease: update on clinical management and non-glycaemic effects of newer medications for type 2 diabetes [^115HQiwg]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

DPP-4 inhibitors

First line therapy for type 2 diabetes is usually metformin, which has a long confirmed cardiovascular risk profile, but over the past 15 years DPP-4 inhibitors have been used in preference in patients intolerant of metformin, and those with stage 4 or worse CKD, and very often as add-on therapy when a second glucose-lowering agent is required. DPP-4 is an enzyme expressed on most cell types that deactivates bioactive peptides including GLP-1.GLP-1 stimulates the pancreatic secretion of insulin and reduces glucagon secretion, and hence inhibition of DPP-4 enhances glycaemic control. In a pooled analysis of RCTs encompassing 5466 patients that examined the effect of linagliptin versus placebo on renal end points (incidence of new albuminuria, deteriorating renal function, halving of eGFR and acute kidney injury), linagliptin significantly reduced the overall renal event hazard by 16%, but this was largely due to the effect on incident albuminuria as reduction in renal function, halving of eGFR and acute renal failure were comparable in both groups. The Saxaliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 53 Trial (SAVOR-TIMI 53) randomly assigned 16,492 patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk and varying renal function to treatment with saxagliptin or placebo and followed them for a median of 2.1 years. Saxagliptin did not confer any cardiovascular event benefit but an analysis of renal outcomes showed that saxagliptin was associated with an improvement in albuminuria for all baseline albuminuria categories. The change in albuminuria did not correlate with HbA1c. There was no difference between the groups in terms of change in eGFR, doubling of creatinine or initiation of renal replacement therapy. The Cardiovascular and Renal Microvascular Outcome Study with Linagliptin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (CARMELINA) is the most recent RCT comparing the addition of linagliptin versus placebo in patients at high risk of both cardiovascular disease and CKD, and it had primary cardiovascular and secondary renal end points;74% of patients had CKD and 43% had an eGFR of < 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Linagliptin was non-inferior to placebo in terms of cardiovascular events and there was no signal that it increased heart failure, important as this end point had previously been highlighted as a concern with DPP-4 inhibitors as a class. Linagliptin was again shown to reduce the progression of albuminuria but had no effect on other renal outcomes.

### Efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes and ESRD receiving dialysis: a 54-week randomized trial [^114PYLBT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment with oral antihyperglycemic agents has not been well characterized in patients with type 2 diabetes and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The efficacy and safety of sitagliptin and glipizide monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and ESRD on dialysis therapy were assessed in this study.

Study Design

54-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm study.

Setting & Participants

From 31 clinical sites in 12 countries, 129 patients 30 years or older with type 2 diabetes and ESRD who were on dialysis therapy and had a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 7%-9% were randomly assigned 1:1 to treatment.

Intervention

Monotherapy with sitagliptin, 25 mg daily or glipizide (initiated with 2.5 mg daily and titrated up to a potential maximum dose of 10 mg twice daily or down to avoid hypoglycemia).

Outcomes

Primary end points were 54-week change in HbA1c level from baseline and tolerability with sitagliptin. A secondary end point was the comparison of sitagliptin versus glipizide on the incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia.

Results

Of 129 patients randomly assigned, 64 were in the sitagliptin group (mean baseline age, 61 years; HbA1c, 7.9%) and 65 were in the glipizide group (mean baseline age, 59 years; HbA1c, 7.8%). After 54 weeks, the least squares mean change from baseline in HbA1c level was -0.72% (95% CI, -0.95% to -0.48%) with sitagliptin and -0.87% (95% CI, -1.11% to -0.63%) with glipizide, for a difference of 0.15% (95% CI, -0.18% to 0.49%). The incidences of symptomatic hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemia were 6.3% versus 10.8% (between-group difference, -4.8% [95% CI, -15.7% to 5.6%]) and 0% versus 7.7% (between-group difference, -7.8% [95% CI, -17.1% to -1.9%]) in the sitagliptin and glipizide groups, respectively. Higher incidences (ie, 95% CI around between-treatment difference excluded 0) of cellulitis and headache were found with sitagliptin compared to glipizide (6.3% vs 0%, respectively, for both).

Limitations

Small sample size limits between-group comparisons.

Conclusions

Treatment with sitagliptin or glipizide monotherapy was effective and well tolerated over 54 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes and ESRD who were receiving dialysis.

### Selection and dosing of medications for management of diabetes in patients with advanced kidney disease [^113sHgHn]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a leading cause of kidney disease worldwide. A large and expanding array of treatments for diabetes is available to improve glycemic control, including newer classes of drugs, such as thiazolidinediones and incretin-based therapies. The presence of impaired kidney function with reduced glomerular filtration rate should influence choices, dosing, and monitoring of hypoglycemic agents, as some agents require a dosing adjustment in patients with kidney disease and some are entirely contraindicated.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112TtxQw]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are prioritized based on kidney and cardiovascular benefits: SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for people with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 and type 2 diabetes to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and reduce heart failure risk independent of glucose management, while GLP-1 RAs are suggested for cardiovascular risk reduction if such risk is predominant. Selection of glucose-lowering medications should also consider an individual's cardiovascular and kidney risks, effects on weight, adverse effects, preferences, and cost, and both SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs have shown cardiovascular and kidney protection.

Latest guideline recommendations on the use of SGLT2 inhibitors

Several major clinical practice guidelines have been updated in the past 18 months to reflect the evolving evidence for cardiovascular and kidney protection from SGLT2 trials. Major updates include a joint consensus report from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the EASD, and the ADA Standards of Care. These have been accompanied by a number of statements from other organizations including the American College of Cardiology, ESC, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, Diabetes Canada and European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association.

Most noticeably, guidelines now recommended the selection of agents based on end-organ protection and patient co-morbidities. Most guidelines recommend either SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists as second-line treatment (after metformin) in people with T2DM and a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (i.e. for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events). The ESC–EASD guidelines recommend either an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist in people with T2DM at high or very high risk of cardiovascular disease, irrespective of whether they are treatment naïve or already on metformin.

Given the consistent evidence that SGLT2 inhibition can reduce the risk of hospitalization for HF and kidney disease progression, the ADA–EASD consensus report also recommends the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in people with T2DM and HF or CKD (irrespective of a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease). Based on the results of the CREDENCE trial, the updated 2019 ADA Standards of Care specifically endorse the use of SGLT2 inhibitors for the prevention of kidney failure, cardiovascular events or both in patients with an eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, particularly in those with severely increased albuminuria (Grade A recommendation).

### Metformin-associated risk of acute dialysis in patients with type 2 diabetes: a nationwide cohort study [^115WypVm]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines governing anti-diabetic medications increasingly advocate metformin as first-line therapy in all patients with type 2 diabetes. However, metformin could be associated with increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), acute dialysis and lactate acidosis in marginal patients. In a retrospective nationwide cohort study, a total of 168 443 drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes ≥ 50 years, initiating treatment with either metformin or sulphonyl in Denmark between 2000 and 2012 were included in this study (70.7% initiated treatment with metformin); calculation of 1-year risk of acute dialysis was based on g-standardization of cause-specific Cox regression models for acute dialysis, end-stage renal disease and death. One-year risks of acute dialysis were 92.4 per 100 000 (95% CI, 67.1–121.3) and 142.7 per 100 000 (95% CI, 118.3–168.0) for sulphonylurea and metformin, respectively. The metformin-associated 1-year risk of acute dialysis was increased by 50.3 per 100 000 (95% CI, 7.9–88.6), corresponding to a risk ratio of 1.53 (95% CI, 1.06–2.23), and a number needed to harm of 1988, thus providing evidence of potential concerns pertaining to the increasing use of metformin.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes: guidelines from KDIGO… [^1111tfiL]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Structured diabetes self-management education programs are recommended because they improve self-efficacy and clinical outcomes.
- First-line antiglycemic treatment for type 2 diabetes and CKD with eGFR as low as 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 should include metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor to improve cardiovascular outcomes and limit CKD progression. Glycemic Treatment For people with type 2 diabetes and CKD with an eGFR 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 or higher, metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, in combination, are recommended for first-line medical treatment because they improve glycemic control outcomes. Metformin limits weight gain and reduces cardiovascular events, whereas the SGLT2 inhibitor improves cardiovascular outcomes and limits kidney disease progression. Metformin is safe in patients with an eGFR above 45 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 unless risk for acute kidney injury is high.

The dose of metformin should be reduced when eGFR is less than 45 mL per minute per 1.73 m² and discontinued when eGFR is less than 30 mL per minute per

1.73 m² or in people treated with dialysis. The guidelines recommend treatment with a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes who have not achieved glycemic goals despite use of metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor or who are unable to use those medications. Some of the GLP-1 receptor agonists have a beneficial effect in reducing cardiovascular events. GLP-1 receptor agonist trials are safe with an eGFR as low as 15 mL per minute per 1. 73 m. 2, where they appear to reduce albuminuria and preserve eGFR. They should not be prescribed with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. They can be used with a sulfonylurea or insulin, although the doses of these medications may need to be reduced.

Summary and practical use of anti-diabetic therapies in patients with CKD

The results of the RCTs involving SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-RAs in particular have strengthened the available therapeutic possibilities for treating patients with CKD (Table 2). The combination of improvements in cardiovascular risk and in renal outcomes has led to earlier prioritisation for the introduction of these anti-diabetic classes in the treatment algorithm for diabetes patients. The fact that GLP-RAs can be used in patients with stage 4 CKD, a stage in which metformin cannot be used, is a huge advantage for nephrologists, and the emerging guidance enabling the introduction of canagliflozin throughout the stage 3 CKD continuum is of equal importance. One or other of these anti-diabetic classes should now be first choice for introduction with or after metformin, or in place of it in those intolerant, in patients with diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk or CKD, and in preference to other classes of therapy such as DPP-4 inhibitors or sulphonylureas. Based on the new evidence both the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the study of Diabetes (EASD) published a consensus in 2018 on the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. For patients with type 2 diabetes and existing cardiovascular disease they now advise the use of either an SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 agonist with confirmed cardiovascular benefit, and for those with CKD or clinical heart failure with confirmed atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease the recommendation is the early use of an SGLT-2 inhibitor with confirmed benefit.

Monotherapy in patients with renal impairment

To explore the clinical use of SAXA in patients with renal impairment, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled 12-week study conducted to the assess the efficacy and safety of SAXA 2.5 mg/day in adult patients with T2DM, HbA 1c 7%-11%, and moderate (estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 0.50 to < 0.84 mL/s) to severe (creatinine clearance < 0.50 mL/s) renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with hemodialysis. Patients (96%) continued background oral antidiabetic (32%) and/or insulin (74%) therapy as prescribed. The results, which were presented by Nowicki et al at ADA, showed that the overall mean reduction in HbA 1c from baseline to week 12 for patients with renal impairment was significantly greater with SAXA versus placebo. Subgroup results by baseline renal impairment category showed numerically greater reductions in HbA 1c with SAXA versus placebo in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, while the HbA 1c reduction in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis was similar between the treatment groups. SAXA was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to placebo (adverse events were experienced by 57.6% of patients in the SAXA group, compared with 54.1% in the placebo group; hypoglycemia was reported in 20.0% of SAXA patients vs 22.4% of placebo patients). Based on these results, SAXA could also be considered as the antidiabetic drug in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, where insulin is usually the drug of choice and MET is contraindicated, although it is not recommended for patients with ESRD on hemodialysis.

### Metformin monotherapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1131Kq7F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, there is an increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Metformin is still the recommended first-line glucose-lowering drug for people with T2DM. Despite this, the effects of metformin on patient-important outcomes are still not clarified.

Objectives

To assess the effects of metformin monotherapy in adults with T2DM.

Search Methods

We based our search on a systematic report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and topped-up the search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, we searched the reference lists of included trials and systematic reviews, as well as health technology assessment reports and medical agencies. The date of the last search for all databases was 2 December 2019, except Embase (searched up 28 April 2017).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least one year's duration comparing metformin monotherapy with no intervention, behaviour changing interventions or other glucose-lowering drugs in adults with T2DM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles/records, assessed risk of bias, and extracted outcome data independently. We resolved discrepancies by involvement of a third review author. For meta-analyses we used a random-effects model with investigation of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence by using the GRADE instrument.

Main Results

We included 18 RCTs with multiple study arms (N = 10,680). The percentage of participants finishing the trials was approximately 58% in all groups. Treatment duration ranged from one to 10.7 years. We judged no trials to be at low risk of bias on all 'Risk of bias' domains. The main outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events (SAEs), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), cardiovascular mortality (CVM), non-fatal myocardial infarction (NFMI), non-fatal stroke (NFS), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Two trials compared metformin (N = 370) with insulin (N = 454). Neither trial reported on all-cause mortality, SAE, CVM, NFMI, NFS or ESRD. One trial provided information on HRQoL but did not show a substantial difference between the interventions. Seven trials compared metformin with sulphonylureas. Four trials reported on all-cause mortality: in three trials no participant died, and in the remaining trial 31/1454 participants (2.1%) in the metformin group died compared with 31/1441 participants (2.2%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Three trials reported on SAE: in two trials no SAE occurred (186 participants); in the other trial 331/1454 participants (22.8%) in the metformin group experienced a SAE compared with 308/1441 participants (21.4%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Two trials reported on CVM: in one trial no CVM was observed and in the other trial 4/1441 participants (0.3%) in the metformin group died of cardiovascular reasons compared with 8/1447 participants (0.6%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Three trials reported on NFMI: in two trials no NFMI occurred, and in the other trial 21/1454 participants (1.4%) in the metformin group experienced a NFMI compared with 15/1441 participants (1.0%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). One trial reported no NFS occurred (very low-certainty evidence). No trial reported on HRQoL or ESRD. Seven trials compared metformin with thiazolidinediones (very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes). Five trials reported on all-cause mortality: in two trials no participant died; the overall RR was 0.88, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.39; P = 0.57; 5 trials; 4402 participants). Four trials reported on SAE, the RR was 0,95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; P = 0.49; 3208 participants. Four trials reported on CVM, the RR was 0.71, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.39; P = 0.58; 3211 participants. Three trial reported on NFMI: in two trials no NFMI occurred and in one trial 21/1454 participants (1.4%) in the metformin group experienced a NFMI compared with 25/1456 participants (1.7%) in the thiazolidinedione group. One trial reported no NFS occurred. No trial reported on HRQoL or ESRD. Three trials compared metformin with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (one trial each with saxagliptin, sitagliptin, vildagliptin with altogether 1977 participants). There was no substantial difference between the interventions for all-cause mortality, SAE, CVM, NFMI and NFS (very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes). One trial compared metformin with a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue (very low-certainty evidence for all reported outcomes). There was no substantial difference between the interventions for all-cause mortality, CVM, NFMI and NFS. One or more SAEs were reported in 16/268 (6.0%) of the participants allocated to metformin compared with 35/539 (6.5%) of the participants allocated to a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue. HRQoL or ESRD were not reported. One trial compared metformin with meglitinide and two trials compared metformin with no intervention. No deaths or SAEs occurred (very low-certainty evidence) no other patient-important outcomes were reported. No trial compared metformin with placebo or a behaviour changing interventions. Four ongoing trials with 5824 participants are likely to report one or more of our outcomes of interest and are estimated to be completed between 2018 and 2024. Furthermore, 24 trials with 2369 participants are awaiting assessment.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no clear evidence whether metformin monotherapy compared with no intervention, behaviour changing interventions or other glucose-lowering drugs influences patient-important outcomes.

### Who does not need a statin: too late in end-stage renal disease or heart failure? [^117Aq7Gg]. Heart (2008). Low credibility.

Current guidelines from large randomised trials recommend that all patients with diabetes type 2 or coronary artery disease after myocardial infarction should be treated with statin drugs. However, the recent 4D and CORONA trials show no improvement in mortality in elderly patients with ischaemic heart failure and patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease receiving haemodialysis with the onset of statin treatment. The survival benefit from statin treatment appears to stem primarily from the prevention of progression of coronary artery disease. In clinical conditions where coronary artery disease does not significantly contribute to the cause of death statins seem to be less effective. In patients at risk for organ damage, statin treatment, therefore, has to be started early in the course of the disease. The effect of statin withdrawal in ischaemic heart failure or in patients with advanced renal disease is not known. On the basis of the available evidence, current statin treatment should not be stopped in these patients.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist use in people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease: a narrative review of the key evidence with practical considerations [^114ABhCz]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The Lancet Commission on Diabetes recently performed a comprehensive analysis of available data on diabetes care to provide a summary of the best evidence for effectively managing diabetes. Of the key messages provided in their summary, the commission states that SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA therapies can reduce cardiovascular–renal diseases and all-cause death by up to 40% in people living with T2DM, independently of their effect on lowering blood glucose concentration.

Should a physician decide that a GLP-1 RA would benefit their patient, the next challenge is deciding upon which to prescribe as there are a variety of GLP-1 RAs with regulatory approval in U.S. and European markets, each with different profiles in relation to duration of action (short-acting vs. long-acting), indications (monotherapy and/or combined therapy), timing and ease of dosing, efficacy, and tolerability. The variation in profiles means that GLP-1 RAs can be used for treating most stages of CKD, although as described above, there is an exception for people with ESRD (< 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2 or on dialysis) that is dependent on the prescribing information set by regulators. According to the U.S. and European prescribing information, the majority of GLP-1 RAs can be used without dose adjustments in people with mild (eGFR 60–89 ml/min/1.73 m 2) or moderate (eGFR 30–59 ml/min/1.73 m²) renal impairment. The use of exenatide and its analog, lixisenatide, both GLP-1RAs that cannot be metabolized in circulation and must be cleared renally, is more restricted depending on the CKD grade and prescribing information set by regulators. Currently, dulaglutide, semaglutide, and liraglutide are the only GLP-1 RAs recommended by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) without any dose adjustment in people living with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2). Figure 5 summarizes the use of GLP-1 RAs in people with renal impairment that is based on either the FDA-approved U.S. prescribing information or the EMA-approved summary of product characteristics.

### Thiazolidinediones for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes [^1114sMd7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD), and it affects quality of life and contributes to substantial costs for healthcare systems. Approximately a third of people with type 2 diabetes develop CKD. Thiazolidinediones are associated with improved glucose management and a lower risk of progression to kidney failure, requiring long-term dialysis. However, evidence of safety in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes is still lacking and is based on low-certainty studies.

Objectives

This review aims to assess the benefits and harms of thiazolidinediones in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies was searched up to October 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled studies were eligible if they compared treatment with thiazolidinediones against placebo, usual medical care or another glucose-lowering agent in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes. We included all CKD stages (from 1 to 5), including people treated with dialysis.

Outcomes

The critical outcomes included cardiovascular death and severe hypoglycaemia. The important outcomes included death (any cause), 3-point and 4-point major cardiovascular events (MACE), non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, kidney failure requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT), and adverse events.

Risk Of Bias

Three authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the Risk of Bias 2 tool.

Synthesis Methods

Pooled analyses using summary estimates of effects were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Included Studies

Eighty-five studies involving 3044 participants were included. The median age was 62 years, and the median follow-up was 24 weeks; one study included children. Five studies were conducted in people with CKD stages 1 and 2, six studies in people with CKD stages 3 to 5, seven studies in people on dialysis, and the remaining studies included people with both CKD stages 1 and 2 and CKD stages 3 to 5. Overall, the risks of bias in the included studies for all critical outcomes in studies that compared thiazolidinediones to placebo or standard care alone were high due to concerns about blinding. The overall risk of bias for cardiovascular death reported in studies that compared thiazolidinediones to placebo or standard care alone was assessed as low or uncertain, except for two studies that were considered at high risk of bias due to concerns about lack of blinding, whilst other domains seemed to be free from other sources of bias. Two studies reported severe hypoglycaemia: one study was assessed as unclear risk of bias for all the risk of bias domains, while the other study was considered at high risk of bias due to concerns about lack of blinding. Other critical outcomes, including 3-and 4-point MACE, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or kidney failure requiring KRT were not reported in the included studies.

Synthesis Of Results

Compared to placebo or standard care alone, thiazolidinediones may have little or no effect on the risk of cardiovascular death (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.97; 4 studies, 226 participants; low-certainty evidence), whilst the effect of severe hypoglycaemia was not estimable (2 studies, 107 participants) in people with all CKD stages and type 2 diabetes. No study evaluated the effects of 3- and 4-point MACE, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or kidney failure requiring KRT. Compared to sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular death (RR 2.78, 95% CI 0.11 to 67.92; 4 studies, 483 participants; low-certainty evidence) in people with CKD stages 1 and 2 and type 2 diabetes, but no study evaluated the effects of severe hypoglycaemia, 3- and 4-point MACE, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or kidney failure requiring KRT. The effects of thiazolidinediones compared to other hypoglycaemic agents or different doses of thiazolidinediones were uncertain. The risk of bias in the included studies was high or unclear, leading to low to very low-certainty evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

Thiazolidinediones may have little or no effect on the risk of cardiovascular death, whilst the effects of severe hypoglycaemia or other cardiovascular and kidney outcomes were uncertain in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes. The effects of thiazolidinediones in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes are insufficient to provide firm conclusions. Future studies will address the benefits and harms of thiazolidinediones in this setting, reporting the core outcomes as prioritised by stakeholders to better inform decision-making.

### Trends in prescribing preferences for antidiabetic medications among patients with type 2 diabetes in the U.K. with and without chronic kidney disease, 2006–2020 [^11597PKt]. Diabetes Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate trends in antidiabetic medication initiation patterns among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Research Design and Methods

A retrospective cohort study using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (2006–2020) was conducted to evaluate the overall, first-, and second line (after metformin) medication initiation patterns among patients with CKD (n = 38,622) and those without CKD (n = 230,963) who had T2DM.

Results

Relative to other glucose-lowering therapies, metformin initiations declined overall but remained the first-line treatment of choice for both patients with and those without CKD. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2i) use increased modestly among patients with CKD, but this increase was more pronounced among patients without CKD; by 2020, patients without CKD, compared with patients with CKD, were three (28.5% vs. 9.4%) and six (46.3% vs. 7.9%) times more likely to initiate SGLT2i overall and as second-line therapy, respectively. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) use was minimal regardless of CKD status (< 5%), whereas both dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i) and sulfonylurea use remained high among patients with CKD. For instance, by 2020, and among patients with CKD, DPP4i and sulfonylureas constituted 28.3% and 20.6% of all initiations, and 57.4% and 30.3% of second-line initiations, respectively.

Conclusions

SGLT2i use increased among patients with T2DM, but this increase was largely driven by patients without CKD. Work is needed to identify barriers associated with the uptake of therapies with proven cardiorenal benefits (e.g. SGLT2i, GLP-1RA) among patients with CKD.

Guideline 2 — Management of hyperglycemia and general diabetes care in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — research recommendations emphasize determining effects of glycemic control on early and late GFR loss and health outcomes of CKD, including evaluating different levels of glycemic control to optimize safety and clinical outcomes such as survival, hospitalization, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in advanced CKD and/or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). They also propose performing validation studies of HbA1c, glycated albumin, and other long-term glycemic markers in patients with diabetes and various stages of CKD, and assessing metformin safety in CKD stages 4 and 5.

### Moderate-to high-intensity statins for secondary prevention in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on dialysis after acute myocardial infarction [^116MZd6A]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is considered as an equivalent of coronary heart disease, with a twofold higher mortality rate than those without T2DM. Among patients with T2DM, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a predominant independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death. The risk for premature CVD is increased by 25–30% in early-stage CKD, and 30- to 50-fold higher in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) than in people with normal renal function. The complications of CVD are a leading cause of deaths in patients with T2DM and ESRD, accounting for about 50% of all-cause mortality.

Numerous trials of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have shown benefits of primary or secondary prevention for CVD in patients not receiving dialysis. Current evidence indicates that moderate- to high-intensity statins should be initiated if patients not receiving dialysis have clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) such as acute coronary syndromes. Nevertheless, for patients on dialysis, guidelines of the 2013 kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) and the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) work groups advise that statins treatment should not be administered routinely, because the results of major trials such as the Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse (4-D), a study to evaluate the use of rosuvastatin in subjects on regular hemodialysis: an assessment of survival and cardiovascular events (AURORA), and the study of heart and renal protection (SHARP), revealed no definite clinical benefits with statins treatment in patients on dialysis. However, one caveat to be considered in the implementation of these guidelines is that patients with recent acute coronary syndrome who may be considered for statins treatment were typically excluded from previous clinical trials. Moreover, secondary outcomes in the 4-D study showed significant 18% reductions in the rate of combined cardiac events (hazard ratio [HR].82; 95% confidence interval [CI].68–.99). Post-hoc analysis of the AURORA trial found that rosuvastatin significantly reduced rates of cardiac events (including cardiac death and non-fatal myocardial infarction) by 32% (HR.68; 95% CI.51–.90) in diabetic patients.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) globally. People with T2D have a high prevalence and incidence of CKD, which presents an increased risk of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and death. Cardiovascular complications are an especially relevant concern for individuals with both diabetes and CKD. The treatment approach for people with CKD is multidisciplinary, with the aim being primarily to slow the progression of disease to avoid dialysis or kidney transplantation and secondarily to reduce the cardiovascular risk that accompanies CKD. Currently available therapies with demonstrated benefits on cardiovascular events and kidney outcomes among patients with T2D include sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (ns-MRAs). Among the latter class, finerenone is the drug with more robust and well-documented evidence supporting cardiovascular and kidney benefits among patients with CKD and T2D; finerenone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2022 specifically to prevent CKD disease progression and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD associated with T2D.

The 2022 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines recommend SGLT2i as first-line therapy as part of a comprehensive management approach for people with T2D and CKD with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. A growing body of clinical trial evidence suggests a protective effect of GLP-1 RA on cardiorenal outcomes compared with placebo or with standard of care; indeed, the first GLP-1 RA was recently approved by the US FDA for reducing the risk of worsening kidney disease and cardiovascular death in patients with T2D and CKD. While KDIGO guidelines do not explicitly recommend the use of GLP-1 RA as first-line therapy for CKD in T2D, KDIGO's comprehensive risk reduction strategy includes GLP-1 RA as an additional therapy option for patients at risk of insufficient glycemic control. Systematic reviews and network meta-analyses of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i in patients with T2D concluded that both medication classes have cardiovascular and kidney benefits but with notable differences in benefits and harms.

Metformin has been used as a first‐line oral drug for people with type 2 diabetes for over 60 years. The dose of metformin should be decreased to 500 mg twice a day if eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and omitted in the majority of circumstances if eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Of note limitations of eGFR measurements need to be appreciated especially in those at extremes of body weight and individualised treatment decisions may need to be considered in people with eGFR 25–30 mL/min/1.73 m².

The guidelines acknowledge that there is a lack of high‐quality clinical trial evidence for the use of metformin as a cardio‐renal protective agent in people with CKD but in most countries worldwide it remains the most widely used first‐line agent for type 2 diabetes.

### Approach to the patient with type 2 diabetes and progressive kidney disease [^116DpqXk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease in the United States. The management of patients with type 2 diabetes and progressive kidney disease requires a comprehensive approach that includes aggressive blood pressure control with agents that also lower urinary protein excretion and optimization of glucose and lipid control while remaining cognizant of the therapeutic limitations imparted by renal dysfunction. Clinicians must also address the comorbidities associated with renal failure such as anemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Diabetic nephropathy typically follows a slowly progressive course from albuminuria to azotemia. Consequently, optimal care includes planning for the management of impending renal failure long before the patient requires dialysis or transplantation.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of linagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes and severe renal impairment: a 1-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^111sNXSU]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetes, predominantly type 2, is reaching epidemic proportions, with global prevalence estimated to increase from 8.3%, affecting 366 million adults in 2011, to 9.9% or 552 million adults, by 2030. Concurrent with this increase, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising worldwide. Diabetes has been identified as the leading cause of CKD, which may progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or increase the risk of death. This association represents an increasing burden for patients and health care systems, particularly in developing countries.

Standards of diabetes care recommend reducing the risk, or slowing the progression, of CKD by optimizing glycemic control. However, most drugs available to treat hyperglycemia are affected by kidney function and should therefore be either avoided or used at reduced doses in patients with CKD. Consequently, there is a great need to focus on optimal diabetes management in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are one of the latest therapeutic classes of glucose-lowering medications. Within this class, linagliptin uniquely has a primarily nonrenal route of elimination, with only ∼5% of the dose being excreted via the kidneys. This contrasts with other DPP-4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, and alogliptin that are predominantly cleared by renal excretion. Thus, linagliptin needs no dose adjustment in patients with impaired renal function. Dose adjustment is recommended for sitagliptin, saxagliptin, and vildagliptin in patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min, including those with ESRD requiring dialysis.

Previous clinical studies have shown that linagliptin achieves clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes either as monotherapy or in combination with metformin, metformin/sulfonylurea, or a thiazolidinedione. Those studies demonstrated the overall safety and tolerability of linagliptin. The objective of this study was to investigate the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of linagliptin compared with placebo when administered in combination with existing glucose-lowering background therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and severe renal impairment (RI) over 52 weeks.

### Evidence-based treatment of hyperglycaemia with incretin therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease [^111sLEHu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

In addition to the difficulties of evaluating HbA1c levels in CKD, specific glycaemic targets for diabetic patients with CKD have not been established. HbA1c levels of ~ 7%, consistent with NKF‐KDOQI guidelines, 19 are recommended if they can be achieved without compromising safety, and most importantly, without increasing the number and severity of episodes of hypoglycaemia. Target HbA1c levels are also uncertain for patients with diabetes on chronic dialysis or with a kidney transplant, and will depend on age, co‐morbidities and the risk of hypoglycaemia. 19, 20 Therefore, the approach to glycaemic management in patients with T2D and advanced CKD should be individualized, taking account of the needs and preferences of each patient, including the presence of co‐morbidities and concomitant therapies. 19

1.3 What are the challenges associated with treating T2D in patients with advanced CKD?

Kidney disease increases the complexity and risks associated with management of T2D. 19 In particular, advanced CKD is an important risk factor for hypoglycaemia, as gluconeogenesis by the kidney is impaired. 21 In addition, hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis are reduced in advanced CKD. 22, 23 The risk of hypoglycaemia in patients with CKD is further increased because the drugs commonly used to treat diabetes in these patients, insulin and sulfonylureas (SUs), are themselves associated with a risk of hypoglycaemia. 17 Many glucose‐lowering drugs, including insulin, undergo clearance by the kidney, and therefore require dose adjustments or are contraindicated in patients with advanced CKD. 19 Thus, choices of glucose‐lowering therapies have been limited for patients with T2D with advanced CKD. 24

1.4 What are the treatment options for patients with T2D and advanced CKD?

Only a few studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of glucose‐lowering drugs in patients with advanced CKD. The number of patients studied with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 is low because these patients are often excluded from clinical trials of glucose‐lowering agents (Table 1). 24 Because cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) follow the approved indications for these agents, this patient population has been under‐represented in the CVOTs (Table 2). 25 There remains a need for effective glucose‐lowering therapies that have shown safety, especially for hypoglycaemia, in patients with T2D and advanced CKD.

The 2022 KDIGO guideline for diabetes management in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) had endorsed the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) for patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes who did not achieve optimal glycemic target with maximally tolerated metformin and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor. Our study revealed the potential benefits of GLP-1RAs in patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney disease possibly owing to pleiotropic effects of the medicine. Nonetheless, pharmacokinetics and dialysis dose were omitted in our subgroup analyses. Herein, we would like to raise our concern regarding neglecting these important confounders in our analyses and the impact to the findings of the study.

### Is there evidence of any safety differences among DPP-4 inhibitors in the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and reduced GFR due to chronic kidney disease? [^115zao1r]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) globally. Multiple risk factor management is essential in such patients to delay the disease progression; however, the management of blood glucose presents a particular challenge, with limited treatment options available beyond exogenous insulin therapy. Patients with T2DM and CKD are at particular risk of hypoglycemia and its adverse consequences. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors provide a simple, oral, glucose-sensitive treatment option that does not increase the risk of hypoglycemia and does not confound the comorbidities that afflict many of the other drugs used to treat T2DM. In addition, DPP-4 inhibitors have been shown to be associated with no further decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) when treating patients with CKD. In recent years, several DPP-4 inhibitors have become available and have been extensively evaluated in patients with T2DM and varying degrees of renal impairment (RI). These studies have demonstrated good efficacy and tolerability of the DPP-4 inhibitor class in these patients, and have subsequently led to regulatory approval for the use in patients with T2DM and reduced eGFR due to CKD. Indeed, only exogenous insulin and DPP-4 inhibitors are indicated and now utilized widely across all thresholds of renal function, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD; Fig. 1).

### Is there evidence of any safety differences among DPP-4 inhibitors in the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and reduced GFR due to chronic kidney disease? [^112ThenX]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Current license recommendations for the marketed DPP-4 inhibitors with respect to renal function are based on extensive pharmacological and clinical trial data and represent the desire to ensure patient exposure to the minimal doses of drug required to ensure clinical efficacy. There is currently, however, no evidence to suggest that should an inadvertently inappropriate dosing of any DPP-4 inhibitor take place in the context of declining renal function translates into either nephrotoxicity or any increased risk of adverse events.

### Should metformin continue as first-line pharmacotherapy… [^111MVbdR]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

This study shifted primarily sulfonylurea-based regimens to metformin-first regimens for the treatment of non–insulin-dependent diabetes. Subsequent studies demonstrating reduced mortality in populations with atherothrombosis or heart failure and its affordable cost further solidified metformin as the preferred initial treatment for diabetes. 5, 6 Metformin is the most commonly prescribed glucose-lowering medication worldwide and the recommended initial pharmacologic option in major clinical guidelines, including those from the International Diabetes Federation, American Association of Clinical Endocrinology, and American College of Physicians. 7–9. During the years the FDA guidance was in effect, two novel classes of medications were developed, studied, and marketed: sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists.

Both have been shown to reduce ASCVD events in patients with type 2 diabetes, leading to questions about whether they should be considered first-line therapy. Empagliflozin was studied in the EMPA-REG trial, in which all participants had established ASCVD. 12 Although treatment showed benefit for the primary composite outcome, the only individual outcome of the composite to show a benefit was cardiovascular death, which was determined by presumed cardiovascular death and worsening heart failure. 17 However, selecting therapy to meet patient goals is the approach every clinician should use for those with type 2 diabetes; this does not automatically exclude the use of metformin. The goals for each patient are different and include considerations such as costs, adverse effects, and administration.

Metformin's established safety and effectiveness at A1C reduction — in addition to its relatively low cost and widespread availability to patients — make it an ideal first-line option for many patients with diabetes. Because of safety concerns, metformin is preferred over other older and inexpensive options such as sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones.
9. Metformin should be included in first-line medication regimens. Whether additional therapies are started concurrently or deferred depends on individual patient goals. Primary care physicians should not overstate the ASCVD benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonist medications.

### Safety and efficacy of liraglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes and end-stage renal disease: an investigator-initiated, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized trial [^113gbWkP]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate parameters related to safety and efficacy of liraglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes and dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Research Design and Methods

Twenty-four patients with type 2 diabetes and ESRD and 23 control subjects with type 2 diabetes and normal kidney function were randomly allocated to 12 weeks of double-blind liraglutide (titrated to a maximum dose of 1.8 mg) or placebo treatment (1:1) injected subcutaneously once daily as add on to ongoing antidiabetic treatment. Dose-corrected plasma trough liraglutide concentration was evaluated at the final trial visit as the primary outcome measure using a linear mixed model.

Results

Twenty patients with ESRD (1:1 for liraglutide vs. placebo) and 20 control subjects (1:1) completed the study period. Dose-corrected plasma trough liraglutide concentration at the final visit was increased by 49% (95% CI 6–109, P = 0.02) in the group with ESRD compared with the control group. Initial and temporary nausea and vomiting occurred more frequently among liraglutide-treated patients with ESRD compared with control subjects (P < 0.04). Glycemic control tended to improve during the study period in both liraglutide-treated groups as assessed by daily blood glucose measurements (P < 0.01), and dose of baseline insulin was reduced in parallel (P < 0.04). Body weight was reduced in both liraglutide-treated groups (-2.4 ± 0.8 kg [mean ± SE] in the group with ESRD, P = 0.22; -2.9 ± 1.0 kg in the control group, P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Plasma liraglutide concentrations increased during treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and ESRD, who experienced more gastrointestinal side effects. Reduced treatment doses and prolonged titration period may be advisable.

However, the KDOQI Work Group believes that there is not enough evidence to suggest that these medications are effective in patients receiving kidney replacement therapy.

### GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2-is to lower glucose and reduce the risk of cardiovascular and diabetic kidney disease [^117RjMBF]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The landscape of diabetes management has changed, such that the goal of pharmacotherapy extends beyond glucose-lowering to prioritize risk reduction of cardiovascular disease and diabetic kidney disease. Two newer classes of medications, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-Is), have become first line therapies for many patients with type 2 diabetes to reduce cardiovascular and renal complications of type 2 diabetes. This review article will describe the mechanism of action, evidence for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, contraindications, adverse effects, and risk mitigation strategies for the GLP-1 RA and SGLT2-I drug classes. In addition, we will provide a practical approach for primary care clinicians to prescribe, adjust, and combine these medication classes, while considering patient preference, tolerability, comorbidities, cost, and availability.

Long-Term Efficacy and Safety

ADVANCE and CAROLINA Studies

Achieving glycemic control is the cornerstone of T2D management, and while metformin remains superior to other oral medications as a first-line monotherapy for T2D, physicians always consider add-on medications when needed, and factors such as long-term efficacy and safety are paramount in the decision-making process. Given the long history of SUs in the market, their risks and benefits are much more extensively documented compared to their successors. The Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial was a clinical trial with a long-term follow-up (> 5 years) that aimed to ascertain the vascular benefits of intensified glucose control (glycated hemoglobin, HbA1c < 6.5%). This landmark study was the largest of its kind, involving 215 collaborating international institutions, and was designed to randomize more than 11,000 T2D patients 55 years and older across regions to either intensive glucose control (including gliclazide modified release, MR) or standard glucose control. The ADVANCE trial proved that, compared to standard therapy, tighter glycemic control in T2D patients (HbA1c < 6.5) can be achieved [HbA1c reduction 0.67 (95% confidence interval, CI 0.64–0.40; p < 0.0001)] and maintained for a longer duration (5 years) using a SU-based regimen, which translated into a 14% reduction in microvascular events (95% CI 3.0–23%; p = 0.015). Furthermore, while the regimen did not yield a significant reduction in macrovascular events [hazard ratio, HR 0.94 (95% CI 0.84–1.06); p = 0.32] or mortality from any cause [HR 0.93 (95% CI 0.83–1.06); p = 0.28], it was considered safe and practical. Long-term (> 5 years post-trial) observational follow-up studies also indicated a significant cumulative benefit (as much as 46%) in relation to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), suggesting that renal protection persisted long after the surviving participants returned to their usual care.

### SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD: are they really effective in all patients? [^114Lhouj]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

A meta-analysis of numerous large clinical trials has provided robust evidence that Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors significantly delay the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and reduce cardiovascular events in patients with CKD, regardless of diabetes status. These findings have driven the regulatory approval of SGLT2 inhibitors with broad indications for adult CKD, not including CKD patients with polycystic kidney disease. However, the universal applicability of these benefits remains uncertain. Do these benefits extend uniformly to all CKD patients, or are there other subpopulations where efficacy is limited or uncertain?

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors for adults with chronic kidney disease: a clinical practice guideline [^116Y6FA9]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors on survival and on cardiovascular and kidneyoutcomes for adults living with chronic kidney disease (CKD)?

Current Practice

Few therapies slow kidney disease progression and improve long term prognosis for adults living with CKD. SGLT-2 inhibitors have demonstrated cardiovascular and kidney benefits in adults with CKD with and without type 2 diabetes. Existing guidance for SGLT-2 inhibitors does not account for the totality of current best evidence for adults with CKD and does not provide fully stratified treatment effects and recommendations across all risk groups based on risk of CKD progression and complications.

Recommendations

The guideline panel considered evidence regarding benefits and harms of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy for adults with CKD over a five year period, along with contextual factors, and provided the following recommendations:1. For adults at low risk of CKD progression and complications, we suggest administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (weak recommendation in favour)2. For adults at moderate risk of CKD progression and complications, we suggest administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (weak recommendation in favour)3. For adults at high risk of CKD progression and complications, we recommend administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (strong recommendation in favour)4. For adults at very high risk of CKD progression and complications, we recommend administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (strong recommendation in favour). Recommendations are applicable to all adults with CKD, irrespective of type 2 diabetes status.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel identified typical risk strata of adults with CKD (from low to very high risk of CKD progression and related complications) using the classification system developed by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and applied an individual patient perspective in moving from evidence to recommendations. Effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors were interpreted in absolute terms applicable to different risk strata with varying baseline risks for outcomes of benefit over a five year period. The panel explicitly considered the balance of benefits, harms, and burdens of starting an SGLT-2 inhibitor, incorporating the values and preferences of adults with different risk profiles. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids accompany multilayered recommendations, developed in an online authoring and publication platform (www.magicapp.org) that allows reuse and adaptation.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and pairwise meta-analysis (13 trials including 29614 participants) of benefits and harms associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors in adults with CKD with or without type 2 diabetes informed guidance. Among individuals at very high risk of CKD progression and complications, moderate to high certainty evidence shows SGLT-2 inhibitors (relative to placebo or standard care without SGLT-2 inhibitors) decrease all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure, kidney failure, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. Among individuals at high risk, moderate to high certainty evidence shows SGLT-2 inhibitors result in similar benefits across outcomes except demonstrating little or no effect on hospitalisation for heart failure and kidney failure. Among individuals at moderate and low risk, moderate to high certainty evidence shows SGLT-2 inhibitors probably reduce all-cause mortality and non-fatal stroke, with little or no effect for other outcomes of benefit. Risk-stratified estimates were unavailable for outcomes of harm; the panel therefore considered absolute effects summarised across risk strata. SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with little or no effect on acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, bone fractures, lower limb amputations, ketoacidosis, genital infections, or symptomatic hypovolaemia, although a residual possibility of harms at the individual patient level remains.

Understanding The Recommendation

In order to apply recommendations, clinicians must appropriately identify adults with CKD, consider the underlying aetiology, and risk stratify them based on glomerular filtration rate (estimated or measured) and degree of albuminuria. In addition to classifying individuals into risk strata, further estimation of a given patient's risk based on the extent of their kidney disease and other comorbidities may be warranted to inform individual-level decisions and shared decision making. Available risk calculators may help estimate a given patient's risk of CKD progression and complications.

Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with approximately 40% of the 537 million diabetic patients worldwide developing CKD and potentially progressing to CKD stage 5 or even end‐stage renal disease (ESRD), which ultimately requires dialysis or kidney transplantation. The presence of ESRD in patients with diabetes poses a significant global health threat, leading to increased mortality, deteriorated quality of life, and high healthcare costs. Therefore, preventing the progression of severe CKD to dialysis, renal transplantation, or death is critically important.

The choices of antidiabetic agents for patients with diabetes and CKD stage 5 are limited, and dose adjustment is often required, primarily due to severely decreased renal function, the renal elimination of most antidiabetic drugs, and the risk of drug‐induced hypoglycemia. Although sodium–glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have shown renal protective effects, initiation of SGLT2i is not recommended in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) under 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 because these drugs can cause a drop in eGFR during early treatment and have reduced glucose‐lowering effects in advanced CKD. Similarly, glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs), another newer class of antidiabetic medications, have been demonstrated to have renal protective effects in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, GLP‐1 RA use in patients with diabetes and pre‐dialysis is relatively uncommon, primarily due to intolerance of gastrointestinal side effects — such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea — in this vulnerable population. Consequently, patients with diabetes and CKD stage 5 have restricted choices of oral antidiabetic medications with approved reno‐protective effects.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to management of diabetic nephropathy, SGLT-2 inhibitors, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate an SGLT-2 inhibitor with demonstrated benefit in patients with T2DM and CKD (eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m²) to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical practice guideline [^112VEpub]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

### Safety and efficacy of sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic renal insufficiency [^114f1KuJ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the safety of sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate [creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 to < 50 ml/min] or severe renal insufficiency [CrCl < 30 ml/min including patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis]. The efficacy of sitagliptin in this patient population was also assessed.

Methods

In a 54-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients with baseline glycosylated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) values of 6.5–10% were allocated (2:1) to sitagliptin (for 54 weeks) or the sequence of placebo (for 12 weeks) followed by active treatment with glipizide (for 42 weeks). To achieve plasma concentrations similar to those observed in patients with normal renal function treated with 100 mg sitagliptin once daily, patients with moderate renal insufficiency were allocated to receive sitagliptin 50 mg once daily and patients with severe renal insufficiency to receive 25 mg once daily. Glipizide treatment was initiated at 2.5 or 5 mg/day and uptitrated to a maximum of 20 mg/day.

Results

Patients (N = 91) with a mean baseline HbA(1c) value of 7.7% (range: 6.2–10.3%) were randomized to sitagliptin (n = 65) or placebo (n = 26). After 12 weeks, the mean change [95% confidence interval (CI)] from baseline in HbA(1c) was -0.6% (-0.8, -0.4) in the sitagliptin group compared with -0.2% (-0.4, 0.1) in the placebo group [between-group difference (95% CI) = -0.4% (-0.7, -0.1)]. At 54 weeks, patients continuously treated with sitagliptin had a mean change (95% CI) from baseline in HbA(1c) of -0.7% (-0.9, -0.4). The overall incidence of adverse experiences was generally similar between groups. Between-group differences in incidences of specific clinical adverse experiences were generally small; however, the proportion of patients for whom hypoglycaemia was reported was lower in the sitagliptin group (4.6%) compared with the placebo/glipizide group (23.1%). Consistent with the high mortality risk in this patient population, there were six deaths during this 54-week study [5 of 65 patients (7.7%) in the sitagliptin group and 1 of 26 patients (3.8%) in the placebo/glipizide group]; no death was considered by the investigator to be drug related. The overall incidences of drug-related and serious adverse experiences and discontinuations because of adverse experiences were generally similar between groups.

Conclusions

In this study, sitagliptin was generally well tolerated and provided effective glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate to severe renal insufficiency, including patients with ESRD on dialysis.

### Safety and efficacy of exenatide once weekly in participants with type 2 diabetes and stage 2 / 3 chronic kidney disease [^115LojQU]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This analysis of the pooled results of eight studies reporting on treatment with EQW over approximately 6 months showed EQW to be well tolerated in participants with type 2 diabetes and mild, as well as moderate, renal disease. Further, the mean results showed EQW to have clinically meaningful improvements in HbA 1c in both participants with CKD3 and CKD2, i.e. irrespective of renal function in patients with an eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

Approximately one fifth of people with type 2 diabetes have comorbid CKD (defined as stages 3–5 or dialysis), with up to one third of these developing CKD over a 4-year period. These data underscore the importance of treatment options that can be safely and effectively used in this population. Previous studies have found that in mild or moderate renal impairment, no dosage adjustments of exenatide are needed, although reduced renal clearance leading to poor gastrointestinal tolerability limits its use in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease. Other GLP-1 RAs, such as albiglutide, dulaglutide and liraglutide, are not dependent on renal clearance for their degradation. However, care still needs to be taken regarding their gastrointestinal tolerability profiles and the risk for dehydration and potential subsequent acute kidney injury.

### Is there evidence of any safety differences among DPP-4 inhibitors in the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and reduced GFR due to chronic kidney disease? [^111RV5J8]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

In a recent review article on linagliptin, the authors state that "other widely available DPP-4 inhibitors are excreted predominantly via the kidneys and require consideration/adjustment of dose or are not recommended in patients with moderate or severe RI or ESRD requiring dialysis". Such statements may cast doubt over the suitability of DPP-4 inhibitors other than linagliptin in treating patients with RI, implying that failure to adequately adjust the dose of these DPP-4 inhibitors may be associated with an increased risk of adverse effects and even nephrotoxicity. The safety and efficacy of the DPP-4 inhibitor calls as a whole has been well established in both patients with normal renal function as well as those with varying degrees of RI. These data are derived from patients with stable renal function at baseline, the question, however, is — what happens when a patient's CKD progresses resulting in an increase in exposure to unchanged drug or its metabolites consequent upon the declining GFR? In routine clinical practice, the failure to adjust the dose of DPP-4 inhibitor according to drug's summary of product characteristics and eGFR level is likely a fairly frequent occurrence. A key issue, therefore, is whether this failure in appropriate DPP-4 inhibitor dose adjustment in line with renal function translates into clinically meaningful consequences? Such concerns are further compounded by the fact that many other commonly prescribed drugs are associated with potential renal toxicity particularly when there is an increase in pharmacological exposure due to reduced clearance or catabolism. However, there is no evidence for such a link between higher exposure and renal toxicity with respect to any of the available DPP-4 inhibitors.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^112zdjSf]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease.

Kidney disease is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes, and moderate to severe renal functional impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min) occurs in approximately 20–30% of patients. The individual with progressive renal dysfunction is at increased risk for hypoglycemia, which is multifactorial. Insulin and, to some degree, the incretin hormones are eliminated more slowly, as are antihyperglycemic drugs with renal excretion. Thus, dose reduction may be necessary, contraindications need to be observed, and consequences (hypoglycemia, fluid retention, etc.) require careful evaluation.

Current U.S. prescribing guidelines warn against the use of metformin in patients with a serum creatinine ≥ 133 mmol/L (≥ 1.5 mg/dL) in men or 124 mmol/L (≥ 1.4 mg/dL) in women. Metformin is eliminated renally, and cases of lactic acidosis have been described in patients with renal failure. There is an ongoing debate, however, as to whether these thresholds are too restrictive and that those with mild–moderate renal impairment would gain more benefit than harm from using metformin. In the U.K. the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines are less proscriptive and more evidence-based than those in the U.S. generally allowing use down to a GFR of 30 mL/min, with dose reduction advised at 45 mL/min. Given the current widespread reporting of estimated GFR, these guidelines appear very reasonable.

Introduction

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Kidney Disease

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) involves the gradual loss of kidney function, characterized by a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or the presence of albuminuria for > 3 months. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization provide a classification system for determining CKD risk based on cause, GFR, and albuminuria (Fig. 1). Of the complications that arise from T2DM, CKD is among the most common, affecting approximately 20–40% of people. Within 10 years of T2DM diagnosis, 24.9% of people develop microalbuminuria, 5.3% develop macroalbuminuria, and 0.8% develop advanced CKD that includes persistently elevated plasma creatinine or the need for renal replacement therapy. The progression of CKD can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), increasing the risk of kidney failure with a need for renal replacement therapy involving dialysis or renal transplant. The predominance of CKD accounts for the increased mortality observed in people living with T2DM. Despite advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis, and the increased availability of treatment options, the prevalence of ESRD continues to rise in people living with T2DM. With diabetes and CKD projected to be the seventh and fifth leading cause of premature mortality worldwide by 2040, respectively, novel and effective treatment options are critical.

2.1.3 Hypertension management

The guideline emphasises the importance of accurate BP measurement for the diagnosis of hypertension and monitoring of BP after starting treatment and suggests using standardised BP measurement technique as per the British and Irish Hypertension Society (BIHS) guidance. The mean difference in systolic BP between standardised and routine measurements is around 13 mmHg with wide limits of agreement (−46.1 to 20.7 mm Hg). The suggested threshold for starting pharmacological treatment varies depending on the type of diabetes, the age of the person, presence or absence of CKD and albuminuria.

BP control is the most important measure to slow progression of CKD in people with diabetes. For those with urine albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) 3‐30 mg/mmol, CKD stages 1–3 or stages 4–5 with ACR > 30 mg/mmol, the guidelines recommend a target BP of ≤ 130/80 mmHg. For those with CKD stages 4–5 without albuminuria or who are on dialysis, the recommended target is ≤ 140/90 mmHg.

Angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the suggested first‐line anti‐hypertensive agents for CKD. If ACE inhibitors are not tolerated, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should be prescribed. If BP is not controlled to target, we suggest following the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) treatment algorithm to select the second line and subsequent anti‐hypertensive agents. In people with advanced CKD and treatment‐resistant hypertension (uncontrolled hypertension despite treatment with three or more agents at maximum tolerated doses including a diuretic), adding a thiazide diuretic may improve BP control.

2.2 Tier 2

Although referred to as Tier 2, the interventions in this tier may be started concurrently with the interventions in Tier 1. The main objective here is to reduce the baseline risks of CKD progression and CVD. Both Tiers 1 and 2 management should be started in primary care.

### Fully automated closed-loop glucose control compared with standard insulin therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes requiring dialysis: an open-label, randomized crossover trial [^115Kmypy]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Main

Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), accounting for 30% of incident cases in the UK and 29% in Europe in 2018. As the prevalence of type 2 diabetes increases, the number of people with diabetes and ESRD requiring renal replacement therapy is also rising. A scarcity of organs for transplantation as well as cardiovascular comorbidities associated with diabetes that preclude transplantation mean that hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis are the only available treatment options for many.

ESRD and dialysis itself increase the risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which are associated with adverse outcomes –. Management of diabetes in this population is challenging for both patients and healthcare professionals. Many aspects of diabetes care of patients on dialysis are poorly understood, including targets for glycemic control and treatment algorithms. Most oral diabetes medications are contraindicated in people with ESRD, so insulin is the most commonly used diabetes therapy. Optimal insulin dosing regimens are difficult to establish with the altered glucose and insulin metabolism associated with ESRD and dialysis, and concerns regarding hypoglycemia often result in sub-optimal glycemic control. There is an unmet need for novel approaches to the safe and effective management of diabetes for people requiring dialysis.

Closed-loop insulin delivery systems comprise a continuous glucose monitor, an insulin pump and a control algorithm that continuously and automatically modulates subcutaneous insulin delivery in response to real-time interstitial glucose concentrations. Closed-loop systems are increasingly being applied to the management of type 1 diabetes. However, use of this technology in people with type 2 diabetes has been limited to the inpatient setting including those on hemodialysis –. Safety and efficacy in outpatient settings, a precursor for wider clinical acceptance, is to be determined. In the present study, we address this issue and hypothesize that fully closed-loop insulin delivery may improve glycemic control compared to standard insulin therapy without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia in people with type 2 diabetes and ESRD undergoing maintenance dialysis in the outpatient setting.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^1152ER3S]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

A common clinical conundrum faces all U.S. practitioners treating patients with type 2 diabetes. Today's U.S. Food and Drug Administration prescribing guidelines for metformin contraindicate its use in men and women with serum creatinine concentrations ≥ 1.5 and ≥ 1.4 mg/dL (≥ 132 and ≥ 123 µmol/L), respectively. In a patient tolerating and controlled with this medication, should it automatically be discontinued as the creatinine rises beyond these cut points over time? Stopping metformin often results in poorly controlled glycemia and/or the need for other agents with their own adverse-effect profiles. Moreover, is the now widespread use of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in lieu of serum creatinine levels creating even more confusion, especially in those with abnormalities in one but not the other indirect measure of renal function? Indeed, more than a decade and a half after metformin became available in the U.S. debate continues over the best approach in these settings. How many patients are unable to receive this medication on the basis of guidelines which, although well intentioned, are somewhat arbitrary and outdated based on modern assessments of renal status?

### Cardiorenal disease management in type 2 diabetes: an expert consensus [^116NCJFc]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aim

The interplay between cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is well established. We aim at providing an evidence-based expert opinion regarding the prevention and treatment of both heart failure (HF) and renal complications in people with T2D.

Method

ology: The consensus recommendations were developed by subject experts in endocrinology, cardiology, and nephrology. The criteria for consensus were set to statements with ≥ 80% of agreement among clinicians specialized in endocrinology, cardiology, and nephrology. Key expert opinions were formulated based on scientific evidence and clinical judgment.

Results

Assessing the risk factors of CVD or CKD in people with diabetes and taking measures to prevent HF or kidney disease are essential. Known CVD or CKD among people with diabetes confers a very high risk for recurrent CVD. Metformin plus lifestyle modification should be the first-line therapy (unless contraindicated) for the management of T2D. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists can be preferred in people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or with high-risk indicators, along with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), whereas SGLT2i are the first choice in HF and CKD. The GLP-1 agonists can be used in people with CKD if SGLT2i are not tolerated.

Conclusion

Current evidence suggests SGLT2i as preferred agents among people with T2D and HF, and for those with T2D and ASCVD. SGLT2i and GLP-1RA also lower CV outcomes in those with diabetes and ASCVD, and the treatment choice should depend on the patient profile.

### Glycaemic control with insulin glargine 300 U / mL in individuals with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a REALI European pooled data analysis [^111gEDod]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are common chronic comorbid conditions, with the prevalence of CKD among patients with diabetes estimated at 36% in the USA. In Europe, the prevalence of end-stage renal disease among patients with diabetes is projected to increase approximately 3% per year from 2012 to 2025. CKD is an independent risk factor for hypoglycaemia, and increases the risk already present in patients with T2DM due to accumulation of uremic toxins leading to lower hepatic and renal insulin degradation, and as a result of decreased renal gluconeogenesis as well as deficient catecholamine release. Unfortunately, the combination of hypoglycaemia and CKD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease, and T2DM was found to increase the risk of death from renal disease by threefold.

The management of T2DM in patients with CKD is especially difficult, in part because of treatment complexity and due to insufficient convincing data supporting the benefits of tight glycaemic control in this subset of patients. In patients with T2DM and advanced CKD, basal insulin is considered the therapeutic option of choice, as oral glucose-lowering agents such as metformin, sulfonylureas, and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors are less used because their glycaemic efficacy is reduced and/or the risk of hypoglycaemia or other adverse reactions is increased as a consequence of drug accumulation. Insulin requirements are generally lower in patients with T2DM and renal impairment due to a decreased insulin clearance; yet, there are no guidelines regarding insulin dose adjustment in this specific population.

### Patients' preferences for once-daily oral versus once-weekly injectable diabetes medications: the REVISE study [^1157rjvp]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

It is estimated that 30.3 million people in the United States and 4.6 million people in the United Kingdom are living with diabetes, approximately 90.0% of whom have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1, 2 The principal aim of T2DM treatment is to maintain blood glucose levels within acceptable limits, in turn, reducing the risk of long‐term complications associated with hyperglycaemia. First‐line T2DM therapy is metformin, along with lifestyle modifications, such as diet, exercise, and weight management. 3 For patients who are unable to control blood glucose levels with metformin therapy and lifestyle changes, physicians may consider pharmacological treatment such as a glucagon‐like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs). 4 For patients who are at risk of or who have established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or heart failure, a GLP‐1RA may be considered as part of the glucose‐lowering regimen, independent of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level. 4

### Executive summary of the KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease: an update based on rapidly emerging new evidence [^114zUo4G]. Kidney International (2022). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) represents a focused update of the KDIGO 2020 guideline on the topic. The guideline targets a broad audience of clinicians treating people with diabetes and CKD. Topic areas for which recommendations are updated based on new evidence include Chapter 1: Comprehensive care in patients with diabetes and CKD and Chapter 4: Glucose-lowering therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CKD. The content of previous chapters on Glycemic monitoring and targets in patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 2), Lifestyle interventions in patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 3), and Approaches to management of patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 5) has been deemed current and was not changed. This guideline update was developed according to an explicit process of evidence review and appraisal. Treatment approaches and guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence, and the strength of recommendations followed the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach.

### Safety and efficacy of incretin-based therapies in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and CKD: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112KiXXc]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antidiabetic therapies for patients with type 2 diabetes are often altered in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting & Population

Patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

Selection Criteria For Studies

2 reviewers independently screened studies identified through bibliographic databases (Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts), clinical trial registries, and references from pertinent articles and clinical practice guidelines. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials evaluating incretin-based therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes and estimated glomerular filtration rates < 60mL/min/1.73m 2.

Interventions

Incretin-based therapies (dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists) compared to placebo or active antidiabetic therapies.

Outcomes

Changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), hypoglycemia, mortality, change in fasting plasma glucose, cardiovascular events, and end-stage renal disease.

Results

Of 1,619 nonduplicate records screened, 13 studies were included. Compared to placebo, incretin-based therapies significantly reduced HbA 1c levels (n = 9; weighted mean difference, -0.64; 95% CI, -0.79 to -0.48; I² = 43%); however, compared with active comparators, they did not (n = 4; weighted mean difference, -0.07; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.12; I² = 38%). Incretin-based therapies significantly increased the risk for hypoglycemia compared to placebo (n = 7; relative risk [RR], 1.38; 95% CI, 1.01–1.89; I² = 0%) but no effect was observed versus active comparators (n = 4; RR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.03–1.94; I² = 52%). Limited evidence exists for all-cause mortality (placebo: n = 7 [RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.64–2.29; I² = 0%]; active comparators: n = 3 [RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.32–1.54; I² = 0%]).

Limitations

Variation among interventions, small number of studies, heterogeneity between studies, and high risk for attrition bias in 7 of the selected studies.

Conclusions

In patients with moderate or severe CKD, incretin-based therapies are effective in reducing HbA 1c levels. Hypoglycemic events are rare, and wide CIs for the association preclude any definitive conclusions. Likewise, wide CIs were observed for mortality, cardiovascular events, and end-stage renal disease.

### Safety and efficacy of teneligliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and impaired renal function: interim report from post-marketing surveillance [^115cmFwy]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The aim of this interim analysis was to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of teneligliptin in patients with T2DM and reduced renal function. In this analysis, we documented ADR incidences ranging from 2.98% to 6.98% across patients with each stage of renal impairment, and no clear differences in the ADR profiles at the different stages of impairment were observed. The well-tolerated profile highlighted by this post-marketing surveillance is supported by a previous study exploring teneligliptin in patients with end-stage renal disease. Additionally, we showed that during 2 years of treatment with teneligliptin, glycemic control improved in all subgroups of patients, from those with normal or high levels of renal function to those with end-stage renal disease, including patients on dialysis.

### Effects of second-line antihyperglycemic drugs on the risk of chronic kidney disease: applying a target trial approach to a hospital-based cohort of Thai patients with type 2 diabetes [^1119fmdG]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes is increasingly prevalent in terms of global chronic disease burden. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was estimated at 6,059 cases per 100,000 in 2017, and is expected to reach 7,079 cases per 100,000 by 2030. Patients with type 2 diabetes have a high risk of developing complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Management of type 2 diabetes includes lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions, which aim to normalize blood glucose levels. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends metformin monotherapy as first-line treatment if there is no contraindication. A second-line antihyperglycemic drug is added to metformin for patients who continue to have uncontrolled glycemic levels or who have any complications such as CVD or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Currently, second-line antihyperglycemic treatment options include sulfonylureas (SU), thiazolidinediones (TZD), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and basal insulin. The selection of a second-line drug is based on many factors including comorbidities, drug efficacy, side effects, costs, patients' accessibility, and patient-doctor's preferences.

Practical Use of GLP-1 RAs in People Living with CKD

In this section we provide general recommendations for GLP-1 RA use in people with CKD. The information for GLP-1 RA use for patients without CKD will also be included to enhance the context.

Current Treatment Guidelines for People Living with CKD

By nature, T2DM is a heterogenous and progressive disease for which a wide variety of treatment options exist and where treatment paradigms continue to evolve. Several international organizations have provided clinical practice guidelines to aid physicians in optimizing therapy for people living with CKD.

The general guidelines for management of T2DM that are provided by the ADA can aid physicians in navigating the overall treatment landscape. Pharmacologic intervention is usually initiated with a single oral agent, usually metformin, combined with lifestyle modifications. If HbA1c remains elevated, metformin treatment is followed by sequential addition of oral agents before intensification to injectables in a stepwise approach. Although the primary goal of diabetes management is to reduce glycemia and diabetes-related complications, special consideration needs to be taken in people living with compromised renal function. For example, metformin is regarded as contraindicated if eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² due to the increased risk of hypoglycemia.

In 2020, the ADA provided a revision to the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes with updated guidelines recommending the use of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs to treat people living with T2DM and CKD independently of baseline A1C, individualized A1C target, or metformin use (summarized in Fig. 2). These revised changes take into consideration the latest trial findings on SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA and suggest that these medications are the preferred option for people when CKD predominates, independent of HbA1c. If CKD is the predominant condition, the recommendation is to start with an SGLT2i with evidence of reducing CKD progression, assuming eGFR is adequate. If SGLT2i is not tolerated or contraindicated, or if eGFR is less than adequate (< 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2), then a GLP-1 RA is recommended.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^111Vj6CR]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

KDIGO grading of recommendations — nomenclature and implications is defined as follows: Level 1 'Strong' ("We recommend") indicates for patients, "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", for clinicians, "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and for policy, "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2 'Weak' ("We suggest") indicates for patients, "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", for clinicians, "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and for policy, "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined".

### The potential of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: from randomised trials to clinical practice [^116TfYi8]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The clearance of drug compounds often happens via the kidneys and may be lower when kidney function is impaired. In those cases, the blood concentration and half-life of the compound can be increased, resulting in an elevated risk of side effects. In persons with diabetes and impaired kidney function, many diabetes medications therefore need to be used with caution (e.g. at a reduced dose level) if at all. However, no reduction in dose is required for any of the GLP-1 RAs marketed today according to kidney function. Indeed, most of the agents can be used also in people with advanced CKD, while some are subject to restrictions due to lack of data.

In summary, safety and tolerability of the GLP-1 RAs have been thoroughly investigated in people with CKD and are well established.

The LIRA-RENAL Trial (Once-Daily Liraglutide)

The Efficacy and Safety of Liraglutide Versus Placebo as Add-on to Glucose-Lowering Therapy in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Moderate Renal Impairment (LIRA-RENAL) trial investigated the efficacy and safety of liraglutide as an add-on to existing glucose-lowering medications in people with inadequately controlled T2DM and moderate renal impairment (stage 3 CKD, eGFR 30–59 ml/min/1.73 m 2). After 26 weeks, along with a greater change in HbA1c from baseline, no changes in renal function were observed with liraglutide when compared to placebo.

The LEADER Trial (Once-Daily Liraglutide)

The LEADER trial primarily assessed the cardiovascular safety of once-daily liraglutide compared to placebo. The trial included 9340 participants (≥ 50 years; HbA1c ≥ 7.0%), the majority with established cardiovascular disease (81%). Renal outcomes were explored in a prespecified secondary analysis. The secondary renal outcome was a composite of the following components: new-onset persistent macroalbuminuria, persistent doubling of the serum creatinine level, ESRD, or death due to renal disease. The composite renal outcome was observed less frequently in participants using liraglutide than placebo (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67–0.92; p = 0.003). Of the individual components, only new-onset persistent macroalbuminuria was observed less frequently in people treated with liraglutide (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60–0.91; p = 0.004).

KDOQI US commentary — introduction and scope of KDIGO 2024 CKD guideline: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is estimated to affect 37 million people in the United States, with hypertension and diabetes mellitus the most common risk factors and many individuals unaware due to the condition's asymptomatic nature and low rates of albuminuria testing. The KDIGO 2024 CKD guidelines, last updated in 2012, outline areas spanning identification/evaluation, risk assessment, management of progression and systemic complications, medication management, and team-based/collaborative care models. Multiple high-quality clinical trials show several medication classes reduce kidney failure, kidney function decline, death due to kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease in adults with CKD and type 2 diabetes mellitus; drug classes include a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid antagonist and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists, and the commentary acknowledges novel agents such as sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors.

### Kidney and cardiovascular-protective benefits of combination drug therapies in chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes [^114EX8Le]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the substantial burden of chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes, an aggressive approach to treatment is required. Despite the benefits of guideline-directed therapy, there remains a high residual risk of continuing progression of chronic kidney disease and of cardiovascular events. Historically, a linear approach to pharmacologic management of chronic kidney disease has been used, in which drugs are added, then adjusted, optimized, or stopped in a stepwise manner based on their efficacy, toxicity, effects on a patient's quality of life, and cost. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, which may result in missing a window of opportunity to slow chronic kidney disease progression. Instead, a pillar approach has been proposed to enable earlier treatment that simultaneously targets multiple pathways involved in disease progression. Combination therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes is being investigated in several clinical trials. In this article, we discuss current treatment options for patients with chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes and provide a rationale for tailored combinations of therapies with complementary mechanisms of action to optimize therapy using a pillar-based treatment strategy. [This article includes a plain language summary as an additional file].
