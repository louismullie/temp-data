## Question

Ketosis causing nausea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how ketosis causes nausea, with mechanisms, thresholds, modifiers, and management implications across contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology linking ketone accumulation to nausea. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence across different ketotic states, including nutritional ketosis, DKA, euglycemic DKA, alcoholic ketoacidosis, and lactation-related ketoacidosis. Next, I will examine dose-response and thresholds, followed by modifiers such as dehydration, acidosis, and medication interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical clinical approach to evaluation and management, and close with a cautious conclusion that distinguishes benign from dangerous ketosis scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the core mechanism. Ketosis increases circulating β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, which are osmotically active and can provoke gastrointestinal symptoms; this is well-described in the "keto flu" phenomenon during ketogenic diet initiation, where nausea and vomiting are common and correlate with the degree of nutritional ketosis achieved, supporting a direct relationship between ketone load and GI symptoms [^113a1cmF]. Wait, let me verify whether exogenous ketones behave similarly; in athletes given ketone esters, nausea increased with higher ketosis conditions, reinforcing a dose-related effect of circulating ketones on GI tolerance [^112kVdLU] [^113hp9PD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should distinguish nutritional ketosis from pathologic ketoacidosis. In DKA, nausea and vomiting are cardinal features and occur in roughly 50–80% of cases, reflecting both ketonemia and the underlying metabolic acidosis and volume depletion, which independently worsen nausea via chemoreceptor trigger zone activation and hypovolemia-related neurohumoral changes [^111rAKrQ] [^115yTEZQ]. I need to ensure I also cover euglycemic DKA; multiple case series and reviews emphasize that nausea and vomiting are prominent even when glucose is normal, underscoring that acidosis and ketonemia themselves drive symptoms independent of hyperglycemia [^1152Ag4y] [^11616MkR].

> Next, I should review non-diabetic ketoacidosis. Alcoholic ketoacidosis frequently presents with severe nausea and vomiting, and can be misdiagnosed as DKA if hyperglycemia is present, highlighting that ketosis per se is sufficient to produce prominent GI symptoms in the right clinical context [^1134prJU] [^113AqPuz]. But wait, what if the patient is postpartum and breastfeeding? Lactation ketoacidosis has been repeatedly reported with profound nausea and vomiting, again linking ketosis to GI symptomatology in the setting of caloric restriction and increased metabolic demands [^117Uu6UC] [^111xeN5f].

> I will now examine dose-response and thresholds. Let me think about this carefully: in athletes, higher ketosis conditions were associated with more nausea, suggesting a graded effect of circulating ketones on GI symptoms, though formal thresholds are not well standardized in healthy populations [^112kVdLU]. In clinical ketotic states, symptom severity tends to escalate with rising β-hydroxybutyrate and worsening acidosis; in DKA cohorts, resolution of nausea and vomiting tracks with β-hydroxybutyrate falling below about 1.0 mmol/L, which is a pragmatic marker of metabolic improvement rather than a universal symptom threshold [^114ZG1ku]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there might be a single numeric threshold like 3.0 mmol/L for symptom onset; I should correct that — while 3.0 mmol/L is often used as a clinical action point for DKA risk, symptoms occur across a range and are modulated by acid-base status and volume state, so a fixed threshold is too simplistic for predicting nausea alone [^1153G14A].

> Let me consider modifiers that amplify nausea in ketosis. Dehydration and metabolic acidosis independently trigger nausea via central and peripheral pathways; in DKA and euglycemic DKA, osmotic diuresis and acidemia compound GI symptoms, and patients often report nausea and vomiting early in the course, sometimes before classic hyperglycemia is evident [^111rAKrQ] [^1152Ag4y]. I should double-check medication interactions; SGLT2 inhibitors increase euglycemic DKA risk and FDA labeling repeatedly lists nausea and vomiting as key warning symptoms, reinforcing the need to suspect ketosis when these symptoms occur even with normal glucose [^112yTeQF] [^1146KJqV]. GLP-1 receptor agonists can independently cause nausea and vomiting and, when combined with ketogenic regimens, may synergistically worsen GI symptoms, which I need to keep in mind when evaluating overlapping etiologies [^111sVQmn] [^111BktX4].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy to avoid overgeneralization. High-quality sources consistently document nausea as a core feature of DKA and euglycemic DKA, and guidelines emphasize early recognition of these symptoms to trigger ketone testing and appropriate management, which strengthens the causal inference in pathologic ketosis [^111rAKrQ] [^114orqys]. Medium-quality data from ketogenic diet studies and exogenous ketone trials show that GI symptoms, including nausea, are common during induction and with ketone ester ingestion, supporting a dose-related effect in non-pathologic ketosis as well [^113a1cmF] [^112kVdLU]. Case reports of lactation ketoacidosis and diet-induced ketoacidosis provide corroborative signals but carry lower evidentiary weight, so I should be cautious in extrapolating broadly from them [^117Uu6UC] [^1164Qk3G].

> I need to ensure the clinical approach is practical. In any patient with compatible symptoms, I should confirm ketosis with blood β-hydroxybutyrate rather than relying on urine ketones alone, assess acid-base status, and evaluate precipitating factors such as SGLT2 use, caloric restriction, alcohol use, infection, or insulin omission; this aligns with emergency care guidance and diabetes standards for DKA and euglycemic DKA recognition [^111rAKrQ] [^1152Ag4y]. Management hinges on correcting the underlying cause: volume resuscitation, insulin when indicated, dextrose as needed in euglycemic cases, and electrolyte repletion; symptom resolution typically parallels clearance of ketones and correction of acidosis, which I should monitor serially to confirm trajectory [^116cdNdL] [^114ZG1ku]. For nutritional ketosis, slower titration, adequate hydration, and dietary adjustments can mitigate "keto flu" symptoms, which I should counsel on proactively [^113a1cmF].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to avoid overstatement. Ketosis can cause nausea via direct effects of ketone bodies on the GI tract and CNS, with severity modulated by ketone concentration, acid-base derangement, and volume status; in pathologic ketoacidosis, nausea is frequent and often severe, whereas in nutritional ketosis, symptoms are typically milder, transient, and dose-related, improving with adaptation and supportive measures [^111rAKrQ] [^112kVdLU]. I should confirm that the clinical imperative is to distinguish benign nutritional ketosis from dangerous ketoacidosis by integrating symptoms, ketone level, acid-base status, and precipitating factors, and to treat promptly when pathologic ketosis is identified to prevent progression and relieve symptoms [^116cdNdL] [^1152Ag4y].

---

Ketosis-related nausea is driven by **ketone accumulation** (β-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate) [^112kVdLU] and **metabolic acidosis** [^1146KJqV], which activate chemoreceptors and the vomiting center, and is worsened by dehydration and electrolyte shifts [^1146KJqV]. Nausea is common in ketogenic diets ("keto flu") [^113a1cmF], exogenous ketone use [^113hp9PD], and ketoacidosis (DKA/euDKA) [^1152Ag4y], and is typically transient and self-limited with hydration, electrolytes, and gradual diet adaptation [^113a1cmF]. Persistent or severe nausea warrants evaluation for DKA/euDKA [^114EzAFr] or other causes, and management includes fluids, insulin, and antiemetics as indicated [^112pCmrF].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking ketosis to nausea

Several **interconnected mechanisms** underlie nausea in ketosis:

---

### Accumulation of ketone bodies

- **Direct irritation**: Elevated β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate can irritate gastrointestinal mucosa, triggering nausea [^notfound].

- **Central activation**: Ketones may activate the area postrema (vomiting center), especially with metabolic acidosis [^notfound].

- **Exogenous ketones**: Ketone esters commonly cause GI upset, including nausea [^114zLd5n].

---

### Metabolic acidosis

Hydrogen ions from ketone metabolism lower pH, activating chemoreceptors and the vomiting center to produce **nausea and vomiting** [^114ZG1ku]. Acidosis also causes **electrolyte shifts** — particularly potassium — that further contribute to GI symptoms [^116LZ16B].

---

### Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance

Osmotic diuresis from glycosuria/ketonuria leads to **volume depletion**, which exacerbates nausea [^111rAKrQ]. Losses of sodium, potassium, and chloride increase **nausea and vomiting** [^116LZ16B].

---

### Hormonal changes

Increased **glucagon** during ketosis may slow gastric emptying, worsening nausea. Elevated **ghrelin** may also contribute to nausea and appetite changes.

---

## Clinical evidence of nausea in ketosis

Nausea is a well-documented feature across ketotic states:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Evidence of nausea** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Ketogenic diet ("keto flu") | - Commonly reported <br/> - Transient <br/> - Self-limited [^113a1cmF] | - Occurs during diet initiation <br/> - Resolves with adaptation [^112txMPH] |
| Exogenous ketone supplements | - Mild GI upset <br/> - Including nausea <br/> - Infrequent and dose-related [^114b7rwX] | - Well tolerated overall <br/> - Symptoms typically mild [^1141gwh9] |
| Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) | - Nausea and vomiting are cardinal symptoms <br/> - Present in 50–80% of cases [^115yTEZQ] | - Requires urgent medical management [^112pCmrF] |
| Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA) | - Nausea and vomiting are common presentations [^1152Ag4y] | - Often associated with SGLT2 inhibitors [^114EzAFr] |

---

## Factors influencing severity and occurrence of nausea in ketosis

Severity and occurrence vary with **ketone levels** — higher concentrations increase nausea risk [^112kVdLU]. Rapid shifts to ketosis (e.g. fasting, strict diets) heighten symptoms, whereas gradual adaptation reduces them [^notfound]. Dehydration and electrolyte disturbances amplify nausea [^notfound]. Individual susceptibility differs, with some experiencing minimal symptoms and others significant GI effects [^113hp9PD].

---

## Management strategies for ketosis-related nausea

Effective management addresses both symptoms and underlying ketosis:

- **Hydration**: Adequate fluid intake, especially with electrolytes, reduces nausea [^111SkzEP].

- **Electrolyte replacement**: Sodium, potassium, and magnesium correction improves symptoms [^notfound].

- **Gradual dietary adaptation**: Slow initiation of ketogenic diets or exogenous ketones improves tolerance [^notfound].

- **Antiemetics**: Use for persistent nausea, especially in DKA/euDKA [^notfound].

- **Medical evaluation**: Persistent or severe nausea needs assessment for DKA/euDKA or other causes [^114EzAFr].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Clinicians should **recognize ketosis-related nausea** as common and usually benign, yet remain vigilant for DKA/euDKA when symptoms persist or are severe [^111rAKrQ]. Patients on ketogenic diets or exogenous ketones should be counseled on expected GI effects and mitigation strategies [^1176kSMR]. Persistent or severe nausea warrants evaluation for DKA/euDKA or other etiologies [^114orqys].

---

Ketosis-related nausea reflects the combined effects of ketone accumulation, acidosis, dehydration, and electrolyte shifts; it is **typically transient and manageable** with hydration, electrolytes, and gradual adaptation, but persistent or severe symptoms require evaluation for ketoacidosis or other causes.

### Does a ketogenic diet have a place within diabetes clinical practice? Review of current evidence and controversies [^113a1cmF]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the abundance of promising short-term evidence in supporting the use of ketogenic diets for diabetes management, especially for T2DM, there is a still a paucity of research to support the long-term efficacy and safety in a variety of cohorts to broadly recommend as a therapeutic approach for diabetes management at a population level. For balance it is important to point out this is true for all dietary approaches for diabetes management due to the logistic problems in long-term studies. The lack of adherence and non-compliance is a limiting factor of ketogenic diets which is one contributor to the lack of long-term studies for diabetes management. It has been shown that adherence can be improved through intervention of psychological support and reinforcing mindful eating and other behavioural adherence strategies. A study highlights the importance of adequate lifestyle support from healthcare professionals when individuals embark on a ketogenic diet to improve diabetes management, with an increase of non-adherence and dropout rates when lifestyle support was stopped. The social impact of reducing a main source of food for many is a major contributor to non-adherence as many social events revolve around consuming carbohydrate-rich food.

Non-adherence may also be attributable to the side effects experienced from ketogenic diets, a temporary experience so common it has been coined "keto flu". This phenomenon primarily includes neurological symptoms such as headache, brain fog and dizziness and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and constipation which is positively related to the degree of nutritional ketosis reached.

### The effect of blood ketone concentration and exercise intensity on exogenous ketone oxidation rates in athletes [^112kVdLU]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal discomfort

A main effect of condition was present for nausea (P = 0.009), with post hoc analyses showing a tendency for this to be greater in the high-ketosis (mean ± SD, 2.2 ± 2.3 on a 0–10 scale) versus control condition (no reported nausea; P = 0.053). No differences were observed for heartburn, bloating, abdominal pain, dizziness, or headache.

Effect of blood βHB concentration and exercise intensity on exogenous βHB oxidation rate

Neither a main effect of condition nor a condition–time interaction effect was present for exogenous βHB oxidation rates (Table 1). Exogenous βHB oxidation rate was significantly associated with oxygen consumption (R² = 0.402, P < 0.001). This relationship remained significant when resting values were removed (R² = 0.111, P = 0.048; Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 4, associations between exogenous BHB oxidation rate and V˙O₂ and individual BHB oxidation rates).

A main effect of time was observed for exogenous βHB oxidation rates (P < 0.001). In both the low- and high-ketosis conditions, oxidation rates rose significantly from rest to the 25% W Max exercise interval (~7-fold increase) and from 25% W Max to 50% W Max exercise intervals (~1.5-fold increase), but thereafter plateaued (Table 1). Peak exogenous βHB oxidation rates were 0.103 ± 0.044 g·min⁻¹, observed during the 75% W Max exercise interval. In both conditions, the relative contribution to energy expenditure during exercise was highest during the 25% W Max (peak, 4.46% ± 2.71%) and lowest during the 75% W Max exercise intensities (Table 1).

Urine βHB concentration

A main effect of condition was present for urinary βHB concentration (P < 0.001), which was greater in low-ketosis versus control condition (P = 0.002) and the high- versus low-ketosis condition (P = 0.004; Table 1).

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis: etiologies, evaluation, and management [^1152Ag4y]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis is an endocrine emergency. A subset of diabetic patients may present with relative euglycemia with acidosis, known as euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA), which is often misdiagnosed due to a serum glucose < 250 mg/dL.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of EDKA for emergency clinicians.

Discussion

EDKA is comprised of serum glucose < 250 mg/dL with an anion gap metabolic acidosis and ketosis. It most commonly occurs in patients with a history of low glucose states such as starvation, chronic liver disease, pregnancy, infection, and alcohol use. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which result in increased urinary glucose excretion, are also associated with EDKA. The underlying pathophysiology involves insulin deficiency or resistance with glucagon release, poor glucose availability, ketone body production, and urinary glucose excretion. Patients typically present with nausea, vomiting, malaise, or fatigue. The physician must determine and treat the underlying etiology of EDKA. Laboratory assessment includes venous blood gas for serum pH, bicarbonate, and ketones. Management includes resuscitation with intravenous fluids, insulin, and glucose, with treatment of the underlying etiology.

Conclusions

Clinician knowledge of this condition can improve the evaluation and management of patients with EDKA.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: exciting implications for clinical practice [^116cdNdL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

2 CURRENT APPROACHES TO THE PREVENTION, RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT OF

The standard management of established DKA has been extensively documented in international guidelines. The principles are volume replacement, the correction of electrolyte abnormalities, provision of insulin and addressing precipitating factors, all of which should occur in a hospital environment in which the patient is closely monitored. Patients with DKA may range from early presenters who are mildly unwell and have rapid reversal of their metabolic disturbances to late presenters who are severely unwell with marked disturbances in acid–base balance, volume status and electrolyte abnormalities requiring admission to an intensive care unit. Generally, early presentation with a milder metabolic derangement is associated with lower mortality, faster recovery and lower socioeconomic costs.

The first step in the prevention and management of DKA is recognition of the impending or established condition with a ketone measurement. The measurement of ketones requires that the person recognizes that they are at an increased risk of DKA and to proactively initiate a test to confirm the presence of elevated ketones. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and thirst occur late, and hyperglycaemia, which is not invariably present, may not always prompt the person to check their ketone levels. Current available options test for the presence of ketones in urine and blood samples.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis: a potential complication of treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition [^114EzAFr]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are the most recently approved antihyperglycemic medications. We sought to describe their association with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA) in hopes that it will enhance recognition of this potentially life-threatening complication.

Research Design and Methods

Cases identified incidentally are described.

Results

We identified 13 episodes of SGLT-2 inhibitor-associated euDKA or ketosis in nine individuals, seven with type 1 diabetes and two with type 2 diabetes, from various practices across the U.S. The absence of significant hyperglycemia in these patients delayed recognition of the emergent nature of the problem by patients and providers.

Conclusions

SGLT-2 inhibitors seem to be associated with euglycemic DKA and ketosis, perhaps as a consequence of their noninsulin-dependent glucose clearance, hyperglucagonemia, and volume depletion. Patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who experience nausea, vomiting, or malaise or develop a metabolic acidosis in the setting of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy should be promptly evaluated for the presence of urine and/or serum ketones. SGLT-2 inhibitors should only be used with great caution, extensive counseling, and close monitoring in the setting of type 1 diabetes.

### Clinical profile of diabetic ketoacidosis: a prospective study in a tertiary care hospital [^1174Euhp]. Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research (2015). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diabetic ketoacidosis:

- **Definition**: DKA is an acute metabolic complication occurring mostly in patients with T1DM, characterized by a triad of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: DKA is caused by absolute or relative insulin deficiency and increased levels of counterregulatory hormones, typically ocurring at the time of new diagnosis of untreated T1DM or due to inadequate insulin therapy, infection (such as pneumonia, UTI, sepsis), concomitant medications (corticosteroids, SGLT-2 inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, sympathomimetics, certain antipsychotics), illicit drug use, surgery, trauma, physiologic stress, or pregnancy.
- **Epidemiology**: The age-adjusted hospitalization rate for DKA in the US was estimated at 6.3% annually in 2014, with an in-hospital case fatality of 0.4%. The rate of hopsitalization for DKA per 10,000 admissions was reported as 53.4 in 2014 and 61.6 in 2017.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include inconsistent caloric intake, poor medication adherence, poor glucose control, alcohol use, and dehydration.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, polydipsia, polyuria, dehydration, weight loss, polyphagia, fruity odor of breath, dyspnea, tachypnea, Kussmaul breathing, hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status. Laboratory findings in DKA include hyperglycemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia/ketonuria.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: exciting implications for clinical practice [^116VWAMQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Should an alert inform a person that ketosis is developing, we recommend that a response algorithm based on a modification of the STICH (STop, Inject, Carbohydrate and Hydrate) protocol be followed to pre‐empt DKA risk. The key steps involved in this protocol include (i) verifying ketosis and identifying conditions that cause ketosis; (ii) STopping the SGLTinh, Injecting bolus insulin, consuming 30 g of Carbohydrate and Hydrating; (iii) monitoring ketone levels every 1‐2 hours; and (iv) seeking medical care (such as presenting to the emergency department if ketones persist at > 2.5 mmol/L) if ketosis does not resolve or if symptoms of DKA appear, such as abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. At any elevated CKM level, before taking any further action, it is recommended that the individual checks their ketones with a capillary blood reading using a blood ketone meter. Conversely, should a person experience any symptoms of ketosis despite the CKM indicating normal levels, then confirmation with a blood ketone measurement is strongly recommended. Examples of potential response algorithms for those on insulin pumps and multiple daily injections are listed in Table 2. However, an evidence base providing details of the optimum responses to minimize the risk of DKA is urgently needed.

### Relationship between bedside ketone levels and time to resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis: a retrospective cohort study [^114ZG1ku]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

In this study, DKA resolution was defined as 3HB below 1.0 mmol/L. When 3HB was below 1.0 mmol/L, all patients, except the two patients who developed gastroenteritis, reported resolution of nausea and/or vomiting, with blood pH correction to above 7.3.

Our data also showed that the required insulin dose for DKA resolution was less than 2.0 units/kg in patients with established T1D. Most previous studies described only the initial insulin infusion rate and only some reported the total insulin dosage necessary for DKA resolution. Desse et al. reported that the mean insulin dosage used and time to DKA resolution were 136.85 ± 152.41 units and 64.38 ± 76.34 h. On the other hand, Braatvedt et al. reported the insulin infusion rate used in their 71 DKA adult cases in New Zealand. However, both groups neither mentioned the body weight nor defined the time to DKA resolution. For these reasons, we cannot compare our data with any of the aforementioned previous studies. We recommend further studies to determine the relationship between the rate of insulin administration, total insulin dosage, and the time to DKA resolution.

The time to DKA resolution was longer in the T1D established group than in the newly diagnosed group and did not correlate with 3HB on admission. This finding could be due to different mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of DKA in patients with established T1D, such as infection, insulin omission, and insulin pump infusion troubles, as discussed below. Apart from insulin deficiency, other factors such as infection might also play a role in the observed delay in DKA resolution.

How can one explain the significant relationship between 3HB on admission and time to DKA resolution in patients with newly diagnosed T1D? While our study design did not provide an answer to this important question, it is noteworthy that the reported time required to secure DKA resolution varied widely from one study to another. We limited our literature search to studies that defined DKA resolution as a fall in 3HB. On the basis of these studies, it seems that the 3HB level on admission could be a significant predictor of the time to DKA resolution.

### Acute intractable vomiting and severe ketoacidosis secondary to the dukan diet © [^1164Qk3G]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits of low-carbohydrate, high-protein diets, such as the Dukan Diet©, are well documented, whereas reported adverse effects are rare in literature. Such diets mimic starvation states in that they promote the breakdown of fat and the production of ketones secondary to fatty acid metabolism. In fact, one measure of the effectiveness of such diets is the presence of ketosis. To our knowledge, there have been no reported cases of ketoacidosis resulting from the Dukan Diet.

Objectives

The purpose of this case report is to illustrate the importance of a detailed dietary history in patients with severe ketoacidosis secondary to the Dukan Diet and suggest treatment that may allow outpatient management.

Case Report

A 42-year-old Iranian woman with no prior medical problems presented with 10 h of intractable nausea and vomiting secondary to ketoacidosis 2 days after starting the Dukan Diet.

Conclusion

Although rare, ketoacidosis secondary to a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet can have serious complications if untreated. Clinical suspicion should arise in any patient presenting with intractable nausea and vomiting after starting a diet such as the Dukan Diet. Early recognition and intervention is essential to quicken patient recovery and outpatient management.

### Dapagliflozin [^112yTeQF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, dapagliflozin significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo. DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS are not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Invokamet) [^116TbwtG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR.

Withhold INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

### A pilot study of alternative substrates in the critically ill subject using a ketogenic feed [^113qJuCY]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Definitions

Adverse Events are any untoward medical occurrence or effect in a patient participating in the trial, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with trial treatment. An Adverse Event can therefore be any unfavourable symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of the trial treatment, whether or not it is related to the allocated trial treatment.
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are AEs that Result in death; Are life-threatening; Require in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; Result in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or Result in a congenital anomaly/birth defect

All AEs were graded for severity:

0. **None**: indicates no event or complication.

1. **Mild**: complication results in only temporary harm and does not require clinical treatment.

2. **Moderate**: complication requires clinical treatment but does not result in significant prolongation of hospital stay. Does not usually result in permanent harm and where this does occur the harm does not cause functional limitation to the patient.

3. **Severe**: complication requires clinical treatment and results in significant prolongation of hospital stay, permanent functional limitation.

4. **Life-threatening**: complication that may lead to death.

5. **Fatal**: indicates that the patient died as a direct result of the complication/adverse event.

7.2 Potential "expected" AE's in patients with multi-organ failure
Abdominal distension – new, clinically significant change in appearance. Considered severe if acute obstruction.
Abdominal pain – new, localised to abdomen and requiring more than just simple analgesia. Considered severe if not controlled with opiates.
Electrolyte disturbance – new change that is clinically significant requiring active monitoring or treatment.
Hypersensitivity reaction (anaphylactic reaction) – anaphylactic reaction.
Hypoglycaemia – new, clinically significant hypoglycaemia requiring active monitoring or treatment.
Ischaemic bowel – inferred on radiology or diagnosed visually, e.g. surgery or endoscopy.
Nausea requiring treatment with anti-emetics; Vomiting – any episode
Regurgitation/aspiration – any episodes

### Bexagliflozin [^115PMX1w]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, bexagliflozin tablets significantly increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo. Bexagliflozin tablets are not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing bexagliflozin tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR.

Withhold SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

### Nutritional ketosis improves exercise metabolism in patients with very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency [^114zLd5n]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The major complaint concerning the tolerability was nausea related to the large volume of the drink in combination with the acrid taste of the ester. This potential barrier to clinical use can, however, be overcome easily by adopting the shot‐like bolus ingestion strategy of the undiluted KE followed by a big volume of a tasty CHO drink.

Various findings in this study suggest that BHB in the bloodstream was indeed a major source of oxidative substrate in VLCADD muscle during exercise. As such, this study shows that nutritional ketosis by acute ingestion of KE is a viable new therapeutic option in clinical management of FAO disorders. Firstly, in the KE + CHO arm blood BHB significantly dropped during exercise. In contrast, in the CHO arm blood glucose dropped during exercise, suggesting that these substrates were oxidised during exercise. Secondly, in muscle, glycolytic flux was upregulated in the CHO arm, but not in the KE + CHO arm as evidenced by our metabolomics results. The tendency of plasma lactate to drop during exercise in the KE + CHO arm, but not the CHO arm, agrees with this scenario. Also, our finding of a 1.2‐fold higher rise of plasma acetylcarnitine (C2) during exercise in the KE + CHO arm compared to CHO arm fits with elevated oxidative substrate availability during NK. 23, 37 In vivo, we observed that the intramuscular energy balance during exercise in the majority of patients improved in the KE + CHO arm compared to CHO analogous to previous findings on the impact of BHB vs CHO infusion on intracellular energy balance in working cardiac muscle. 21

### Non-diabetic ketoacidosis: a case of alcoholic ketoacidosis accompanied by hyperglycemia [^1134prJU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) lacks specific clinical presentation. The results of blood testing commonly show hemoconcentration, elevated β-hydroxybutyrate levels, and acidosis in patients with AKA. Herein, we report a case of AKA accompanied by hyperglycemia and review the related literature. Case report: AKA associated with hyperglycemia is rare, and its pathogenesis is similar to that of diabetic ketoacidosis, thereby making differentiation challenging. Accordingly, AKA is easily misdiagnosed by endocrinologists. The main symptoms of a 37-year-old female included hyperglycemia, elevated β-hydroxybutyrate levels, and metabolic acidosis. Primary clinical presentations were severe nausea and vomiting. The patient initially diagnosed with DKA were eventually confirmed as AKA, who recovered after active therapy with rehydration and correction of hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, and ketosis. This study provides a reference for clinicians to reduce missed diagnosis and the misdiagnosis rates of AKA.

TABLE 1
Incidence rates of all events by disease and by SGLT2‐inhibitor (SGLT2i) exposure.

In 50 404 patient‐years of follow‐up in PWD, the incidence rates of IAK and of DKA were 1.69 and 1.01 per 1000 person‐years, respectively. There were no deaths. Among PWD, the incidence rate of IAK of those who ever took an SGLT2‐inhibitor, including just before dietary change, is 4.23 per 1000 person‐years compared to 0.82 per 1000 person‐years for those who never took an SGLT2‐inhibitor. The incidence rates of DKA in PWD per 1000 person‐years is 1.01, 2.90 among those ever on an SGLT2‐inhibitor, and 0.37 among those never on an SGLT2‐inhibitor. The use of SGLT2‐inhibitors in PWD increased the risk of IAK by 4.24‐fold (p < 0.001), 2.11‐fold for non‐DKA IAK (not significant) and 7.18‐fold for DKA (p < 0.001).

Table 2 shows the biomarkers and clinical characteristics of PWD with flagged events including those who recovered at home and those who developed IAK, including events where DKA was ruled in and ruled out. Among flagged events, the presence of nausea and/or vomiting was less common among those who recovered at home than among those who sought care (25% vs. 61%, p < 0.001). The highest fingerstick glucose within 3 days of the event were more likely to be under 200 mg/dL (86% vs. 68%, p = 0.02) in people who recovered at home than in people with IAK. No other clinical characteristics distinguished these two groups, including SGLT2‐inhibitor or insulin use, and fingerstick BHB values that were well above the diagnostic threshold for DKA of ≥ 3 mmol/L.

### The role of serum ADAMTS-1 levels in hyperemesis gravidarum [^113L88fS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

It is well known that ketone bodies are a fuel for the brain as an alternative to glucose in long periods of fasting and have the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. Studies have shown that starvation ketosis could be observed in long-term nausea and vomiting seen in HEG, and this might be harmful to the maternal and fetal neuronal system. ADAMTS-1 might have a function, such as protecting the blood–brain barrier from the negative effects of ketone bodies, because ADAMTS-1 is an antagonist of VEGF, which increases the blood–brain barrier. Although most studies could not find a relationship between ketonuria and HEG severity, we detected a significant degree of ketonuria in our HEG group compared to the control group, and we observed a positive correlation between ketonuria and ADAMTS-1 levels. In a different study that investigated the relation between ketonuria and HEG, Soysal et al. claimed that ketonuria in HEG was determined by the inflammatory response in pregnancy rather than HEG itself. Similar to that study, we found that inflammatory markers such as PDW, PCT, and MPV were higher in the HEG group compared with the control group.

One of the main weaknesses of this study is that GDF 15 levels were not measured. Another weakness is that we did not measure VEGF levels as there was no standardized value in the first trimester of pregnancy. The well-matched features of the patients and the fact that they were free from the effects of BMI and age showed that the results and comparisons were reliable.

### Clinical and biochemical characteristics and analysis of risk factors for euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis in type 2 diabetic individuals treated with SGLT2 inhibitors: a review of 72 cases over a 4.5-year period [^115MRixE]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

To study euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA) outcomes associated with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) METHODS: Review of 72 euDKA cases in T2DM between September 2015 and January 2020 (PUBMED).

Results

euDKA could occur at any time during SGLT2is treatment, with nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting as main symptoms. Hyperglycemia did not correlate with pH and β-hydroxybutyrates. Low pH and high β-hydroxybutyrates were significantly associated with euDKA. In biguanides users, acidosis was unrelated to lactic acidosis. euDKA occurred during fasting, surgery, acute infection, insulin deprivation (endogenous or exogenous).

Conclusions

These data support avoidance of euDKA risk states in SGLT2i users.

### Euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis in a patient with type 2 diabetes started on empagliflozin [^115MnFTR]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA) is largely associated with type 1 diabetes and has hyperglycaemia as a cardinal feature. We discuss the case of a 42-year-old man, a patient with type 2 diabetes, who presented to the emergency room, with nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. He had recently changed his diabetes medications and started on an SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) along with metformin, pioglitazone, liraglutide and self-adjusted exogenous insulin. DKA was suspected in the wake of clinical examination and lab findings but glucose levels were below the cut-off for DKA; therefore, he was diagnosed with euglycaemic DKA. He was successfully managed with intravenous hydration and insulin infusion. We discuss the link of SGLT2 inhibitors with DKA and the pathophysiology behind euglycaemic DKA.

### Healthcare resource utilization and costs associated with ketosis events in pediatric and adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus in the UK [^1153G14A]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia with ketosis are the two most common acute complications in established type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). However, while self-management of hypoglycemia is well documented in the literature, there is little information available regarding the management of ketosis events.

Defined as the presence of elevated ketone bodies in the blood, and arising during periods of insulin deficiency and increased concentrations of counter-regulatory hormones, ketosis is often asymptomatic, but at high levels patients may experience nausea or abdominal pain. Common causes of ketosis include infection, gastrointestinal illness, insulin omission, and exercise, and its incidence may be increased in insulin pump users.

It is generally recommended that compensatory actions should be taken when blood ketone levels are greater than 0.6 mmol/L. Unidentified and untreated, high ketone levels cause the body to enter diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is defined as a state of metabolic acidosis, ketosis, and hyperglycemia. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common and significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in people with T1DM and is associated with high hospitalization and healthcare resource costs. In 2015, over 7000 patients were hospitalized for DKA in the UK, at a cost to the National Health Service (NHS) of almost £10,000,000.

Patients should be taught to identify and initiate treatment of ketosis to prevent progression to DKA. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advises ketone monitoring with blood ketone strips for children, and urine or blood ketone strips for adults in the sick-day rules for T1DM. Where raised ketones are identified, patients are instructed to adjust their insulin dose and increase their liquid intake. While NICE does not provide guidelines on insulin dose adjustments, the British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes advises the administration of 10% of a patient's daily dose where ketone levels are 0.6–1.5 mmol/L, or 20% where levels are greater than 1.5 mmol/L. At ketone levels above 3.0 mmol/L, patients should seek medical assistance. However, a preliminary literature review identified no publications reporting actual healthcare resource use during and following ketosis events, or the associated costs.

This study aimed to quantify the cost of healthcare resource utilization in the UK attributable to ketosis events in adults and children with T1DM.

### Exogenous ketosis in patients with type 2 diabetes: safety, tolerability and effect on glycaemic control [^114b7rwX]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ketogenic diets have shown to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. This study investigated the safety, tolerability, and effects on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes of an exogenous ketone monoester (KE) capable of inducing fasting-like elevations in serum β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) without the need for caloric or carbohydrate restriction.

Methods

Twenty one participants (14 men and 7 women, aged 45 ± 11 years) with insulin-independent type 2 diabetes, and unchanged hypoglycaemic medication for the previous 6 months, were recruited for this non-randomised interventional study. Participants wore intermittent scanning glucose monitors (IS-GM) for a total of 6 weeks and were given 25 mL of KE 3 times daily for 4 weeks. Serum electrolytes, acid-base status, and βHB concentrations were measured weekly and cardiovascular risk markers were measured before and after the intervention. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, with the secondary endpoint being glycaemic control.

Results

The 21 participants consumed a total of 1,588 drinks (39.7 litres) of KE over the course of the intervention. Adverse reactions were mild and infrequent, including mild nausea, headache, and gastric discomfort following fewer than 0.5% of the drinks. Serum electrolyte concentrations, acid-base status, and renal function remained normal throughout the study. Compared to baseline, exogenous ketosis induced a significant decrease in all glycaemic control markers, including fructosamine (335 ± 60 μmol/L to 290 ± 49 μmol/L, p < .01), HbA1c (61 ± 10 mmol/mol to 55 ± 9 mmol/mol [7.7 ± 0.9% to 7.2 ± 0.9%], p < .01), mean daily glucose (7.8 ± 1.4 mM to 7.4 ± 1.3 mM [140 ± 23 mg/dl to 133 ± 25 mg/dl], p < .01) and time in range (67 ± 11% to 69 ± 10%, p < .01).

Conclusions

Constant ketone monoester consumption over 1 month was safe, well tolerated, and improved glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis caused by alcoholic pancreatitis and starvation ketosis [^112UNHfj]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Starvation ketosis and pancreatitis are uncommon and underrecognized etiologies of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Euglycemic DKA is associated commonly with pregnancy, use of insulin en route to the hospital, and use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. A 58-year-old male with past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus and alcoholism presented with chief complaint of nausea, vomiting, and poor oral intake for several weeks. Despite extensive history of diabetes and no recent SGLT-2 inhibitor use, his labs were consistent with euglycemic DKA. His imaging and clinical history also confirmed alcoholic pancreatitis. The patient was admitted for euglycemic DKA secondary to starvation ketosis and alcoholic pancreatitis. His anion gap and beta-hydroxybutyrate rapidly cleared with initiation of the DKA protocol. This case teaches us that clinicians should consider early initiation of the DKA protocol even in the setting of euglycemia, when a patient presents with high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis, a high beta-hydroxybutyrate level, and a clinical picture of pancreatitis and starvation.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis in pregnancy [^114R1LXd]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

The clinical presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) includes nausea, vomiting, thirst, polyuria, polydipsia, abdominal pain, tachypnoea, and change in mental status in cases of severe DKA. DKA is similar in pregnant and non-pregnant women, but in pregnant women it can be seen at lower serum glucose levels and symptoms may develop more rapidly. Most, but not all, cases occur in the second or third trimester.DKA results in reduction in uteroplacental blood flow due to osmotic diuresis, and also in metabolic abnormalities (maternal acidosis, hyperglycaemia, electrolyte imbalance), resulting in fetal hypoxaemia and acidosis. In fetuses with mature cardiac activity, the fetal heart rate may show minimal or absent variability, repetitive deceleration and absence of acceleration. These abnormalities in heart rate usually resolve with resolution of the DKA, which may last for several hours before normalisation. For the patient reported on here, immediate delivery based on pathological fetal heart rate would have resulted in preterm delivery and jeopardised the maternal clinical condition. However, a holistic clinical approach by the multidisciplinary team to management of the patient led to normal term delivery 5 weeks after presentation with DKA; fetal and maternal outcome were good.

### Ertugliflozin (Steglatro) [^116WqmDX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, STEGLATRO significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo; this risk may be greater with higher doses. STEGLATRO is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 4 days after discontinuing STEGLATRO [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Hyperemesis gravidarum in the context of migration: when the absence of cultural meaning gives rise to "blaming the victim" [^115yZone]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The severity of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy ranges as a continuum from the nausea and vomiting that occurs commonly in many pregnancies to hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), a rare and severe complication involving persistent nausea and extreme vomiting associated with ketosis and weight loss (> 5% of pre-pregnancy weight). HG leads to nutritional deficiencies, loss of water and salts from cells, and acid-base imbalances that can cause destabilised organ function, renal failure, neurological damage, and even death. The severity and persistence of HG symptoms, which can endanger the health of both mother and child, differentiate HG from the nausea and vomiting commonly experienced by women during pregnancy.

HG is a rare disorder estimated to affect between 0.03–2% of pregnancies, with a prevalence up to 4.5 times higher in immigrant populations. Country of origin and length of time after immigration were shown to influence this prevalence, with only one study in China reporting a rate as high as 10.8% in pregnant immigrant women. Although research has suggested potential biological and psychological etiological pathways for HG, it remains unclear why the prevalence of this illness is so much higher in immigrant women.

Biological factors

Research has identified potential hormonal, immunological, gastrointestinal, and genetic causes of HG. However, the extent and way in which specific biological factors, such as estrogens, human chorionic gonadotropin, prolactin, cortisol, leptin, progesterone, and thyroid hormones play a role in the etiology of HG is still under debate, with studies finding both increases and decreases in each of the biological measures. Similarly, the relationship between helicobacter pylori infection and HG remains controversial, with some studies suggesting a strong association and others suggesting that the relationship is much weaker. Recently, the risk of HG has also been shown to be influenced by maternal genotype and was linked to genes mediating calcium channels that are activated through thyroid hormone signalling. However, these biological factors do not explain why immigrant women are more vulnerable to developing HG.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to dapagliflozin use: a Case report [^111mDwZE]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a novel class of oral antihyperglycemic agents. They are associated with rare cases of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which presents a diagnostic challenge in the emergency department (ED) and potentially severe consequences if missed.

Case Report

A 53-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a recent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery presented to the ED with nausea, vomiting, and generalized abdominal pain. His medications included dapagliflozin. Work-up revealed anion-gap acidosis, which prompted us to send serum ketone levels despite a blood glucose level of 9.8 mmol/L (162 mg/dL). The patient was ultimately diagnosed with euglycemic DKA. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Patients on SGLT2 inhibitors may present in DKA despite having normal blood glucose levels. It is important for emergency physicians to be aware of this phenomenon in all SGLT2-inhibitor users, as a delay in the diagnosis of DKA can be life threatening.

TABLE 2
Baseline characteristics of diabetic ketoacidosis patients in SGLT2 inhibitor users versus non‐users.

Clinical symptoms of DKA appear to be similar between SGLT2i users and non‐users, based on limited comparative data. Reported symptoms included nausea/vomiting (57.9%–76.5%), abdominal pain (42.1%–83.3%), fever (16.7%–50.0%), dyspnoea (16.7%–21.1%), and unconsciousness (12.5%–29.4%). The results of meta‐analysis comparing clinical features and outcomes of patients with DKA who were SGLT2i users and non‐users are summarised in Table 3, and their forest and funnel plots are displayed in Figures S4–S7. Among DKA cases, the decrease in pH was less pronounced in SGLT2i users than in non‐users, whereas bicarbonate levels and anion gaps were not significantly different between the two groups. Serum ketone levels in DKA cases among SGLT2i users were generally comparable to or slightly lower than those in non‐users. Two studies reported no significant differences between groups (p = 0.94 and p = 0.19, respectively), whereas Khan et al. demonstrated lower β‐hydroxybutyrate levels in SGLT2i users compared with non‐users (7.7 vs. 8.3 mmol/L). Especially, euglycemic DKA accounted for a 22.4‐fold (95% CI: 7.4–67.5) higher proportion of DKA cases in SGLT2i users than in non‐users. DKA cases in SGLT2i users had significantly lower blood glucose (MD = −218.4, 95% CI: −275.7 to −161.1, p < 0.0001, I² = 79.5%) and HbA1c levels (MD = −1.2, 95% CI: −2.1 to −0.4, p = 0.0027, I² = 73.6%) compared with DKA cases in non‐users. Regarding the electrolytes, DKA cases in SGLT2i users exhibited a less pronounced decrease in sodium levels (MD = 4.1, 95% CI: 2.3–6.0, p < 0.0001, I² = 0.0%) than DKA cases in non‐users, whereas no significant differences were observed in potassium level and chloride level. SGLT2i users had a small but less pronounced increase in creatinine levels (MD = −0.1, 95% CI: −0.2 to −0.1, p = 0.0007, I² = 0.0%) and lactate (MD = −0.3, 95% CI: −0.6 to −0.0, p = 0.0239, I² = 16.2%). No statistically significant differences were observed in the systolic blood pressure or heart rate between SGLT2i users and non‐users of DKA. With respect to DKA outcomes, no significant differences were observed in the length of hospitalisation (p = 0.211, I² = 70.1%), ICU admission (p = 0.697, I² = 68.7%), or in‐hospital mortality (p = 0.156, I² = 0.0%).

### Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy: implications for obstetric anesthesia [^11575Zt1]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Other physiologic changes in pregnancy may also contribute to the difficulties in recognizing DKA, even if capillary glucose values are elevated. For instance, an increase in tidal volume and resting minute ventilation are typical of normal pregnancy. This causes hypocarbia and a respiratory alkalosis, which is compensated for by a normal decrease in serum bicarbonate levels to 18 to 21 mM in uncomplicated pregnancies. Serum pH is typically between 7.4 and 7.46 during normal pregnancy, despite this compensatory metabolic acidosis. Blood pH is lowered in DKA as excessive ketone bodies consume bicarbonate buffer, but pH may initially not be lowered to the degree otherwise expected by the high anion gap, or to the degree that would be seen in nonpregnant individuals. As a result, pregnant patients in early DKA may present with only a low normal pH, despite a high anion gap, before rapidly developing a profound metabolic acidosis.

Clinical presentation of DKA in pregnant patients is similar to the clinical presentation in nonpregnant patients except that the complication of ketosis tends to develop more rapidly. Symptoms of DKA in pregnancy include nausea, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, and change in mental status. Given that more than 70% of pregnancies are complicated by nausea and vomiting, underlying DKA could potentially be missed if not suspected.

Key laboratory findings sufficient for diagnosis of DKA in pregnancy include evidence of both ketosis and an anion gap acidosis. An anion gap greater than 12 mEq/l and positive ketones are sufficient to confirm the diagnosis, regardless of blood sugar. A serum bicarbonate level less than 15 supports the diagnosis, as well as an arterial pH less than 7.3. However, obtaining an arterial sample can be challenging in an obstetrics unit and is not always necessary.

14 KETONE MONITORING

Ketoacidosis is a life‐threatening acute complication of diabetes. Six percent of children younger than 6 years in the United States and 4% of children in Germany/Austria (data from the T1D Exchange clinic registry and the Prospective Diabetes Follow‐up Registry: DPV) have suffered from ketoacidosis during the past year. Education of families on prevention of ketoacidosis is an essential part of diabetes care, especially as young children are physiologically prone to develop ketosis. See the ISPAD Guidelines on Diabetic Ketoacidosis chapter 13 for further advice.

The high incidence of gastroenteritis with vomiting and risk of misinterpreting vomiting due to insulinopenia makes monitoring of ketones important in this age group. Measuring ketone bodies in blood (betahydroxybutyrate, BOHB) should be the primary method of detecting and monitoring ketosis in preschool children with T1D; see the ISPAD Guidelines chapter 12 on Sick days. Blood ketone checking gives the caregivers and health care professionals timely information regarding ketone levels and their rise or fall to provide advice over the phone or in the emergency room.

Ketones should be monitored when there is a suspicion of lack of insulin raised either by high blood glucose (2 values above 14 mmol/L [252 mg/dL] within 2 h that do not decline with an extra insulin dose) or when the child shows symptoms suggestive of ketosis (vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain or unclear illness). It is important to educate and remind caregivers of young children that insulin always should be given by s.c. injection (with a syringe or a pen) when treating ketonemia (without DKA) even if the child usually is treated with an insulin pump. See the ISPAD Guidelines chapter 12 on Sick days for further advice on treatment.

Measurement of acetoacetate in urine with a dipstick can be used as an alternative to blood ketone measurement but gives different information. As preschool children do not urinate on command, results from blood ketone monitoring will be more easily available for the caregiver parent unless the child uses diapers. Cotton balls can be put in the diaper to absorb urine which can then be applied to the dipstick.

4 CONCLUSIONS

This study is the first to evaluate the effects of combining a GLP‐1 RA with a VLCKD. Both interventions led to weight loss and metabolic improvements; however, adding liraglutide enhanced these outcomes. The greater weight reduction observed with liraglutide is likely due to its appetite‐suppressing effects, which complemented the VLCKD by potentially improving dietary adherence, as indicated by higher BHB even compared with similar studies. The weight loss achieved with the combination therapy was markedly greater than what is typically observed with liraglutide 3 mg alone. Additionally, insulin sensitivity improved more markedly in the combined group, consistent with liraglutide's effects on insulin secretion and glucagon suppression.

The combination therapy was also associated with increased gastrointestinal effects, and no participant followed the standard weekly dose uptitration. For some, the lower dose was sufficient; for others, side effects limited dose escalation, raising concerns about the combination tolerability. Interestingly, the combination led all participants to develop nausea or vomiting at some point, likely because both interventions can independently lead to these symptoms, possibly due to delayed gastric emptying. It is therefore plausible that a VLCKD may amplify the GI adverse events commonly occurring during GLP‐1 RA treatment, although this should be further investigated in the future. Despite this, biochemical safety outcomes remained stable, supporting the safety of combining liraglutide with a VLCKD, at least for short‐term use, and the dropout rate between the two groups was identical, confirming that the adverse events did not compromise adherence or overall treatment outcomes.

1.2 Diabetic ketoacidosis

The risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with SGLT2 inhibitor use has been a cause of concern. The absolute risk is low, but the consequences can be severe. Mitigation strategies are outlined in Box 1. These strategies include stopping the agent when acutely unwell, stopping the agent 3 days before any procedure that requires fasting, bowel preparation, or a hospital admission and restarting the agent when well.,

BOX 1
Reducing the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis with SGLT2 inhibitors.

Reducing the Risk of DKA with SGLT2 inhibitors
Patient counseling,: Patients should seek urgent medical attention if they develop nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain, drowsiness, rapid weight loss, ketotic (sweet) breath, Kussmaul (fast and deep) breathing and abnormal odour to the urine or sweat. Patients should be aware of DKA risk factors–fasting, dehydration, acute illness, surgery, sudden reductions in insulin dosage, alcohol abuse, latent autoimmune diabetes in adults and low C‐peptide levels. Patients should remain well hydrated during periods of illness. Patients should stop taking SGLT2 inhibitors if unable to eat or drink.
Withhold SGLT2 inhibitors 3 days prior to the day of any surgery/procedure if the procedure requires fasting, bowel preparation and a hospital admission. Therapy can be restarted when the patient is recovered and eating and drinking.
Consider introducing an automatic alert in the electronic medical record when a patient is on an SGLT2 inhibitor and is being booked for an operation.
Withhold SGLT2 inhibitors during acute severe medical illnesses, and monitor ketones during this period. The SGLT2 inhibitor should then be restarted once the patient's condition stabilizes and the ketones are normal.
Immediately discontinue SGLT2 inhibitor use if DKA is suspected or diagnosed.
In patients who experience DKA during use, do not resume therapy unless another cause for DKA was identified, and resolved.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Participant characteristics

Twenty‐three patients were initially enrolled. One participant withdrew after 1 week without reporting any adverse event. Another participant completed 5 weeks of the study but was excluded from the analysis because she was prescribed glucocorticoids during her last week of the intervention. Therefore, twenty‐one participants (14 males and 7 females), aged 45.1 ± 10.8 years, completed the study. Co‐morbidities included hypertension (38%) and dyslipidaemia (28%). Common glycaemic therapies included metformin (90.4%), liraglutide (28%) and empagliflozin (19%) (Table 1).

Note

3.2 Tolerability and adherence

All participants had > 90% adherence, defined as consumption of at least 76 of the maximum 84 KE drinks. Thus, the KE drink was well‐tolerated. Adverse symptoms were self‐recorded by participants following each of their drinks and were ranked as 'mild', 'moderate' or 'severe'. Overall occurrence of adverse symptoms is expressed relative to the total number, 1,588, of drinks consumed throughout the entire study. Mild nausea (5/1,588 = 0.3%), mild headache (5/1,588 = 0.3%) and mild gastric discomfort (9/1,588 = 0.5%) were the only reported symptoms.

Clinical (weight, BMI waist circumference) and laboratory (lipids, glucose, insulin, electrolytes, renal and liver function, uric acid and HOMA‐IR) assessments were performed in a fasting state at baseline and after 4 months. Safety and adherence were monitored via dietitian contact through scheduled in‐person visits, with additional remote follow‐ups as needed. Adherence was assessed via confirmation of ketosis (BHB > 0.5 mmol/L), and standardised symptom questionnaires composed of binary (yes/no) items addressing common side effects such as nausea, constipation or fatigue were employed. Participants were instructed to avoid any additional foods or beverages not explicitly included in the dietary protocol.

In all, 40 patients were deemed sufficient to detect a clinically relevant 15% weight loss (power 0.80, alpha 0.05). Foreseeing a 15% drop‐out, 48 patients were enrolled. Data are expressed as mean and standard deviation or %. Non‐normally distributed variables were log‐transformed. A general linear repeated measures model was used to analyse continuous endpoints. The time × treatment interaction analyses were used to determine groupwise differences. The Pearson χ² test was used for categorical variables. Analyses were performed using SPSS‐27.0 (Armonk, NY, USA). All tests were two‐tailed, and a p ‐value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Unexpected cause of recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis in type 1 diabetes: a case report [^113mnbBa]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious life-threatening condition that usually requires admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The development of DKA has been associated with a number of precipitating factors such as inadequate insulin therapy, infection, ischemia, medications, and other medical-surgical conditions. The absence of clear precipitating factors may make DKA diagnosis and treatment challenging and can easily lead to misdiagnosis.

Cannabis use should be considered in patients with type 1 diabetes who have recurrent DKA with an unusual presentation, such as unexpectedly high pH and bicarbonate levels with hyperglycemic ketosis.

Here, we describe a patient with type 1 diabetes who presented with recurrent DKA, abdominal pain, and cyclic vomiting thought to be due to cyclic vomiting syndrome. After an appropriate evaluation, the patient was diagnosed with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS (. This case provides an opportunity to discuss the diagnosis and treatment of this challenging condition.

As far as we know, this is the first case report on this topic in Saudi Arabia.

Case presentation

A 21-year-old women was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 7 years. She also had anxiety and depression that required expert help. Basal bolus insulin was used to treat her diabetes. She had a history of frequent admissions for DKA 6 times within the last 12 months and a presumptive diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome. All DKA episodes started with sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain that worsened over time, eventually leading to dehydration and ketosis. DKA episodes were managed according to the standard protocol. There was no apparent cause for any of the episodes of DKA, either in her history or in extensive investigations. On the last admission, she presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She reported 7 episodes of bilious vomiting one day prior to admission. The pain was epigastric, 7/10 in intensity, progressive, and nonradiating. The pain was mainly postprandial and accompanied by vomiting, which was resolved with paracetamol. She denied any aggravating factors, but the hot water baths provided some relief.

RPE and heart rate

For RPE, a time–KE interaction effect was detected (P = 0.02, ηp² = 0.30). Post hoc analyses indicated that RPE was similar between all experimental conditions during the WU and TT 30′, but tended to be lower in KE and KE + BIC (18.4 ± 1.1) than in CON and BIC (18.9 ± 0.9) during the SPRINT (P = 0.07, d = 0.49). Heart rate during the TT 30′ and peak heart rate after the SPRINT were similar between all conditions as evidenced by the absence of main or interaction effects (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Effect of KE and/or bicarbonate supplementation on RPE and heart rate.

GI distress and appetite perception

The overall incidence and severity of GI symptoms were low. Nonetheless, there was a main effect of KE for GI distress (P = 0.01, ηp² = 0.51), indicating that GI distress was slightly higher in KE (12 ± 12 on a 96-point scale) and KE + BIC (11 ± 9) compared with CON (7 ± 12) and BIC (5 ± 8). This resulted from increased distress at the systemic (dizziness) and upper abdominal (bloating, nausea, vomiting) levels in KE and KE + BIC (all, P < 0.05). Scores on each of the four "appetite questions" were similar between the experimental conditions.

Identification of condition and best performance trial

Upon completion of the final experimental session, the subjects were asked to identify the sequential order of their experimental conditions and their best TT 30′ performance. None of the participants correctly identified the four experimental conditions, whereas 9 of 12 subjects correctly identified their best TT 30′ performance.

### Unexpected cause of recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis in type 1 diabetes: a case report [^1147fqgc]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Chronic gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including vomiting and abdominal pain, are most commonly observed among patients with type 1 diabetes, for which presumptive and incorrect diagnoses can mislead physicians, especially when dealing with rare diagnoses of exclusion, such as CHS.

To our knowledge, this is the first case report of an association between HCS and recurrent DKA in patients with type 1 diabetes in Saudi Arabia. This can be challenging to diagnose due to a variety of factors.

Cannabis is the most commonly used psychoactive drug in the world. According to the latest World Drug Report 2019 of the United Nations (UNODC), an estimated 271 million people (5.5% of the world population aged 15–64 years) had used drugs at least once in the previous year.

The use of cannabis by Saudis with type 1 diabetes has not been well described in the literature. Few published studies have estimated that approximately 7–8% of Saudis have used drugs. The substances most frequently abused by Saudis are amphetamines, heroin, alcohol, and cannabis.

Patients with type 1 diabetes who use cannabis are more likely to experience recurrent vomiting, and abdominal pain, which can be difficult to diagnose and manage. Similar symptoms may be experienced by those with diabetic gastroparesis. Therefore, a comprehensive, detailed medical history and physical exam are important in identifying cause and avoiding unnecessary tests and procedures.

Long-term regular cannabis use can cause CHS, a rare condition characterized by nausea progressing to severe vomiting that occurs in cycles leading to dehydration and ketosis, followed by hyperglycaemia. In contrast to typical DKA, in which ketoacidosis is preceded by hyperglycemia mainly due to insulin omission or other precipitating factors. Cannabis use may mask DKA by causing an increase in pH documented at the time of presentation compared to non-cannabis users with DKA. The mechanism for this high pH is related to the effect of cannabis on delaying gastric emptying and progressive emesis, leading to metabolic alkalosis. CHS can present as recurrent DKA, as in this case.

### Therapeutic use of intermittent fasting and ketogenic diet as an alternative treatment for type 2 diabetes in a normal weight woman: a 14-month case study [^112txMPH]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

While the benefits of low-carbohydrate diets in type 2 diabetes are well accepted, the role of KD in the management of type 2 diabetes is not widely accepted at the present time, partly due to limited long-term safety data. A KD is typically defined as a LCHF diet that induces a shift in energy source from glucose to fatty acids and fatty-acid-derived ketones. Achieving nutritional ketosis has been shown to result in diabetes remission and reversal in some cases. A non-randomised long-term study implementing KD found significant improvements in biomarkers, including HbA1c, weight, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, blood pressure, cholesterol profile, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and a reduced need for type 2 diabetic medication. By contrast, the control arm consisting of patients with type 2 diabetes receiving 'usual care' with counselling on lifestyle interventions by a registered dietitian showed no significant change in any of the biomarkers measured.

However, in other disease states, both KDs and IF have a long history of safety. KD was first used in the 1920s in the treatment of epilepsy. During nearly a century of clinical use, there have been remarkably few health concerns. IF has been used even longer in the treatment of epilepsy, having been described by the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates more than 2400 years ago. Further, IF has been a traditional part of virtually every major religion in the world.

Our patient tolerated the KD well, with her only reported difficulty being the week-long initial period of adjustment, termed in popular media as keto flu and in the medical literature as keto induction. Common symptoms of keto flu include influenza-like symptoms, headache, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, gastrointestinal discomfort and decreased energy. The symptoms tend to peak within the first 7 days of initiating a KD and resolve within the first month. While data show that IF and the production of ketone bodies result in adaptive responses that influence health and longevity, further research on KDs is needed to help support their widespread use in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.

The case fatality rate is 1 to 5 percent. About one-third of all cases are in persons without a history of diabetes mellitus. Common symptoms include polyuria with polydipsia (98 percent), weight loss (81 percent), fatigue (62 percent), dyspnea (57 percent), vomiting (46 percent), preceding febrile illness (40 percent), abdominal pain (32 percent), and polyphagia (23 percent). Measurement of A1C, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, serum glucose, electrolytes, pH, and serum ketones; complete blood count; urinalysis; electrocardiography; and calculation of anion gap and osmolar gap can differentiate diabetic ketoacidosis from hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, gastroenteritis, starvation ketosis, and other metabolic syndromes, and can assist in diagnosing comorbid conditions. Appropriate treatment includes administering intravenous fluids and insulin, and monitoring glucose and electrolyte levels. Cerebral edema is a rare but severe complication that occurs predominantly in children. Physicians should recognize the signs of diabetic ketoacidosis for prompt diagnosis, and identify early symptoms to prevent it. Patient education should include information on how to adjust insulin during times of illness and how to monitor glucose and ketone levels, as well as information on the importance of medication compliance.

### Balanced electrolyte solution with 1% glucose as intraoperative maintenance fluid in infants: a prospective study of glucose, electrolyte, and acid-base homeostasis [^112tSAmL]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Editor's key points

- Optimal compositions and infusion rates of intravenous maintenance fluids for children undergoing surgery to avoid hypoglycaemia, ketosis, and hyponatraemia are have not been established.
- This two-centre prospective observational study investigated maintenance of normoglycaemia using a balanced electrolyte maintenance infusion with 1% glucose in infants undergoing surgery.
- Use of a balanced electrolyte maintenance fluid with 1% glucose was not associated with hypoglycaemia or electrolyte abnormalities intraoperatively in infants, even during prolonged anaesthesia (> 4 h).

As emphasised in the expert initiative Safe Anesthesia For Every Tot, as well as in international guidelines for paediatric anaesthesia, the aim of intraoperative fluid therapy should be to maintain or re-establish normal physiology with regards to metabolic, electrolyte, and acid–base balance. In particular, hypoglycaemia is of great concern since, if severe and untreated, it affects cerebral perfusion and metabolism and can result in permanent neurological damage. Infants have a greater risk of developing intraoperative hypoglycaemia because of their higher metabolic rate and lower energy stores compared with older children and adults.

Prolonged fasting before and during anaesthesia induces hepatic glycogenolysis. When this source of glucose is depleted, metabolism shifts to lipolysis and beta-oxidation with production of ketone bodies as alternative energy substrates. This protects the central nervous system from energy deficiency, but the negatively charged ketone bodies can lead to metabolic acidosis. However, excessive glucose supply can induce perioperative hyperglycaemia which can aggravate global or focal cerebral ischaemia and impair the immune system, with potential negative postoperative outcomes.,

Hyponatraemia can lead to severe complications as it will increase the influx of water into brain cells, causing intracellular cerebral oedema with severe neurological damage and death as possible consequences. The main mechanism causing hyponatraemia is increased secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP) as a result of perioperative non-osmotic stimuli — such as pain, nausea, and surgical stress — that reduce the excretion of free water. The choice of intraoperative and postoperative intravenous fluid and infusion rates also influences the risk for hyponatraemia.

Recommendation 6 — The guideline panel suggests IV fluid administration at the early treatment of acute CVS episodes guided by patient age, symptom severity, and degree of dehydration (conditional recommendation, based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects). Remarks state there is no research evidence regarding use of D10 vs. D5 IV fluids in this setting and no recommendations for specific IV fluids are made due to lack of evidence and potential for delay if specialized fluids are utilized; IV fluids should be determined by the evaluating clinician and provided similarly to other children with acute onset vomiting, with goals of rehydration and alleviation of electrolyte disturbances and ketosis. Background notes that a prior pediatric expert consensus recommended dextrose 10% (D10) over dextrose 5% (D5), but the guideline panel found no published evidence supporting this practice, and the panel was unable to judge the desirable effects of D10 versus D5 given the lack of evidence.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — metabolic abnormalities and mitochondrial evaluation: During vomiting episodes, mild mitochondrial dysfunction is suggested by anion gap metabolic acidosis that "is often 15–20 mg/dL", lactic acidosis, urinary ketosis early in the episode, and/or hypoglycemia, and these findings "by themselves do not necessitate a comprehensive metabolic workup". When present, early testing with quantitative urine organic acids and plasma amino acids "can confirm mild mitochondrial dysfunction" by elevated urine ketones, Krebs cycle intermediates, and/or dicarboxylic acids, while "urine organic acids are typically normal" when asymptomatic or after several hours of intravenous dextrose. In some cases, episodes may reflect mitochondrial disease with severe anion gap metabolic acidosis " > 20 mg/dL", insulin resistance, and/or multisystem failure such as cardiomyopathy or seizures.

Recognition and Management of DKA

Pathophysiology and Epidemiology of DKA

DKA is an acute metabolic crisis that occurs due to the relative insufficiency of insulin, not due to hyperglycemia, per se. – The lack of adequate insulin-induced glucose uptake at end-organs results in (1) release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, which are then oxidized to ketone bodies that bind sodium and potassium, and (2) a perceived hypoglycemia and subsequent release of glucagon stores, worsening any actual hyperglycemia and in turn causing an osmotic diuresis that leads to hypovolemia and further electrolyte depletion.

As many as 5 to 10% of pregnant patients with preexisting diabetes may have their pregnancy complicated by DKA. The incidence of DKA among patients with diabetes who are pregnant is reported to be much higher than among females with diabetes who are not pregnant. While most cases occur in individuals with preexisting T1DM, around 15% of cases present in individuals with T2DM or GDM in modern series. – Most cases of DKA are observed in the third trimester of pregnancy, and while maternal mortality associated with DKA is rare, recent studies have shown a fetal mortality rate of ranging from 6 to 16%. – Thus, it is crucial to maintain a high index of suspicion in order to promptly recognize and manage DKA to improve both maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Recently published data suggest that DKA may be underrecognized in pregnancy. This may be in part because symptoms of DKA (such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain) overlap significantly with complaints typical of otherwise normal pregnancies, and perhaps in part because DKA in pregnancy frequently presents with euglycemia and sometimes with near-normal laboratory findings such as pH and potassium levels. Reported rates of euglycemia in DKA during pregnancy range from 5 to 50% depending on the population.

Euglycemia may be common in DKA during pregnancy (1) because the mother is predisposed to an accelerated starvation ketosis characterized by a decrease in glycogenolysis and hepatic glucose production, (2) because of a switch from use of hepatic glycogen to lipolysis and ketone production during fasting, (3) because of increased glucose uptake by the feto-placental unit, (4) because of a physiologic hemodilution of blood glucose, and (5) because of an increased glomerular filtration rate with increased renal glucose excretion.

Side effects of KD

Side effects to KD are significant factors influencing treatment adherence. More than 40 adverse effects have been associated with KD, with the most notable being gastrointestinal discomfort, hyperlipidemia, kidney stones, and osteoporosis (as illustrated in Fig. 1). Gastrointestinal discomfort is the most frequently reported side effect, primarily presenting as constipation, nausea, and vomiting. This may be related to the high fat content inherent in the KD. Effective measures for alleviating these symptoms include the administration of enemas, increased dietary fiber intake, and the use of medications to manage nausea and vomiting. KD may induce transient hyperlipidemia; in a single-center prospective study, 389 children with epilepsy treated with KD experienced hyperlipidemia at a rate of 50.8%. Following adjustments to the high-fat content of KD and administering atorvastatin (10 mg/kg) for three months, the lipid profiles of all children returned to normal. However, it remains uncertain whether KD can lead to long-term hyperlipidemia.

### Prediabetes directly deteriorates into diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome triggered by acute pancreatitis: a case report illustrating a "Chicken and egg" paradigm in ketosis-prone diabetes [^111pZAm4]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic crises occur most often in patients with type 1 diabetes and occasionally in type 2 diabetes, especially under stressful conditions. However, a diabetic crisis occurring directly from prediabetes is an unusual phenomenon.

Case Report

A 45-year-old woman presented with postprandial left upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She had a past medical history of prediabetes with impaired fasting glucose and HbA1c 6.4%. On admission, routine laboratory tests showed high anion gap metabolic acidosis (pH 6.92), anion gap 41 mmol/L, blood glucose 931 mg/dL, beta-hydroxybutyrate 28 mmol/L, and calculated effective osmolarity 322 mOsm/kg; she was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS), and DKA-related abdominal pain. Later, the patient was found to have elevated lipase and amylase, and diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Since DKA can induce abdominal pain and nonspecific lipase elevation, both of which are characteristics of acute pancreatitis, while acute pancreatitis can conversely trigger DKA, there exists a "chicken and egg" paradigm. Therefore, the differential diagnosis is discussed.

Conclusion

It is important to differentiate DKA from concomitant causes of abdominal pain to avoid missing the underlying etiology, which can be the trigger for DKA. During diabetic crises, treating the underlying trigger is just as important as managing metabolic derangements in order to achieve favorable outcomes; meanwhile, managing acute pancreatitis-associated hyperglycemia can promote recovery. Additionally, diabetic crisis that directly evolves from prediabetes illustrates an atypical form of diabetes called ketosis-prone diabetes; we briefly discuss its clinical characteristics, classification, and follow-up.

### Optimisation of hyperemesis gravidarum management through an emergency department setting [^115DEyyn]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are common, affecting women in up to 80% of pregnancies. Hyperemesis gravidarum represents the severe end of the spectrum and is associated with dehydration, weight loss of > 5% and electrolyte imbalance. Diagnosis is dependent on exclusion of other causes like gastritis and urinary tract infections and inclusion of those with ketones of four or more on urinalysis. It occurs in 0.3%–3.6% of pregnancies with variable recurrence rates between 15.2% and 81%.

Hyperemesis gravidarum has several aetiological theories but is primarily associated with increased beta human chorionic gonadotropin hormone levels. It affects women in the first trimester of pregnancy, with symptoms peaking at approximately 9 weeks and mostly resolving by 20 weeks in 90% of women.

Treatment is supportive focusing on fluid, vitamin and electrolyte replacement as well as antiemetic therapy.

One should not dismiss the increasing evidence which highlights the psychological burden of hyperemesis gravidarum, not to mention the financial cost to both the patient and the healthcare system.

### Prediabetes directly deteriorates into diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome triggered by acute pancreatitis: a case report illustrating a "Chicken and egg" paradigm in ketosis-prone diabetes [^115NbUJh]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The patient presented with severe anion gap metabolic acidosis, anion gap of 41 mmol/L (Na⁺ − Cl⁻ − HCO₃⁻) and an albumin-corrected anion gap of 40 mmol/L [anion gap − 2.5 × (4 − albumin)]. This patient's high anion gap metabolic acidosis is likely primarily caused by DKA, with some contribution from the DKA-associated secondary lactic acidosis and volume depletion-induced pre-renal uremic acidosis.

Using Winter's formula [pCO₂ = (1.5 × HCO₃⁻) + 8 ± 2], we calculated the respiratory compensation to yield an expected pCO₂ between 15.6 and 19.6 mmHg. ABG revealed a pCO₂ of 16 mmHg, suggesting she had a primary metabolic acidosis with adequate respiratory compensation.

The delta gap was used to investigate the presence of a mixed metabolic acid–base disorder. The normal range of delta gap is from − 6 to + 6. If the delta gap is significantly positive (> + 6), a concomitant primary metabolic alkalosis is usually present; conversely, if the delta gap is significantly negative (< − 6), then a superimposed non-anion gap metabolic acidosis is usually present. In our case, the delta gap [(adjusted anion gap − 12) − (24 − HCO₃⁻)] of + 9 mmol/L indicated there was a co-existing primary metabolic alkalosis.

Meanwhile, the calculated effective osmolality (2 × Na + glucose/18) was 322 mOsm/kg; thus, the patient also had HHS.

The underlying mechanism for the co-existing primary metabolic alkalosis and HHS is likely due to severe hyperglycemia-related glycosuria as well as ketoacidosis-associated osmotic diuresis causing volume depletion. In addition, her nausea, vomiting, and poor oral tolerance worsened her dehydration, thereby causing a contraction alkalosis and the development of hyperosmolarity.

### Clinical research framework proposal for ketogenic metabolic therapy in glioblastoma [^1129zwvQ]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DON is the prototypical drug for broad-acting glutaminolysis inhibition, targeting multiple isoforms of glutaminases and glutamine-utilizing enzymes. DON is currently not FDA-approved, but has an extensive history of clinical testing, a relatively good safety profile at moderate doses, and could be revisited as a research therapy in its original or prodrug forms. Continuous daily parenteral administration produced dose-limiting side effects in previous clinical trials (most notably, oral mucositis, nausea, vomiting, and myelosuppression; premedication with antiemetics can be implemented prophylactically). Instead, congruent with the short half-life (1.2 h), low-dose intermittent administration would be preferable, as suggested by initial dose-escalation studies. Thus, future research may consider parenteral or oral administration in the 0.2 to 1.1 mg/kg/day range, adjusted to individual tolerance. Dosing frequency (continuous or intermittent) will be contingent upon route of administration, anti-tumor response, and safety. In more recent phase IIa studies, DON has been administered at 140 mg/m² (twice weekly) in 15-min infusions, combined with plasma glutamine depletion.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis associated with SGLT2i use: case series [^11616MkR]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EuDKA) associated with Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) use has been described but remains poorly understood. Data on Emergency Department (ED) presentation, resource utilization, and safety outcomes for these patients are lacking. We report a case series of patients diagnosed with EuDKA in the ED.

Methods

An electronic medical record search identified adult patients presenting to a large tertiary ED with EuDKA. They were screened for concurrent use of SGLT2i. Clinical presentation, resource utilization, safety, and disposition data were collected and described.

Results

Five patients were included for analysis. Median age [range] was 57 [43–73] years. Presenting symptoms included nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and altered mental status. Initial results included: serum glucose 191 mg/dL [176–215], venous pH 7.01 [6.95–7.30], serum HCO3 8 mEq/L [6–13], anion gap 27 [26–31], serum beta-hydroxybutyrate 9.9 mmol/L [9.2–12.3], and urine ketones 150 [150–150]. Patients remained on an insulin infusion for 18.77 h [11.25–56.48]. There were zero episodes of hypoglycemia and one episode of hypokalemia while on insulin infusion. Time to resolution of metabolic acidosis was 23.82 h [15.45–24.77].

Discussion

We report a case series of ED patients with EuDKA associated with SGLT2i use, and describe presentation characteristics, resource utilization, and safety outcomes. Emergency physicians should be aware of the association between SGLT2i use and EuDKA. An appropriate work-up should be pursued for patients taking an SGLT2i who present with symptoms suggestive of DKA, including nausea, vomiting, malaise, and altered mental status, or are noted to have an unexplained elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis.

### Clinical and biochemical profile, precipitants and prognostic factors of diabetic ketoacidosis: a retrospective study from a tertiary care center of north India [^114eKNmV]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

We aimed to retrospectively investigate the clinical and biochemical profile of Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) patients and various precipitating and prognostic factors.

Methods

This was a hospital-based retrospective observational study, conducted in a tertiary care hospital in north India, from March 2014 to March 2017.

Results

Among 50 patients who satisfied the study criteria, 10 (20%) had DKA as their first presentation. Most common symptoms were nausea and vomiting (74%). Noncompliance was the major precipitating cause in 26 cases (52%) followed by infections in 18 cases (36%). The mean value of blood sugar at presentation was 406.8 ± 130.4 mg/dl with serum ketone 5.38 ± 1.56 mmol/l and mean pH 7.128 ± 0.157 with severe DKA in 14 (28%) patients. Mean duration of hospital stay was 8.2. ± 5.0 days, and low hemoglobin (p = 0.019) and high pulse rate (p = 0.025) were independent predictors of a longer stay.

Conclusion

With intensive care, mortality did not occur; however, non-compliance remained the most common precipitating cause of DKA followed by infections.

Diabetes and tobacco/e-cigarette/cannabis use — counseling and adverse events: Individuals with diabetes should be advised to avoid vaping and using e-cigarettes, and if people are using e-cigarettes to quit, they should be advised to avoid using both combustible and electronic cigarettes, and if using only e-cigarettes, they should be advised to have a plan to quit these also; findings confirm there is no safe tobacco product. Evidence of specific increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis has been reported in adults with type 1 diabetes using cannabis, with an association to cannabis hyperemesis syndrome marked by severe nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Recommended diagnostic criteria for cannabis hyperemesis syndrome include a blood glucose of ≥ 250 mg/dL, an anion gap of > 10, a serum β-hydroxybutyrate level of > 0.6 mmol/L, a pH level of ≥ 7.4, and a bicarbonate level of ≥ 15 mmol/L, and health care professionals should consider cannabis hyperemesis syndrome in people with type 1 diabetes with pH ≥ 7.4 and bicarbonate ≥ 15 mmol/L in the presence of ketosis. Recent research shows no noticeable effect on glucose or insulin levels in adults with type 2 diabetes who use cannabidiol (CBD). A cluster randomized trial found statistically significant increases in quit rates and long-term abstinence rates (> 6 months) when smoking cessation interventions were offered through diabetes education clinics, regardless of motivation to quit at baseline, and the increased prevalence in availability and use of tobacco and cannabis products and the effect on the health of people with diabetes highlights the need to ask about use of these products, educate individuals regarding the associated risks, and provide support for cessation.

### Coexistence of diabetic ketoacidosis and thyrotoxicosis: a jeopardy of two endocrine emergencies [^116aFB8F]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Simultaneous occurrences of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and thyroid storm have long been known, but only a few cases have been reported to date. Both these endocrine emergencies demand timely diagnosis and management to prevent adverse outcomes. Due to the similarities in their clinical presentation, DKA can mask the diagnosis of thyroid storm and vice versa. This case report describes a patient with Graves' disease who presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. He was found to have severe DKA without an explicit history of diabetes mellitus. Further evaluation revealed that the patient also had a concomitant thyroid storm that was the likely cause of his DKA. Early recognition and appropriate management of both conditions resulted in a favourable outcome. This paper emphasises that a simultaneous thyroid storm diagnosis should be considered in patients with DKA, especially those with a known history of thyroid disorders.

17	PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, inform them that using JARDIANCE can increase their risk of life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis and that fatal ketoacidosis has occurred. For all other patients, inform them that JARDIANCE can cause potentially fatal ketoacidosis and that type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are risk factors.

Educate all patients on precipitating factors (such as insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, infection, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, dehydration, and alcohol abuse) and symptoms of ketoacidosis (including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and labored breathing). Inform patients that blood glucose may be normal even in the presence of ketoacidosis.

Advise patients that they may be asked to monitor ketones. If symptoms of ketoacidosis occur, instruct patients to discontinue JARDIANCE and seek medical attention immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Volume Depletion

Inform patients that symptomatic hypotension may occur with JARDIANCE and advise them to contact their healthcare provider if they experience such symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Inform patients that dehydration may increase the risk for hypotension, and to maintain adequate fluid intake.

Serious Urinary Tract Infections

Inform patients of the potential for urinary tract infections, which may be serious. Provide them with information on the symptoms of urinary tract infections. Advise them to seek medical advice if such symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Hypoglycemia

Inform patients that hypoglycemia has been reported when JARDIANCE is used with insulin secretagogues or insulin. Hypoglycemia may occur in pediatric patients regardless of concomitant antidiabetic treatment. Educate patients or caregivers on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist cases reported to United States poison centers, 2017–2022 [^111BktX4]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Although clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and tolerability of GLP-1RAs, side effects, especially gastrointestinal-related, are known to affect up to 10–40% of users. The most common related clinical effects reported for cases in our study were consistent with previous reports in the literature for this medication class. Adverse effects are more common during the early phase of treatment, when doses are initiated or increased. Adverse effects from GLP-1RAs can be mitigated through pausing up-titration or dose reduction. For patients experiencing profound side effects, medication discontinuation often leads to symptom abatement. Thus, most GLP-1RA side effects, especially gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, can be managed successfully in the outpatient setting. Both providers and patients should be cognizant that serious side effects can occur and that even desirable effects of GLP-1RAs, such as early satiety, must be monitored closely, because they may affect nutrition or hydration status. In fact, a recent scientific abstract described a case of life-threatening starvation ketoacidosis preceded by 5 days of nausea and vomiting that developed several weeks after starting tirzepatide for weight loss. Patients should be educated to recognize side effects so clinicians can address these promptly to prevent the development of complications. In addition, patients should be educated about the prevention of therapeutic errors, which accounted for more than three-fourths of reported cases. Dosing schedule systems and reminders may help prevent common scenarios, such as taking/giving the medication twice or too close together. Although reported for < 5% of cases in this study, providers should also be aware of the potential for patients to intentionally misuse/abuse GLP-1 agonists or use them for self-harm. This may be more common in populations with mental health or eating disorders, and screening for these conditions should be part of a clinician's approach when considering this class of medications.

### Defining the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in primary care: time to think differently [^113FQv9s]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

As a result of the osmotic diuretic effects associated with SGLT2is, mild volume depletion, orthostatic hypotension and dizziness may be observed in those receiving this treatment. Prior to initiation, blood pressure and volume status should be assessed and SGLT2is should not be initiated in hypotensive/hypovolaemic individuals. This is of particular importance in those with either HFrEF or CKD. If a person with CKD develops hypotension, physicians should aim to maintain stable doses of RAAS inhibitor which have been demonstrated to confer prognostic benefit. Other antihypertensives may be reduced, particularly diuretic dosing which would address volume depletion. If volume depletion occurs, SGLT2i treatment should be suspended until this is corrected. Patient education around the importance of maintaining adequate hydration is essential to minimize the incidence of these complications.

Although rare (0.1–0.5% in RCTs), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious life-threatening complication, can occur in people treated with SGLT2is. As a result of their insulin-independent effect on glycaemia, over a third of DKA cases associated with SGLT2is present in the absence of hyperglycaemia or with mildly elevated glucose levels (euglycaemic DKA), which can be difficult to diagnose. Thus, people prescribed SGLT2is should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if experiencing DKA symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) and should be evaluated for DKA and, if confirmed, SGLT2i therapy should be stopped. SGLT2is should not be restarted in individuals who have experienced DKA. In addition, individuals prescribed SGLT2is should be educated around sick day rules in case of acute illness or in pre-operative settings which should include information regarding the frequency of monitoring of blood glucose and ketone levels and the identification of symptoms of DKA.

Artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH) in dying patients — risks, burdens, and limited benefit are highlighted as follows: The role of ANH "needs to be re-evaluated in terms of the goals of comfort, relief of symptoms, and quality rather than quantity of life". ANH in dying patients "has been associated with increased nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea and repeated aspiration pneumonia, while fluids may cause or exacerbate dyspnea, bronchial secretions, urinary frequency, bladder distention, pulmonary edema and effusions and ascites". "The administration of ANH often requires the need for additional interventions such as catheters, blood draws, restraints and medications to manage complications of nutrition and hydration, which may cause discomfort". It also notes that "ANH can prevent the ketosis and dehydration that are a protective mechanism against potentially painful symptoms of dying". Hospice nurses observed that patients who "voluntarily refused both food and fluids experienced a good death within 2 weeks". In cancer patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, those "receiving parenteral nutrition had lower oral intake and higher fevers and infections as compared to patients not receiving parenteral nutrition". Overall, "Research has not shown that ANH prolongs life in patients with certain specific serious and terminal conditions".

Prior to initiation with dapagliflozin people with T1DM should be re-educated on their condition and should also undergo formal structured education focussed on mitigating the risk of DKA. An example of a healthcare professional checklist that may be used in relation to the use of dapagliflozin in people with T1DM, and which advises on information to be included in an education session, is provided in the Appendix in the electronic supplementary material. The risks associated with dapagliflozin treatment should be fully explained, but balanced against the positive impact on HbA1c, weight and time in optimal glucose range. People should be informed of the symptoms of DKA (rapid weight loss, nausea or vomiting, stomach pain, excessive thirst, fast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to the breath, a sweet or metallic taste in the mouth, or a different odour to urine or sweat), emphasising that DKA may occur even if blood glucose levels are within the normal range. Information should also be provided regarding DKA risk factors and the importance of ketone monitoring.

Very-low-calorie diets and ketogenic diets are increasingly popular dietary approaches to induce rapid weight loss, but are associated with an increased risk of DKA in people with T1DM. Therefore, anyone commencing on dapagliflozin should be strongly advised against such weight loss strategies and should also be educated regarding the importance of avoiding other important pro-ketogenic factors such as missed insulin doses.

People should also be educated on the management of blood glucose during periods of illness ('sick-day management'). This should include specific information regarding the frequency of blood glucose monitoring, blood glucose targets, blood ketone monitoring, appropriate adjustment of insulin doses and identifying early signs and symptoms of DKA. To complement the education, people with T1DM should be provided with the TREND-UK patient information leaflet 'Type 1 diabetes: What to do when you are ill'. People should be reminded of the seriousness of DKA and advised to discontinue dapagliflozin and call their GP or diabetes team, or go to the nearest accident and emergency (A&E) hospital, if they develop any DKA symptoms.

### Diabetic ketosis caused by the insulin analog aspart-induced anti-insulin antibody: successful treatment with the newest insulin analog glulisine [^116K9p68]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Anti-insulin antibodies induce immunological insulin resistance and poor diabetic control in insulin-treated diabetic patients. Recently, the prevalence and levels of anti-insulin antibodies have remarkably decreased as a consequence of the purity of insulin preparations and human insulin. The insulin analog insulin aspart exists as hexamers that rapidly dissociate into monomers and dimmers after the subcutaneous injection; therefore, insulin aspart is supposed to be less immunogenic than human recombinant insulin.

Here we report a type 1 diabetic patient who developed diabetic ketosis induced by severe insulin resistance caused by anti-insulin antibody after 6 years of insulin aspart use. He was treated with the newest insulin analog, insulin glulisine, which resulted in ameliorated glycemic control, reduced requirement of daily insulin, and decreased insulin binding rate by anti-insulin antibody.

A 48-year-old man developed type 1 diabetes in 2000. For the last 6 years, he has been treated with four daily insulin injections: three injections of insulin aspart before breakfast (6–8 units), lunch (6–8 units), and dinner (6–8 units) and one of insulin glargine (6 units) at bedtime. Home monitoring of blood glucose has not been performed for the last 3 years. He was admitted to hospital because of hypoglycemia in November 2009 and in July 2010. In August 2010, he was admitted to our hospital because of nausea and disturbed consciousness. His body weight was 49.4 kg and height 179.3 cm (BMI 15.4 kg/m²). Plasma glucose (868 mg/dL) and HbA₁c (13.1%) levels were significantly elevated. A blood test revealed elevated serum total ketone bodies (5,770 μmol/L; normal, < 130 μmol/L) and normal pH (pH = 7.366), suggesting the development of diabetic ketosis. Anti-insulin antibody (¹²⁵I-insulin binding rate, 43.9%; normal, < 0.4%) level was significantly elevated. Switching from insulin aspart to insulin glulisine ameliorated his blood glucose levels. His blood glucose levels were 130–160 mg/dL by using 4, 4, and 6 units of insulin glulisine before breakfast, lunch, and dinner, respectively, and 6 units of insulin glargine at bedtime, and he was discharged in September 2010. His HbA₁c level and ¹²⁵I-insulin binding rate by anti-insulin antibody significantly decreased to 11.3 and 35.3%, respectively, after 4 months of insulin glulisine use.

### Effect of weight-maintaining ketogenic diet on glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in obese T2D subjects [^112u7mTd]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Lipid profile, blood pressure

Systolic blood pressure decreased modestly during the standard diet treatment and did not change in the keto diet and keto diet plus esters groups (table 1). No significant changes in diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or triglycerides were observed in any of the three dietary intervention groups (table 1).

Calorie intake during 10 days of diet treatment

The mean daily caloric intake required to maintain a stable body weight was 2549 ± 133, 2756 ± 167, and 3165 ± 133 in the standard diet, keto diet and keto diet plus keto ester groups. The estimated energy expenditure at baseline was higher in the keto diet plus keto ester group compared with the keto diet group which was higher than that in the standard diet group.

Adverse events

One subject reported mild nausea when ingesting the keto ester supplement but consumed all three daily supplements and completed the entire study. Otherwise, there were no adverse events.

### Lactation ketoacidosis induced by breastfeeding while on a ketogenic diet [^111xeN5f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Lactation ketoacidosis is a very rare cause of metabolic acidosis in breastfeeding patients. We present a case of a 34-year-old female, 8-weeks postpartum, who was breastfeeding while also on the ketogenic diet. She developed dyspnea, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and an inability to tolerate oral intake for several days. She presented with a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 33, HCO3 of 5.1 mmol/L, venous pH of 7.045, and serum b-hydroxybutyrate of 7.4 mmol/L. She was treated in the emergency department with intravenous normal saline and intravenous dextrose, with prompt transfer to the intensive care unit for treatment with an intravenous sodium bicarbonate drip and an intravenous insulin drip with dextrose. After normalization of laboratory values, she re-developed an elevated anion gap acidosis after breastfeeding in the ICU overnight. She was started on a carbohydrate-rich diet and made a full recovery without reported repeat incidences. We provide a summary of our case, discuss known causes of lactation ketoacidosis, and emphasize the importance of a thorough history and physical. In this case a dietary history was more helpful than a very expensive laboratory and imaging evaluation.

### Life-threatening dapagliflozin-associated euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis in a postoperative patient [^111XTFyE]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Euglyceamic diabetic ketoacidosis (EuDKA) is an uncommon but serious diabetes mellitus complication associated with risk factors such as fasting, surgery, pregnancy and, more recently, the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). This case is of a woman with type 2 diabetes and hypertension in her 50s who underwent an incarcerated umbilical hernia repair and abdominoplasty. Two days after discharge, she was readmitted with nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, low-grade fever and breathing difficulty. Preoperatively, her diabetes management included an SGLT2i. She was diagnosed with EuDKA with high anion gap metabolic acidosis, a medical emergency similar to diabetic ketoacidosis. The normal blood glucose levels in EuDKA can mask the condition, which poses a conundrum for physicians in the emergency department/intensive care units as it may delay diagnosis and treatment, worsening the outcomes. To mitigate this risk, SGLT2i should be stopped 3–4days before planned surgery with appropriate adjustments to the insulin regimen.

### Ketogenic diet ameliorates MASLD via balancing mitochondrial dynamics and improving mitochondrial dysfunction [^114Zo8Zq]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously termed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is characterized by an excess of lipids in the liver and components of the metabolic syndrome, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. It's projected to impact one billion people worldwide, constituting roughly 38% of the entire global populace. In 2024, the FDA approved resmetirom, the first drug for the treatment of non-cirrhotic metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. However, resmetirom has side effects such as diarrhea, nausea, and drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Therefore, traditional interventions such as diet and exercise remain healthy, cost-effective interventions for treating MASLD

The ketogenic diet (KD) emphasizes high fats, minimal carbohydrates, and moderate protein. It triggers a metabolic shift from glucose to fatty acids as the primary energy source, leading to the production of ketone bodies for use by other tissues and organs. Besides its well-known role in treating intractable epilepsy, the KD has also been explored for managing various metabolic disorders, including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease risk, and MASLD A meta-analysis has demonstrated that, compared to conventional diets, KD demonstrates greater efficacy in reducing blood lipid, blood glucose, and body weight among overweight individuals, particularly those with type-2-diabetes. KD has also shown promise in improving MASLD phenotypes by aiding in weight loss, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and making ketone bodies potent mediators of fibrosis and inflammation. Another study confirmed that KD reduces HFD-induced hepatic triglyceride levels by balancing mitochondrial homeostasis. However, the key role of mitochondrial-based mechanisms in KD improves MASLD deserves further investigation.

### Potassium bicarbonate (effer-K) [^112guLFx]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Pharmacology

Potassium ion is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues, whereas sodium ion is relatively low in concentration. In extracellular fluid the opposite exists, sodium ion being principal and potassium ion being low. The situation is maintained by an active membrane-bound enzyme (Na+K+ATPase). This potassium ion concentration gradient is essential to conduct nerve impulses in such specialized tissues as the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle; and in addition, to maintain normal renal function, acid-base balance, and various cellular metabolic functions. Elimination values are 90% renal and 10% fecal.

Potassium depletion may occur if the rate of potassium ion loss by renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract exceeds the rate of potassium ion intake. Such depletion usually develops slowly as a consequence of prolonged therapy with oral diuretics, primary or secondary hyperaldosteronism, diabetic ketoacidosis, severe diarrhea, or inadequate replacement of potassium in patients on prolonged parenteral nutrition. Potassium depletion due to these causes is usually accompanied by a concomitant deficiency of chloride and is manifested by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Potassium depletion may produce weakness, fatigue, mood or mental changes, nausea, vomiting, disturbances of cardiac rhythm (primarily ectopic beats), prominent U-waves in the electrocardiogram, and in advanced cases flaccid paralysis and/or impaired ability to concentrate urine.

### Ketoacidosis is not always due to diabetes [^113AqPuz]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic alcoholism is a frequently unrecognised cause of ketoacidosis. Most patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis present with normal or low glucose, but this condition can present with hyperglycaemia. This can lead to misdiagnosis of diabetes ketoacidosis and, therefore, inappropriate treatment with insulin. We describe a 37-year-old Caucasian woman with chronic pancreatitis secondary to excess alcohol consumption, admitted with abdominal pain and vomiting, fulfilling the criteria for diabetes ketoacidosis. She was treated according to diabetes ketoacidosis protocol and experienced a hypoglycaemic attack within an hour of initiation of insulin. On review of her history, she was found to have three similar episodes over the past 12 months. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can present with hyperglycaemia due to relative deficiency of insulin and relative surplus in counter-regulatory stress hormones including glucagon. Awareness of the syndrome with a detailed history helps to differentiate alcohol ketoacidosis from diabetes ketoacidosis and prevent iatrogenic hypoglycaemia.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines on the diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^116NcUGC]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) in children — abortive intravenous (IV) management: The guideline panel suggests early presentation and immediate IV fluid therapy for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents not responding to outpatient abortive therapies (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects). Regarding fluid selection, remarks note there is no research evidence regarding the use of D10 versus D5 IV fluids, make no recommendations for specific IV fluids due to lack of evidence and potential delays, and state that IV fluids should be determined by the evaluating physician with goals of rehydration and alleviation of electrolyte disturbances and ketosis. When outpatient therapy fails, the guideline panel suggests using an IV NK-1 receptor antagonist (e.g., fosaprepitant) for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents not responding to outpatient abortive therapies (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects), and suggests using an IV 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (e.g., ondansetron) for acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents not responding to outpatient abortive therapies (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects).

### Awareness and knowledge of diabetic ketoacidosis in people with type 1 diabetes: a cross-sectional, multicenter survey [^112fqx7D]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

The most common multiple-choice causes of DKA were missed insulin injection (61%) and illness (54%) (see figure 1A). A total of 85 (25%) participants stated 'too low' or 'forgotten insulin administration' as causes of DKA, whereas 62 (19%) participants attributed 'high glucose values' and 5 (2%) participants specifically stated 'pregnancy', 'stress' and 'diseases' as causes of DKA.

Figure 1
(A) Picked answer options for potential causes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) by participants. (B) Most frequently picked DKA symptoms out of multiple answers to choose from. (C) ORs for individuals reporting no DKA compared with those with several experienced DKA episodes. ORs with 95% CI are depicted. *Indicates atypical symptoms. BMI, body mass index.

With regard to free-text symptoms of DKA most frequently 'nausea', 'vomiting' or 'abdominal pain' were mentioned by 59 (18%) participants; 'Thirst', 'need to urinate' or 'dry mouth' by 44 (13%) participants; and symptoms such as 'fruity' or 'acetonic odour/urine' by 33 (10%) participants. A total of 30 (9%) participants mentioned further symptoms of DKA such as 'tiredness', 'sweating', 'visual disturbances' or 'coma'. Participants were then offered multiple-choice answers including atypical symptoms of DKA. Answers can be found in figure 1B. Symptoms not typical for DKA that were offered included aggression, muscular pain, olfactorial disorder, increased appetite and hearing disorder.

There was a significant but low positive correlation between diabetes duration and knowledge of DKA (Spearman r = 0.187; 95% CI 0.0714 to 0.298; p = 0.001).

Ketone body testing

A total of 185 (64%) individuals did not test for ketones at all, 124 (56%) participants tested less than every 6 months and 78 participants (38%) only if glucose was high or testing was needed. The last testing was longer than 1 year ago or never happened in a total of 165 participants (63%). A total of 148 individuals (60%) reported that their ketone test strips were either expired or they did not know (see table 2).

### Dapagliflozin (SGLT2-I) induced euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis [^114z2CxV]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i) have become a popular therapeutic strategy in the management of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary site of action of SGLT2-i is at the proximal renal convoluted tubule. They work by blocking SGLT2 receptors, sodium-dependent glucose co-transport molecules, which in turn prevents glucose reabsorption, facilitating glucosuria, improving glycaemic control as well as a moderate degree of weight loss. We report the case of a 51-year-old woman admitted to the acute medical unit with abdominal pain and vomiting, who was diagnosed with euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to recent initiation of an SGLT2-i medication (dapagliflozin). Clinicians should be aware of this rare side effect of SGLT2-i, to circumvent delays in patient management.

### Dextrose saline compared with normal saline rehydration of hyperemesis gravidarum: a randomized controlled trial [^111SkzEP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare 5% dextrose-0.9% saline against 0.9% saline solution in the intravenous rehydration of hyperemesis gravidarum.

Methods

Women at their first hospitalization for hyperemesis gravidarum were enrolled on admission to the ward and randomly assigned to receive either 5% dextrose-0.9% saline or 0.9% saline by intravenous infusion at a rate 125 mL/h over 24 hours in a double-blind trial. All participants also received thiamine and an antiemetic intravenously. Oral intake was allowed as tolerated. Primary outcomes were resolution of ketonuria and well-being (by 10-point visual numerical rating scale) at 24 hours. Nausea visual numerical rating scale scores were obtained every 8 hours for 24 hours.

Results

Persistent ketonuria rates after the 24-hour study period were 10 of 101 (9.9%) compared with 11 of 101 (10.9%) (P > .99; relative risk 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.4–2.2) and median (interquartile range) well-being scores at 24 hours were 9 (8–10) compared with 9 (8–9.5) (P = 0.73) in the 5% dextrose-0.9% saline and 0.9% saline arms, respectively. Repeated measures analysis of variance of the nausea visual numerical rating scale score as assessed every 8 hours during the 24-hour study period showed a significant difference in favor of the 5% dextrose-0.9% saline arm (P = 0.046) with the superiority apparent at 8 and 16 hours, but the advantage had dissipated by 24 hours. Secondary outcomes of vomiting, resolution of hyponatremia, hypochloremia and hypokalemia, length of hospitalization, duration of intravenous antiemetic, and rehydration were not different.

Conclusions

Intravenous rehydration with 5% dextrose-0.9% saline or 0.9% saline solution in women hospitalized for hyperemesis gravidarum produced similar outcomes.

### The ketogenic diet: initiation at goal calories versus gradual caloric advancement [^115Lr8ha]. Pediatric Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Inpatient initiation of the ketogenic diet has historically involved fasting followed by gradual advancement of calories and/or diet ratio. Complications during this initiation period are common. We sought to determine if the initiation of the diet at goal calories would reduce these complications while maintaining efficacy.

Methods

Sixty patients were admitted to a tertiary care hospital for elective initiation of the ketogenic diet between October 2007 and January 2013. All patients were placed on a ketogenic diet initiation pathway. In 2010, the pathway was modified from gradual caloric advancement to initiation at goal calories. We selected 30 consecutive patients before and after the change for comparison. Each child's record was reviewed for the occurrence of hypoglycemia, number of days to reach full ketosis (defined as 4 + urine ketones), acidosis requiring commencement of sodium citrate, length of admission, and long-term efficacy.

Results

Both methods of initiation had similar rates of dehydration, vomiting, lethargy, and irritability. More patients initiated at goal received sodium citrate (P = 0.005); however, mean daily values of carbon dioxide were not significantly different. Onset of ketosis was slightly delayed (P = 0.009) in patients initiated at goal, but length of stay was not affected (P > 0.1). Hypoglycemia was uncommon and rates were similar between the groups. Efficacy at 3 months was better in patients initiated at full calories (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Initiation of the ketogenic diet full calories is a reasonable alternative to the current standard practice of gradual advancement of calories and/or diet ratio.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis… [^115yTEZQ]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Three key features of diabetic acidosis are hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidosis. The conditions that cause these metabolic abnormalities overlap. The primary differential diagnosis for hyperglycemia is hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, which is discussed in the Stoner article 21on page 1723 of this issue. Common problems that produce ketosis include alcoholism and starvation. Metabolic states in which acidosis is predominant include lactic acidosis and ingestion of drugs such as salicylates and methanol. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS DKA can develop in less than 24 hours. 3 Metabolic changes occur one and one half to two hours earlier in patients who are managed only with a short-acting insulin such as lispro. 22 Patients with DKA usually present with polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, weakness, and Kussmaul's respirations. Nausea and vomiting are present in 50 to 80 percent of patients, and abdominal pain is present in about 30 percent.

23 Coffee-ground emesis, usually from hemorrhagic gastritis, occurs in about 25 percent of vomiting patients. 3 Often, the patient's breath will have a fruity odor. Body temperature usually is normal or low, even with an infection. If the patient's temperature is elevated, infection invariably is present. 23 Signs of dehydration, such as dry mucous membranes, tachycardia, and hypotension, often are found. Most patients are about 10 percent dehydrated. Consciousness ranges from alert to confused to a comatose state in less than 20 percent of patients.
3. POTASSIUM Whole body potassium deficits typically are 3 to 5 mEq per L. Acidosis increases potassium levels and glucose administered with insulin lowers them. Before treatment of DKA, the level of potassium usually is normal or elevated. Potassium should be started as soon as adequate urine output is confirmed and the potassium level is less than 5 mEq per L.

For example, in a patient with a serum glucose concentration of 600 mg per dL and a measured serum sodium level of 130, the true serum sodium level is 130 + = 138. A high serum sodium level almost always indicates hypernatremic dehydration.

### Screening diabetic patients with a ketone dip test… [^1147D7Cw]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and, to a lesser degree, diabetic ketosis are potentially dangerous complications of diabetes. Seriously ill patients are easy to detect clinically, but well-appearing diabetic patients who present with vague symptoms such as malaise, nausea and hyperglycemia with ketonemia are more difficult to identify. Detection of diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetic ketosis is accomplished on the basis of the urine ketone dip test, the anion gap or the serum bicarbonate level. Schwab and associates compared the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of these three screening tests in the detection of ketonemia, with or without acidosis, in diabetic patients. The study was conducted in an emergency department of a large hospital. Patients were tested for the presence of ketonemia using all three screening techniques. If serum ketones were detected, an arterial blood gas analysis was performed.

The criteria for the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis were a serum glucose level greater than 200 mg per dL, metabolic acidosis with a corrected pH of less than 7. 3, a serum bicarbonate concentration less than 15 mEq per L and ketonemia, positive at 1: 2 dilution or greater. The criteria for the diagnosis of diabetic ketosis were a serum glucose concentration greater than 200 mg per dL, a positive serum ketone test and lack of acidosis as already defined. Of the 697 patients enrolled in the study, 98 were diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis and 88 with diabetic ketosis. The urine ketone dip test was highly sensitive for diabetic ketoacidosis and diabetic ketosis with or without acidosis. A negative urine dip test eliminated the need for any other screening, although it should be noted that the hyperglycemic, hyperosmolar nonketotic state can occur with extreme hyperglycemia and absent serum ketones.

If the urine dip test is positive for ketones, a serum ketone test should be performed to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of diabetic ketosis or diabetic ketoacidosis. Limitations of the urine ketone dip stick test include false-positive results caused by captopril and other free sulfhydryl drugs. Other ketotic states such as alcoholic and starvation ketosis can also produce a positive urine ketone test without corresponding serum ketones, affecting the specificity of the urine dip test for detecting ketonemia.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment… [^116LZ16B]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology DKA results from insulin deficiency from new-onset diabetes, insulin noncompliance, prescription or illicit drug use, and increased insulin need because of infection. These components are converted to acetyl coenzyme A, some of which enter the Krebs cycle for energy production; the remainder are broken down into ketones. Ketones can be used for energy, but accumulate rapidly. Glycogen and proteins are catabolized to form glucose. Together, these factors promote hyperglycemia, which leads to an osmotic diuresis resulting in dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and a hyperosmolar state. Diagnosis TYPICAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION The presentation of DKA varies with severity and comorbid conditions. Polyuria with polydipsia is the most common presenting symptom and was found in 98 percent of persons in one study of childhood type 1 diabetes.

Other common symptoms included weight loss, fatigue, dyspnea, vomiting, preceding febrile illness, abdominal pain, and polyphagia. 17 Dehydration causes tachycardia, poor skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, and orthostatic hypotension. The metabolic acidosis may lead to compensatory deep respirations, whereas increased acetone can be sensed as a fruity smell on the patient's breath. Mental status can vary from somnolence to lethargy and coma. A detailed evaluation may reveal precipitating factors, especially nonadherence to medical regimens and infection, which are common causes of DKA. POTASSIUM Although potassium is profoundly depleted in persons with DKA, decreased insulin levels, acidosis, and volume depletion cause elevated extracellular concentrations. Potassium levels should be monitored every two to four hours in the early stages of DKA.

Hydration alone will cause potassium to drop because of dilution. Improved renal perfusion will increase excretion. 30, 40 Signs of cerebral edema that require immediate evaluation include headache, persistent vomiting, hypertension, bradycardia, and lethargy and other neurologic changes. Other complications of DKA include hypokalemia, hypoglycemia, acute renal failure, and shock. Less common problems can include rhabdomyolysis.
