## Question

decomponsated cirrohosis outpatient management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step outpatient management plan for decompensated cirrhosis, preserving the reasoning flow and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define decompensated cirrhosis and stage severity. Then, I should verify the core elements of outpatient care: ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding prophylaxis, nutrition, and renal issues. Next, I will review transplant referral thresholds and palliative care integration. After that, I need to check special circumstances like surgery, pregnancy, and travel. Finally, I will ensure quality metrics, care bundles, and follow-up pathways are addressed, and I will double-check any areas where my initial assumptions might be off, correcting them as needed.

> Let me first confirm the definition and staging framework so I don't miss the severity implications. Decompensated cirrhosis is defined by the development of clinically overt complications: ascites, variceal hemorrhage, or overt hepatic encephalopathy; median survival drops to roughly 2 years after the first decompensation, underscoring the need for aggressive complication management and early transplant evaluation [^116pNGrx] [^117VKS9P]. I should confirm severity using Child-Pugh and MELD/UKELD, and I need to remember that UKELD ≥ 49 is the UK threshold for transplant listing, which helps me anchor prognosis and referral timing [^116XgxvK].

> Now, I will examine ascites management, but wait, let me verify the fundamentals before proposing diuretics. New-onset ascites warrants confirmation of portal hypertension physiology (SAAG > 11 g/L) and exclusion of alternative causes; if ascites increases, becomes painful, or fever develops, I should promptly perform diagnostic paracentesis to exclude SBP, because missing SBP delays life-saving antibiotics and worsens outcomes [^116VMyG8]. I should double-check that secondary SBP prophylaxis is indicated after a prior episode, with norfloxacin 400 mg daily, ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily, or co-trimoxazole 960 mg daily as acceptable options, while recognizing that rifaximin used for HE may also reduce SBP risk and could obviate a second systemic antibiotic in some cases [^111VxjaL]. For diuretics, I need to ensure a stepwise approach with spironolactone first, add furosemide if needed, and titrate to about 0.5–1 kg/day weight loss while monitoring renal function and electrolytes; hold or reduce diuretics if AKI or encephalopathy emerges, and consider TIPS for refractory ascites after careful selection and transplant consideration [^111VxjaL] [^115455tV]. Hold on, I should verify the role of long-term albumin; the ANSWER trial suggested survival benefit with weekly albumin, but confounding by supervised care tempers enthusiasm, so routine outpatient albumin is not broadly recommended outside trials or select programs, and I should frame it as investigational rather than standard [^111VxjaL] [^111NyzvM].

> Next, I should review hepatic encephalopathy, and I need to ensure I'm not overlooking precipitants. Standard outpatient therapy is lactulose titrated to 2–3 soft stools daily, with rifaximin 550 mg twice daily added for prevention of recurrence; I should confirm that rifaximin is continued long term after an episode to reduce recurrence risk, and I must screen for and treat precipitating factors like infection, constipation, dehydration, or sedatives at each visit [^116VZBsx]. But wait, what if adherence is a concern? I should provide clear education and consider a self-management toolkit to reduce readmissions and improve transitions of care, especially for HE-related admissions [^115praDH].

> I will now examine variceal bleeding prophylaxis, and I should double-check surveillance cadence in decompensated disease. All patients with decompensated cirrhosis who are not on NSBB should undergo upper endoscopy to screen for varices, and given higher progression risk, annual surveillance is reasonable; small varices in Child-Pugh C warrant primary prophylaxis with NSBB if tolerated, and medium-to-large varices require NSBB or band ligation, with NSBB preferred when feasible and banding for those intolerant or contraindicated [^114PNDYY]. For secondary prophylaxis after a bleed, I need to ensure combination therapy with NSBB plus banding, and consider TIPS for rebleeding despite optimized medical-endoscopic therapy or when refractory ascites coexists, coordinating with transplant evaluation when appropriate [^114PNDYY] [^116XgxvK].

> Let me consider nutrition, because sarcopenia silently worsens outcomes. I should confirm that all patients with decompensated cirrhosis are screened for malnutrition and sarcopenia using liver-specific tools, and that a dietitian-led plan targets 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day protein with small, frequent meals and a bedtime snack to blunt overnight catabolism; protein should not be restricted even in HE, and branched-chain amino acids can be considered in refractory HE to augment standard therapy [^114CA7S3] [^117PMsMf]. I need to ensure I'm not conflating obesity with adequate muscle mass; sarcopenic obesity is common, so weight-loss strategies must preserve muscle and be supervised carefully in decompensated disease [^112zydVW].

> I should confirm renal and electrolyte management next. Hyponatremia is common and often hypervolemic; management centers on fluid restriction to about 1–1.5 L/day, careful diuretic adjustment, and close electrolyte monitoring, with vigilance for HRS-AKI if creatinine rises and blood pressure falls; in that scenario, I need to stop diuretics, avoid nephrotoxins, and arrange urgent evaluation for terlipressin and albumin if indicated, recognizing that outpatient HRS management is limited and often requires inpatient therapy [^114beeQs] [^115sSBYo]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overusing albumin in the outpatient setting; outside specific indications, routine albumin is not standard, aligning with the uncertainty noted above [^111VxjaL].

> Next, I should review transplant referral, and I need to ensure I don't wait too long. Patients with irreversible decompensation and UKELD ≥ 49 should be referred for liver transplantation, with earlier referral favored when feasible; for alcohol-related disease, I should confirm at least 3 months of validated abstinence and ongoing support before listing, documenting adherence and relapse prevention plans clearly [^116XgxvK]. I should double-check that the local team maintains monthly surveillance and communicates changes promptly to the transplant center while the patient is on the waiting list, as deterioration can necessitate status updates or transfer for higher-acuity care [^113kzJz1].

> Palliative care deserves parallel attention, and I need to correct the misconception that it equals hospice. Palliative care can and should be integrated alongside disease-directed therapies, with early referral for Child-Pugh C, repeated admissions, ongoing alcohol use in ARLD, or in those not transplant candidates; primary palliative care by hepatology teams includes symptom assessment, basic advance care planning, and caregiver support, with specialty palliative care for complex symptoms or goals-of-care discussions [^113yZnHD] [^116MzKBZ]. I should confirm that structured symptom management for pain, dyspnea, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction is offered, using acetaminophen as first-line analgesic and avoiding NSAIDs, reserving low-dose oxycodone or hydromorphone cautiously when necessary, and employing nonpharmacologic strategies whenever possible [^112TA27V] [^113hWy2Q].

> Special circumstances require forethought, so let me verify key scenarios. For surgery, elective procedures in decompensated cirrhosis carry high risk; Child-Pugh C or MELD > 20 should prompt deferment until after transplant when possible, and hernia repairs are often best timed with transplant or avoided unless life-threatening complications arise; preoperative optimization of nutrition, portal hypertension, and frailty is essential, ideally at experienced centers [^116gdpoc] [^112RNz4k]. For pregnancy, I should confirm that diuretics, rifaximin, and most prophylactic antibiotics are generally avoided, beta-blockers and lactulose can continue, and vaginal delivery is preferred when feasible to mitigate wound complications; any decompensation warrants urgent multidisciplinary management and transplant center involvement [^1174iwHf]. For travel, I need to ensure patients carry medication summaries, secure adequate insurance, and complete indicated vaccinations, recognizing that decompensated patients face higher travel risks and should coordinate with their transplant team if listed [^114bZvAp].

> I should double-check that quality improvement tools are embedded in routine care. Discharge and outpatient care bundles improve reliability by standardizing ascites, HE, variceal, renal, and alcohol-related actions; early post-discharge follow-up within 2 weeks and nurse-led clinics support titration, surveillance, and education, reducing preventable admissions and improving patient experience [^111PLsAv] [^114cbpNN]. Let me verify that we also track process and outcome metrics such as variceal screening completion, SBP prophylaxis after a prior episode, nutrition assessment, and transplant referral timeliness, aligning with BSG's emphasis on standardized, multidisciplinary outpatient frameworks [^112bQeDM].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal monitoring is explicit. Every visit should include weight and blood pressure, diuretic and lactulose adherence, encephalopathy symptoms, infection surveillance, and labs including CBC, INR, creatinine/eGFR, sodium, and LFTs; MELD or UKELD should be recalculated periodically to inform prognosis and transplant readiness, and any new decompensation should trigger reassessment of goals of care and palliative care needs [^117YPHnV] [^114cbpNN]. Hold on, I should verify that we also screen for HCC every 6 months with ultrasound with or without AFP in all cirrhotics, as this remains standard even in decompensated disease when life expectancy exceeds 6 months, and integrate this into the care bundle to avoid missed surveillance [^116BmY3F].

Outpatient management of decompensated cirrhosis centers on **multidisciplinary care** [^116pNGrx] to prevent and treat complications, with structured follow-up and patient education to reduce readmissions and improve outcomes [^111PLsAv]. Core elements include **dietary sodium restriction** [^112crA1i] and stepwise diuretics for ascites, lactulose with or without rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and nonselective beta-blockers or band ligation for variceal prophylaxis [^114PNDYY]. Regular labs, imaging, and clinical assessments are essential to detect and manage complications early [^1127ouKc]. Early transplant referral is critical for eligible patients [^116XgxvK], and palliative care should be integrated for symptom control and advance care planning [^114N3siz].

---

### Optimal management of the inpatient with decompensated cirrhosis [^117AEPPC]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Over the past several years, there has been a wealth of new data pertaining to the management of complications of cirrhosis, resulting in several important updates to best practices and consensus guidelines. Despite these advancements and numerous recent targeted quality initiatives, hospitalizations resulting from complications of cirrhosis remain frequent, costly and associated with poor patient outcomes. An emphasis on evidence-based management of hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis has the potential to decrease readmission rates and length of stay while improving overall patient outcomes. Herein, we provide an updated, evidence-based overview of the optimal inpatient management of the most frequently encountered complications associated with cirrhosis.

When to refer for transplant

LT is the definitive treatment for selected patients with DC and should be considered when the severity of liver disease incurs a likelihood of poor survival or impaired quality of life. A UK clinical guideline outlining the process of LT assessment, including who and how to refer, has recently been published. To summarise, the over-riding principles of LT in the UK are that anticipated life expectancy after LT must exceed that without. A UK Model for End-stage liver disease (UKELD) score of 49 is the equipoise at which the predicted 1 year mortality without LT matches that after LT and is therefore the current minimum listing threshold for elective LT in those with irreversible decompensation.

In the absence of variant conditions, we recommend that referral for LT is considered when a patient with chronic liver disease develops the typical features of DC (ie, jaundice, ascites, variceal bleeding or HE) and UKELD ≥ 49. Early referral is preferable because a patient can become too unwell for LT, if the referral is made too late. The referring clinician should consider first whether the decompensation is potentially reversible (for example with abstinence, in the case of alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), or with antivirals in untreated chronic viral hepatitis). If not, is the patient suitable for LT? Contraindications to LT include coexisting significant extrahepatic comorbidity (with predicted mortality of > 50% at 5 years), presence of extrahepatic sepsis, active malignancy and some previous extrahepatic malignancies. Some contra-indications can be temporary or relative, so if a patient is not currently suitable for LT, consider whether they may be suitable following treatment or an intervention (eg, nasogastric feeding in a patient with severe sarcopenia). If there is any doubt, advice should be sought from the LT unit.

ARLD is the leading indication for LT in the UK. Detailed recommendations for LT referral in ARLD in the UK are beyond the scope of this practice guidance. These have recently been revised. To summarise, it is recommended that patients with decompensated ARLD should be referred to consider their suitability for LT if they still have evidence of decompensation after optimal management and 3 months validated abstinence from alcohol and are otherwise suitable candidates for LT, in line with The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance. Contraindications to LT in ARLD include active ongoing alcohol use, drinking alcohol while on the waitlist and during the period of transplant evaluation, and a history of repeated non-adherence to advice to abstain from alcohol.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^115BHhC1]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — palliative care in decompensated cirrhosis defines palliative care as multidisciplinary, specialized medical care addressing the physical, spiritual, and psychosocial needs of patients with serious illness and their caregivers, and notes benefits are increasingly recognized across disease states and for patients with decompensated cirrhosis (DC). This AASLD guidance to providing palliative care for patients with cirrhosis was developed with the support and oversight of the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee, which chose to commission a guidance, rather than a guideline, because of the paucity of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on this topic. It contrasts with AASLD guidelines, which are supported by systematic reviews of the literature, formal ratings of evidence quality and strength of recommendations, and, if appropriate, meta-analysis of results using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation system.

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 3: special circumstances [^116xXMkC]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of cirrhosis has risen significantly over recent decades and is predicted to rise further. Widespread use of non-invasive testing means cirrhosis is increasingly diagnosed at an earlier stage. Despite this, there are significant variations in outcomes in patients with cirrhosis across the UK, and patients in areas with higher levels of deprivation are more likely to die from their liver disease. This three-part best practice guidance aims to address outpatient management of cirrhosis, in order to standardise care and to reduce the risk of progression, decompensation and mortality from liver disease. Part 1 addresses outpatient management of compensated cirrhosis: screening for hepatocellular cancer, varices and osteoporosis, vaccination and lifestyle measures. Part 2 concentrates on outpatient management of decompensated disease including management of ascites, encephalopathy, varices, nutrition as well as liver transplantation and palliative care. In this, the third part of the guidance, we focus on special circumstances encountered in managing people with cirrhosis, namely surgery, pregnancy, travel, managing bleeding risk for invasive procedures and portal vein thrombosis.

The prevalence of cirrhosis has risen significantly over recent decades and is predicted to rise further. Widespread use of non-invasive testing means cirrhosis is increasingly diagnosed at an earlier stage. Despite this, there are significant variations in outcomes in patients with cirrhosis across the UK, and patients in areas with higher levels of deprivation are more likely to die from their liver disease. This three-part best practice guidance aims to address outpatient management of cirrhosis, in order to standardise care and to reduce the risk of progression, decompensation and mortality from liver disease. Here, in part one, we focus on outpatient management of compensated cirrhosis, encompassing hepatocellular cancer surveillance, screening for varices and osteoporosis, vaccination and lifestyle measures. We also introduce a compensated cirrhosis care bundle for use in the outpatient setting. Part two concentrates on outpatient management of decompensated disease including management of ascites, encephalopathy, varices, nutrition as well as liver transplantation and palliative care. The third part of the guidance covers special circumstances encountered in managing people with cirrhosis: surgery, pregnancy, travel, managing bleeding risk for invasive procedures and portal vein thrombosis.

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 2: decompensated cirrhosis [^117YPHnV]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

There are two distinct phases in the natural history of cirrhosis: compensated disease (corresponding to Child Pugh A and early Child Pugh B disease), where the patient may be largely asymptomatic, progressing with increasing portal hypertension and liver dysfunction to decompensated disease (corresponding to Child Pugh late B-C), characterised by the development of overt clinical signs, including jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), ascites, renal dysfunction and variceal bleeding. The transition from compensated cirrhosis to decompensated cirrhosis (DC) heralds a watershed in the nature and prognosis of the disease. DC is a systemic disease, characterised by multiorgan/system dysfunction, including haemodynamic and immune dysfunction. In this second part of our three-part series on the outpatient management of cirrhosis, we address outpatient management of DC, including management of varices, ascites, HE, nutrition, liver transplantation and palliative care. We also introduce an outpatient DC care bundle. For recommendations on screening for osteoporosis, hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance and vaccination see part one of the guidance. Part 3 of the guidance focusses on special circumstances encountered in patients with cirrhosis, including surgery, pregnancy, travel, management of bleeding risk for invasive procedures and portal vein thrombosis.

PC in patients with DC

DC is associated with a significant physical and psychosocial symptom burden which is most pronounced in the final year of life. Determining an accurate prognosis in patients with liver disease is challenging, due to the uncertain trajectory of the illness characterised by decompensations of disease and subsequent (partial) recovery. It is important to make patients aware of this uncertainty. It is now well recognised that there is a place for PC earlier in the patients' disease course. Parallel planning is important in the management of patients with other organ failures — 'hoping for the best but planning for the worst'. This is a useful phrase to use with patients when introducing the concept of PC.

Who and when to refer to PC?

Clinicians are often unsure as to when referral to PC services is appropriate. There are several tools available to identify patients with decompensated liver disease, who may benefit from referral to PC. Broadly speaking, they include:

Patients with Child Pugh C cirrhosis.
Patients with decompensated ARLD and ongoing alcohol use.
Patients with irreversible decompensated disease not deemed to be candidates for LT.
Patients undergoing assessment for LT or who are on the liver transplant waiting list.
Patients with two unplanned liver-related admissions within the past 6 months.
Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma for best supportive care.

The Gastroenterology Getting It Right First Time Programme National Specialty Report, which analysed delivery of services across England, identified variation in how well hospital trusts managed patients with liver disease at risk, including the proportion of emergency admissions, proportion of patients having varices treated as an emergency (rather than at screening/surveillance) and outpatient management of ascites. The authors encouraged the use of cirrhosis care bundles as a way of ensuring patients are managed appropriately. This best practice guidance aims to provide overarching guidance on the management of cirrhosis in the outpatient setting, to address variations in care, promote proactive outpatient management and improve outcomes.

The guidance is written in three parts, to cover the outpatient management of compensated (part 1), decompensated cirrhosis (part 2) and special circumstances, including surgery, pregnancy and travel in patients with cirrhosis (part 3). The aim of these documents is to provide a practical guide and service framework, including cirrhosis care bundles, for clinicians caring for patients with cirrhosis in secondary care, to promote best practice and multidisciplinary team working, and to identify areas for audit, quality improvement and research where there are gaps in the current evidence base. Aetiology-specific management, with the exception of alcohol use disorder (AUD), is outside the scope of this guidance. MASLD/NAFLD, viral hepatitis and autoimmune liver disease should be managed in accordance with the relevant published guidelines.

Introduction

The transition from compensated cirrhosis (CC) to decompensated cirrhosis (DC) occurs at the rate of approximately 5%–7% per year, and median survival drops from over 12 years in CC to approximately 2 years in DC. People with DC should be managed by a specialist with expertise in the management of patients with liver disease. While removal of aetiological factors driving liver damage is important at all stages of liver disease, the management of CC, focused on surveillance and preventing further liver damage, differs significantly from that of DC, where the focus is on managing complications, identifying suitable candidates for transplantation and ensuring good palliative care (PC). The following recommendations are accompanied by a care bundle for use in the outpatient setting (see figure 1).

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^114N3siz]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD guidance statements — In patients with decompensated cirrhosis (DC), outpatient palliative care may be associated with improved symptoms, improved care coordination, and better anticipatory planning. Inpatient specialty palliative care (PC) consultations with postdischarge follow-up may be associated with greater consensus between patients and clinicians about the goals of care, reduced life-sustaining treatment use, earlier provision of comfort-focused care, and reduced readmission.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^114gFBQi]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — future clinical and policy implications for palliative care in hepatology state that to successfully weave the principles of palliative care into hepatology care requires substantial research, workforce and culture change, and health policy advocacy, with a critical first step being workforce training and programmatic development to support palliative care advocacy. The guidance notes that palliative care is a growing field but its penetration is uneven across the United States, with the largest gaps existing in ambulatory and community palliative care services, and that routine symptom assessment in hepatology can increase providers' experience with triaging and managing symptoms that are often underaddressed for patients with cirrhosis. Implementation can be facilitated by developing reimbursement infrastructure across the various aspects of palliative care and by dissemination of information, since many are unaware that patients on the transplant list can receive hospice benefits until a donor organ becomes available; incorporating measures of hospice and palliative care in cirrhosis quality metrics can demonstrate the importance of these topics to providers and payors.

The mainstay of ascites management in the outpatient setting is diuretic therapy. This involves a stepwise approach as outlined in figure 3 with the additional specific recommendations:

Secondary antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered in patients with a previous episode of SBP. Suitable antibiotic choices are norfloxacin 400 mg, ciprofloxacin 500 mg or co-trimoxazole 960 mg once daily. The ASEPTIC trial, investigating the role of primary prophylaxis of SBP, is ongoing. Some centres offer primary prophylaxis for those considered high risk of SBP (protein concentration < 15 g/L)but there are concerns around antibiotic resistance and this should only be considered following discussion with local microbiology teams. Rifaximin prescribed for secondary prophylaxis of HE may negate the prescription of a second oral systemic antibiotic with substantial evidence to suggest it prevents SBP.
NSBB, when indicated, is not contraindicated in refractory ascites; although patients require close monitoring; dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate in those who develop hypotension or acute/progressive renal dysfunction.
Long-term outpatient albumin administration to patients with cirrhosis and ascites is not currently recommended: despite encouraging results from the ANSWER trial, the accompanying medical supervision was a strong confounding variable; further research is required to determine the efficacy, practicality, cost-effectiveness and impact on quality of life.
Patients with refractory ascites requiring regular large-volume paracentesis should have them performed as planned day case procedures as this reduces costs and improves patient outcomes, particularly in the last year of life.
Indwelling abdominal drains remain experimental but can be considered in palliative patients with advanced disease as an alternative to recurrent large volume paracentesis following careful discussion involving the patient about the risk benefit ratio, and in particular the potential infection risk. Their use is currently being evaluated in the REDUCe2 trial.

Introduction

The prevalence of cirrhosis continues to rise, and cirrhosis is increasingly diagnosed at an earlier stage. As a result, potentially challenging clinical scenarios, such as surgery, pregnancy, invasive procedures, anticoagulation and travel in patients with cirrhosis, are encountered more frequently in practice. The third part of these guidelines on outpatient management of cirrhosis focuses on these scenarios.

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 1: compensated cirrhosis [^116RrfDX]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Liver disease and liver cancer together caused 2.5% of deaths in England in 2018. Over half of these deaths occur in those of working age. Liver-related deaths have increased by over 400% since 1970, and the number of hospital admissions for liver disease has increased by half over the last decade. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, premature mortality from all major causes of liver disease increased further in 2020, with mortality highest in the most deprived areas. Good outpatient management is crucial in preventing hospital admissions and keeping people living with cirrhosis well.

Cirrhosis is defined by widespread disruption of normal liver structure by fibrosis, caused by chronic progressive conditions affecting the liver; most commonly alcohol-related steatotic liver disease (ALD), followed by metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) (previously termed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)). The diagnosis is generally made based on one, or a combination, of clinical findings, imaging, endoscopy, non-invasive tests (such as enhanced liver fibrosis test or transient elastography (TE)) and/or histology.

An asymptomatic compensated phase is followed, in the presence of ongoing liver damage, by a decompensated phase, marked by the development of overt clinical signs, most frequently ascites, bleeding, encephalopathy and jaundice. The Baveno group have developed a six-stage model of cirrhosis, reflecting the degree of portal hypertension (see figure 1). Mortality in the compensated phase (stages 0–2), a median of 10-year duration, is 1%, compared with 40%, 65% and 80% at 1, 2 and 5 years, respectively, for those progressing to decompensated cirrhosis. The Child-Pugh class (A–C)is referred to in parts of this guidance. While initially developed to estimate postoperative mortality, Child-Pugh score (5–15) and associated class are widely used to describe the severity of liver disease and are associated with prognosis. Child-Pugh class A and Child-Pugh class C indicate compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, respectively. Patients with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis may have compensated or decompensated disease. More recently developed scores such as the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD)and UK Model for End Stage Liver Disease (UKELD)provide better prognostic value and so are used to predict mortality following a range of interventions in patients with cirrhosis, as well as eligibility for liver transplant (see part 2).

Symptoms and problems addressed by PC

Patients with DC often have general symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue and breathlessness frequently overlooked due to a focus on more liver specific symptoms such as itch, ascites and encephalopathy. Addressing symptoms has a clear impact on quality of life. In addition, there are often broader psychosocial issues to address such as emotional support, dealing with carer burden and financial aspects.

There is often uncertainty about the safety of medication prescribing in patients with DC, but this should not lead to inadequate management of patients' symptoms. See table 3 for a summary of how to manage common symptoms in patients with DC. The British Association for the Study of the Liver (BASL) has further guidance on anticipatory prescribing at the end of life.

Table 3
Managing symptoms in advanced liver disease

Patients who may be suitable for PC should be discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting with representatives from PC, hepatology/gastroenterology (including specialist nurses) and other Allied Health Practitioners (AHPs) such as dieticians and alcohol care teams. Outcomes should be clearly communicated to the community team. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss advance care plans, emergency healthcare plans and resuscitation status, and should be added to the PC register. Consider signposting patients and families to additional practical support such as social prescribers, accessible through primary care.

Multidisciplinary care

Patients with DC have high rates of hospital admissions, long lengths of stay, high complication rates and significant healthcare costs. Liver specialist nurse led clinics can play an important role in admission avoidance and facilitating early discharge. Early postdischarge clinics (within 2 weeks of patient discharge) and urgent nurse-led liver clinics can facilitate diuretic titration, early detection of HE, symptom management and offer support to patients and carers. If admission is required, they can ensure early specialist input, which is crucial in improving outcomes for patients admitted with decompensation.

Nurse-led day case paracentesis services significantly reduce emergency admission rates, lower costs and improve outcomes and patient experience. There should be clear referral pathways in place via the gastroenterology/hepatology team to ensure patients are appropriate for the service. Patients should be given information on when and who to contact when symptoms (such as encephalopathy) deteriorate, or their ascites accumulates.

The aim should be to develop a service with an integrated MDT including dieticians, physiotherapists, pharmacists, PC nurse specialists and alcohol care teams to support a holistic approach to outpatient management of advanced liver disease.

Information for people with cirrhosis

People diagnosed with cirrhosis should be followed up in clinic by a specialist with an expertise in the management of patients with liver disease.

At the time of diagnosis, patients should be provided with information on their condition in a way they are able to understand. This could include verbal information, tailored videosand information leaflets that patients can use to support self-care, bearing in mind that some patients may not be able to read or understand written information. They should also be sign-posted to patient support groups such as the British Liver Trust, where they can access a wide range of practical information and support.

Patients should be actively involved in decisions around the management of their cirrhosis. They should be made aware of red flag symptoms or complications to look out for and be given lifestyle advice on how to help prevent further liver damage. The rationale for screening, surveillance and primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding (if applicable) should be discussed, including whether surveillance is appropriate. They should also be able to discuss the likely course of their disease and prognosis, if they wish, accepting that there is a degree of uncertainty.

Travel in people with cirrhosis

Increasing prevalence, earlier recognition and better management of liver disease mean more people with cirrhosis enjoy a good quality of life and wish to travel. Patients increasingly seek advice around travel during outpatient appointments.

Some considerations are common across all chronic diseases: advise patients to carry a list of medications, a summary of conditions, complications and therapies in an accessible format. Within the UK, electronic prescribing allows prescriptions to be collected from pharmacies near to the place of stay. If travelling abroad then it is important patients take an adequate supply of their prescribed medications with them. It is advisable to carry a limited supply of medication in hand in case luggage is lost. Additional vaccinations (such as hepatitis A/B) may be required prior to travel if not already taken up. Patients on immunosuppression may be advised against live vaccines such as yellow fever(see part 1).

Adequate travel insurance is crucial — many companies will cover compensated liver disease, but some insurance companies specialise in insuring people with liver disease. Patients should be advised to shop around and consider seeking advice from patient support groups to get the best cover.

People with cirrhosis are often anxious about air travel or visiting destinations at high altitude. However, there is no documented increase in variceal bleeding associated with altitude. Nevertheless, anecdotally, variceal bleeding while on a flight can occur, and it is prudent to ensure appropriate primary prophylaxis for variceal bleeding is initiated prior to travel.

Travel with decompensated liver disease is higher risk and should be considered on an individual basis, considering the destination, the degree of decompensation, suitability for transplant, and mode and duration of travel. Patients on the transplant list should inform their transplant co-ordinator.

Reasons for travel differ — some may have had their decompensation episode away from home and need to get back to their base; others may feel recovered and wish to contemplate holidays; for some it may be important for their quality of life and palliative care.

Once decompensation is declared, insurance premiums increase significantly and for some individuals or destinations may not even be available. It may be advisable to delay travel following an acute decompensation, for example, to complete a banding programme following variceal haemorrhage, and to ensure liver disease is optimised. It is important patients understand the potential risks of travel in order to make an informed decision.

Table 1
Predictive models used in patients with cirrhosis undergoing surgery

In patients with cirrhosis, non-urgent surgery should be deferred until an adequate assessment has been undertaken and their liver disease optimised. The clinical team should consider referral to a unit with experience in managing patients with cirrhosis, where appropriate. Consideration should also be given to non-surgical options if available/appropriate. Care should be taken to optimise nutrition. For patients with compensated cirrhosis, after appropriate perioperative risk stratification and counselling, surgery may then be indicated.

Emergency surgery in patients with cirrhosis carries an increased mortality risk, and cirrhosis is an independent predictor of death. In the emergency setting, where deferring surgery may not be feasible, the patient and surgical, anaesthetic and medical teams must weigh the potential benefits and risks collaboratively. Table 2 summarises the anaesthetic considerations when planning surgery in patients with cirrhosis.

Table 2
Anaesthetic considerations in the cirrhotic patient

Surgery in decompensated cirrhosis

Surgery in patients with decompensated cirrhosis carries a significantly higher mortality risk than compensated cirrhosis. Eligibility for liver transplantation, if the patient was to decompensate following surgery, should be determined prior to surgery. In patients with Child-Pugh C or MELD > 20, surgery should be avoided or delayed until after liver transplantation, if possible, for all but the most urgent and lifesaving procedures. Good palliation of symptoms is crucial in patients unsuitable for transplant where surgery is considered too high risk, as well as in all patients waiting for surgery post-transplant.

Abdominal wall hernias are common in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, and mortality is high in those undergoing surgery. The clinical team should consider discussion with an experienced centre to guide management of recurrent ascites with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) and other sequelae of decompensation in the perioperative/postoperative period. The decision to offer hernia repair and its timing will be influenced by the patient's eligibility for liver transplantation and the nature of their presentation. Where patients have undergone assessment and are awaiting liver transplantation, hernia repair may be deferred until the time of transplantation (when it can be undertaken during or following liver transplantation). In patients who are not candidates for liver transplantation elective repair of symptomatic umbilical hernia (if feasible) can be undertaken and may avoid the added risk of emergency surgery. In patients who develop life-threatening complications of an abdominal wall hernia (skin breakdown with leaking ascites, incarceration, obstruction or strangulation) emergency repair may still be undertaken but the morbidity and mortality increases significantly.

### Endpoints and design of clinical trials in patients with decompensated cirrhosis: position paper of the liverHope consortium [^113vuLBM]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of decompensated cirrhosis is currently geared towards the treatment of complications once they occur. To date there is no established disease-modifying therapy aimed at halting progression of the disease and preventing the development of complications in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The design of clinical trials to investigate new therapies for patients with decompensated cirrhosis is complex. The population of patients with decompensated cirrhosis is heterogeneous (i.e., different etiologies, comorbidities and disease severity), leading to the inclusion of diverse populations in clinical trials. In addition, primary endpoints selected for trials that include patients with decompensated cirrhosis are not homogeneous and at times may not be appropriate. This leads to difficulties in comparing results obtained from different trials. Against this background, the LiverHope Consortium organized a meeting of experts, the goal of which was to develop recommendations for the design of clinical trials and to define appropriate endpoints, both for trials aimed at modifying the natural history and preventing progression of decompensated cirrhosis, as well as for trials aimed at managing the individual complications of cirrhosis.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^113hWy2Q]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD Practice Guidance — guidance statements on symptom assessment and management in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) stress systematic, staged, and interdisciplinary care. A wide range of symptoms co-occur in patients with DC, and addressing these symptoms is a key component of high-quality cirrhosis care. For patients with DC, following general palliative care principles, we recommend systematically evaluating the presence and severity of a wide range of symptoms and addressing the symptoms most important to patients. Often, the first approach to symptom management may be nonpharmacological, such as behavioral intervention, physical therapy, or other modalities that address multiple symptoms. Underlying causes of symptoms should be identified and managed first. Symptom management should consider best practices, disease stage, and patient goals and preferences, and evaluation and management of symptoms should be interdisciplinary, when possible, including nursing, social work, and chaplaincy.

Alcohol

Patients with cirrhosis should be routinely asked about alcohol intake as part of their clinical review. It is recommended that patients with cirrhosis from any cause should abstain from alcohol. Abstinence is a critical goal for people with ARLD, since it improves outcomes at all stages of disease.

Pharmacotherapy for relapse prevention should be considered for people with ARLD in combination with psychosocial/behavioural interventions. NICE recommends use of disulfiram, naltrexone or acamprosate to manage AUDs following successful alcohol withdrawal. However, none of these medications have specifically been studied in patients with cirrhosis. Disulfiram and naltrexone undergo hepatic metabolism, increasing the risk of hepatotoxicity in those with hepatic dysfunction — they are therefore not recommended by the European Association for the Study of the Liver for use in patients with cirrhosis. Acamprosate does not undergo hepatic metabolism, and based on limited data, is probably safe in Child-Pugh A and B cirrhosis. To date, baclofen is the only pharmacotherapy for AUD for which there are RCT data in people with cirrhosis; a single RCT demonstrated the safety and efficacy of baclofen in promoting alcohol abstinence in patients with ARLD and cirrhosis (including decompensated disease, but excluding patients with hepatic encephalopathy), but confirmatory studies are warranted as subsequent study results have been conflicting. The role of baclofen in the management of AUD is currently being evaluated in a further RCT.

Those who continue to drink alcohol, in a harmful or dependent pattern, are at risk of developing alcohol-related brain damage, in part due to thiamine deficiency. Prophylactic parenteral thiamine followed by oral thiamine (100 mg two times per day) should be given to those at risk who attend an emergency department or are admitted to hospital with an acute illness, including decompensated chronic liver disease.

People diagnosed with ongoing alcohol misuse or alcohol dependence (indicators of which include alcohol-withdrawal symptoms including seizures and the need for medically assisted withdrawal/detoxification) must be advised not to drive until after 6 (alcohol misuse) to 12 (alcohol dependence) months of controlled drinking or abstinence, and to notify the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. This advice extends to those with any chronic cognitive impairment due to alcohol and those diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy due to any cause of cirrhosis (see guidelines on decompensated cirrhosis).

Outpatient management of ascites

The onset of ascites signifies an important stage in cirrhosis evolution: the 2-year and 5-year cumulative mortality after ascites development is 38% and 78%, respectively.

Ascites is a clinical manifestation of portal hypertension related renal dysfunction, leading to sodium and water retention and impaired free water clearance. This presents progressively as ascites, refractory ascites, hyponatraemia and ultimately hepatorenal syndrome.

New-onset ascites should be evaluated to ensure it is related to portal hypertension, including calculating serum albumin gradient (SAAG) where SAAG > 11 g/L is consistent with portal hypertension. In the absence of another clear cause of decompensation, CT scan of the liver to rule out hepatocellular carcinoma or portomesenteric vein thrombosis should be considered. Any significant increase in the volume of ascites, abdominal pain or fever should prompt an ascitic tap with fluid sent for white cell count to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and ascitic fluid culture. A neutrophil count of > 250/mm³ confirms SBP requiring prompt treatment with antibiotics.

Background and methods

This guidance document was commissioned by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) and endorsed by the British Association for the Study of the Liver (BASL) and British Liver Nurse Association (BLNA). A multidisciplinary working group, consisting of hepatologists, specialist nurses, a surgeon, anaesthetist, pharmacist, dietitian and representative of the British Liver Trust, was formed, and subject areas agreed by the group. Allocated section leads were responsible for searching and summarising recent guidelines, updating with recent evidence where appropriate and drafting recommendations. These were appraised by the entire working group and consensus reached on the recommendations made, through a series of virtual meetings. These were then circulated to the BSG liver section committee, the BSG/BASL portal hypertension Special Interest Group and members of the BLNA for review prior to peer-reviewed publication.

Part 1 of the guidance covers management of compensated cirrhosis, including screening and surveillance for varices, osteoporosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and vaccinations. Recommendations are collated into a care bundle to be used in outpatient clinics (figure 2). To avoid repetition, some areas are only covered in part 1 of the guidance (including HCC surveillance and management of AUD) and so reference is made to decompensated disease in these sections.

Screening, surveillance and prophylaxis of variceal bleeding

All patients with DC who are not on a non-selective beta blocker (NSBB) should undergo endoscopy to screen for varices. The risk of progression to high-risk varices is higher in decompensated disease, so we recommend annual surveillance in all patients not already receiving primary prophylaxis. Patients with Child-Pugh C disease and small varices should have primary prophylaxis with NSBB if tolerated. All patients with medium-to-large varices/red signs should have primary prophylaxis with NSBB or variceal band ligation (VBL) (figure 2). Patients on NSBB for primary prevention do not require further surveillance endoscopy. Those who have VBL for primary prevention should be scoped approximately every 4 weeks until the varices are eradicated and then have ongoing surveillance annually until they recompensate and the underlying aetiological driver for their liver disease is removed (eg, abstinence from alcohol).

Figure 2
Surveillance and treatment of non-bleeding gastrooesophageal varices indecompensated cirrhosis. + Titrate from 6.25 mg od to target 12.5 mg od in single or divided doses if tolerated (maintain HR, 50–60, systolic blood pressure > 90 mm Hg). *Small varices defined as < 5 mm diameter or varices which completely disappear with moderate insufflation of the oesophagus, medium-large varices > 5 mm diameter. NSSB, non-selective beta blocker; VBL, variceal band ligation.

Secondary prevention of variceal haemorrhage is important, as the risk of rebleeding can be as high as 60% with 20% mortality for each rebleeding episode. A combination of NSBB and VBL is recommended. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPSS) has a role in secondary prevention in high-risk cases, where patients rebleed despite NSBB and VBL, or where there are additional indications such as refractory/recurrent ascites. Careful patient selection is necessary (see BSG guidelines on TIPSS in portal hypertension), including consideration of liver transplantation (LT) where appropriate.

AASLD guidance statements — pain in patients with cirrhosis emphasize that multimodal pain management approaches are ideal and include a person-centered holistic, multidisciplinary approach, engaging a combination of expertise from across a number of specialties; pain in patients with DC requires a systematic approach that starts with assessing and treating reversible causes of pain; and localized pain should first be addressed with local, rather than systemic, therapies. Acetaminophen, 500 mg every 6 h, up to a maximum dose of 2 g/d, is the preferred first-line pharmacotherapy for the management of pain in patients with cirrhosis, and systemic NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis. We recommend avoiding opioids, when possible, for chronic pain. However, when necessary, opioid use should be approached with caution and with careful discussion with patients and caregivers. Low-dose oxycodone or hydromorphone can be started in select cases on an as-needed basis and titrated to effect, often in consultation with pain management experts.

Renal impairment

Renal impairment and hyponatraemia are common complications of DC and are associated with poor outcome. Circulatory changes mean that patients with DC are more susceptible to prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI), for example due to hypovolaemia secondary to diuretics, bleeding or infection. They may also suffer from renal causes of AKI (such as acute tubular necrosis) and postrenal causes, as in patients without cirrhosis. Patients with metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and diabetes are more likely to have underlying chronic kidney disease.

Hepatorenal syndrome refers to renal failure in patients with cirrhosis and ascites in the absence of any other identifiable cause and can develop acutely or more chronically. Management of HRS is outside the remit of this guideline. However, if patients develop renal impairment in an outpatient setting, the priority should be cessation/reduction of diuretic therapy and suspension of nephrotoxic medications. Arrangements should be made for frequent monitoring of renal function, to see whether admission for plasma expansion with fluids and/or terlipressin is required.

Special considerations for prescribing in DC

The pathophysiological changes in decompensated liver disease may significantly change the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of many medicines, altering pharmacological and toxicological responses (online supplemental table 1). In addition, many medications can exacerbate fluid overload and/or HE in patients with DC. Table 2 provides a summary of prescribing adjustments to consider in some commonly used medications.

Table 2
Summary of prescribing commonly used medicines in patients with DC

Careful consideration should be given to the potential risk–benefit of treatment in each individual with advanced liver disease. Polypharmacy should be avoided, and medicines regularly reviewed to ensure all are still required. Concordance should be addressed regularly; if suboptimal, medications should be rationalised in partnership with patients to optimise concordance with the most important treatments.

Medicines should be titrated slowly, closely monitored and suspended or withdrawn if there are signs of toxicity or patient deterioration. Therapeutic drug monitoring should be employed where available.

Nutrition

Malnutrition can be present in up to 20% of patients with compensated cirrhosis, and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. While more pronounced in decompensated cirrhosis, accelerated starvation and muscle breakdown can present in compensated cirrhosis with fatigue, reduced muscle mass, strength and function (sarcopenia) without overt weight loss. All patients with cirrhosis should be screened for malnutrition as part of routine outpatient review; screening tools such as the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool may not be valid in patients with ascites or oedema. Alternative liver-specific tools such as the Royal Free Hospital Nutritional Prioritising tooland the Liver Frailty Index, which incorporates assessment of muscle strength and function, can be used in both compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. Those at high risk of malnutrition, including body mass index < 18.5 or Child-Pugh C disease (see part 2), should have a full nutritional assessment by a dietitian.

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 2: decompensated cirrhosis [^114CA7S3]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nutrition in DC

All patients with DC are at high risk of malnutrition and should have nutritional screening, including an assessment of dietary intake, preferably by a dietician, to determine the presence and severity of malnutrition and sarcopenia, both of which are independent predictors of poor outcomes in cirrhosis. While outpatient dietetic services are not widespread for patients with cirrhosis, intervention to prevent/treat malnutrition is important, as its presence is associated with increased decompensation, hospitalisation and mortality. Traditional nutritional screening tools such as body mass index (BMI) are unreliable in patients with ascites/oedema and dry weight should be used/estimated. Bedside tests such as grip strength, can be used to assess and monitor sarcopenia.

Malnutrition is almost universal in patients with DC. Multiple factors may be involved, including reduced oral intake (due to encephalopathy, ascites or anorexia), malabsorption (due to portal enteropathy, jaundice or pancreatic insufficiency) and protein loss into ascites. Fundamental changes in energy metabolism in DC drive accelerated starvation, resulting in muscle catabolism, deconditioning and frailty. Diminished hepatic glycogen stores, due to high circulating levels of glucagon, result in gluconeogenesis as an alternative fuel and protein break down resulting in sarcopenia. Rapid transition from fed to fasting state means even short-term fasting results in muscle loss.

### Noninvasive assessment of hepatic decompensation [^115dmdwZ]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Noninvasive tests (NITs) are used in all aspects of liver disease management. Their most prominent break-through since the millennium has been in advancing early detection of liver fibrosis, but their use is not limited to this. In contrast to the symptom-driven assessment of decompensation in patients with cirrhosis, NITs provide not only opportunities for earlier diagnoses but also accurate prognostication, targeted treatment decisions, and a means of monitoring disease. NITs can inform disease management and decision-making based on validated cutoffs and standardized interpretations as a valuable supplement to clinical acumen. The Baveno VI and VII consensus meetings resulted in tangible improvements to pathways of care for patients with compensated and decompensated advanced chronic liver disease, including the combination of platelet count and transient elastography to diagnose clinically significant portal hypertension. Furthermore, circulating NITs will play increasingly important roles in assessing the response to interventions against ascites, variceal bleeding, HE, acute kidney injury, and infections. However, due to NITs' wide availability, there is a risk of inaccurate use, leading to a waste of resources and flawed decisions. In this review, we describe the uses and pitfalls of NITs for hepatic decompensation, from risk stratification in primary care to treatment decisions in outpatient clinics, as well as for the in-hospital management of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. We summarize which NITs to use when, for what indications, and how to maximize the potential of NITs for improved patient management.

### Response to the NCEPOD report: development of a care bundle for patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis-the first 24 H [^114ZHkn7]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The recent NCEPOD report on ARLD highlighted that the management of some patients with decompensated cirrhosis in the UK was suboptimal. In order to address these concerns, we have developed a 'care bundle' for patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis, to ensure the appropriate initial investigations and interventions are conducted at an early stage when specialist advice may not be available. It is hoped that this care bundle will help improve the care of patients admitted to hospital with decompensated cirrhosis across the UK, but this will need to be formally evaluated. This care bundle could also be a focus for audit, nationally regarding the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Hospice use and prognostication in decompensated cirrhosis — "Hospice for patients with decompensated cirrhosis is covered by Medicare Part A". Hospice is generally appropriate for patients who prioritize comfort-focused care, are no longer pursuing disease-directed therapies, and whose "prognosis is < 6 months", and "has been associated with improved control of physical and psychological symptoms, quality of life, and caregiver bereavement"; however, "Evidence shows that hospice is provided infrequently and, when provided, is very close to the end of life for patients with DC". For prognostication, "MELD score > 21 or Child-Pugh score ≥ 12 are also associated with an ~6-month life expectancy", and "Bereavement services… should be considered as a potential benefit in the decision-making process".

Pregnancy in decompensated disease

Pregnancies in women with decompensated liver disease are rare, due to the hormonal imbalances caused by end-stage liver disease. These pregnancies are usually more difficult to manage and should be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting with regular review in outpatients and a low threshold for admission if complications develop.

Prepregnancy MELD scores ≥ 10 predict the risk of hepatic decompensation during pregnancy, as does a history of previous hepatic decompensation. In older studies, the rates of decompensation during pregnancy were reported to be between 12% and 36%. A recent US population-based study has demonstrated that rates of hepatic decompensation in pregnancy are lower than expected; 1.2% in compensated cirrhosis and 13% in previous decompensated disease. Variceal haemorrhage is the most common manifestation of decompensation (3%–36%), although ascites (3%–11%), hepatic encephalopathy (< 2%) and hepatorenal syndrome can also present during pregnancy.

β-blockers and lactulose can be continued during pregnancy. However, diuretics, rifaximin and most prophylactic antibiotics should be discontinued due to fetal risks and lack of human safety data. Paracentesis should also be avoided where possible. Terlipressin should not be used due to risks of utero-placental ischaemia. In acute variceal haemorrhage refractory to endoscopic therapy, TIPSS insertion can be considered. In the context of liver failure, transplantation can be performed successfully in pregnant women.

The decision to deliver will be dependent on the presence of materno–fetal complications. Excessive straining and repeated Valsalva manoeuvres during labour, which temporarily increase intra-abdominal pressures, were previously believed to promote variceal rupture. For this reason, C-section rates have been reported to be high (12%–81%) in women with cirrhosis. Pregnancies in these women are also independently associated with induction of labour.C-sections are associated with poor wound healing and infection, which can be problematic in women with cirrhosis who have an increased risk of puerperal infections. Vaginal deliveries are thus a suitable mode of delivery in these pregnancies, while C-sections should be reserved for obstetric indications or based on individualised risk profile.

Pelvic varices, thrombocytopaenia and coagulopathy can increase the risk of PPH in women with decompensated cirrhosis. Management of PPH includes blood/coagulation factors, uterine contractile agents, ligation of bleeding vessels and, if all fails, hysterectomy.

There are two options for primary prevention of variceal bleeding: non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs) and variceal band ligation (VBL). At present, we recommend NSBB or VBL in medium to large varices (> 5 mm in diameter), considering comorbidities, tolerances and patient choice. Patients on NSBB for primary prevention do not need further surveillance. Those who have VBL should have banding approximately every 4 weeks until the varices are eradicated; in those who continue to have active liver disease (eg, still drinking alcohol), we would recommend rescope at 1 year (or if they develop decompensation) and then 1–2 yearly until abstinence is achieved and there is evidence that their liver disease is stable or improving.

A recent meta-analysis, including results from the PREDESCI trial, suggests that NSBB such as carvedilol may reduce decompensation and mortality in patients with compensated cirrhosis, particularly in the presence of varices. Based on this evidence, carvedilol, where tolerated, could be preferred to VBL in patients with compensated cirrhosis and medium to large varices. In addition, carvedilol could be considered in patients with small varices (defined as varices < 5 mm in diameter or varices which completely disappear on moderate insufflation of the oesophagus) and compensated cirrhosis in the presence of active liver disease. However, concerns of poor tolerance and concordance with NSBB (particularly in ARLD with ongoing alcohol use) could limit NSBB use in small varices and make VBL a preferable option in some patients with medium/large varices. We are currently awaiting the results of CALIBREand BOPPP, two multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at definitively addressing these issues.

Another area of active debate is the role of NSBB in preventing decompensation in clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), defined by the Baveno group as hepatic venous pressure gradient ≥ 10 mm Hg or LSM > 25 kPa. The recently published updated Baveno VII document includes a recommendation to use NSBB in all patients with CSPHregardless of the presence of varices. However, we believe further studies are required, and we do not currently advocate prescribing NSBB based on non-invasive markers (such as TE) alone, without endoscopic evidence of varices.

### Multidisciplinary management of patients with cirrhosis: a need for care coordination [^116P6jZF]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis is a common chronic condition with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Optimal medical management involves a multidisciplinary approach, but coordination between medical specialties needs to be improved. This clinical perspective discusses care coordination interventions that have been successful in other disease states and how they could be applied to the management of cirrhosis.

Multidisciplinary care

Patients with cirrhosis should be managed by a multidisciplinary team tailored to the holistic needs of the individual, including specialist nurses, dietitians and physiotherapists. Depending on the aetiology of the liver disease, other allied health practitioners, such as alcohol care teams, may be involved.

Specialist liver nurses, advanced clinical practitioners and specialist pharmacists can play a key role in monitoring patients with cirrhosis. Patients with compensated cirrhosis requiring 6-month review and surveillance can be managed with a combination of telephone, video and face-to-face appointments. Use of care bundles and objective scores (MELD/UKELD) can help to standardise outpatient care. All patients should have an allocated consultant in overall charge of care and there should be an agreed referral pathway back to consultant if the clinical picture changes. Consultant support, adequate supervision and continuing professional development are also crucial in developing an effective nurse-led service.

Sustainability and service development

Efforts should be made to improve the sustainability of the service (for example, reducing the number of trips patients need to make to the hospital by linking outpatient appointments to ultrasound surveillance, avoiding unnecessary endoscopy, by treating patients closer to home and/or use of telephone and virtual clinics). Services should be flexible to deliver patient-centred care, and strategies should be employed to manage more vulnerable patients (for example, frequent non-attenders with drug and alcohol problems) to optimise their engagement with the service.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^111NyzvM]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Long term regular outpatient HAS therapy

Improving morbidity and mortality by long-term administration of albumin to patients with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites has been explored in six studies with three recent RCTs, in contrasting patient groups, with contradictory findings (online supplemental table 9).

In the ANSWERstudy, 431 patients with uncomplicated ascites receiving diuretics were randomised to weekly outpatient HAS infusions or no additional intervention (standard medical therapy). The study had a pragmatic approach and was unblinded. Overall 18-month survival was significantly higher in the standard therapy plus HAS than in the standard medical therapy group (Kaplan-Meier estimates 77% vs 66%; p = 0.028), resulting in a 38% reduction in the mortality hazard ratio (0.62, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.95). There were additional benefits with lower incidence rate ratio (IRR) for infection (SBP and non-SBP) and renal dysfunction. However, unlike the standard therapy group, the HAS group had weekly medical professional contact when IV albumin was administered which could possibly have caused a confounding effect by improving standard of care in this group.

Patients should be advised to eat a varied diet with three meals a day and be encouraged to include protein with each meal (aiming for 1.2–1.5 g/kg body weight/day). A protein and carbohydrate supper or evening snack minimises the overnight fast, reducing protein breakdown and muscle catabolism. Where oral intake is good, they should be encouraged to maintain or improve the quality of their diet with as many fruits and vegetables as they can manage.

Obesity is at least as frequent in cirrhosis as in the general population (20–35%) and affects most individuals with MASLD-related cirrhosis. Sarcopenia can be missed in the presence of obesity, and both obesity and sarcopenia can worsen the prognosis in cirrhosis. Implementing nutritional and lifestyle changes (including moderate exercise) to achieve progressive weight loss (> 5–10%) in obese patients with cirrhosis, and adopting a tailored, moderately hypocaloric (500–800 kcal/day deficit) diet, including adequate protein intake (> 1.5 g proteins/kg ideal body weight/day) can be used to achieve weight loss without compromising muscle mass. However, a slower sustained weight loss with calorie restriction of 250–500 kcal deficit is generally preferred to preserve muscle mass, particularly where exercise levels are low. Physical activity is often overlooked but is an important aspect of care in all patients with cirrhosis, irrespective of aetiology, and especially those with sarcopenic obesity. Patients should be encouraged to follow WHO advice of at least 150 min of moderate or 75 min of vigorous-intensity exercise per week with muscle strengthening exercises at least 2 days a week. However, any physical activity is better than none, and exercise can be built up slowly and gradually over time. Weight loss should be under dietetic supervision with regular checks on muscle mass and function.

### Quality standards for the management of alcohol-related liver disease: consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British society of gastroenterology ARLD special interest group [^1165G3xb]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Patients should be provided with clear, written information about their liver disease in a manner that they can understand before they leave hospital

Patients should be supported to understand their health in the transition from hospital to the community. Written information should include details about their liver disease, the reasons for hospital admission, treatment received and plans for follow-up including advice about abstinence and sources of alcohol support. Written information should take into account literacy level as the median UK reading age is 9 years old. A template information leaflet for decompensated alcohol-related cirrhosis is provided in the supporting information. The British Liver Trust also offers a range of resources designed to be accessible for patients. Where appropriate and with patients' consent, information should be shared with people significant or important to patients.

The date and time of follow-up appointments should be arranged with patients before they leave hospital

Patients who attend outpatient hepatology outpatient clinics have been shown in retrospective reviews to have improved survival. Early follow-up also facilitates discharge and may help prevent readmission, both of which can reduce pressure on inpatient services. Necessary investigations should where possible be completed during an index admission to reduce journeys and costs to patients. Measures to allow patients to lead follow-up arrangements by picking dates or times of appointments may also support engagement. Outpatient hepatology clinics have traditionally been delivered in hospitals, but could be placed in other centres which may improve attendance.

Patients hospitalised with decompensated ALD or AH should be followed up by clinicians with specialist interest in hepatology within 6 weeks of discharge

In clinical studies, follow-up has been difficult. Special efforts to engage patients with follow-up may be needed in excess of other patient groups. These efforts should ideally ensure that further engagement is made as easy as possible and, importantly, continually informed by patient experience. Additional efforts to engage patients through for example peer support, dedicated specialist nursing staff and using text messages have shown to improve attendance in people with hepatitis C; similar initiatives may also be valuable in ALD.

### Response to the NCEPOD report: development of a care bundle for patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis-the first 24 H [^113DQhNJ]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Recently, there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of chronic liver disease in the UK, and as a result, hospital admissions and deaths due to liver disease have also increased. The 2013 National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) of patients with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) found that less than half the number of patients who died from ARLD received 'good care', and avoidable deaths were identified. In order to improve the care of patients admitted with ARLD, the NCEPOD report recommended that a 'toolkit' for the acute management of patients admitted with decompensated ARLD be developed and made widely available. As a result, we have developed a 'care bundle' for patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis (of all aetiologies) to ensure that effective evidence-based treatments are delivered within the first 24h. This care bundle provides a checklist to ensure that all appropriate investigations are undertaken when a patient with decompensated cirrhosis presents and provides clinicians with clear guidance on the initial management of alcohol withdrawal, infection, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding and encephalopathy. The first 24h are particularly important, as early intervention can reduce mortality and shorten hospital stay, and specialist gastroenterology/liver advice is not always available during this period. This review will discuss the care bundle and the evidence base behind the treatment recommendations made.

### Guidance for timely referral to liver transplantation [^1176hxii]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Morbidity and mortality from cirrhosis is increasing, and it is mainly driven by liver-associated decompensation. Liver transplantation (LT) is the only curative treatment for decompensated cirrhosis and selected liver-related complications and malignancies. Delayed referral or lack of referral in patients who will benefit from LT can impact quality of life for patients and their caregivers and lead to increased mortality. Timely identification of the clinical scenarios that will benefit from LT is key for patients not to lose their LT window. Early referral is also appropriate so that patients and providers can have access to multidisciplinary teams with dedicated expertise in managing the complications of decompensated cirrhosis. Referral for LT typically begins with primary care providers, gastroenterologists, and oncologists, who can more efficiently deliver their care through understanding of the referral process and LT framework. We aim to provide guidance to adult providers on timely referral to LT, demystify the LT evaluation process and contraindications to LT, and increase partnership between referring providers and transplant center providers caring for patients with advanced chronic liver disease.

Dyspnea in cirrhosis — palliative management emphasizes assessment, nonpharmacologic measures first, and cautious pharmacologic use aligned with patient goals. General principles state dyspnea should be approached by first assessing and addressing underlying causes, balanced with patient preferences; disease-directed therapies may be used as appropriate, and procedural options include paracentesis, thoracentesis, and TIPS. Indwelling abdominal drains may be used in some cases to address volume-related dyspnea when goals are comfort focused and have been associated with improved quality of life. Nonpharmacological treatments include supplemental oxygen (even in the absence of hypoxia) or a bedside fan, and self-care practices like relaxation, meditation, and guided imagery may decrease dyspnea. The mainstays of pharmacological management at the end of life are low-dose opioids and benzodiazepines; opioids or benzodiazepines should be used with caution, with careful discussion of risks and benefits, and because morphine is relatively contraindicated in advanced cirrhosis, clinicians should first consider hydromorphone or oxycodone. Guidance statements specify that patients should routinely be assessed for dyspnea and its impact on patient quality of life, function, and caregivers; nonpharmacological therapies should be used when possible (fan, supplemental oxygen, mindfulness); and pharmacological interventions may include opioids and anxiolytics with careful consideration of risks, goals, and prognosis.

Decompensated cirrhosis — sexual dysfunction requires proactive assessment and stepwise management, as "80% of women with cirrhosis suffer from sexual dysfunction, which leads to impaired HRQOL". Initial evaluation should include directly asking about symptoms (e.g., "Are you sexually satisfied?" and "Are you able to achieve orgasm?"), removing contributors ("medications (e.g., beta-blockers) and substances (e.g., alcohol, tobacco) that can cause sexual dysfunction should be removed, where appropriate") and medically managing conditions "such as depression and diabetes". Phosphodiesterase inhibitor therapy can be considered; in a small trial, tadalafil in "25 men with cirrhosis… and a mean MELD of 13 ± 4" at "10 mg over a 4-week period was a safe and efficacious approach", with adverse events of "dyspepsia (n = 2) and headache (n = 1)" and exclusion of encephalopathy; in settings of hypotension such medications are "contraindicated". Nonpharmacologic options "have not been tried in patients with cirrhosis, but may be a safe alternative", and "More research is needed… particularly among women". Guidance statements specify: "Sexual dysfunction is often important for quality of life of patients with DC and should be assessed", acknowledge that evidence is sparse but "tadalafil may be a safe short-term option in select patients", and emphasize "a notable lack of research… in women with cirrhosis".

Portal vein thrombosis

Increased levels of factor VIII (procoagulant driver) and decreased levels of protein C (anticoagulant driver), combined with reduced portal vein flow velocity and endothelial injury, increase the risk of portal vein thrombosis (PVT).

Many patients are asymptomatic; the diagnosis is often made on routine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance, or coincidentally during liver decompensation. However, PVT is independently associated with worsening decompensation, including variceal bleeding and with increased mortality in liver transplant candidates.

Initial diagnosis is made on Doppler US or CT imaging. MR/CT imaging should be performed to evaluate the extent of the thrombus and rule out neoplastic PVT/HCC. Consider screening for underlying thrombophilic conditions if there are extensive clots or other thromboses.

The management of PVT in cirrhosis is summarised in figure 2. Initial treatment is with anticoagulation, although treatment is not required in all cases. Chances of responding to anticoagulation are higher if treatment is started within 6 months of diagnosis. The recent Baveno VII guidelines recommend treatment in patients with cirrhosis and recent (< 6 months) PVT involving > 50% of the portal vein trunk lumen, any symptomatic PVT or PVT in potential liver transplant candidates. Treatment can also be considered if there is progression of thrombosis on early follow-up (1–3 months), or compromise of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV).

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^115UXPmD]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — purpose and scope states that there are approximately 800,000 hospitalizations a year for cirrhosis complications in the United States, and 7%–8% of these patients require intensive care at an estimated cost of $2 billion but without standardized intensive care protocols. Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a term often applied to patients with chronic liver disease with or without cirrhosis with hepatic and extrahepatic organ failures, most of whom require intensive care, and the document provides guidance and a data-supported approach for the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of patients with cirrhosis and ACLF as well as cirrhosis and critical illness; it differs from the AASLD Guidelines in that it was developed by consensus of an expert panel with oversight provided by the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee because there are an insufficient number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) available to support meaningful systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The introduction describes traditional stages of cirrhosis as a compensated phase with no complications and a decompensated phase that manifests with complications of portal hypertension, notes that there is a more rapid phase, and states that in cirrhosis precipitating events leading to hepatic and extrahepatic organ failures (e.g., neurologic, respiratory, circulatory, renal) may be liver related or non–liver related (e.g., surgery), and often the precipitant is not identified.

### Missed diagnosis of cirrhosis in the inpatient setting [^1172CQ3o]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Cirrhosis accounts for a large number of deaths in the United States and worldwide, leading to an increasing burden on the healthcare system. Cirrhosis is, however, a progressive disease with different potential complications related to liver dysfunction and portal hypertension. Often, patients may present with complications of cirrhosis without having been diagnosed previously. It is pertinent that clinicians recognize these signs to place patients on an appropriate course of management to help delay or avoid further disease progression while avoiding deleterious outcomes and unnecessary utilization. We will discuss the epidemiology of liver disease, cirrhosis, and its complications (hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and varices). In this study, we will discuss the rationale and impact of missing these diagnoses on the healthcare system and patient.

Monitoring response to therapy in patients with decompensated cirrhosis

Treatment of decompensation events is essential to cirrhosis management. Equally important is monitoring responses to treatment, which enables clinicians to adjust treatment duration and strategy, as well as evaluate treatment success. Furthermore, there is an unmet need to develop and validate predictive biomarkers that can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from treatments and those who are most likely to experience adverse events.

Monitoring response to diuretics in the treatment of ascites and edema

Ascites and edema develop with cirrhosis because of a marked alteration in the regulation of extracellular fluid volume. Sodium and associated water retention cause accumulation of extracellular fluid, which results in ascites and leg edema, leading to discomfort, impaired walking, and decreased quality of life. Pharmacotherapy with aldosterone antagonists, alone or combined with loop diuretics, can increase sodium excretion. The goal of this treatment is to achieve a negative sodium balance, which results in a negative fluid balance because water is eliminated with sodium. A low-sodium diet should also be implemented.

The ideal test for monitoring the efficacy of the treatment of ascites and edema would be an NIT to quantify fluid in extracellular spaces. Diuretics would be administered until fluid volume in the extracellular spaces had returned to normal. Unfortunately, such a tool does not exist. Instead, patients are monitored with less sophisticated tools that estimate the effect of treatment on total fluid (eg, by monitoring body weight). Alternatively, the biological effect of diuretics can be monitored easily by measuring changes in urinary sodium excretion (in mEq/day, measured accurately by 24 h urine collection). An effective treatment of ascites is associated with a reduction in body weight of no more than 0.5–1 kg per day (1 kg if peripheral edema is also present). Effective diuretic treatment should increase sodium excretion compared to baseline, with 24 h sodium excretion exceeding the presumed sodium intake (90–100 mEq/day with a low-sodium diet). The major risks associated with such treatment include diuretic-induced AKI and hypovolemia (Table 3).

### Management of ascites in elderly patients with cirrhosis: results of an Italian survey [^115tbXr3]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Ascites is the most common cause of decompensation in cirrhosis. Elderly patients with cirrhosis usually have multiple comorbidities, which can be a barrier to many therapeutic options. Therefore, the treatment choices available to these patients are limited and must be carefully selected on a case-by-case basis. In order to explore the management of ascites in elderly patients with cirrhosis in real-life, we conducted a survey among members of the AISF in July 2024, concerning patients with cirrhosis aged > 70 years with ascites. Physicians were invited to anonymously answer 49 questions on several topics. Data from 22 centers revealed that approximately 20% of these patients had intractable ascites, primarily caused by renal failure, hypotension, and hepatic encephalopathy. Diuretics were used in 62% of cases, while advanced therapies such as TIPS or transplantation were rare due to frailty and comorbidities. The dose and frequency of home albumin infusion was heterogeneous across centers, showing a non-uniform approach. Malnutrition was reported in nearly 50% of patients, but nutritional interventions were limited. Non-academic centers reported reduced availability to different therapeutic options, highlighting disparities in care. This study underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach and increased outpatient support to address the complex needs of elderly patients with cirrhosis and ascites.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of portal hypertension [^116UyWi9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Cirrhosis is a heterogeneous disease that cannot be studied as a single entity and is classified in two main prognostic stages: compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. Portal hypertension, characterized by a pathological increase of the portal pressure and by the formation of portal-systemic collaterals that bypass the liver, is the initial and main consequence of cirrhosis and is responsible for the majority of its complications. A myriad of treatment options exists for appropriately managing the most common complications of portal hypertension, including acute variceal bleeding and refractory ascites. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Recommendations for future research, audit and service development

Earlier detection of liver disease

It has been clear for some time that people with ALD are more likely to present late, with more advanced disease, compared with those with other causes of liver disease. Recent initiatives in the UK have sought to find cases of disease at an earlier stage, for example, by the use of TE in people at risk of disease. Understanding the value of this approach and the best way to implement methods of early detection will be essential for future service development.

NITs for risk assessment in ALD

There is a clear unmet need to understand which NITs have the greatest utility for the risk assessment of ALD, and the cut-off levels which are best suited to confirming or excluding advanced fibrosis and risk of liver-related ill health. The optimal timeframe for repeat testing in patients at low risk of disease at baseline also needs to be established.

Treatments and services for decompensated disease and AH

There have been no new treatments for decompensated ALD cirrhosis or AH since the introduction of corticosteroids several decades ago. Given the increasing number of admissions and deaths from ALD this is an important gap in our ability to care for patients and improve outcomes. Research into new treatments is necessary. Research into new methods of delivering care is also required for example the value of 'hub and spoke' relationships between secondary and tertiary care for improved access to specialist services, and delivery of hepatology services outside of traditional hospital settings such as outpatient clinics based in community or alcohol treatment centres. Innovative research methods may be necessary to effectively deliver research in this cohort since concomitant health and social issues may reduce the value of traditional trial methods.

### A new clinical and prognostic characterization of the patterns of decompensation of cirrhosis [^111E72zo]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

The prognostic impact of acute decompensation (AD), i.e. the development of complications that require hospitalization, has recently been assessed. However, complications of cirrhosis do not necessarily require hospitalization and can develop progressively, as in the recently defined non-acute decompensation (NAD). Nevertheless, there is no data regarding the incidence and prognostic impact of NAD. The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence and the prognostic impact of NAD and AD in outpatients with cirrhosis.

Methods

A total of 617 outpatients with cirrhosis from two Italian tertiary centers (Padua and Milan) were enrolled from January 2003 to June 2021 and followed prospectively until the end of the study, death or liver transplantation. The complications registered during follow-up were considered as AD if they required hospitalization, or NAD if managed at the outpatient clinic.

Results

During follow-up, 154 patients (25.0% of total patients) developed complications, 69 patients (44.8%) developed NAD and 85 (55.2%) developed AD, while 29 patients with NAD (42.0%) developed a further episode of AD during follow-up. Sixty-month survival was significantly higher in patients with no decompensation than in patients with NAD or AD. On multivariable analysis, AD (hazard ratio [HR] 21.07, p < 0.001), NAD (HR 7.13, p < 0.001), the etiological cure of cirrhosis (HR 0.38, p < 0.001) and model for end-stage liver disease score (HR 1.12, p = 0.003) were found to be independent predictors of mortality.

Conclusions

The first decompensation is non-acute in almost 50% of outpatients, though such events are still associated with decreased survival compared to no decompensation. Patients who develop NAD must be treated with extreme care and monitored closely to prevent the development of AD.

Impact and Implications

This multicenter study is the first to investigate the role of non-acute decompensation (NAD) in patients with cirrhosis. In fact, while the unfavorable impact of acute decompensation is well known, there is currently a dearth of evidence on NAD, despite it being a common occurrence in clinical practice. Our data show that almost half of decompensations in patients with cirrhosis can be considered NAD and that such events are associated with a higher risk of mortality than no decompensation. This study has important clinical implications because it highlights the need to carefully consider patients who develop NAD, in order to prevent further decompensation and reduce mortality.

### Management of the major complications of cirrhosis: beyond guidelines [^111bSgeR]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Along with a growing understanding of the pathophysiology of cirrhosis and its complications, new therapies and management strategies have emerged in recent years. Many of these advances have helped inform the current EASL clinical practice guidelines 1 on the management of some of the key complications of cirrhosis, such as ascites, variceal bleeding and infection. However, there are still some aspects of management where the evidence base is less clear, and/or where opinions amongst practitioners remain divided. Some of these more controversial areas are explored in this section, wherein we present evidence culminating in a suggested management approach based on expert opinion and extending beyond the current guidelines.

### ACG clinical guideline: malnutrition and nutritional recommendations in liver disease [^117PMsMf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — nutrition management in cirrhosis and liver disease states that patients with cirrhosis and/or alcohol-associated hepatitis should be assessed for malnutrition because it adversely affects outcomes including mortality and transplant-related outcomes. Among stable outpatients with cirrhosis, counseling should be done to eat small frequent meals, a night-time snack between 7 PM and 10 PM, and 2 or more cups of coffee daily. In selected patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, vitamin E 800 IU/d should be provided. Among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis, nutritional supplementation preferably by enteral route should be implemented in those with poor oral intake of daily requirements of proteins and/or calories. Protein intake should not be restricted including patients with decompensated cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. A vegetable source of protein seems to be better tolerated than an animal source of protein in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Branched chain amino acids augment the efficiency of lactulose and rifaximin therapy in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.

### Safety and efficacy of continuous infusion terlipressin (BIV201): a phase 2 trial in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and refractory ascites [^116s8aJj]. Liver Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

In the prespecified subgroup analysis, including only patients who completed both treatment cycles, there was a greater difference in liver complications in favor of the BIV201+SOC group versus the SOC group. A subsequent sensitivity analysis demonstrated a more pronounced effect when events of hyponatremia were omitted from the patients with concomitant gabapentinoid use. Similar results were observed for the 12-week change in cumulative ascites, with only a slight difference favoring the BIV201+SOC group in the FAS that was more robust among completers in the subgroup analysis. Other exploratory endpoints also demonstrated modest differences between groups in favor of BIV201+SOC versus SOC. These included the mean percentage change in the number of TPs, the time to first TP, and several patient-reported measures of QoL, such as the CLDQ. However, the benefit of BIV201 on these exploratory assessments was only observed at certain timepoints. The variability in these assessments over time is challenging to interpret, but may have resulted in part from the small sample size. Notably, feedback from the investigators that was available for 4 of 5 patients who completed both cycles of BIV201 indicated that those patients would have continued treatment with BIV201 had the protocol allowed it.

These results are consistent with previous studies from our group and others demonstrating a clinical benefit of continuous infusion of terlipressin in patients with cirrhosis and uncontrolled ascites. The sustained hemodynamic effects of continuous terlipressin infusion may help preserve renal function in patients with ascites, improving cardiac reserve and reducing the risk of HRS-AKI. A recent study found that ~50% of patients with cirrhosis who are managed on an outpatient basis develop complications gradually, with 42% of those patients progressing to acute decompensation. Notably, mortality was higher among those patients than compensated patients, highlighting the need to improve outpatient treatment options and prevent further decompensation. Additional long-term, multicenter studies are needed to determine whether BIV201 may be an appropriate outpatient treatment option for reducing ascites and liver complications, including HRS-AKI, in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Clinical staging and prognosis in cirrhosis — Cirrhosis presents as compensated or decompensated; decompensation is defined by clinically overt ascites, variceal hemorrhage or overt hepatic encephalopathy, and while median survival in compensated patients exceeds 12 years, once a decompensating event occurs median survival decreases to less than 1.5 years, with successive complications denoted as "further decompensation".

### Key insights and clinical pearls in the identification and management of cirrhosis and its complications [^116VZBsx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Cirrhosis is a prevalent, chronic condition with an asymptomatic compensated phase, in which patients may feel well, and a decompensated phase that begins with the onset of complications (eg hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and/or variceal bleeding). Because patients with cirrhosis may appear healthy with normal liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin levels, awareness of clinical signals is important. For example, patients with thrombocytopenia should be evaluated for chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Early recognition and management of cirrhosis-related complications (eg hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and/or variceal bleeding) are important, given their association with hospitalization and poor prognosis (eg increased odds of short-term mortality). Hepatic encephalopathy can be the most subtle cirrhosis-related complication and associated cognitive impairment may be misdiagnosed. Because hepatic encephalopathy can be associated with hospital readmissions, reducing readmission rates after hepatic encephalopathy-related hospitalizations is critical. This includes incorporating ongoing therapy (eg rifaximin plus lactulose) in postdischarge management plans to reduce the risk of hepatic encephalopathy recurrence. Strategies that mitigate cirrhosis progression and prevent the development of cirrhosis-related complications are key to improving patient outcomes.

### Quality standards for the management of alcohol-related liver disease: consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British society of gastroenterology ARLD special interest group [^115CzMhf]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

It should be documented that patients have been advised that complete abstinence from alcohol is associated with better prognosis in ALD and that stopping alcohol entirely should be their goal

It is clear that abstinence from alcohol is associated with better outcomes compared with people who continue to drink. Alcohol abstinence is also a prerequisite for consideration of liver transplantation should this become necessary. All patients with decompensated ALD cirrhosis including AH should therefore be advised that complete abstinence from alcohol should be the target of treatment. This may be an overwhelming goal and patients should be supported to work towards this target to avoid alienating them from treatment. This should be documented in patient notes, records and on electronic portals where possible with access for all clinicians involved in going care. A record of this advice should also be given to patients and general practitioners (usually via a discharge letter).

Patients presenting with decompensated ALD or AH should be screened for infection

Alcohol consumption increases the risk of infection, and infection is a common cause of decompensated liver disease. Infection may be present at presentation or occur during admission particularly in AH, and is associated with poorer outcomes. This advice regarding screening for infection is consistent with the BSG/BASL decompensated cirrhosis bundle. Monitoring for signs of infection should continue throughout an admission with particular vigilance in patients with AH who are treated with corticosteroids where incident infection is associated with poor outcomes. It is important to note that standard laboratory markers of infection for example, leukocytosis or elevated C reactive protein may be part of the syndrome of AH and not necessarily reflect active infection; these should be interpreted with caution and additional evidence for active infection should be sought. This said, given the adverse outcome with infection a low threshold for prescribing antibiotics is appropriate. The possibility of fungal infection should be considered: this may be more frequent in AH and associated with poor outcomes. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment in AH has been shown not to improve mortality or morbidity in AH and should not replace careful monitoring for signs of infection.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^111BuNzi]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Infection management in ACLF — treatment urgency, bacterascites, and escalation/de-escalation are described as follows: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the most common infection in patients with ACLF, and delay in starting treatment at hospital admission in patients with SBP almost triples the in-hospital mortality with each hour delay, increasing the absolute risk of in-hospital death by 3.3%; therefore first antibiotic doses for patients with ACLF should be given in the emergency room and the pharmacist should minimize the salt load with antibiotic administration. Although a nonneurotoxic bacterascites does not necessarily require therapy in outpatients, bacterascites in inpatients increases the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), ACLF, and increased mortality, necessitating early antibiotic therapy. Once culture results return, de-escalation of antibiotics is important; in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with ACLF, lack of clinical improvement after 48 h should trigger broadening of antibiotic coverage and consideration of fungal coverage. In liver transplant (LT) candidates, reactivation for transplant as soon as clinical improvement and control of infection is achieved may open a "window of opportunity" for transplant in the setting of infection-related ACLF or decompensation.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^112RNz4k]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

This guideline presents a comprehensive approach to perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis. Recognizing the unique surgical risks in this population, the guideline emphasizes a multidisciplinary approach to preoperative evaluation, perioperative care, and postoperative follow-up. Key considerations include the severity of liver disease, nonhepatic comorbidities, and surgery-specific factors, with an emphasis on the use of validated cirrhosis-specific risk calculators, such as the VOCAL-Penn Score, for individualized risk stratification. Recommendations highlight preoperative optimization strategies, including nutritional support, management of portal hypertension, correction of hemostatic abnormalities, and addressing frailty and sarcopenia. For patients with decompensated cirrhosis, interventions such as transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt may reduce portal pressure and surgical risks when indicated. Elective surgeries, including cholecystectomy and hernia repair, are advised for select patients with compensated cirrhosis, whereas alternatives to surgery are explored for high-risk patients. The guideline underscores the importance of performing surgeries at high-volume centers with expertise in managing patients with cirrhosis and emphasizes shared decision-making informed by objective risk assessments. Furthermore, it addresses procedure-specific considerations, including the role of bariatric and cardiac surgeries in cirrhotic patients. Through evidence-based recommendations and expert insights, this guideline aims to enhance surgical outcomes and inform clinical decision-making in a growing population of patients with cirrhosis undergoing surgery.

### Adult liver transplantation: a UK clinical guideline-part 1: pre-operation [^113kzJz1]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

How to manage the patient on the waiting list

During 2015–2016, 1161 patients joined the LT waiting list in the UK. At 1-year post-registration, 73% of patients had received a LT, 9% had died waiting or been removed due to deterioration. A further 4% were removed for other reasons such as clinical improvement, non-compliance or at patient's request. The remaining 14% were still waiting.

The waiting times depend on several factors, including recipient blood group, size and illness severity (i.e. UKELD score). The median waiting time is currently 135 days, though this is shorter for recipients who are blood group AB (56 days), A (84 days) and B (129 days) than blood group O (256 days). Details of organ allocation are outlined in Part 2.

Monitoring on the waiting list

Patients listed for LT must be monitored closely for changes in their clinical circumstances. The 'local' team manage all the patient's routine care, but as this may impact on their suitability for LT, regular and careful communication with the LTU, via the TC is essential (see figure 2).

Optimisation of patients on the waiting list

Managing deterioration

Patients on the LT waiting list frequently present with decompensation to their referring hospital. This decompensation carries a significant mortality risk.

The Lancet Standing Commission on Liver Disease has highlighted the need to focus on improving the care for acutely ill, hospitalised patients with liver disease. Ideally, hospitals should have in place a 'care bundle' for patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis.

Management of listed patients in the referring hospital

Patients on LT waiting list require monthly review in gastroenterology/hepatology outpatient clinics for nutritional review, blood-sampling, UKELD calculation and surveillance tests for cirrhosis. The LTU should be appraised of any deterioration, as listing status may need reviewing. Transfer to the LTU for acute deterioration is sometimes necessary, but if not, the confidence of patients and their carers is enhanced when there is open dialogue between the local hospital and the LTU.

### Health-related quality of life in patients with liver cirrhosis following adjunctive nurse-based care versus standard medical care: a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled study [^111E6VJu]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) involves a person's subjective experience of the physical, psychological and social aspects of their daily life. HRQoL is influenced by cultural context as well as personal values, goals and levels of independence. Compared with the general population, HRQoL is usually impaired in individuals with liver cirrhosis, the final stage of chronic liver disease. The transition from compensated liver cirrhosis to the decompensated phase is characterised by the development of severe symptoms, such as ascites, overt hepatic encephalopathy and/or bleeding from gastro-oesophageal varices. The decompensated phase is also afflicted with an increased risk of malnutrition, sarcopenia and physical frailty. The disease entails a mental burden, including depression, stigmatisation, anxietyand existential concerns. Accordingly, liver cirrhosis disease affects both the physicaland psychological domains of HRQoL, making patients' daily lives vulnerable and unpredictable. Patients with impaired HRQoL face a higher risk of hospitalisation related to liver cirrhosis. Therefore, identifying worsened HRQoL has a prognostic value in liver cirrhosis.

It has been reported that regular registered nurse (RN)-led visits may add a holistic and person-centred perspective to the standard medical outpatient care, enabling patients to make informed decisions and undertake self-care actions to improve their health. These RN-led visits also have the potential to reduce mortalityand increase patient-perceived quality of care. Despite patients repeatedly reporting difficulties in understanding how to manage their liver disease, support from healthcare providers that facilitate access to and understanding of health-related informationremains largely insufficient in outpatient care. Hence, continuous and person-centred collaboration with healthcare providers, delivered by RNs within hepatology healthcare teams, may improve patients' HRQoL, as has been confirmed in the management of other somatic diseases. However, only a few studies have previously evaluated the effectiveness of RN involvement in improving HRQoL for patients with liver cirrhosis. None of these applied to both compensated and decompensated phases of the disease. Accordingly, the primary aim of this study was to compare HRQoL in patients with either decompensated or compensated liver cirrhosis after receiving either standard medical outpatient care or an adjunctive person-centred nurse-led intervention, the Quality Liver Nursing Care Model (QLiNCaM). Secondary aims were to compare the risk of malnutrition, decompensation events and mortality rates between the two study groups.

### Management of decompensated cirrhosis in the surgical ICU: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^113vRnCa]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Critical Care Committee develops Clinical Consensus Documents to provide practical guidance to the surgical intensivist on challenging topics. These documents are based on expert consensus following review of the literature. The Critical Care Committee chose the management of decompensated cirrhosis (DC) in the intensive care unit (ICU) as a topic appropriate for review. Specifically, these are patients with underlying cirrhosis who have decompensation precipitated by other disease or injury; these recommendations do not apply to patients with acute liver failure or hemorrhage-related shock liver.

DC is a common clinical entity, with an estimated 10.6 million prevalent cases globally in 2017, and with the number of cases having more than tripled since 1990. Patients with DC are particularly challenging to manage in the surgical ICU due to their comorbidities related to underlying liver dysfunction. This clinical consensus document is not intended as a comprehensive overview of the topic. It addresses several important practical considerations for intensivists in the care of the critically ill patient with DC, including: end points of resuscitation, ascites management and avoidance of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (PPCD), gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis, management of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and nutritional support (recommendations summarized in table 1).

### An evidence-based medicine approach to β-blocker therapy in patients with cirrhosis [^113VxNUw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Disease management strategies have gained attention in recent years because of their potential to improve health-related quality of life and prevent excessive resource use. Despite recognition as an important cause of mortality, cirrhosis with portal hypertension has not been widely discussed as a condition amenable to planned care management. Given the effect of variceal hemorrhage as the most immediate life-threatening complication of portal hypertension, a number of high-quality controlled clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy of beta-blocker therapy for primary and secondary prophylaxis. Despite the existence of practice guidelines that incorporate this information, specific clinical scenarios that demand consideration for beta-blocker therapy have not been well described. In this article, a number of hypothetical patient-based cases drawn from the authors' experiences are utilized to illustrate these issues.

### Treatment for ascites in adults with decompensated liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^1173NWrF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 20% of people with cirrhosis develop ascites. Several different treatments are available; including, among others, paracentesis plus fluid replacement, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts, aldosterone antagonists, and loop diuretics. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their relative efficacy.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for ascites in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for ascites according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until May 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and ascites.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and ascites. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio, rate ratio, and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance.

Main Results

We included a total of 49 randomised clinical trials (3521 participants) in the review. Forty-two trials (2870 participants) were included in one or more outcomes in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies, without other features of decompensation, having mainly grade 3 (severe), recurrent, or refractory ascites. The follow-up in the trials ranged from 0.1 to 84 months. All the trials were at high risk of bias, and the overall certainty of evidence was low or very low. Approximately 36.8% of participants who received paracentesis plus fluid replacement (reference group, the current standard treatment) died within 11 months. There was no evidence of differences in mortality, adverse events, or liver transplantation in people receiving different interventions compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement (very low-certainty evidence). Resolution of ascites at maximal follow-up was higher with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (HR 9.44; 95% CrI 1.93 to 62.68) and adding aldosterone antagonists to paracentesis plus fluid replacement (HR 30.63; 95% CrI 5.06 to 692.98) compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement (very low-certainty evidence). Aldosterone antagonists plus loop diuretics had a higher rate of other decompensation events such as hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and variceal bleeding compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement (rate ratio 2.04; 95% CrI 1.37 to 3.10) (very low-certainty evidence). None of the trials using paracentesis plus fluid replacement reported health-related quality of life or symptomatic recovery from ascites.

Funding

the source of funding for four trials were industries which would benefit from the results of the study; 24 trials received no additional funding or were funded by neutral organisations; and the source of funding for the remaining 21 trials was unclear.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on very low-certainty evidence, there is considerable uncertainty about whether interventions for ascites in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis decrease mortality, adverse events, or liver transplantation compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis and ascites. Based on very low-certainty evidence, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and adding aldosterone antagonists to paracentesis plus fluid replacement may increase the resolution of ascites compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement. Based on very low-certainty evidence, aldosterone antagonists plus loop diuretics may increase the decompensation rate compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement.

### Acute-on-chronic liver failure clinical guidelines [^113KZZoB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients with cirrhosis and chronic liver disease, acute-on-chronic liver failure is emerging as a major cause of mortality. These guidelines indicate the preferred approach to the management of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. In instances where the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, key concept statements were developed using expert consensus. These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable and should be viewed as the preferred, but not only, approach to clinical scenarios.

### Integration of palliative and supportive care in the management of advanced liver disease: development and evaluation of a prognostic screening tool and supportive care intervention [^113BJ2Zk]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Patients with decompensated cirrhosis rarely receive palliative and supportive care interventions, which are routine in other life-limiting diseases. We aimed to design and evaluate a prognostic screening tool to routinely identify inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis at high risk of dying over the coming year, alongside the development of a supportive care intervention.

Design

Clinical notes from consecutive patients admitted as an emergency to University Hospitals Bristol with a diagnosis of cirrhosis over two distinct 90-day periods were scrutinised retrospectively for the presence or absence of five evidence-based factors associated with poor prognosis. These were analysed against their ability to predict mortality at 1year. 'Plan-Do-Study-Act' (PDSA) methodology was used to incorporate poor-prognosis screening into the routine assessment of patients admitted with cirrhosis, and develop a supportive care intervention.

Results

73 admissions were scrutinised (79.5% male, 63% alcohol-related liver disease, median age 54). The presence of three or more poor-prognosis criteria at admission predicted 1-year mortality with sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of 72.2%, 83.8% and 81.3%, respectively, and was used as a trigger for implementing the supportive care intervention. Following modification from six PDSA cycles, prognostic screening was integrated into the assessment of all patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis, with the supportive care intervention (developed simultaneously) instigated for appropriate patients.

Conclusions

We describe a model of care which identifies inpatients with cirrhosis at significant risk of dying over the coming year, and describe development of a supportive care intervention, which can be offered to suitable patients in parallel to ongoing active management.

Regarding medical management for ascites, more specifically with respect to management of hyponatremia, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to manage outpatient asymptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis by restricting both sodium and water (aim for 1–1.5 L of daily fluid intake), modifying diuretics and laxatives, and monitoring electrolytes.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^114Kcsj1]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The development of ascites is a landmark in the natural history of cirrhosis. Therefore, it should be considered an important time point at which an individual patient's suitability for liver transplantation which is a definitive treatment of ascites and its complications, should be determined. Over the years, there has been a substantial improvement in care of patients with cirrhosis, including those with ascites. A study involving over 780 000 hospitalisations of patients with cirrhosis demonstrated an improvement in inpatient survival over a decade despite higher age and more medically complex disease. This was remarkably consistent across several cirrhosis complications, suggesting improved cirrhosis care beyond general improvements in inpatient care. Future research should focus on areas of need and questions where there is no high-quality evidence to guide the management of ascites.

### Improved outcomes following the implementation of a decompensated cirrhosis discharge bundle [^111PLsAv]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Baseline review of the management of patients with DC at discharge

Consecutive patients discharged with DC (including Jaundice, ascites, variceal bleeding and HE) from the gastroenterology/hepatology wards at the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (NUTH) were included from January to December 2017. Individual patients were only included once during the review period.

A comprehensive data collection tool was developed to review the management of cirrhotic complications at discharge based on the recommendations from the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL). A retrospective review of the patients' medical notes was undertaken to identify if specific aspects of their management were addressed at discharge, including management of ascites, varices, HE, diuretics/electrolyte monitoring and alcohol harm reduction. In addition, we assessed 30-day readmission rates, including the presenting reason. 'Potentially preventable' readmissions were defined as those that we believe could have been avoided with improved discharge planning (eg, a patient presenting with ascites to the emergency department rather than having day-case elective paracentesis).

Development of the 'DCDB' and 'cirrhosis patient self-management toolkit'

Following the baseline review, we developed the 'DCDB' to standardise the management of patients at the time of discharge (figure 1 and online supplemental file 1). This provides a perihospital discharge checklist to be completed by the ward medical staff to ensure that appropriate investigations and management are instituted according to EASL guidelines. Subsequently, the DCDB was reviewed by the BSG liver section and BASL and was endorsed following some minor modification. The BSG/BASL versions of the DCDB are available at.

Second, in collaboration with LIVErNORTH, our local liver patient charity, we developed a 'Cirrhosis patient self-management toolkit' (online supplemental file 2) to provide detailed information about cirrhosis to help patients and their caregivers to manage aspects of their care. This document includes helpful information to empower patients and encourage self-management of complications such as HE and ascites.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^115rYZxw]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Abdominal distension attributable to refractory ascites — palliative options and outcomes include the following: Large volume paracentesis (LVP) requires multiple visits to the hospital and can be burdensome, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an option but many patients with refractory ascites are not candidates because of encephalopathy, cardiac contraindications, or high MELD scores. Indwelling peritoneal drains or catheters have been evaluated for palliation, and a systematic review including 176 patients reported patients' MELD scores ranged from 10 to 22, technical success was 100% with noninfectious complications generally low (< 12%), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurred in 0%–42% with an overall combined rate of 17%, and other complications included cellulitis at the catheter insertion site (6%), transient hyponatremia (11%), and increased serum creatinine (8%). A 12-week, small feasibility, unblinded randomized controlled trial compared LVP to long-term abdominal drains in 36 transplant-ineligible patients with refractory ascites, noted no drain-related serious adverse events or drain removals attributable to complications, found patients in the LVP group had more than double the ascites-related hospital time than the drain group, observed self-limiting cellulitis/leakage 41% versus 11% and peritonitis 6% versus 11%, and reported overall attrition 42% with deaths 7 of 16 and 5 of 18; at study end, all surviving drain participants elected to retain the drains.

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^114c3m7Q]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Summary of all recommendations

Recommendations: primary prophylaxis of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhosis (Figure 2)
What is the best method for primary prophylaxis? We recommend non-cardioselective β blockers (NSBB) or variceal band ligation (VBL). We suggest pharmacological treatment with propranolol as first line. VBL is offered if there are contraindications to NSBB. The choice of VBL or NSBB should also take into account patient choice (level 1a, grade A). We suggest carvedilol or nadolol as alternatives to propranolol (level 1b, grade A). Dose: Propranolol: 40 mg twice daily. Dose titrated to maximum tolerated or once heart rate (HR) of 50–55 bpm is reached to a maximum dose of 320 mg (level 1a, grade A). Nadolol: 40 mg daily dose. Dose titrated to maximum tolerated or once HR of 50–55 bpm is reached a maximum dose of 240 mg (level 1a, grade A). Carvedilol: 6.25 mg once daily to increase to maintenance of 12.5 mg after a week if tolerated or once HR of < 50–55 bpm is reached (level 1a, grade A). It is suggested that NSBB are discontinued at the time of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, renal impairment and hypotension (level 2b, grade B). In cases of contraindications or intolerance to NSBB, we recommend variceal band ligation (level 1a, grade A).
Who should have surveillance for variceal bleeding? We recommend all patients with cirrhosis should be endoscoped at the time of diagnosis (level 1a, grade A). There is no indication to repeat endoscopy in patients receiving NSBB.
How often should cirrhotic patients be endoscoped? If at the time of first endoscopy no varices are seen, we suggest that patients with cirrhosis should be endoscoped at 2–3-year intervals (level 2a, grade B). If grade I varices are diagnosed, we suggest that patients should be endoscoped at yearly intervals (level 2a, grade B). If there is clear evidence of disease progression we suggest that the intervals can be modified by the clinician. Endoscopy should also be offered at time of decompensation (level 2a, grade B).
Which patients with cirrhosis should have primary prophylaxis? If grade I varices and red signs or grade 2–3 varices are diagnosed, we recommend that patients have primary prophylaxis irrespective of the severity of the liver disease (level 1a, grade A).
Treatments not recommended: Proton pump inhibitors are not recommended unless otherwise required for peptic ulcer disease (level 1b, grade B). Isosorbide mononitrate monotherapy is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1b, grade A). There is insufficient evidence to recommend isosorbide mononitrate in combination with NSBB (level 1b, grade A). Shunt surgery or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1a, grade A). Sclerotherapy is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1a, grade A).
Areas requiring further study: Role of NSBB in patients without varices, with focus on carvedilol. Role of NSBB in patients with small varices, with focus on carvedilol. Comparison of carvedilol versus propranolol in primary prophylaxis. Identification of, and trials assessing, new drugs for primary prophylaxis such as statins.
Quality indicator: Percentage of patients at diagnosis of cirrhosis who have had an endoscopy to screen for varices (level 1a, grade A). Numerator; patients diagnosed with cirrhosis who have had an endoscopy either before or after diagnosis within 6 months. Denominator; patients newly diagnosed with cirrhosis. Percentage of patients receiving primary prophylaxis among those newly diagnosed with grade I varices and red signs or grade 2–3 varices. Numerator; patients who have grade 1 varices with red signs or grade 2–3 varices receiving primary prophylaxis. Denominator; patients diagnosed with cirrhosis who have grade I varices with red signs or grade 2–3 varices.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^1127ouKc]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of ascites, diuretic therapy, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain frequent clinical and biochemical monitoring during the first weeks of diuretic treatment, particularly on the first presentation.

### Hepatic encephalopathy and strategies to prevent readmission from inadequate transitions of care [^115praDH]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

One of the most costly and frequent causes of hospital readmissions in the United States is hepatic encephalopathy in patients with underlying liver cirrhosis. In this narrative review, we cover current practices in inpatient management, transitions of care, and strategies to prevent hospital readmissions. Bundled approaches using a model such as the "Ideal Transitions of Care" appear to be more likely to prevent readmissions and assist patients as they transition to outpatient care. Numerous strategies have been evaluated to prevent readmissions in patients with hepatic encephalopathy, including technologic interventions, involvement of nonphysician team members, early follow-up strategies, and involvement of palliative care when appropriate.

### Management challenges of liver cirrhosis… [^1167wrUu]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

A complete diagnosis should include the cause of the liver disease and determine if the patient has decompensated liver disease. Laboratory tests determine the presence and severity of disease and help establish the etiology. An increase in aminotransferase suggests hepatocellular disease; a predominant increase in alkaline phosphatase indicates cholestatic or biliary tract problems. Imaging studies may reveal outflow obstruction. For a comprehensive review of additional diagnostic tests. see the accompanying table. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Clinical presentation varies widely, ranging from complete absence of symptoms to vague illness to serious decompensated liver disease.

Physical signs, caused by hyperdynamic circulation and blood shunting around the liver, include tachycardia, a bounding pulse, warm extremities and breathlessness. Management focuses primarily on treating complications. Dietary restrictions generally are not needed in uncomplicated cirrhosis, although patients with edema should avoid salt. Diuretics can help reduce fluid accumulation, but patients with resistant ascites are candidates for a shunt procedure or a liver transplant. Patients who have cirrhosis with ascites are prone to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Signs and symptoms of the latter include fever, abdominal pain and an ascitic fluid neutrophil count of more than 250 per mm³. Intravenous antibiotic therapy is appropriate. Portal hypertension with bleeding varices is a serious complication of cirrhosis that can be treated surgically and with drug therapy.

Patients with encephalopathy require a low-protein diet and enough lactulose to produce three or four bowel movements daily. Hepatorenal syndrome, defined as oliguric renal failure in a patient with advanced liver disease, is caused by reduced renal perfusion. Treatment is limited to placement of a shunt or liver transplant. Because cirrhosis is considered a premalignant condition with an enhanced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, screening with alpha-fetoprotein determinations and ultrasonography every six months is appropriate.

### Diagnosis and management of cirrhosis and its complications… [^116BmY3F]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Prevention of bleeding: carvedilol, 12. 5 mg, daily; propranolol, 40 mg, twice a day increased up to 160 mg twice a day with goal heart rate of 55 beats/min Active bleeding: Intravenous octreotide/terlipressin ceftriaxone. Band ligation or sclerotherapy of varices Primary prophylaxis with carvedilol or propranolol in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 201 patients with CSPH, carvedilol or propranolol reduced risk of decompensation or death by 3 y. Third-generation cephalosporin for 5 d Albumin, 1. 5g/kg, on day 1 and 1 g/kg on day 2 Meropenem and daptomycin for nosocomial SBP Albumin: compared with antibiotics alone, reduces 3-mo mortality in RCT of 126 patients from 41% to 22%; kidney injury occurred in 33% vs 6%. If nosocomial SBP: in a randomized trial of 32 patients, compared with ceftazidime, meropenem and daptomycin increased SBP resolution but not 90-d survival Terlipressin, 0.

85 mg, IV every 6 h. Observational study of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: compared with no treatment, antiviral therapy was associated with a lower risk of HCC, decompensation, and death in people with cirrhosis from Hong Kong, South Korea, and California. What can be done to improve survival among patients with compensated cirrhosis. Survival for patients with cirrhosis is improved with control of their underlying chronic liver disease. Beyond that, screening for liver cancer with biannual ultrasound and α-fetoprotein is associated with higher rates of curative treatment when cancer is detected. When patients develop portal hypertension, nonselective β-blockers are associated with lower rates of decompensation or death.
