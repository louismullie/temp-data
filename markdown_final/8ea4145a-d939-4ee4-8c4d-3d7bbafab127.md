## Question

what is recommended management for patient with hypothyroidism TSH 6.344 on levothyroxine 200mcg daily who is compliant with their medication

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about recommended management for a patient with hypothyroidism and a TSH 6.344 mIU/L despite taking levothyroxine 200 mcg daily with reported compliance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this reflects inadequate biochemical control and confirm the hypothyroidism type. Then, I should verify true adherence and administration timing. Next, I will systematically check for assay, medication, dietary, and disease interferences. After that, I will consider a same‑dose formulation switch before escalating the dose. If TSH remains high, I will titrate in appropriate increments with correct monitoring intervals. I should also reassess individualized TSH targets by age and comorbidities and set a long‑term monitoring strategy aligned with guideline recommendations [^116NSG5q] [^112VueCg] [^117QfEeg].

> Let me first confirm the clinical framing. A TSH of 6.344 mIU/L while on replacement generally indicates under-replacement in primary hypothyroidism and warrants action to achieve a TSH within the reference interval, ideally toward 1–3 mIU/L in younger adults, although targets are individualized by age and context [^111wnznq] [^117XdzVq]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — if this were central hypothyroidism, TSH would be unreliable and free T4 would guide therapy, but given the scenario describes primary hypothyroidism on levothyroxine, TSH remains the principal biochemical target [^113m2fbv].

> I will now examine "true" adherence and administration, because timing and co‑ingestion are frequent hidden causes of elevated TSH despite pill taking. The drug should be taken consistently either 60 minutes before breakfast or at bedtime at least 3 hours after the evening meal with water only, avoiding food and interfering beverages near the dose, and the regimen should be kept stable relative to meals and other medications [^112VueCg] [^113LxrHd]. Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetics — I initially thought levothyroxine has a 4–6 week half‑life; that's not correct, the half‑life is about a week, but the peak therapeutic effect and steady state after a dose change are reached in roughly 4–6 weeks, so repeating TSH no sooner than 6 weeks after optimizing administration is appropriate [^117QfEeg] [^111wnznq].

> Next, I should review for assay and extrinsic interferences that could explain an elevated TSH at a high dose. I need to check for biotin use and have the patient hold it for at least 2 days before thyroid tests to avoid assay interference, and I should remember that TSH results can differ materially across platforms, so if results are discordant with the clinical picture, repeating on an alternative assay is reasonable [^117QfEeg] [^1127zjRW]. But wait, what if we are dealing with transient dietary effects or a recent change in habits such as coffee at dose time or a new breakfast schedule — guidelines advise retesting before escalating in such contexts after counseling on correct use, which dovetails with the adherence optimization step [^113AV4mB].

> I will now examine medication, supplement, and dietary factors that impair absorption. I need to check for calcium, iron, bile acid sequestrants, proton pump inhibitors, and estrogen therapy taken near the dose, as well as frequent soy, high‑fiber intake, and coffee within an hour of dosing, any of which can reduce tablet absorption and raise TSH on a seemingly adequate dose [^117QfEeg] [^112GMb8Q]. Hold on, I should also screen for gastrointestinal disorders such as celiac disease, H. pylori gastritis, lactose intolerance, and other malabsorption states, because addressing these or adapting the formulation can normalize TSH without simply increasing the dose [^112GMb8Q].

> Given the already high dose of 200 mcg, let me consider a formulation switch before dose escalation. The European Thyroid Association specifically recommends switching from tablets to a liquid solution or softgel capsule at the same microgram dose in patients with repeated above‑range TSH after counseling on correct administration, because these formulations are less susceptible to food, coffee, gastric pH, and excipient issues and often normalize TSH without changing the dose [^116NSG5q] [^115V2h1X] [^112GMb8Q]. I should confirm the plan to recheck TSH approximately 6 weeks after the switch to allow for steady state on the new formulation and keep all other variables stable [^111wnznq].

> If TSH remains above the goal after verified correct use and a formulation change, I should adjust the dose in clinically meaningful steps. I need to ensure increments of about 12.5–25 mcg rather than tiny micro‑adjustments, then reassess TSH and free T4 in 6–8 weeks to judge the effect, because smaller changes do not meaningfully affect symptoms or quality of life and add complexity without benefit [^111wnznq] [^115a5BfG] [^111cpkBq]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — if the patient is on a softgel or liquid already and still needs escalation, I should double‑check that no new interacting medication or dietary pattern has emerged during the interval [^117QfEeg] [^113AV4mB].

> If the problem persists despite correct administration, no identifiable interferences, and doses exceeding roughly 200–225 mcg, I should broaden the differential. Let me think about dose per kilogram and body composition; typical full replacement approximates 1.6 mcg/kg/day, but in obesity dosing to lean body mass is more appropriate, and sex‑related differences in requirement per kg have been described, so I should calculate and reconcile the dose with these factors rather than escalating blindly [^115iuzjg] [^113285Rp] [^116MHcEx]. I should confirm assay reliability if discordant results persist and consider central hypothyroidism if clinical context suggests pituitary disease, in which case free T4, not TSH, guides titration to the mid‑upper reference range [^1127zjRW] [^113m2fbv].

> I need to ensure the TSH target is individualized by age and comorbidity. Hmm, wait a minute, I started to say "aim low for everyone", but I should correct that: in older adults, especially over 80, the upper limit of normal rises and maintaining a higher TSH, even up to about 7.5 mIU/L, can be appropriate to avoid overtreatment, whereas in younger adults many experts favor a target near 1–3 mIU/L when feasible, always avoiding TSH suppression unless specifically indicated for cancer [^116E5fuv] [^117XdzVq]. I should confirm that guideline principles also emphasize staying within the reference interval and avoiding unnecessary overtreatment, tailoring to cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or osteoporosis risk rather than chasing very low TSH values in such patients [^111cpkBq].

> For long‑term monitoring, let me review stability practices. I should maintain the same brand and formulation once control is achieved and, if any change is necessary, remeasure TSH and free T4 about 6 weeks later, since even inter‑manufacturer generic switches can alter bioavailability enough to shift TSH in some patients [^111wnznq]. I should double‑check monitoring frequency; annual TSH is reasonable when stable, but higher daily doses are associated with greater instability, so some patients warrant more frequent checks, and I should avoid continual micro‑titrations that do not improve quality of life once TSH is at goal [^114VwJPF] [^115a5BfG].

> Let me summarize and make sure the sequence is safe and evidence‑based before finalizing. First, confirm correct administration and hold biotin, then retest in about 6 weeks. Second, systematically remove absorption and assay interferences. Third, if TSH remains high at 200 mcg, switch to liquid or softgel at the same dose and recheck in 6 weeks. Fourth, if still elevated, increase by 12.5–25 mcg and reassess at 6–8 weeks. Fifth, if refractory, compute dose per kg with attention to lean mass and sex differences, re‑evaluate assays, and rule out central hypothyroidism while individualizing TSH targets by age and comorbidity, maintaining brand consistency and sensible monitoring thereafter [^116NSG5q] [^111wnznq] [^112GMb8Q] [^116E5fuv].

For a patient with hypothyroidism, TSH 6.344 mIU/L, and confirmed compliance on 200 mcg/day levothyroxine, the most likely cause is **malabsorption or interference**. The recommended management is to **confirm TSH elevation** with repeat testing, review administration timing, and check for interfering medications or supplements [^112VueCg] [^113AV4mB]. If TSH remains elevated, **switch to a liquid or softgel levothyroxine** at the same dose, as these formulations improve absorption and often normalize TSH without dose increase [^115V2h1X] [^116NSG5q]. If TSH is still high after 6 weeks, evaluate for gastrointestinal disorders (celiac, H. pylori, IBD, bariatric surgery) and consider combination LT4/LT3 therapy only if malabsorption is excluded and symptoms persist [^112GMb8Q] [^117XdzVq]. Monitor TSH every 6–8 weeks until stable, then every 6–12 months [^111cpkBq].

---

## Confirm true TSH elevation and compliance

- **Repeat TSH testing**: Confirm the elevated TSH with a repeat test, ideally using the same assay, as transient fluctuations or assay variability can occur [^113AV4mB] [^1127zjRW].

- **Review levothyroxine administration**: Ensure the patient takes levothyroxine consistently, 30–60 minutes before breakfast or at bedtime ≥ 3 hours after the last meal, with water only [^112VueCg] [^113LxrHd].

- **Check for interfering medications and supplements**: Identify calcium, iron, proton pump inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants, sucralfate, antacids, or biotin, which can impair absorption or assay accuracy [^112VueCg] [^117QfEeg].

---

## Evaluate for malabsorption or interference

Persistent TSH elevation despite high-dose levothyroxine and confirmed compliance strongly suggests malabsorption or interference. Evaluate for **celiac disease, H. pylori infection, inflammatory bowel disease, lactose intolerance, or prior bariatric surgery**, as these can reduce levothyroxine absorption [^112GMb8Q]. Additionally, address dietary factors — such as excess fiber, soy, or coffee taken close to dosing — that impair absorption by ensuring consistent timing and separation from these foods [^112VueCg].

---

## Switch to alternative levothyroxine formulations

If malabsorption or interference is suspected, **switch to a liquid or softgel levothyroxine formulation at the same dose**, which has superior absorption and often normalizes TSH without a dose increase [^115V2h1X] [^116NSG5q]. Recheck TSH and free T4 6 weeks after the switch to assess response [^111wnznq].

---

## Consider combination therapy if malabsorption is excluded

If malabsorption is excluded and TSH remains elevated with persistent symptoms, consider **LT4/LT3 combination therapy**. A trial of LT4/LT3 (e.g. 10:1 to 20:1 ratio) may be used in selected patients with ongoing symptoms despite normalized TSH, with close monitoring for adverse effects [^115a2k8B].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor **TSH every 6–8 weeks** after any dose or formulation change until stable, then every 6–12 months [^111cpkBq]. Also assess for symptoms of hypo- or hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular effects, and bone health, especially with high doses or combination therapy [^111cpkBq].

## Summary of recommended management steps

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm TSH elevation with repeat testing |
| 2 | Review levothyroxine administration and adherence |
| 3 | Identify interfering medications or supplements |
| 4 | Evaluate for gastrointestinal malabsorption |
| 5 | Switch to liquid or softgel levothyroxine formulation |
| 6 | Recheck TSH and free T4 after 6 weeks |
| 7 | Consider combination LT4/LT3 therapy if malabsorption excluded and symptoms persist |
| 8 | - Monitor TSH every 6–8 weeks until stable <br/> - Then every 6–12 months |

---

Persistent TSH elevation despite high-dose levothyroxine and confirmed compliance usually reflects **malabsorption or interference**. The recommended approach is to confirm the TSH, optimize administration, identify interfering factors, and switch to a liquid or softgel formulation; consider combination therapy only if malabsorption is excluded and symptoms persist, with regular monitoring to maintain euthyroidism.

Hypothyroidism requires lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy in most patients. Oral levothyroxine (LT4) is an established, safe, and effective treatment for hypothyroidism, but some issues remain unsettled.

- **Methods**: The Italian Association of Clinical Endocrinologists appointed a panel of experts to provide an updated statement for the appropriate use of thyroid hormone formulations for hypothyroidism replacement therapy. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists' protocol for standardized production of clinical practice guidelines was followed.

- **Results**: LT4 is the first choice in replacement therapy. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) should be maintained between 1.0 and 3.0 mIU/L in young subjects and at the upper normal limit in elderly or fragile patients. Achievement of biochemical targets, patient well-being, and adherence to treatment should be addressed. In patients with unstable serum TSH, a search for interfering factors and patient compliance is warranted. Liquid or gel formulations may be considered in subjects with hampered LT4 absorption or who do not allow sufficient time before or after meals and LT4 replacement. Replacement therapy with LT4 and L-triiodothyronine (LT3) combination is generally not recommended. A trial may be considered in patients with normal values of serum TSH who continue to complain of symptoms of hypothyroidism only after co-existent nonthyroid problems have been excluded or optimally managed. LT3 should be administered in small (LT4:LT3 ratio, 10:1 to 20:1) divided daily doses.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, specifically concerning levothyroxine therapy, the ETA 2025 guidelines recommend administering levothyroxine in accordance with the patient's lifestyle. It is essential to maintain an interval of at least 30 minutes between the drug and food or drink intake. For optimal therapeutic efficacy, levothyroxine should be administered consistently either 60 minutes before breakfast or at bedtime, at least 3 hours after the evening meal.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^112GMb8Q]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The ideal normalization of TH levels in these patients relies on the elimination of or an improvement in comorbid diseases. In hypothyroid patients with parasitosis or H. pylori infection, TSH levels usually return to the target range with a normal dose after antiparasitic or antibiotic therapy. A lactose-free formulation or gluten-free diet can rid patients with lactose intolerance or celiac disease of impaired absorption, respectively. Additionally, a switch from LT4 tablets to liquid preparations can restore thyroid function in patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction.

Surprisingly, liquid solutions also alleviate the malabsorption induced by some nongastrointestinal disorders, such as nephrotic syndrome and pregnancy. Similarly, crushed tablet powder might resolve hypothyroidism due to bariatric surgery and lactose intolerance. Unusual administration routes, including intravenous (IV) injection and intramuscular (IM) injection, can also decrease unsuppressed TSH levels in patients with digestive tract disorders. Furthermore, clinicians should be aware that severe refractory hypothyroidism is not common in patients with concomitant diseases or conditions. Many patients with malabsorption can have a serum TSH level in the target range with an increased dose of LT4.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, specifically concerning levothyroxine therapy (maintenance dosing), the ETA 2025 guidelines recommend recognizing that an altered thyroid function test in previously well-controlled hypothyroid patients treated with levothyroxine may result from transient interference by specific foods or a change in dietary habits. It is advised to obtain a retest of thyroid function in non-pregnant patients before increasing the dose of levothyroxine.

### Treating hypothyroidism is not always easy: When to treat subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH goals in the elderly, and alternatives to levothyroxine monotherapy [^116E5fuv]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The majority of patients with hypothyroidism feel better when levothyroxine treatment restores thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations to normal. However, a significant minority of patients remain symptomatic and are dissatisfied with their treatment. Overzealous treatment of symptomatic patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may contribute to dissatisfaction among hypothyroidism patients, as potential hypothyroid symptoms in patients with minimal hypothyroidism rarely respond to treatment. Thyroid hormone prescriptions have increased by 30% in the United States in the last decade.

The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism should be confirmed by repeat thyroid function tests ideally obtained at least two months later, as 62% of elevated TSH levels may revert to normal spontaneously. Generally, treatment is not necessary unless the TSH exceeds 7.0–10 mIU/L. In double-blinded randomized controlled trials, treatment does not improve symptoms or cognitive function if the TSH is less than 10 mIU/L.

While cardiovascular events may be reduced in patients under age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism who are treated with levothyroxine, treatment may be harmful in elderly patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. TSH goals are age dependent, with a 97.5 percentile (upper limit of normal) of 3.6 mIU/L for patients under age 40, and 7.5 mIU/L for patients over age 80. In some hypothyroid patients who are dissatisfied with treatment, especially those with a polymorphism in type 2 deiodinase, combined treatment with levothyroxine and liothyronine may be preferred.

### Levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism based on thyroid function: a 10-year clinical retrospective study [^113dyyPY]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

To explore the appropriate dosage of levothyroxine treatment for patients with congenital hypothyroidism and varying thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: A total of 116 patients, regularly followed up in our endocrine clinic from January 2010 to December 2020, were divided into four groups based on thyroid function:
	- **Group A**: TSH ≥ 100 mIU/L,
	- **Group B**: TSH ≥ 20 mIU/L and < 100 mIU/L,
	- **Group C**: TSH ≥ 4.6 mIU/L and < 20 mIU/L,
	- **Group D**: TSH ≥ 0.1 mIU/L and < 4.6 mIU/L.

	- The initial dosage of levothyroxine was individualized for each patient based on their TSH level and adjusted according to thyroid function at every follow-up. The levothyroxine dosage at each time point was compared between the groups, and thyroid function, as well as physical and neurological development after treatment, were also compared.

- **Results**: After individualized dosage adjustment, all patients achieved normal thyroid function. Although statistical differences in neurological development were noted between the four groups (p < 0.05), the development was within the normal range for all groups.

- **Conclusion**: An individualized levothyroxine dosage can provide the same therapeutic effect as the recommended dosage and may reduce the risk of drug overdose.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: Screening and management [^114mHTpx]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of congenital hypothyroidism, particularly concerning levothyroxine dosing and administration, the AAP 2023 guidelines recommend maintaining the same levothyroxine formulation consistently until three years of age. This approach ensures consistent euthyroidism and minimizes the need for additional laboratory monitoring. It is advisable to use a brand name levothyroxine formulation, if feasible, to provide a consistent formulation in patients with severe congenital hypothyroidism. If generic levothyroxine is prescribed, use the same formulation from a consistent manufacturer.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: A clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomized controlled trials, which could alter practice.

- **Practice**: Guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

- **Recommendation**: The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4, or thyroxine, levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

- **How this guideline was created**: A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

- **The evidence**: The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid-related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high-quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low-quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: Cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^116fQeE3]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, specifically in relation to levothyroxine therapy (indications, normal TSH), the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend initiating L-thyroxine in female patients of childbearing age who are planning a pregnancy in the immediate future (including assisted reproduction) and in pregnant patients with serum TSH levels greater than 2.5 mIU/L in the presence of or past positive levels of serum anti-TPO antibodies.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^115a2k8B]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage, along with consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted, can be challenging and continually evolving.

Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life — such as coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, and psychosocial factors — should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine.

This approach is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary, and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has been explored, but further research is required to establish its efficacy and safety.

### Thyroid antibodies and levothyroxine effects in subclinical hypothyroidism: A pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials [^115APnNy]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

- **Randomization and blinding**: Randomization was conducted for each trial at an independent data center through a computer-based program. The treatment began with levothyroxine 50 μg daily (25 μg in participants < 50 kg body weight or with coronary heart disease) or a matching placebo. The levothyroxine dose was adjusted every 6–8 weeks to target TSH levels between ≥ 0.4 and < 4.6 mIU/L. In the placebo group, a mock titration was performed. During the trial, neither the participants, investigators, nor the treating physicians were aware of the treatment allocation or the results of TSH measurements.

- **Laboratory assays**: Nonfasting venous blood samples were collected from each participant at baseline and follow-up using the same analyzer method. Chemiluminescent immunoassays for TSH and fT4 were conducted in local labs. Antibody status was measured post-RCT in stored baseline serum samples, collected prior to randomization at the Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine laboratory of the Leiden University Medical Center, with an immunoassay from Roche (Cobas 8000 E602) using electrochemiluminescence and a competition principle. Anti-TPO was utilized in the analysis, as it is the most sensitive marker for thyroid autoimmunity. Repeated quality control testing was supervised by a European Specialist in Laboratory Medicine. The measuring range of anti-TPO is between 5 and 600 kU/L, defined by the lower detection limit and the maximum of the master curve. Measurements exceeding the range were set to the high or low limit, respectively.

### Targeted levothyroxine therapy for treatment of congenital hypothyroidism [^111oA3ZZ]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine if infants with congenital hypothyroidism (CH), whose initial dose of levothyroxine (LT4) is based on thyroid gland anatomy, require fewer dose adjustments in the first 6 months of life than those who were started empirically on LT4.

Newborns with CH who had a thyroid ultrasound performed at diagnosis were eligible for this prospective, historical case-controlled study. The daily LT4 dose prescribed was based on results from the thyroid ultrasound as follows: 15 mcg/kg for athyreosis, 12 mcg/kg for a dysgenetic thyroid, and 10 mcg/kg for an anatomically normal gland. Routine labs, according to standard guidelines, were obtained and the number of dose adjustments over the first 6 months of therapy was recorded. Each study participant was matched with two historical controls with CH based on sex and thyroid anatomy.

Twenty-two subjects (10 with athyreosis, 4 with dysgenetic glands, and 8 with anatomically normal glands) were matched to 44 controls. There was no significant difference in the overall number of adjustments in the study group compared to controls (P = 0.74). However, there were significantly fewer adjustments made for undertreatment (P = 0.03) and significantly more adjustments made for overtreatment (P = 0.006) in subjects with athyreosis compared to controls.

Targeted LT4 therapy does not appear to decrease the overall frequency of dose adjustments for infants with CH. However, 15 mcg/kg/day appears to exceed thyroid hormone requirements in infants with CH due to athyreosis.

### Postpartum levothyroxine adjustment and its impact factors in women with hypothyroidism in pregnancy [^112HdG4P]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Low credibility.

Women with hypothyroidism need to increase exogenous thyroid hormone levels during pregnancy to reduce adverse outcomes. Few studies have reported the effect of gestational levothyroxine (LT4) variations on postpartum LT4 treatment.

- **Methods**: Women were classified as having subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) (n = 101), overt hypothyroidism (OH) caused by autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT-OH), OH following thyroidectomy for benign thyroid disease (BA-OH) (n = 66), and OH after surgery for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC-OH) (n = 46). Thyroid function was monitored, and LT4 therapy was adjusted accordingly.

- **Results**: After delivery, all women with SCH stopped LT4 treatment, and 57.4% of them restarted LT4 treatment in the following year, independently of the gestational LT4 variations. Among patients with OH, after adjustment by gestational body weight, 49.1% had LT4 doses less than the prepregnancy dose (baseline) in late pregnancy, leading to a reduction in postpartum LT4. The LT4 dose was reduced to approximately 50% of baseline for women with AIT-OH and BA-OH, and reduced by 27% for women with PTC-OH. The reasons for this reduction in AIT-OH and BA-OH were thyroid-stimulating hormone levels of < 2.5 mU/L during pregnancy and the occurrence of postpartum thyrotoxicosis (39.4%). For PTC-OH, the reason was thyroid-stimulating hormone overinhibition (< 1.0 mU/L) before delivery.

- **Conclusion**: For patients with SCH, postpartum LT4 treatment could initially be suspended. For women with OH, if the LT4 dose in late pregnancy was less than baseline, the prepregnancy dose should be reduced by 50%.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling: A novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^113mrykC]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

In the thyrotoxicosis group, individual fT4 targets could not be reliably estimated due to frequent TSH suppression. A simplified dosing adjustment tool (DAT) version, utilizing a population-based fT4 target, was applied instead. The number of patients who reached their TSH target after 8 weeks showed no difference between the DAT and control groups (Chi-square 1.63, p = 0.20).

- **Application of DAT**:
	- A simplified DAT, which only used population-based fT4 targets, showed no effect on the number of patients achieving their TSH target after eight weeks (p = 0.20).
	- Regarding the distance to final LT4 dosage during the first 20 weeks of follow-up for patients with thyrotoxicosis, it was observed that the light colors indicate the confidence interval (CI). The distance to final dosage was not significantly reduced in the DAT group after 2 weeks [t = 0.99, p = 0.34].

- **Time to achieve TSH targets**:
	- Violin plots depict the time needed to reach TSH targets, with black dots representing individual patients. The median is marked in white lines, while quartiles are in black dotted lines.
	- It was found that achieving TSH targets took longer when the simplified DAT was applied compared to controls [t (42) = −2.96, p = 0.005].

### The ages and TSH values of patients being prescribed levothyroxine [^113YxiQr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020).

Levothyroxine is a commonly prescribed medication. Some data suggest that levothyroxine may be initiated for mild degrees of hypothyroidism without considering age-specific reference ranges or individual patient factors.

- **Methods**: The electronic medical record of a healthcare system operating in the Washington, DC, and Maryland area was examined to determine the number of patients prescribed levothyroxine during 2008–2016. The study assessed the number of prescriptions supplied, associated diagnoses of hypothyroidism, and whether the prescriptions were new or existing. Information was extracted about the age of patients receiving prescriptions and the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels documented prior to levothyroxine initiation.

- **Results**: The number of levothyroxine prescriptions provided annually increased over this time period; however, when corrected for the number of patients in the database, the percentage of patients receiving levothyroxine prescriptions showed a slight downward trend. Levothyroxine was both most frequently prescribed and initiated in individuals aged 50–59 years and 60–69 years. The doses most commonly prescribed were 50 µg and 100 µg. The pattern of doses used was unaffected by whether a diagnosis of hypothyroidism was documented. Levothyroxine prescription initiation was associated with mean TSH values that were modestly elevated, in the range of 7.5–13.8 mIU/L.

Regarding medical management for congenital hypothyroidism, specifically concerning levothyroxine dosing and administration, the ETA 2018 guidelines recommend initiating levothyroxine therapy in patients with congenital central hypothyroidism (e.g. TSHβ mutations) as soon as possible. The optimal initiation should occur within two weeks after birth at doses used for primary congenital hypothyroidism. This approach aims to rapidly restore serum fT4 levels to the normal range and secure optimal treatment as quickly as possible.

### Levothyroxine dosage is associated with stability of thyroid-stimulating hormone values [^114VwJPF]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In patients treated for hypothyroidism, the usual practice is to monitor thyroid-stimulating hormone values yearly once a therapeutic dosage of levothyroxine is determined. This study investigates whether there are any clinical predictors that could identify a subset of patients who might be monitored safely on a less frequent basis.

- **Methods**: Using a retrospective study design, 715 patients treated for hypothyroidism who had a normal (i.e. therapeutic) thyroid-stimulating hormone value in 2006 while taking levothyroxine were identified. All thyroid-stimulating hormone values were then obtained through December 31, 2012. Gender, age, body mass index, history of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, initial thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and levothyroxine dose were analyzed for time to first abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone value using a Cox proportional hazard model.

- **Results**: Age, gender, history of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, and body mass index at the time of initial normal thyroid-stimulating hormone were not significantly associated with time to abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone value. A levothyroxine dose greater than 125 μg/day had an increased hazard ratio of 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.7–3.4; P < .05), suggesting higher doses are linked to instability in thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.

### Biochemical assessment of adequate levothyroxine replacement in primary hypothyroidism differs with different TSH assays: potential clinical implications [^1127zjRW]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Aim**: Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) assays provided by Abbott Laboratories and Roche Diagnostics are used by approximately 75% of laboratories in the UK. We assessed the potential impact of Abbott and Roche TSH assay differences on the biochemical assessment of levothyroxine replacement in primary hypothyroidism.

- **Method**: Samples from 100 consecutive primary care patients (83 women, median age 64 years, interquartile range (IQR) 51–73 years) with primary hypothyroidism on adequate levothyroxine based on an Abbott Architect TSH in the reference range were analysed for TSH on Roche cobas within 24 hours. The Abbott and Roche TSH results were compared. Over 1 year, TSH results from patients in primary care from the laboratories with Abbott and Roche methods were compared.

- **Results**: The median (IQR) Roche TSH (2.5 (1.3–3.6) mIU/L) was 30% ± 10% higher (p < 0.001) than Abbott TSH (1.9 (1.1–2.6) mIU/L). Although all Abbott TSH results were in the Abbott specific reference range, 14 patients (14%) had Roche TSH results above the Roche specific reference range. In the 1-year data collection, Roche TSH (1.9 (1.3–2.9) mIU/L, n = 103932) results were higher (p < 0.001) than Abbott TSH (1.5 (1.0–2.2) mIU/L, n = 110544) results. The TSH results were above their assay-specific upper reference limit in 10.7% of Roche results and 4.2% of Abbott results.

- **Conclusion**: Biochemical assessment of levothyroxine replacement may be dependent on the type of TSH assay. Laboratorians and clinicians should be aware that the lack of harmonization between TSH methods and their assay-specific reference ranges may potentially lead to different outcomes.

### Synthroid [^117QfEeg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important considerations for dosing**: The dosage of Synthroid for hypothyroidism or pituitary TSH suppression depends on a variety of factors, including the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (such as pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food, and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions (7)]. Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors, and dosage adjustments should be made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

	- For adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, titrate until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

	- For secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, serum TSH is not a reliable measure of Synthroid dosage adequacy and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to titrate Synthroid dosing until the patient is clinically euthyroid, and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

	- Inquire whether patients are taking biotin or biotin-containing supplements. If so, advise them to stop biotin supplementation at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.10)].

	- The peak therapeutic effect of a given dose of Synthroid may not be attained for 4 to 6 weeks.

Regarding medical management for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to thyroid replacement therapy, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend adjusting levothyroxine doses to avoid low or elevated free T4 levels to prevent possible long-term cardiovascular risks associated with insufficient or excessive thyroid hormone treatment. Do not use serum TSH levels to adjust thyroid replacement dosing in patients with central hypothyroidism.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: Prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^113yC48n]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

A number of recent advances in our understanding of thyroid physiology may shed light on why some patients feel unwell while taking levothyroxine monotherapy. The purpose of this task force was to review the goals of levothyroxine therapy, the optimal prescription of conventional levothyroxine therapy, the sources of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine therapy, the evidence on treatment alternatives, and the relevant knowledge gaps. We wished to determine whether there are sufficient new data generated by well-designed studies to provide reason to pursue such therapies and change the standard of care. This document is intended to inform clinical decision-making on thyroid hormone replacement therapy; it is not a replacement for individualized clinical judgment.

- **Methods**: Task force members identified 24 questions relevant to the treatment of hypothyroidism. The clinical literature relating to each question was then reviewed. Clinical reviews were supplemented, when relevant, with related mechanistic and bench research literature reviews, performed by our team of translational scientists. Ethics reviews were provided, when relevant, by a bioethicist. The responses to questions were formatted, when possible, in the form of a formal clinical recommendation statement. When responses were not suitable for a formal clinical recommendation, a summary response statement without a formal clinical recommendation was developed. For clinical recommendations, the supporting evidence was appraised, and the strength of each clinical recommendation was assessed.

### Levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism based on thyroid function: a 10-year clinical retrospective study [^1122y35z]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

In our retrospective observation of patients administered individualized dosages of levothyroxine according to their initial TSH level at diagnosis, after 1 month, there were four patients (10.8%) in group A, one patient (3.8%) in group B, four patients (23.5%) in group C, and three patients (8.3%) in group D who did not reach the normal TSH level. Furthermore, eight patients (21.6%) in group A, one patient (3.8%) in group B, and one patient (2.7%) in group D had an FT4 level beyond the upper limit of normal values at 1 month following treatment.

At the follow-up time, the dosage of levothyroxine for each patient was adjusted according to thyroid function, and their thyroid function eventually returned to a normal range. Our study suggests that to reduce the risk of levothyroxine overdose, individualized levothyroxine dosage should be adjusted. Currently, there is no exact dosage for patients with different TSH levels; however, for most patients with mildly elevated TSH, low-dose thyroxine could restore their TSH level to normal 1 month after treatment. It is critical to follow up regularly during treatment to monitor thyroid function and adjust the thyroxine dosage to maintain thyroid function within the normal range.

Research performed by Soliman et al. (2012) revealed that 25% of the patients (n = 45) treated with a high dose of levothyroxine (10–15 μg/kg·d) developed hyperthyroidism. Craven and Frank (2018) reported that a high initial levothyroxine dosage (> 12.5 μg/kg·d) may have caused hyperthyroidism.

### Randomized trial comparing two algorithms for levothyroxine dose adjustment in pregnant women with primary hypothyroidism [^1172Xfai]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Regulation of maternal thyroid hormones during pregnancy is crucial for optimal maternal and fetal outcomes. However, there are no specific guidelines addressing maternal levothyroxine (LT4) dose adjustments throughout pregnancy.

- **Objective**: To compare two LT4 dose-adjustment algorithms in hypothyroid pregnant women.

- **Design**: Thirty-three women on stable LT4 doses were recruited at less than 10 weeks gestation during 38 pregnancies. They were randomized into two dose-adjustment groups. Group 1 (G1) employed an empirical two-pill/week dose increase followed by subsequent pill-per-week dose adjustments. Group 2 (G2) adjusted the LT4 dose ongoingly in micrograms per day based on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and LT4 dose. TSH was monitored every two weeks in the first and second trimesters and every four weeks in the third trimester.

- **Setting**: Academic endocrinology clinics in Washington, DC.

- **Main Outcome Measure**: The proportion of TSH values within trimester-specific goal ranges.

- **Results**: The mean gestational age at study entry was 6.4 ± 2.1 weeks. Seventy-five percent of TSH values were within trimester-specific goal ranges in G1 compared with 81% in G2 (P = 0.09). Similar numbers of LT4 dose adjustments per pregnancy were required in both groups (G1, 3.1 ± 2.0 vs. G2, 4.1 ± 3.2; P = 0.27). Women in G1 were more likely to have suppressed TSH < 0.1 mIU/L in the first trimester (P = 0.01). The etiology of hypothyroidism, but not thyroid antibody status, was associated with the proportion of goal TSH values.

- **Conclusions**: We compared two options for LT4 dose adjustment and showed that an ongoing adjustment approach may lead to a higher proportion of TSH values within the desired range compared to an empirical increase strategy.

### Management of primary hypothyroidism: Statement by the British Thyroid Association Executive Committee [^111sUrae]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

The management of primary hypothyroidism with levothyroxine (L-T4) is simple, effective, and safe, and most patients report improved well-being upon initiation of treatment. However, a proportion of individuals continue to suffer from symptoms despite achieving adequate biochemical correction. The management of such individuals has been the subject of controversy and considerable public interest. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the European Thyroid Association (ETA) have recently published guidelines on the diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism. These guidelines are based on extensive reviews of the medical literature, including sections on the role of combination therapy with L-T4 and liothyronine (L-T3) for individuals persistently dissatisfied with L-T4 therapy. This position statement by the British Thyroid Association (BTA) summarizes the key points in these guidelines and makes recommendations on the management of primary hypothyroidism. It is based on literature reviews, the published positions of the ETA and ATA, and aligns with best practices in good medical practice. The statement is endorsed by the Association of Clinical Biochemistry (ACB), British Thyroid Foundation (BTF), Royal College of Physicians (RCP), and Society for Endocrinology (SFE).

### Study protocol: A randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over [^111gP4aT]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). High credibility.

Participants are blinded to treatment allocation by using matching tablets and packaging for levothyroxine and placebo. All study personnel remain blinded for the duration of the trial through remote analysis of laboratory results of TSH in the data centre, ensuring the trial stays double-blinded. GPs will remain blinded to treatment allocation and TSH tests unless required in an emergency medical situation. An Interactive Voice Response System at the data centre allows for individual emergency allocation information to be released to an unblinded study physician through 24-hour telephone access. All participants will learn the treatment allocation within 15 working days of receiving the final visit and completing all the data to aid in any further treatment decisions with the GP.

All laboratory tests for TSH and fT4 are performed at the local GP and clinical laboratories. The results in the treatment phase are uploaded to the independent data centre, which, in turn, advises the study site on dose titration through the dedicated trial web portal. The study team remains unaware of the results of the thyroid function testing. Additionally, all cooperating GPs were asked to refrain from additional thyroid function measurements to ensure adequate blinding.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: Screening and management [^116WNecU]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of congenital hypothyroidism, the 2023 AAP guidelines specifically address the use of levothyroxine in terms of dosing and administration. The guidelines recommend against the general use of liothyronine. It should only be considered in consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist for patients with persistent severe resistance to thyroid hormone (evidenced by elevated TSH despite elevated fT4) when adequate control cannot be achieved with levothyroxine alone.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling: A novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^113NVeoS]. Thyroid (2021). High credibility.

This is the first study to suggest LT4 dosage adjustment based on repeated fT4 and TSH measurements during the first two weeks after thyroidectomy. Application of the DAT enabled the clinician to make appropriate dosage adjustments after only two weeks. It is challenging to compare the performance of our model directly against other published dosage schemes because they all use the entire TSH reference range as goal achievement, while we used a narrower TSH target for replacement therapy.

The reason we did not include TSH range > 2.0 mIU/L in our targets was that high normal TSH values are associated with comorbidity. This was done to make our TSH targets more applicable to all diagnoses in the study, including cancer. The study was thus not designed to evaluate our model against other published dosage schemes but to assess whether computerized modeling would allow meaningful early LT4 dose adjustments, before a steady state is reached. When recalculating our eight-week data for patients with goiter using the entire TSH reference range as goal achievement, we found, however, that our model outperforms other dosage schemes.

Care must be taken when interpreting these data, as the number of patients is low both in our study groups and in comparable studies.

### Thyroid antibodies and levothyroxine effects in subclinical hypothyroidism: A pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials [^113WyXiu]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo), defined as an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level with free thyroxine (fT4) in the reference range, affects up to 6%–18% of older adults. Although clinical guidelines differ on which patients should be treated, SHypo is frequently treated with levothyroxine (LT4). This contributes to levothyroxine being one of the most prescribed medications in the United States and Europe. In older adults, two recent international, double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) — The Thyroid Hormone Replacement for Untreated Older Adults with Subclinical Hypothyroidism (TRUST) and the IEMO80+ Thyroid Trial — and a meta-analysis found no benefit of levothyroxine on hypothyroid symptoms, tiredness, or quality of life, even among those with high symptom burden. However, specific subgroups might still benefit, such as patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.

### Does initial dosing of levothyroxine in infants with congenital hypothyroidism lead to frequent dose adjustments secondary to iatrogenic hyperthyroidism on follow-up [^115KeymG]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is the most common preventable cause of intellectual disability. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine (LT4) is between 10 and 15 μg/kg, an extremely wide range. We hypothesized that a sizable proportion of newborns treated for CH at the higher end of the dosage range become biochemically hyperthyroid at a follow-up visit.

- **Methods**: This study is a retrospective chart review of infants with CH between 2002 and 2012.

- **Results**: Of the 104 patients included in this analysis, the average age at diagnosis was 11 days and the average starting dose of LT4 was 12 ± 2.5 μg/kg. At follow-up, 36.5% required a dose reduction because of iatrogenic hyperthyroxinemia, 51% required no dose adjustment, and 12.5% required a dose increase due to an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The starting doses of LT4 for those requiring a dose reduction, those not requiring an adjustment, and those requiring an increase in the dose were 13.2 ± 2.4, 11.5 ± 2.1, and 10.3 ± 2.6 μg/kg/day, respectively (p ≤ 0.0001). Of the 34% of infants treated with an initial dose of > 12.5 μg/day, 57.1% required a dose reduction at follow-up, compared to 26.1% of those whose initial starting dose was ≤ 12.5 μg/kg/day (p = 0.007).

- **Conclusions**: Following the guidelines for initiating therapy for CH, 36.5% of the infants required a dose reduction for iatrogenic hyperthyroxinemia. These infants received a higher dose of LT4 than the infants who either required no adjustment or required an increase in the dose. A narrower range for initial dosing in CH may be appropriate.

### ETA guidelines for the use of levothyroxine sodium preparations in monotherapy to optimize the treatment of hypothyroidism [^114Nf3H5]. European Thyroid Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hypothyroidism, particularly with levothyroxine therapy, the ETA 2025 guidelines recommend determining the starting dose of levothyroxine by evaluating factors such as the patient's weight, lean body mass, pregnancy status, etiology of hypothyroidism, age, and overall clinical context. Calculating the daily requirement should also take these factors into account.

### Lack of an association between BMI and TSH in treated hypothyroid patients and euthyroid controls [^116XXhoa]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

The standard treatment for primary hypothyroidism is replacement with levothyroxine to achieve a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level within the normal range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L), which is known to prevent complications including weight gain. While the normal TSH range includes the 95% confidence intervals, it is not known if there is an association between weight and TSH within this interval in treated hypothyroid patients.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients treated within the Cooper Health System from January 1 to August 31, 2014. A sample of 245 treated hypothyroid patients and 162 euthyroid controls were studied. Data collected included age, sex, race/ethnicity, height, weight, levothyroxine dose, and diabetes and smoking history.

- **Results**: Hypothyroid and control groups were similar in height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and the number of patients with diabetes. There were more females, Caucasians, and nonsmokers in the hypothyroid group. The average TSH was slightly higher in the treated hypothyroid patients versus nonhypothyroid controls (median 1.87 vs. 1.55, p < 0.01). There was no significant relationship between TSH and BMI in the treated hypothyroid patients or the euthyroid controls.

- **Conclusion**: Since no significant relationship was found between BMI and TSH in treated hypothyroidism, there may be no weight reduction benefit gained by adjusting TSH to the lower end of the normal range. Patients should be counseled that properly treated hypothyroidism is unlikely to contribute to weight gain.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling: A novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^112Hggkk]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

The development and validation of the dosage adjustment tool (DAT) followed a specific study design. The DAT was initially developed using pilot data as described in the supplemental data. The model parameters were derived from four blood samples analyzed for TSH and fT4, obtained during the first two weeks of levothyroxine (LT4) therapy. We assumed a log-linear relationship between TSH and fT4. Individual TSH-fT4 responses and fT4 pharmacokinetics were modeled, informed by population data, as illustrated in Figure 1.

We tested the DAT in a prospective multicenter trial where participants were randomized to either the application of the DAT or not, serving as controls. An automated stratified randomization based on diagnosis and the participating hospital was used. After surgery and before randomization, all participants were prescribed an LT4 starting dosage, typically between 100 and 150 μg/day, depending on diagnosis, body weight, age, and comorbidity. Participants provided pre-LT4 ingestion blood samples twice per week for two weeks postoperatively (see Figure 2). To reduce variation in measurements and modeling, patients were instructed to take their medication and provide all blood samples in the morning. On blood sampling days, patients delayed LT4 intake until after blood was drawn.

Two to three weeks after surgery, participants received a follow-up call advising them to either maintain or adjust their dosage. In the DAT group, the responsible surgeon was assisted by the DAT with a graphical plot of the predicted fT4 and TSH, given a suggested dosage change (refer to Figure 3). The DAT was disabled in the control group.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^113KWfGB]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for subclinical hypothyroidism, specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy, AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering a daily dose of levothyroxine ranging from 25 to 75 mcg, depending on the degree of thyroid-stimulating hormone elevation. Further adjustments should be guided by clinical response and follow-up laboratory determinations, including thyroid-stimulating hormone values.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling: A novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^117MxN5T]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

The consequences of efficient dosage adjustments after thyroidectomy in terms of work capacity, sick leave, quality of life, or other patient-reported outcomes have to be determined before we know whether a minimum of five postoperative blood draws is acceptable. This number is comparable with routine follow-up in the first author's clinic before development of the DAT (Supplemental Data). However, there is large variation in the reported number of necessary dosage adjustments after thyroidectomy, probably reflecting that optimal care is yet to be established. We believe that the advantages of the DAT outweigh the extra cost of early blood samples by reducing the number of follow-up visits and shortening the dosage adjustment period. Additionally, further refinement of our model could lower the number of needed samples.

The failure of the simplified DAT to improve dosage for thyrotoxic patients suggests that individual fT4-TSH estimations are necessary to achieve successful dosage with our model. The majority of the patients in the thyrotoxicosis group had a totally suppressed TSH before surgery and were still on anti-thyroid hormone drugs. Slow recovery of normal TSH dynamics after prolonged suppression made our model vulnerable to mistakes, as it relied heavily on initial blood samples. In addition, our assumption that a log-linear relationship exists between TSH and fT4 may not be valid for this group. The overall altered metabolism in patients with Graves' disease could also be changing during the course of follow-up, making initial estimations invalid later.

### European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of congenital hypothyroidism [^114PQuog]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

- **Monitoring of dose and follow-up**: Serum or plasma FT4 (or TT4) and TSH concentrations should be determined at least 4 hours after the last L-T4 administration. TSH concentration should be maintained in the age-specific reference range; TT4 or FT4 concentration should be maintained in the upper half of the age-specific reference range. Any reduction of L-T4 dose should not be based on a single increase in FT4 concentration during treatment.

	- The first follow-up examination should take place 1–2 weeks after the start of L-T4 treatment. Subsequent evaluation should take place every 2 weeks until a complete normalization of TSH concentration is reached; then every 1 to 3 months thereafter until the age of 12 months. Between the ages of one and three years, children should undergo frequent clinical and laboratory evaluations (every 2 to 4 months). Thereafter, evaluations should be carried out every 3 to 12 months until growth is completed. More frequent evaluations should be carried out if compliance is questioned or abnormal values are obtained. Additional evaluations should be carried out 4–6 weeks after any change in L-T4 dose or formulation.

	- Adequate treatment throughout childhood is essential and overtreatment should be avoided.

Levothyroxine is a commonly prescribed medication. Some data suggest that levothyroxine may be initiated for mild degrees of hypothyroidism and used without considering age-specific reference ranges or individual patient factors when prescribing.

- **Methods**: The electronic medical record of a healthcare system operating in the Washington, DC, and Maryland area was interrogated to determine the number of patients who were being prescribed levothyroxine during the time period 2008–2016. The number of prescriptions supplied to these individuals, an associated diagnosis of hypothyroidism, and whether the prescriptions were new or existing prescriptions were also determined. Information was also extracted about the age of patients receiving prescriptions and the thyroid-stimulating hormone level documented prior to levothyroxine initiation.

- **Results**: Although the number of levothyroxine prescriptions provided annually increased over this time period, when corrected for the number of patients in the database, the percentage of patients receiving levothyroxine prescriptions showed a slight downward trend. Levothyroxine was both most frequently prescribed and frequently initiated in those of ages 50–59 years and 60–69 years. The doses of levothyroxine most commonly prescribed were 50 µg and 100 µg. The pattern of levothyroxine doses being used was unaffected by whether a diagnosis of hypothyroidism was documented or not. Levothyroxine prescription initiation was associated with mean thyroid-stimulating hormone values that were modestly elevated and in the range of 7.5–13.8 mIU/L.

- **Conclusion**:

(Note: The conclusion section appears to be incomplete.)

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: Cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^111CspHm]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, particularly with respect to levothyroxine therapy (indications, abnormal TSH), the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of levothyroxine in patients with serum TSH levels greater than 10 mIU/L, as these patients have an increased risk for heart failure and cardiovascular mortality.

### 2018 European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of central hypothyroidism [^114pwFCV]. European Thyroid Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for central hypothyroidism, specifically with respect to the assessment of treatment response, the ETA 2018 guidelines recommend up-titrating the levothyroxine dose in the following conditions:

- **Pregnancy**: Adjustments may be necessary to meet increased thyroid hormone requirements.
- **Controlled ovarian stimulation**: Dose adjustments should be considered during this process.
- **Pubertal development**: Monitoring and dose modification are advised to support development.
- **Weight gain**: Increased body weight may necessitate an altered dose.
- **Retarded psychomotor and cognitive development in infants and children**: Modifications to ensure adequate thyroid hormone levels are important.
- **Introduction of GH replacement therapy**: Requires monitoring and possible dose changes.
- **Introduction of estrogen replacement therapy or oral contraceptives**: These can impact thyroid hormone metabolism.
- **Introduction of treatments impacting levothyroxine absorption or thyroid hormone metabolism**: Adjustments may be necessary to maintain therapeutic efficacy.

### Levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism based on thyroid function: A 10-year clinical retrospective study [^115Wxkf1]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to explore the appropriate dosage of levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism patients with different thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.

- **Methods**: A total of 116 patients, who were regularly followed up in our endocrine clinic from January 2010 to December 2020, were divided into four groups based on their thyroid function: group A (TSH ≥ 100 mIU/L), group B (TSH ≥ 20 mIU/L and < 100 mIU/L), group C (TSH ≥ 4.6 mIU/L and < 20 mIU/L), and group D (TSH < 4.6 mIU/L and free thyroxine < 6.6 pmol/L). The initial dosage of levothyroxine was individualized for each patient based on their TSH level and then adjusted according to their thyroid function at every follow-up time point. The levothyroxine dosage at each time point was compared between the groups, and thyroid function, as well as physical and neurological development after treatment, were also compared.

- **Results**: After individualized dosage adjustment, all patients achieved normal thyroid function. Although there were statistical differences in neurological development between the four groups (p < 0.05), development was within the normal range for all groups.

- **Conclusion**: An individualized levothyroxine dosage can provide the same therapeutic effect compared to the recommended dosage. This strategy may also reduce the risk of a drug overdose.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling: A novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^11277w1c]. Thyroid (2021). High credibility.

Measurements of TSH and fT4 from a subset of the RCT population and two example patients during the first two weeks after thyroidectomy were analyzed. Hyperparameters of the Bayesian regression lines estimated from the pilot population were used to develop our model. For the estimation of individual TSH/fT4 relationships, a Bayesian regression model was employed instead of ordinary least squares (OLS) to compensate for the low number of samples and for censoring. In one case, a patient without detectable TSH would yield a flat/no response with naive OLS. The Bayesian model provides a more plausible estimate, with response extending below the censoring limit, as informed by population data. Another case showed a Bayesian slope that was less steep than the naive patient-specific OLS, also informed by population data.

- **Study design**: The randomized controlled validation trial involved patients post-total thyroidectomy. The surgeon chose an LT4 starting dosage based on diagnosis and clinical routine. TSH and fT4 were measured four times over the next two weeks to allow early dosage adjustment. Patients were randomized to the application of a decision aid tool (DAT) or served as controls for dosage adjustments, which were supervised by an experienced endocrine surgeon in either case. Eight weeks after surgery, successful dosage adjustment was evaluated based on TSH measurements. If the TSH target was not achieved, the patient continued with six-week dosage adjustment cycles.

Free thyroxine (fT4), thyrotropin (TSH), ordinary least squares (OLS), randomized controlled trial (RCT), and decision aid tool (DAT) are the abbreviations used in this study.

### Small changes in thyroxine dosage do not produce measurable changes in hypothyroid symptoms, well-being, or quality of life: Results of a double-blind, randomized clinical trial [^115a5BfG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

In patients with primary hypothyroidism, anecdotal evidence suggests that well-being is optimized by fine adjustment of T(4) dosage, aiming for a serum TSH concentration in the lower reference range. This has not been tested in a clinical trial.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to test whether adjustment of T(4) dosage aiming for a serum TSH concentration less than 2 mU/liter improves well-being compared with a serum TSH concentration in the upper reference range.

- **Design**: We conducted a double-blind, randomized clinical trial with a crossover design.

- **Participants**: Fifty-six subjects (52 females) with primary hypothyroidism taking T(4) (≥ 100 microg/d) with baseline serum TSH 0.1–4.8 mU/liter participated.

- **Interventions**: Each subject received three T(4) doses (low, middle, and high in 25-microg increments) in random order.

- **Outcome measures**: Outcome measures included visual analog scales assessing well-being (the primary endpoint) and hypothyroid symptoms, quality of life instruments (General Health Questionnaire 28, Short Form 36, and Thyroid Symptom Questionnaire), cognitive function tests, and treatment preference.

- **Results**: Mean (± sem) serum TSH concentrations were 2.8 ± 0.4, 1.0 ± 0.2, and 0.3 ± 0.1 mU/liter for the three treatments. There were no significant treatment effects on any of the instruments assessing well-being, symptoms, quality of life, or cognitive function, and no significant treatment preference.

- **Conclusions**: Small changes in T(4) dosage do not produce measurable changes in hypothyroid symptoms, well-being, or quality of life.

### Thyroid antibodies and levothyroxine effects in subclinical hypothyroidism: A pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials [^116ss6pH]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Baseline data are expressed as the number of participants (percentage) for categorical characteristics or as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (interquartile range [IQR]) for continuous characteristics.

In line with the protocol and first reports, the primary analysis considered all participants in the intention-to-treat population who had the 1-year follow-up visit within the protocol-specified window. Only participants with an anti-TPO status at baseline were included in this study. Between-group comparisons on the difference between 1-year follow-up and baseline values were performed using linear mixed-effects regression models. These models included an interaction term between the treatment group and baseline anti-TPO status, and adjustments were made for stratification variables (sex, country, and randomization dose) and the respective baseline values. This was necessary because randomization was not stratified by baseline antibody status, as measured after the trial end, and study was used as a random effect.

Basing the effect size for the interaction (i.e. the difference between the differences between the treatment groups) on the SD of the difference between the treatment groups in both anti-TPO groups, and averaging the patient numbers within both groups, a difference in the difference of 6.9 points on the scale could be detected significantly with 80% power at a two-sided alpha of 0.05. The analysis was repeated for the per-protocol population, including all participants who pursued the trial regimen (i.e. on treatment at the time of the analysis being conducted and who had their 12-month follow-up visit).

### Adequate levothyroxine doses for the treatment of hypothyroidism newly discovered during pregnancy [^117MPwAW]. Thyroid (2013). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines recommend thyrotropin (TSH) target levels of ≤ 2.5 mIU/L for the first trimester and ≤ 3 mIU/L for the subsequent trimesters. Euthyroidism should be attained as soon as possible, but there are no precise indications about the initial levothyroxine (LT4) dose. The aim of our study was to determine the appropriate LT4 doses to normalize TSH levels in patients with newly discovered subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) during pregnancy and to correlate them with basal TSH levels. The adequate LT4 doses for women with SCH were also compared to those required in pregnant women with overt hypothyroidism (OH).

- **Methods**: Seventy-seven patients with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism during pregnancy were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were assigned to group 1 (n = 64) with SCH or group 2 (n = 13) with OH. SCH patients were subdivided into two groups: group 1a with serum TSH > 2.5 (1st trimester) or > 3 (2nd or 3rd trimester) to 4.2 mIU/L; and group 1b with TSH levels > 4.21–10 mIU/L. All patients were treated with LT4 as soon as hypothyroidism was diagnosed. The dose that allowed a TSH of ≤ 2.5 mIU/L to be reached in the first trimester or a TSH of ≤ 3 mIU/L to be reached during the second and third trimesters was considered the appropriate one.

- **Results**: A significant difference (p < 0.0001) in the appropriate LT4 dose (mean ± SD, μg/kg/day) was observed between group 1 and group 2: 1.31 ± 0.36 versus 2.33 ± 0.59. Patients in group 1a required a significantly lower LT4 dose (p < 0.014) than group 1b: 1.20 ± 0.39 versus 1.42 ± 0.31 μg/kg/day. In 57 of the patients, the final data is truncated.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115iuzjg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

In the management of central hypothyroidism, particularly concerning thyroid replacement therapy, the Endocrine Society 2016 guidelines recommend initiating levothyroxine therapy at doses of approximately 1.6 mcg/kg/day. Dose adjustments should be made based on clinical context, age, and free T4 levels. The goal is to achieve serum free T4 levels within the mid-to-upper half of the reference range.

### Levothyroxine replacement doses are affected by gender and weight, but not age [^116MHcEx]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Body weight (BW) and age have been shown to affect the dose of levothyroxine (LT(4)) that normalizes serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in hypothyroid patients. Our objective was to determine whether gender, menstrual status, and ideal body weight (IBW) also affect the LT(4) dose required to achieve a serum TSH within the normal range.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients being treated for primary hypothyroidism who had TSH values within a normal range. We selected patients aged 18–85 years who were taking LT(4) without any confounding medications and who had no serious chronic conditions. Their LT(4) doses, referred to here as LT(4) dose requirements, based on both BW and IBW, were documented. The relationship between gender, menstrual status, age, serum TSH concentrations, and the degree of overweight on LT(4) dose requirements was determined using multivariate analyses.

- **Results**: Women were significantly more overweight than men (ratio of BW/IBW was 1.35 for women vs. 1.17 for men, p < 0.0001). LT(4) requirements based on BW did not differ by gender when age was included in the model. However, when the degree of overweight was also included, men required lower LT(4) doses than both premenopausal women (1.34 μg/kg vs. 1.51 μg/kg, p = 0.038) and menopausal women (1.34 μg/kg vs. 1.49 μg/kg, p = 0.023). When examining IBW using a model incorporating age, men also required lower LT(4) doses than both premenopausal women (1.64 μg/kg vs. 1.92 μg/kg, p = 0.0033) and menopausal women (1.64 μg/kg vs. 1.90 μg/kg, p = 0.0024).

### Diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism in TSH deficiency compared to primary thyroid disease: Pituitary patients are at risk of under-replacement with levothyroxine [^113k1s5S]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Achieving optimal thyroid hormone replacement is more difficult in TSH deficiency compared to primary hypothyroidism because of the inability to be guided by serum TSH levels. A combination of clinical symptoms and free thyroxine levels (fT4) is typically used to make a diagnosis and monitor replacement. We investigated the diagnosis of TSH deficiency in patients with pituitary disease and the adequacy of levothyroxine replacement compared with primary thyroid disease.

- **Design**: Using our department's clinical information system, we identified all patients with a diagnosis of any type of pituitary tumor who had been seen in clinics over a 2-year period. We divided the patients into those at high risk and low risk of TSH deficiency based on the presence of macroadenoma and/or intervention by surgery or radiotherapy. We compared fT4 values in these patients with values in patients with primary thyroid disease in our thyrotoxicosis shared-care scheme (TSC) and hypothyroid register within the same timescale, assessing only those samples considered euthyroid in which TSH was in the normal range.

- **Results**: A database query identified 525 patients with a pituitary tumor, of whom 344 were considered at high risk of TSH deficiency. A free T4 (fT4) value was found for 514 patients (97.9%). TSC and thyroid register databases revealed fT4 values for comparison with simultaneous normal TSH in patients on no treatment (n = 3,777 samples) or on levothyroxine alone (n = 11,805). fT4 levels overall were lower in pituitary patients than in equivalent controls.

### The magnitude of increased levothyroxine requirements in hypothyroid pregnant women depends upon the etiology of the hypothyroidism [^116mfndN]. Thyroid (2009). Low credibility.

In the United States, many women with hypothyroidism are on thyroid hormone replacement during pregnancy. The optimal management strategy for thyroid hormone dosing in hypothyroid women during pregnancy is controversial. We hypothesized that dosage requirements during pregnancy might differ depending upon the nature of the underlying hypothyroidism.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of 45 pregnancies from 38 women whose hypothyroidism was managed during pregnancy. Thyroid function tests were obtained when pregnancy was confirmed, then every 4–8 weeks. The thyrotropin (TSH) goal was 0.4–4.1 microU/mL (SI unit conversion: multiply TSH by 1.0 for mIU/L).

- **Results**: On average, the entire group required a cumulative increase from baseline in levothyroxine (LT(4)) dosage of 13% in the first trimester, 26% in the second trimester, and 26% in the third trimester (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). The average baseline LT(4) dose for patients with primary hypothyroidism was 92.5 ± 32.0 microg daily. These patients required small cumulative dose increases of 11%, 16%, and 16% from baseline in each trimester, respectively (p values = 0.125, 0.016, 0.016). The average baseline LT(4) dose for patients with hypothyroidism resulting from treated Graves' disease or goiter was 140.4 ± 62.4 microg daily. These patients required the largest cumulative increases in LT(4) dosage (first trimester, 27%; second trimester, 51%; third trimester, 45%; p = 0.063, 0.063, 0.063, respectively). The average baseline LT(4) dose for patients with thyroid cancer was 153.2 ± 30.

### Low-normal or high-normal thyrotropin target levels during treatment of hypothyroidism: a prospective, comparative study [^116qtkcg]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Recent literature advocates for the decrease of the upper limit of the normal thyrotropin (TSH) reference range. The objective of this study was to determine whether treated hypothyroid patients maintained within a low-normal TSH range (0.4–2.0 mIU/L) have better clinical outcomes than those maintained within a high-normal TSH range (2.0–4.0 mIU/L).

- **Methods**: The study was performed in a thyroid outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital as a prospective, interventional study. Forty-two participants with newly diagnosed overt primary hypothyroidism were paired into two groups: group 1 (n = 20), low-normal target TSH; group 2 (n = 22), high-normal target TSH. Levothyroxine was initiated, and the dose was adjusted to achieve and sustain the target TSH value during the study period. After the target TSH was reached, participants were evaluated every 3 months for thyroid function, serum lipid profile, resting energy expenditure (REE), body composition, and bone mineral density, for 12 months.

- **Results**: Nineteen patients in group 1 and 16 in group 2 completed the study. In the whole-group analysis, total cholesterol (p = 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.004), and triglycerides (p < 0.001) decreased after treatment, whereas REE per kilogram of lean body mass (p = 0.001) and total fat body mass (p = 0.02) increased. Group 1 patients had a significantly higher relative increase in REE (+7.1% ± 11.3% vs. +3.6% ± 15.1%, p = 0.02). There was no difference between the groups in the other variables.

Despite recent trends toward lowering the upper limit of TSH, the study's conclusions were not included in the document.

### The ages and TSH values of patients being prescribed levothyroxine [^115ykRjT]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism affects approximately 5% of the United States population, and synthetic thyroxine in the form of levothyroxine (LT4) is the most prescribed therapy for this common condition. Autoimmune hypothyroidism is generally progressive, with a decrement in endogenous thyroid function occurring over time, such that overt hypothyroidism would occur if the thyroid hormone deficiency is untreated. However, at the time, hypothyroidism may initially be diagnosed when it is mild or subclinical, at a time that the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is minimally elevated below 10 mIU/L and the serum thyroid hormone levels are normal. Symptoms of hypothyroidism are not always specific for this condition, and each of the symptoms generally associated with hypothyroidism may also have non-thyroid causes. As attribution of the cause of symptoms is not a simple matter, many physicians may err on the side of treating mild TSH elevations with the expectation that symptoms may improve. Thus, treatment with LT4 may be initiated for borderline TSH elevations. The authors also hypothesize that LT4 may even be prescribed for unconfirmed serum TSH elevations, or even without TSH elevation, based on the symptoms that the patient is experiencing.

LT4 is being prescribed with increasing frequency, both in the United States and in other countries. Several studies have shown that the TSH threshold at which LT4 therapy is initiated has fallen over time, such that an increasing number of cases of subclinical hypothyroidism are being treated and the mean or median TSH value.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (indications, abnormal TSH), the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering initiating treatment based on individual factors in patients with TSH levels between the upper limit of a given laboratory's reference range and 10 mIU/L. This is particularly applicable if patients exhibit symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, have positive anti-TPO antibodies, or show evidence of ASCVD, HF, or associated risk factors for these diseases.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling: A novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^112Z55Kn]. Thyroid (2021). High credibility.

The DAT was tested in a validation RCT on patients diagnosed with goiter and differentiated thyroid cancer, while the simplified DAT was tested on patients with thyrotoxicosis. There was no statistical difference between the DAT and control groups in the basic characteristics of the groups, nor in the initial and final dosages of LT4 (multiple t-tests, uncorrected p-values > 0.15 for all variables). Most patients with cancer received TSH suppression, while all patients with goiter and most patients with thyrotoxicosis received replacement therapy. There was no difference in clinically decided TSH targets between DAT and controls, as all patients with goiter had the same TSH target (Pearson Chi-square p = 0.58 for cancer and p = 0.61 for thyrotoxicosis).

- **Faster dosage adjustment with DAT in patients with goiter and cancer**: For all RCT groups together, 24 of 68 patients (35%) reached their narrow TSH targets eight weeks after surgery if the dosage adjustment was assisted by the DAT, in contrast to 10 of 67 patients (15%) in the control group (Chi-square = 7.43, p = 0.006). As the applied DAT for thyrotoxic patients used a simplified population-based fT4 target, in contrast to the individually estimated fT4 targets for patients with goiter and cancer, all further analyses were done on subgroups. Forty percent of patients with goiter and 59% of patients with cancer in DAT groups were within the TSH target after eight weeks compared with 0% and 19% in control groups, respectively (Chi-squares 7.94, p = 0.005 and 8.87, p = 0.003).
