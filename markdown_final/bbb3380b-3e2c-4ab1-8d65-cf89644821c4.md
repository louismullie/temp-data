Lactulose dosage

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step‑by‑step dosing plan for lactulose across indications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the authoritative guidelines and FDA labeling to anchor adult and pediatric dosing. Then, I should verify the therapeutic target (stool frequency/consistency) and onset of action. Next, I will review dosing for hepatic encephalopathy (acute, maintenance, and rectal use), followed by dosing for chronic constipation. After that, I need to check pediatric dosing and safety nuances. I will then examine adverse effects, contraindications, and drug–drug interactions. Finally, I should consider adjuncts such as rifaximin and alternatives like PEG for acute HE, and close with a succinct practical summary [^111LvfNU] [^111Z8S7s] [^111k6Qqd] [^117KjC1u] [^1137vbBV].

> Let me first confirm the role of lactulose in hepatic encephalopathy and the therapeutic target; lactulose is first‑line for overt HE per AASLD/EASL, and both contemporary EASL guidance and pivotal rifaximin data emphasize titration to achieve roughly 2–3 soft stools per day as the clinical target, which will anchor all subsequent dose adjustments [^1137vbBV] [^113jFqAY] [^111LvfNU] [^116UhTKF].

> I will now examine adult dosing for HE from FDA labeling; usual oral dosing is 30–45 mL (20–30 g) three to four times daily, adjusted to produce 2–3 soft stools daily, and for rapid catharsis in overt HE an initial regimen of 30–45 mL every hour may be used until laxation is achieved, after which the dose is reduced to the maintenance amount that sustains the target stool pattern; improvement may occur within 24 hours but can take 48 hours or longer, and continuous long‑term therapy is advised to prevent recurrence; if aspiration risk or coma impedes oral administration, rectal dosing is recommended in impending coma or coma stages [^111Z8S7s].

> Wait, let me verify adult dosing for chronic constipation separately so I don't conflate indications; for constipation, the usual oral adult dose is 10–20 g daily, which corresponds to 15–30 mL daily, and may be increased up to 60 mL/day if needed, with an onset of action typically 24–48 hours; palatability can be improved by mixing with juice, water, or milk; importantly, no dose adjustment is required for hepatic impairment or reduced kidney function, so the same constipation doses generally apply across these comorbidities [^111LUiX4] [^111k6Qqd] [^117KjC1u] [^116QmwGM] [^113ib81i].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric dosing because numbers can be counterintuitive; the Enulose label recommends infants start at 2.5–10 mL/day in divided doses and older children/adolescents at 40–90 mL/day in divided doses, with the same target of 2–3 soft stools per day; at first glance, 40–90 mL/day seems high, but I need to check the label wording — yes, that is the FDA‑stated range, and if diarrhea occurs the dose should be reduced or discontinued; additionally, infants are at risk for hyponatremia and dehydration with overtreatment, so electrolyte and volume monitoring is prudent [^111Z8S7s] [^115Hg2uE].

> Next, I should review how to titrate and monitor; while the traditional metric is 2–3 bowel movements per day, consistency matters as well, and using stool form (e.g. Bristol stool scale targeting types 3–4) may reduce admissions and guide more precise titration; also, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — BM frequency alone may not tightly correlate with objective cognition in cirrhosis, so I should integrate clinical mental status and precipitant control into decisions rather than chasing a number [^111XsCUy] [^111DtcWR].

> I need to ensure safety considerations are explicit; common adverse effects include flatulence, cramping, abdominal discomfort, and dose‑related diarrhea, which can lead to fluid loss, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia; lactulose solutions contain galactose and lactose, so use caution in diabetics and avoid in patients who require a low‑galactose diet; practical tip: onset for laxation is often 24–48 hours, so early over‑titration risks electrolyte derangements without immediate benefit [^113ixGC7] [^1165FBr6] [^115Hg2uE] [^1167qxAQ] [^115se3tS] [^111dtmvX].

> I should double‑check for interactions and prescribing pitfalls; oral antibiotics like neomycin and nonabsorbable antacids may blunt the colonic acidification needed for lactulose activity, so monitor for diminished effect if co‑administered; other laxatives can confound stool‑based titration in acute HE and are generally avoided initially, lest they falsely suggest adequate lactulose dosing has been achieved [^115Hg2uE] [^111HUy1U].

> Let me consider adjunctive therapy; rifaximin added to lactulose reduces recurrence and HE‑related hospitalization compared with lactulose alone in high‑quality trials and regulatory summaries, whereas lactulose remains the backbone per guidelines; for example, in patients in remission, rifaximin plus lactulose outperformed rifaximin alone, reinforcing the principle that combination therapy is superior for secondary prophylaxis; in acute OHE, adding rifaximin to lactulose improved reversal rates and possibly mortality compared with lactulose alone in a blinded RCT, supporting escalation when response is suboptimal [^116UhTKF] [^111J8Cru] [^113S3zVL] [^1137vbBV].

> But wait, what if rapid clinical improvement is needed in hospitalized acute HE; polyethylene glycol (PEG) can achieve faster early improvement than lactulose in RCTs and meta‑analyses, shortening time to resolution and length of stay, though heterogeneity and blinding challenges exist; nonetheless, guidelines still position lactulose as first‑line, with PEG as a reasonable short‑term cathartic alternative in selected cases; after TIPS, I should confirm that recommendations remain the same — yes, EASL advises treating and preventing HE with lactulose similarly to non‑TIPS patients [^111QdVSH] [^116c6fVx] [^116LmhcR] [^113dnKBp] [^1137vbBV] [^111LvfNU] [^11537b7j].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost forgot onset and practical administration details that affect expectations; lactulose is minimally absorbed, exerts its effect in the colon via bacterial metabolism and osmotic action, and generally requires 24–48 hours to produce laxation, which is why in overt HE we often front‑load doses or use rectal routes to bridge to maintenance; mixing with juice or milk can improve adherence without altering pharmacodynamics, and overdose manifests principally as diarrhea and cramping, managed by holding or reducing the dose [^114bC2Gv] [^111k6Qqd] [^117KjC1u] [^117FWsvg].

> To synthesize and ensure no step is missed: for overt HE, start 30–45 mL PO three to four times daily and titrate to 2–3 soft stools/day, using hourly 30–45 mL dosing initially for rapid laxation or rectal administration if airway risk; for constipation, use 15–30 mL daily, up to 60 mL/day as needed, recognizing a 24–48 hour onset; in pediatrics, infants 2.5–10 mL/day divided and older children/adolescents 40–90 mL/day divided, titrated to the same stool target and reduced promptly if diarrhea occurs; across all groups, monitor volume status and electrolytes, especially potassium and sodium, avoid use in low‑galactose diets, and consider rifaximin add‑on for secondary prophylaxis if HE recurs despite adherence to lactulose [^111Z8S7s] [^111k6Qqd] [^117KjC1u] [^111LvfNU] [^116UhTKF].

---

Lactulose is titrated to achieve 2–3 soft stools per day [^111LvfNU], with **initial dose 10–20 g/day** for constipation [^111LUiX4] and **30–45 mL every 1–2 hours** for acute hepatic encephalopathy until catharsis [^111Z8S7s] [^1137vbBV], then maintenance 15–30 mL two to three times daily. For chronic HE prevention, use **15–30 mL two to three times daily**, adjusting to stool output [^111LvfNU] [^1137vbBV]. Pediatric dosing is 2.5–10 mL/day for infants and 40–90 mL/day for older children, divided and titrated to 2–3 soft stools/day [^111Z8S7s]. Monitor for diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, and dehydration; reduce dose if diarrhea occurs [^113ixGC7] [^1165FBr6].

Oral administration for adults involves the usual dosage of 2 to 3 tablespoonfuls (30 to 45 ml, containing 20 g to 30 g of lactulose) three or four times daily. The dosage may be adjusted every day or two to achieve the production of 2 or 3 soft stools daily. Hourly doses of 30 to 45 mL of lactulose may be used to induce rapid laxation during the initial phase of therapy for portal-systemic encephalopathy. Once the laxative effect is achieved, the dose of lactulose may be reduced to the recommended daily amount. Improvement in the patient's condition may occur within 24 hours but could take up to 48 hours or longer.

Continuous long-term therapy is advised to mitigate the severity and prevent recurrence of portal-systemic encephalopathy, using the same recommended daily dose.

For pediatric patients, limited information is available on lactulose use in young children and adolescents. As with adults, the treatment goal is to produce 2 to 3 soft stools daily. The recommended initial daily oral dose for infants is between 2.5 to 10 ml, divided into doses. For older children and adolescents, the total daily dose ranges from 40 to 90 ml. If the initial dose causes diarrhea, it should be reduced immediately; if diarrhea persists, discontinuing lactulose is advised.

Rectal administration is recommended for adults in the impending coma or coma stage of portal-systemic encephalopathy, particularly when there is a risk of aspiration or when endoscopic or intubation procedures are necessary.

**Adverse reactions**: Precise frequency data are not available. Lactulose may produce gaseous distention with flatulence or belching and abdominal discomfort such as cramping in about 20% of patients. Excessive dosage can lead to diarrhea with potential complications such as loss of fluids, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia. Nausea and vomiting have been reported.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^113d6v2E]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

The evidence supports recommendations for the use of lactulose therapy for the prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) recurrence over the long term and for the additional benefit of adding rifaximin to lactulose therapy. The addition of rifaximin to lactulose significantly further reduces the risk of OHE recurrence and HE-related hospitalization compared with lactulose therapy alone, with a demonstrably low number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve these further benefits. There is also emerging evidence to indicate that a switch to rifaximin monotherapy may be appropriate for those for whom lactulose is ineffective, poorly tolerated, or when adherence to lactulose therapy is problematic. However, this requires further research.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution versus lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113SaeYj]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

There are several limitations that should be noted in this study. First, this meta-analysis is limited by the small number and poor quality of included trials. Second, significant heterogeneity still exists in the outcomes of studies, and the source of heterogeneity may include age, gender, culture, and many other corresponding factors. In addition, only the follow-up in the short term was conducted in these included studies. In the future, more prospective studies should be undertaken with the follow-up in the long term.

Also, there are a number of advantages in the study. A wide range of literature research was carried out, providing updated information about the efficacy of PEG in the treatment of HE. The inclusion or exclusion of studies and the extraction of data were independently conducted with the help of two reviewers, which can be regarded as more accurate. Moreover, potential studies were not excluded because of publication year or status, and the external validity of the results was increased due to the fact that the trials included were conducted in different settings or even several countries. Here is another advantage: not only were the efficacy and side effects of both treatments assessed, but also other significant clinical results were included, such as serum ammonia concentration and hospital stay. In addition, the funnel plot was also included to investigate substantial publication bias, though a rigorous search strategy was used to reduce the introduction of potential publication bias.

HE is considered to be a severe sequela of chronic liver disease.

- **Dosage and administration**: The usual dose is 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls (15 to 30 mL, containing 10 g to 20 g of lactulose) daily. The dose may be increased to 60 mL daily if necessary. Twenty-four to 48 hours may be required to produce a normal bowel movement.

Note: Some patients have found that lactulose solution may be more acceptable when mixed with fruit juice, water, or milk.

### Branched-chain amino acids for people with hepatic encephalopathy [^116KvjLt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a brain dysfunction characterized by neurological and psychiatric changes related to liver insufficiency or portal-systemic shunting, and its severity ranges from minor symptoms to coma. A Cochrane systematic review, which included 11 randomised clinical trials on branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) versus control interventions, evaluated whether BCAA could benefit people with hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of BCAA as compared to any control intervention for people with hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Search methods**: We identified trials through manual and electronic searches in The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index on 2 October 2014.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised clinical trials, regardless of the bias control, language, or publication status.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The authors independently extracted data from published reports and directly from the primary investigators. For this update of the review, we adjusted our primary outcomes to include mortality (all-cause), hepatic encephalopathy (number of people without improved manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy), and adverse events. The analysis involved both random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses. Additionally, we performed subgroup, sensitivity, regression, and trial sequential analyses to evaluate sources of heterogeneity, including intervention, participant, and trial characteristics, as well as bias using The Cochrane methodology.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^111426bB]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

In the 6-month phase III trial that compared rifaximin-α 550 mg with placebo for the prevention of OHE recurrence in patients in HE remission, more than 90% of whom were additionally treated with lactulose, the overall incidence of AEs was the same in both groups, and there were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of the most commonly reported AEs and serious AEs. In the 24-month open-label maintenance study that followed this trial, the incidences of total AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were lower than those observed in the rifaximin and placebo arms of the original 6-month trial. In addition, long-term retrospective studies have shown a low incidence of AEs when rifaximin is added to lactulose therapy in clinical practice. As with nearly all antibacterial agents, C. difficile-associated diarrhea has been reported with rifaximin treatment. However, this has not emerged as a major safety concern following long-term treatment in clinical trials and in clinical practice studies.

HE is associated with a substantial economic burden, primarily because of the direct costs of hospitalization and rehospitalization following recurrence, and secondarily because of the indirect costs associated with outpatient care, disability, lost productivity, and the wider negative effect on the lives of patients' caregivers. As previously discussed, evidence for the long-term treatment of HE with rifaximin as an add-on to lactulose therapy demonstrates that it not only significantly decreases OHE recurrence, in comparison with lactulose therapy alone, but also mitigates the overall economic burden associated with HE.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^111W6ngN]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

The NNT (Number Needed to Treat) measure was designed to quantify treatment benefit directly in terms of the number of patients who would need to be treated before a benefit is observed, thereby providing a means of expressing absolute, as opposed to relative, risk in a clinically meaningful way. Although the number of studies eligible for inclusion in the NNT analyses was limited, results showed that, for long-term secondary prophylaxis in preventing OHE recurrence, approximately four patients would need to be treated with lactulose before clinical benefit is observed compared with no treatment or placebo. This must be considered within the clinical context showing a very high rate of OHE recurrence with no prophylaxis or with poor adherence to lactulose therapy.

Importantly, to show the add-on benefit of rifaximin to lactulose, the NNT is approximately four patients to prevent the recurrence of OHE. The relatively low NNT value for adding rifaximin to lactulose therapy provides further support for the clinical benefit of these treatments for the prevention of OHE recurrence over the long term. Only one study compared rifaximin monotherapy versus rifaximin plus lactulose, and NNT analysis showed that approximately seven patients would need to be treated with rifaximin monotherapy before clinical benefit is observed in comparison to rifaximin plus lactulose. However, the results of this single study should be viewed with caution, not only because the 95% confidence interval was very wide but also because the study design involved patients who received rifaximin monotherapy.

### Non-absorbable disaccharides versus placebo/no intervention and lactulose versus lactitol for the prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis [^111ufafd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Non-absorbable disaccharides, such as lactulose and lactitol, are recommended as first-line treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. The previous review included 10 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating non-absorbable disaccharides versus placebo or no intervention, and eight RCTs evaluating lactulose versus lactitol for people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. The review found no evidence to either support or refute the use of non-absorbable disaccharides and no differences between lactulose and lactitol.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of non-absorbable disaccharides versus placebo or no intervention, and lactulose versus lactitol in people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Search methods**: We carried out electronic searches of the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 10), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to 19 October 2015. We also performed manual searches of meetings and conference proceedings, checks of bibliographies, and correspondence with investigators and pharmaceutical companies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs irrespective of publication status, language, or blinding.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors, working independently, retrieved data from published reports and correspondence with investigators. The primary outcomes were mortality, hepatic encephalopathy, and serious adverse events. We presented the results of meta-analyses as risk ratios (RR) and mean differences.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^111h4zH9]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Only one long-term study has assessed the effectiveness of rifaximin monotherapy compared with rifaximin+lactulose therapy. The calculated NNT value (95% CI) for rifaximin monotherapy as secondary prophylaxis for OHE recurrence was 6.88 (3.50–203.90). This multicenter, retrospective chart review compared 1-year outcomes of 149 patients with cirrhosis treated with rifaximin (400–1600 mg/day) with those of 54 patients treated with rifaximin+lactulose.

The rate of maintenance of HE remission for 1 year was 81% with rifaximin monotherapy versus 67% with rifaximin+lactulose. Mean time to a breakthrough OHE event was 210 days with rifaximin monotherapy versus 90 days with rifaximin+lactulose. HE-related hospitalization rates were similar with rifaximin (43%) and rifaximin+lactulose (39%).

Response to rifaximin appeared to be enhanced in patients with a mean baseline model for end-stage liver disease score of less than or equal to 20. These findings contrast with those of a single-center, retrospective, observational study of 225 patients evaluated for liver transplantation, all treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg+lactulose for 6 months, which showed a lower rate of HE-related hospitalization in patients with a model for end-stage liver disease score of at least 20 versus less than 20 (1.6 vs. 2.5 per 6 months).

### Enulose [^115Hg2uE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Since lactulose solution contains galactose (less than 1.6 g/15 mL) and lactose (less than 1.2 g/15 mL), it should be used with caution in diabetics.

In the overall management of portal-systemic encephalopathy, it should be recognized that there is serious underlying liver disease with complications such as electrolyte disturbance (e.g. hypokalemia) for which other specific therapy may be required.

Infants receiving lactulose may develop hyponatremia and dehydration.

- **Drug interactions**: There have been conflicting reports about the concomitant use of neomycin and lactulose solution. Theoretically, the elimination of certain colonic bacteria by neomycin and possibly other anti-infective agents may interfere with the desired degradation of lactulose and thus prevent the acidification of colonic contents. Thus, the status of the lactulose-treated patient should be closely monitored in the event of concomitant oral anti-infective therapy.

	- Results of preliminary studies in humans and rats suggest that nonabsorbable antacids given concurrently with lactulose may inhibit the desired lactulose-induced drop in colonic pH. Therefore, a possible lack of desired effect of treatment should be taken into consideration before such drugs are given concomitantly with lactulose.

	- Other laxatives should not be used, especially during the initial phase of therapy for portal-systemic encephalopathy, because the loose stools resulting from their use may falsely suggest that adequate lactulose dosage has been achieved.

### Non-absorbable disaccharides versus placebo/no intervention and lactulose versus lactitol for the prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis [^113AU47Z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Non-absorbable disaccharides (lactulose and lactitol) are recommended as first-line treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. The previous (second) version of this review included 10 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating non-absorbable disaccharides versus placebo/no intervention and eight RCTs evaluating lactulose versus lactitol for people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. The review found no evidence to either support or refute the use of the non-absorbable disaccharides and no differences between lactulose versus lactitol.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of i) non-absorbable disaccharides versus placebo/no intervention and ii) lactulose versus lactitol in people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Search methods**: We carried out electronic searches of the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 10), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded up to 19 October 2015; manual searches of meetings and conference proceedings; checks of bibliographies; and correspondence with investigators and pharmaceutical companies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs, irrespective of publication status, language, or blinding.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors, working independently, retrieved data from published reports and correspondence with investigators. The primary outcomes were mortality, hepatic encephalopathy, and serious adverse events. We presented the results of meta-analyses as risk ratios (RR) and mean differences.

### Bristol stool scale as a determinant of hepatic encephalopathy management in patients with cirrhosis [^111XsCUy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Bowel movement (BM) frequency is used to titrate lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy (HE); however, stool consistency using the Bristol stool scale (BSS, 0–7) is often ignored.

- **Methods**: The study included pre-BSS and post-BSS cohorts. BSS was incorporated into decision-making after training in outpatients with cirrhosis. Two to three BMs per day and BSS scores of 3–4 were considered normal, whereas the rest were considered high or low. Concordance between the metrics was evaluated. Medication changes and 6-month admissions were compared between this group (post-BSS) and a comparable previous group (pre-BSS). Concordance and regression analyses for all-cause admissions and HE-related admissions were performed, and comparisons were made for HE-related medication stability. In the longitudinal analysis, an outpatient group seen twice was analyzed for BSS and BMs.

- **Results**: In the post-BSS cohort, 112 patients were included with only 46% BSS and BMs concordance and modest BSS/BMs correlation (r = 0.27, P = 0.005). Compared with a pre-BSS cohort (N = 114), there was a lower 6-month total (4% vs 0.36%, P < 0.02). The longitudinal analysis observed a difference in BMs (P = 0.02).

### Lactulose: A simple sugar in a complex encephalopathy [^117DiKiC]. Neurocritical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a common encephalopathy and one of the very few that are treatable. Lactulose has remained a standard pharmaceutical intervention and is listed as one of the World Health Organization's Essential Medicines. The discovery of lactulose, the acid dialysis proof of concept, and the role of Bircher are not well known. This historical vignette reviews the gradual understanding of the complex liver-brain connection, the effective treatment of hepatic stupor with lactulose, and the immediate relevance of lactulose to the practice of consultative neurocritical care.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^11473nCz]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

A consolidated overview of evidence for the effectiveness and safety/tolerability of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) treatment over the long term is currently lacking. We identified and assessed published evidence for the long-term (≥ 6 months) pharmacological management of HE with lactulose and/or rifaximin. A literature search was conducted in PubMed (cutoff date 05 March 2018) using the search terms 'hepatic encephalopathy+rifaximin' and 'hepatic encephalopathy+lactulose'. All articles containing primary clinical data were manually assessed to identify studies in which long-term (≥ 6 months) effectiveness and/or safety/tolerability endpoints were reported for lactulose and/or rifaximin.

Long-term effectiveness outcomes were reported in eight articles for treatment with lactulose alone and 19 articles for treatment with rifaximin, alone or in combination with lactulose. Long-term safety/tolerability outcomes were reported in six articles for treatment with lactulose alone and nine articles for treatment with rifaximin, alone or in combination with lactulose. These studies showed that lactulose is effective for the prevention of overt HE recurrence over the long term, and that the addition of rifaximin to lactulose significantly reduces the risk of overt HE recurrence and HE-related hospitalization compared with lactulose therapy alone, without compromising tolerability. Evidence therefore supports recommendations for the use of lactulose therapy for the prevention of overt HE recurrence over the long term, and for the additional benefit of adding rifaximin to lactulose.

### Bowel movement frequency is not linked with cognitive function in cirrhosis [^111DtcWR]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

The spectrum of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) ranges from overt HE (OHE) to cognitive impairment (i.e. covert HE or CHE). The first-line therapy is lactulose, which is titrated to achieve approximately 2–3 soft/loose daily bowel movements (BM). This metric is considered dogma for practitioners despite erratic results, gastrointestinal adverse events, and poor tolerance in Western countries. There are logistic barriers for the widespread uptake of rifaximin, which is the second-line therapy. Moreover, although BM frequency-directed dose titration of lactulose is the usual practice, its impact on objective cognitive performance is unclear. Our aim is to determine the impact of BM frequency on cognition in patients with or without prior OHE.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^114wr1fx]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Lactulose alone, in a single-center, retrospective chart review of 137 patients who received lactulose for a mean duration of 27 ± 6 months after their first HE event, showed significant findings. It was found that 75% of the patients experienced HE recurrence after 9 ± 1 months. The rate of HE-related hospital readmission was 73%, and the mortality rate was 34%. Thirty-nine (28.5%) patients had HE recurrence associated with lactulose nonadherence, which was mostly due to gastrointestinal adverse effects.

Several large single-center, open-label, randomized controlled studies have assessed the long-term (≥ 6 months) effectiveness of lactulose therapy, compared with placebo, probiotics, and/or no therapy. Compared with no treatment or placebo, the calculated NNT values (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for lactulose as secondary prophylaxis for OHE recurrence were 3.28 (2.15–6.90) and 3.68 (2.33–8.75).

### Bifidobacterium combined with fructo-oligosaccharide versus lactulose in the treatment of patients with hepatic encephalopathy [^1169nrbX]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a reversible neuropsychiatric syndrome in patients with liver disease. It was suggested that Bifidobacterium combined with fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) may decrease blood and brain ammonia levels.

- **Aim**: The study was conducted to compare the efficacy of Bifidobacterium combined with FOS and lactulose in patients with HE.

- **Methods**: One hundred and twenty-five patients (35 hepatitis B virus infected, 70 hepatitis C virus infected, and 20 cryptogenetic cirrhosis) were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomized to a treatment for 60 days with Bifidobacterium and FOS (group A) or into a group receiving lactulose (group B) in a double-blind manner.

- **Results**: After 30 days of the study period, the Bifidobacterium and FOS-treated patients, compared with lactulose-treated patients, showed a significant decrease in Trail Making Test B (TMT B) (P < 0.005), and a significant increase in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (P < 0.001) and Block Design Test (P < 0.001). After 60 days of the study period, the Bifidobacterium and FOS-treated patients compared with lactulose-treated patients showed a significant decrease in NH4 fasting HE1 (P < 0.001), TMT A (P < 0.05), TMT B (P < 0.001), and a significant increase in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (P < 0.001) and Block Design Test (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: The treatment with Bifidobacterium and FOS is an alternative to the use of lactulose in patients with cirrhosis, for its usefulness in reducing blood ammonia levels and improving psychometric tests.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^111J8Cru]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Rifaximin with or without lactulose

Most rifaximin studies assessed the additional benefit of rifaximin prophylaxis as an adjunct to lactulose therapy. Compared with placebo plus lactulose, the number needed to treat (NNT) values (95% confidence intervals) for rifaximin plus lactulose as secondary prophylaxis for overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) recurrence were calculated to be 3.28 (2.27–5.90) and 4.21 (2.93–7.46).

A phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial compared the effectiveness of rifaximin-α 550 mg twice daily versus placebo for the prevention of OHE recurrence over 6 months in 299 patients with cirrhosis who had experienced at least two OHE episodes in the previous 6 months but were currently in remission. More than 90% of patients in both treatment arms additionally received lactulose therapy. The rate of OHE recurrence was 22.1% with rifaximin versus 45.9% with placebo. The hazard ratio for the time to a breakthrough OHE episode for rifaximin versus placebo was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.28–0.64; P < 0.001), reflecting a relative risk reduction of 58% with rifaximin versus placebo.

The rate of HE-related hospital readmission was 13.6% with rifaximin versus 22.6% with placebo, and the hazard ratio for time to first HE-related hospitalization for rifaximin versus placebo was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.29–0.87; P = 0.01), representing a 50% relative reduction in risk. In a subanalysis of this trial (n = 219), conducted primarily to assess health-related quality of life, the rate of OHE recurrence was 25.7% with rifaximin versus 50.0% with placebo, and HE remission was maintained for 6 months in 74.3% of patients treated with rifaximin.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^113pHwBu]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

In the similarly designed single-center, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted by Ali et al, the incidence of adverse events (AEs) was low and similar in patients treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg (n = 63) or placebo (n = 63) for 6 months, in addition to lactulose therapy. Deaths occurred in 11.1% of patients in both treatment groups.

In the 24-month, open-label maintenance study that followed the trial by Bass and colleagues, a total of 392 patients were treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg ('all-rifaximin' group), including 252 patients who received de novo treatment (82 patients who received placebo in the original trial and 170 newly recruited patients; 'new-rifaximin' group). Approximately 90% of the patients in the all-rifaximin group additionally received treatment with lactulose. Safety and tolerability results were compared with those for patients who received rifaximin and placebo in the original phase III trial ['historical-rifaximin' (n = 140) and 'historical-placebo' (n = 159) groups, respectively]. The overall rates of AEs per patient-years of exposure (PYE) were lower in the all-rifaximin (0.71) and new-rifaximin (0.69) groups than in the historical-rifaximin (2.24) and historical-placebo (2.76) groups, as were the rates of serious AEs per PYE and discontinuation owing to AEs (rate/PTE). The rate of death per PYE was 0.15 in the all-rifaximin group compared with 0.24 in the historical-placebo group. The rate of C. difficile infection remained stable with long-term rifaximin treatment. When comparing patients who received rifaximin in combination with lactulose (n = 352) with those who received rifaximin alone…

### Sodium benzoate for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in humans and animals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114aQsHi]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Snehavardhan et al. conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 86 children under 18 years with chronic liver disease. The study compared sodium benzoate (SB) at 200 mg/kg/day plus standard treatment (lactulose, rifaximin, and diet) to a placebo plus standard treatment. A total of 88 episodes of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) were analyzed, with 44 episodes per group. There was a significant decrease in ammonia levels after treatment compared with baseline (129.8 ± 34.0 vs. 109.0 ± 40.4 µmol/L), although the difference from the placebo group was not significant. There was no significant effect on the resolution of overt HE, duration of hospital stay (11.8 ± 9.5 vs. 10.0 ± 7.6 days in SB vs. standard treatment, respectively; P = 0.315), or survival with native liver. Adverse events were similar between the groups, and SB was well tolerated. However, there was an increase in ascites observed in 15.9% of patients receiving SB, compared with 4.5% in the placebo group, though this difference was not statistically significant.

Sushma et al. reported on a randomized, double-blind controlled trial involving 74 adult patients with cirrhosis or surgical portosystemic anastomosis and HE. Patients were randomized to receive either lactulose (n = 36) or SB at 5 g twice daily orally (n = 38). The clinical and demographic characteristics of the two groups were similar. There was no significant difference between the groups in ammonia reduction, clinical recovery, time to recovery (11.6 ± 6.4 vs. 12.8 ± 9.1 days in SB vs. lactulose, respectively; P > 0.1), recovery to normal mental status, or adverse events.

### Randomized controlled trial of polyethylene glycol versus lactulose for the treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy [^116VK5Xm]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a frequent complication of cirrhosis and one of the most debilitating manifestations that necessitates hospitalization. Although many treatment modalities are being investigated, none are satisfactory; therefore, newer treatment modalities need to be tried.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of polyethylene glycol (PEG) versus lactulose in the management of HE.

- **Patients and methods**: This clinical trial included 100 patients with post-hepatitis C cirrhosis who were admitted with HE. Patients were randomized into two equal groups: Group I patients received lactulose, and Group II patients received PEG. The clinico-epidemiological characteristics of patients, Child-Pugh score, and HE scoring algorithm were registered before and 24 hours after administration of the drug. Moreover, any suspected adverse effects were recorded.

- **Results**: All 100 patients received treatment. Three patients died within 24 hours of admission and did not complete the follow-up period. According to the intention-to-treat approach, they were considered as treatment failures. On analysis, 36 out of 50 (72%) patients improved one grade or more in HE scoring algorithm after 24 hours of lactulose therapy versus 47 out of 50 (94%) of those on PEG therapy (P < 0.05). The time needed for resolution of HE and the length of hospital stay were significantly lower in the PEG group versus the lactulose group (P < 0.001). Both therapies were tolerated, and no significant adverse events were reported.

- **Conclusion**: Both lactulose and PEG were safe and effective in the treatment of HE. PEG significantly reduced the time needed for resolution of HE.

### Management of minimal and overt hepatic encephalopathy with branched-chain amino acids: a review of the evidence [^115FNd9W]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a challenging complication of liver disease that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation in the management of HE is a debated topic. This narrative review aims to provide an up-to-date review of the topic and includes studies featuring patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. A review of the literature was performed using the online databases MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies between 2002 and December 2022. Keywords 'branched-chain amino acids', 'liver cirrhosis', and 'hepatic encephalopathy' were used. Studies were assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of 1045 citations, 8 studies met the inclusion criteria.

The main outcomes reported for HE were changes in minimal HE (MHE) (n = 4) and/or the incidence of overt HE (OHE) (n = 7). Two of the four studies reporting on MHE showed improvement in psychometric testing in the BCAA group, but there was no change in the incidence of OHE in any of the seven papers in the BCAA group. There were few adverse effects of BCAA supplementation. This review found weak evidence for BCAA supplementation for MHE and no evidence for BCAAs for OHE. However, given the relative paucity and methodological heterogeneity of the research, there is scope for future studies to examine the effects of varying timing, dosage, and frequency of BCAAs on outcomes such as HE. Importantly, research is also needed to examine BCAAs in conjunction with standard therapies for HE, such as rifaximin and/or lactulose.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^111rSF1p]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: Literature searches were conducted in PubMed, focusing on titles and abstracts, with the language restricted to English and no date restrictions up to the cutoff date of March 5, 2018. The search terms used included 'hepatic encephalopathy+rifaximin' and 'hepatic encephalopathy+lactulose'. The abstracts of all identified articles were manually assessed to locate primary clinical data manuscripts, including clinical trials, observational studies, registry studies, health economics, survey data, and journal-published congress abstracts indexed on PubMed. These manuscripts were further evaluated to identify studies reporting long-term effectiveness and/or safety/tolerability endpoints for lactulose and/or rifaximin. Long-term treatment was defined as at least 6 months. The results of these studies were tabulated for further evaluation.

- **Similar searches**: Additional initial searches utilized terms such as 'hepatic encephalopathy+-ornithine — aspartate', 'hepatic encephalopathy+LOLA', and 'hepatic encephalopathy+ornithine aspartate'. Nevertheless, as only one study reported long-term outcomes (≥ 6 months), the subsequent review process focused solely on evidence for lactulose and rifaximin.

- **Analysis**: Number needed to treat (NNT) analyses were carried out for studies showing significant between-group differences in the recurrence rate of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) after at least 6 months of secondary prophylaxis with lactulose and/or rifaximin. The analysis was limited to studies investigating secondary prophylaxis due to the lack of studies on primary prophylaxis and different dosing regimens.

### A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial comparing rifaximin plus lactulose with lactulose alone in treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy [^113S3zVL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

The study titled "Rifaximin plus lactulose in hepatic encephalopathy" was published by Sharma BC and colleagues in 2013 in the journal Am J Gastroenterol. This study is related to hepatic encephalopathy. The trial question was: What is the effect of rifaximin plus lactulose in patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy?

- **Study design**: The study was a single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: The study involved 120 patients (31 females, 89 males). The inclusion criterion was patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Key exclusions included serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl, active alcohol intake < 4 weeks before the present episode, other metabolic encephalopathies, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), degenerative central nervous system (CNS) disease or major psychiatric illness, and significant comorbidity.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Rifaximin and lactulose group**: 63 patients received lactulose (30–60 mL TID) plus rifaximin (1,200 mg/day).
	- **Lactulose only group**: 57 patients received lactulose (30–60 mL TID) plus a placebo capsule.

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant increase in the complete reversal of hepatic encephalopathy (76% vs. 50.8%; RR 1.5, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.52).

- **Secondary outcomes**: A borderline significant decrease in death was observed (23.8% vs. 49.1%; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0 to 0.96).

The study provides high credibility outcomes based on its design and rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution versus lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116c6fVx]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

The results of this study provide substantial evidence for the efficacy of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), with shorter hospitalization observed. The early resolution of HE not only contributes to timely and effective intestinal nutrition, which plays an important role in patient recovery, but also enables health care professionals to focus on managing the factors that cause metabolic encephalopathy and identifying other possible causes. Significant heterogeneity was observed in the meta-analysis of hospital stay, and conservative results were obtained using the random effects model. Uncorrected triggers for HE were excluded from all the trials included in the review. Nevertheless, relevant data were not acquired from individual patients to ascertain whether the length of stay varied depending on the grade or etiology of liver disease or other comorbidities in each population. Importantly, these aspects would most likely generate the heterogeneity observed in the studies.

None of the patients included in this study had any serious adverse reactions, which is consistent with a Cochrane systematic review of PEG versus lactulose in the treatment of chronic constipation. No difference in the incidence of adverse events between PEG and lactulose was observed after collecting valid studies. The meta-analysis of adverse events had no significant heterogeneity in the pooled studies. Adverse reactions mainly include diarrhea, bloating, and nausea. More bloating symptoms appeared in the lactulose group, while more diarrhea symptoms appeared in the PEG group.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution versus lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113dnKBp]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome that can complicate acute or chronic liver failure. The main characteristic is the change of mental state, involving a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms from a slight change in brain function to a deep coma. Although the pathogenesis of HE is not yet fully understood, it is generally believed that gut-derived neurotoxic ammonia plays a key role. Elevated serum ammonia can be observed in approximately 60% to 80% of HE patients, indicating that serum ammonia mainly comes from the gut. Ammonia can easily pass through the blood-brain barrier and lead to cirrhotic patients with altered mental status.

Lactulose has been recommended as a treatment for HE for decades, as it is able to reduce the intestinal production and absorption of ammonia generated by catharsis and intestinal microbial metabolism. Although lactulose is the standard therapy for gut catharsis in HE patients, polyethylene glycol (PEG) electrolyte solution can also relieve constipation and reduce the absorption of ammonia. PEG has been found to be effective and safe in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PEG with lactulose. PEG can be considered an alternative treatment for lactulose in acute HE, but it should be reserved for patients with poor response to lactulose in chronic encephalopathy. A number of new randomized clinical trials about the efficacy of PEG have been published since 2014, and these small-scale studies have shown that PEG may become an additional choice for the treatment of patients with HE.

### Nonabsorbable disaccharides for hepatic encephalopathy [^113mTcan]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Nonabsorbable disaccharides, such as lactulose or lactitol, are considered the treatment of choice for hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of nonabsorbable disaccharides for patients with hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Search strategy**: Trials were identified through The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (March 2003), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to 2003/03), EMBASE (1980 to 2003/03), manual searches of bibliographies and journals, authors of trials, and pharmaceutical companies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials comparing lactulose or lactitol versus no intervention, placebo, or antibiotics and trials comparing lactulose versus lactitol for hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The primary outcome measures included no improvement of hepatic encephalopathy and all-cause mortality. Binary outcomes are reported as relative risks (RR) based on a random effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed with regard to methodological quality and form of hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Main results**: Thirty trials assessed nonabsorbable disaccharides versus placebo, no intervention, or antibiotics, or assessed lactulose versus lactitol. We could not extract data from all trials. Compared with placebo or no intervention, nonabsorbable disaccharides had no statistically significant effect on mortality (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.02 to 8.68, four trials) but appeared to reduce the risk of no improvement of hepatic encephalopathy (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.84, six trials).

### Branched-chain amino acids for people with hepatic encephalopathy [^112Zm63R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a brain dysfunction characterized by neurological and psychiatric changes associated with liver insufficiency or portal-systemic shunting. The severity ranges from minor symptoms to coma. A Cochrane systematic review, including 11 randomized clinical trials on branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) versus control interventions, evaluated whether BCAA may benefit people with hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of BCAA versus any control intervention for people with hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Search methods**: We identified trials through manual and electronic searches in The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science, and LILACS (May 2017).

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized clinical trials, irrespective of the bias control, language, or publication status.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The authors independently extracted data based on published reports and collected data from the primary investigators. We changed our primary outcomes in this update of the review to include mortality (all-cause), hepatic encephalopathy (number of people without improved manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy), and adverse events. The analyses included random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses. We performed subgroup, sensitivity, regression, and trial sequential analyses to evaluate sources of heterogeneity, including intervention and participant characteristics.

**Rifaximin with or without lactulose**: In the phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial carried out by Bass et al, which compared rifaximin-α 550 mg (n = 140) versus placebo (n = 159) for the prevention of OHE recurrence over 6 months (concomitant lactulose use > 90% in both groups), the overall incidence of AEs was 80.0% with rifaximin versus 79.9% with placebo. The most commonly reported AEs (≥ 10% of patients in either group) were nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, peripheral edema, ascites, dizziness, and headache, but there were no significant differences between treatment groups. There were also no significant differences between groups in the incidences of serious AEs and AEs related to infection, including Clostridium difficile infection.

In addition to these prospective data, several large retrospective studies have assessed the effectiveness of rifaximin combined with lactulose in comparison with lactulose alone. The IMPRESS study was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study of 207 patients with hepatic encephalopathy, 84% of whom received concomitant lactulose, designed to assess the effect of rifaximin-α 550 mg on hospital resource use. Outcomes were compared for the six months before starting rifaximin ('pre-rifaximin') versus the six months following rifaximin initiation ('post-rifaximin'), and for 12 months pre-rifaximin versus 12 months post-rifaximin. Overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) episodes were experienced by 57% of patients in the 12 months pre-rifaximin versus 38% in the 12 months post-rifaximin. The mean number of hepatic encephalopathy episodes per patient decreased significantly from the 12 months pre-rifaximin to the 12 months post-rifaximin (P = 0.047).

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: A consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^1144MqUd]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Specific therapy for overt HE episodes includes supportive care, treatment of underlying precipitants, and initiation of specific therapy; first-line choices are nonabsorbable disaccharides or short-course antibiotics. All patients recovering from an acute episode of overt HE should also receive secondary prophylaxis to reduce the risk of recurrence; the evidence-based choices include nonabsorbable disaccharides and/or rifaximin. Appropriate therapy can reduce the duration of admission and reduce the risk of subsequent readmission. However, to maximize the benefits from therapy, early diagnosis is essential to allow prompt initiation of recommended treatment.

We recommend that our conclusions and recommendations be considered further by our colleagues in gastroenterology and hepatology and those in other disciplines. We hope that these recommendations assist in the development of regional/national cross-specialty guidelines to improve the identification and triage of patients who may have HE and facilitate appropriate management. We also hope that future guidelines consider the management of patients with HE from initial 'suspicion' of cognitive impairment, which may be identified by a clinician or healthcare provider not routinely responsible for management of an individual's liver disease.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^114Y5NkF]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

In a primary prophylaxis study, patients with cirrhosis but no previous history of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) were randomized to receive lactulose therapy (n = 60) or no lactulose therapy (n = 60) for 12 months. Lactulose significantly reduced the rate of OHE occurrence compared to no lactulose (11% vs. 28%; P = 0.02) and reduced the median length of stay for HE-related hospitalization, although not significantly.

- **Secondary prophylaxis study**: Patients with cirrhosis who had recovered from OHE were randomized to receive lactulose (n = 68), probiotics (n = 64), or no therapy (n = 65) for up to 12 months. The rate of OHE recurrence was 26.5% with lactulose, 34.4% with probiotics, and 56.9% with no therapy (lactulose vs. probiotics, P = not significant; lactulose vs. no therapy, P = 0.001; and probiotics vs. no therapy, P = 0.02). The mortality rate was 19.1%, 17.2%, and 24.6% for the lactulose, probiotics, and no therapy groups, respectively (P = not significant between groups).

In a similar secondary prophylaxis study, patients were randomized to receive lactulose or placebo over a median follow-up duration of 14 months. Lactulose was significantly superior to placebo in reducing the rate of OHE recurrence (19.6% vs. 46.8%; P = 0.001) but not in reducing the rate of hospitalization for non-HE events or mortality.

### Enulose [^111dtmvX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

### Lactulose [^114bC2Gv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Lactulose is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and no enzyme capable of hydrolysis of this disaccharide is present in human gastrointestinal tissue. As a result, oral doses of lactulose solution reach the colon virtually unchanged. In the colon, lactulose is broken down primarily to lactic acid and to small amounts of formic and acetic acids by the action of colonic bacteria. This process results in an increase in osmotic pressure and slight acidification of the colonic contents, which in turn causes an increase in stool water content and softens the stool.

Since lactulose does not exert its effect until it reaches the colon, and because transit time through the colon may be slow, 24 to 48 hours may be required to produce the desired bowel movement.

Lactulose solution given orally to humans and experimental animals results in only small amounts reaching the blood. Urinary excretion of lactulose has been determined to be 3% or less and is essentially complete within 24 hours.

### Xifaxan [^116UhTKF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

A total of 222 subjects were randomized to receive either Xifaxan monotherapy (550 mg twice daily) (N = 113) or Xifaxan (550 mg twice daily) plus lactulose (self-titrated by the patient to produce 2 to 3 soft stools per day) (N = 109). Sixty-five percent of subjects received lactulose at enrollment. Subjects randomized to Xifaxan monotherapy who received lactulose at enrollment (N = 76) discontinued lactulose on the day of randomization.

Subjects had a mean age of 58 years (range, 32–85 years); 74% were under 65 years of age, 63% were male, 91% were White, 6% were Black, 1% were Asian, and 2% were of other ethnicities.

- **Primary endpoint and results**: The primary endpoint was the time to first breakthrough overt HE episode, defined as an increase of Conn score to Grade ≥ 2. Breakthrough overt HE episodes occurred in 28 of 113 subjects (25%) in the Xifaxan monotherapy group and in 15 of 109 subjects (14%) in the Xifaxan plus lactulose group during the 6-month treatment period; the hazard ratio was 1.98 (95% CI: 1.06 to 3.7). Comparison of Kaplan-Meier estimates of event-free curves showed that Xifaxan monotherapy, compared with the combination of Xifaxan and lactulose, increased the risk of HE breakthrough by 98% during the 6-month treatment period.

Kaplan-Meier event-free curves are illustrated in Figure 3, depicting the time to first breakthrough HE event up to 6 months of treatment (Day 170) for all randomized subjects.

### Predictors of nonresponse to lactulose in patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy [^111CGAM9]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Lactulose is commonly used in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). However, not all patients respond to lactulose. This study evaluated predictors of nonresponse to lactulose in patients with cirrhosis and HE.

- **Patients and methods**: Consecutive cirrhotic patients with HE were enrolled, diagnosed by the West Haven criteria. Patients were treated with lactulose and correction of any associated precipitating factors. Nonresponse was defined as the patient remaining in HE even after 10 days of treatment or dying while in HE.

- **Results**: Of 300 patients with cirrhosis and HE, 231 (77%) met the inclusion criteria. The majority (95%) of these patients had Grade 2 or 3 HE. Of the 231 patients, 180 (78%) responded to lactulose. However, 51 (22%) did not respond, and 34 (15%) died without any improvement in HE. HE did not improve in 17 (7%) patients after 10 days of therapy. Significant differences were observed in baseline parameters between nonresponders and responders: age (42.0 ± 11.9 vs. 46.6 ± 12.7 years, P = 0.02), total leukocyte count (median, 9300 vs. 7300 cells/mm³, P = 0.001), serum sodium level (129.9 ± 6.2 vs. 133.7 ± 7.1 mmol/l, P = 0.001), model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (22.9 ± 3.8 vs. 19.9 ± 4.2, P = 0.001), mean arterial pressure (MAP, 77.9 ± 10.0 vs. 86.3 ± 8.7 mmHg, P = 0.001), serum AST (median, 114 vs. 76 IU/l, P = 0.01), and serum ALT (median, 84 vs. 48.5 IU/l, P = 0.001). Additionally, rates of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (18 (35%) vs. 37 (21%), P = 0.02) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, 17 (33%) vs. 14 (7%), P = 0.001) were significantly different.

### Generlac [^111HUy1U]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Since Generlac Solution contains galactose (less than 1.6 g/15 mL) and lactose (less than 1.2 g/15 mL), it should be used with caution in diabetics. In the overall management of portal-systemic encephalopathy, it should be recognized that there is serious underlying liver disease with complications such as electrolyte disturbance (e.g. hypokalemia) for which other specific therapy may be required. Infants receiving lactulose may develop hyponatremia and dehydration.

- **Drug interactions**: There have been conflicting reports about the concomitant use of neomycin and lactulose solution. Theoretically, the elimination of certain colonic bacteria by neomycin and possibly other anti-infective agents may interfere with the desired degradation of lactulose and thus prevent the acidification of colonic contents. Thus, the status of the lactulose-treated patient should be closely monitored in the event of concomitant oral anti-infective therapy. Results of preliminary studies in humans and rats suggest that nonabsorbable antacids given concurrently with lactulose may inhibit the desired lactulose-induced drop in colonic pH. Therefore, a possible lack of desired effect of treatment should be taken into consideration before such drugs are given concomitantly with Generlac Solution. Other laxatives should not be used, especially during the initial phase of therapy for portal-systemic encephalopathy, because the loose stools resulting from their use may falsely suggest that adequate Generlac Solution dosage has been achieved.

### Branched-chain amino acids for people with hepatic encephalopathy [^115N61xT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a brain dysfunction characterized by neurological and psychiatric changes associated with liver insufficiency or portal-systemic shunting. The severity ranges from minor symptoms to coma. A Cochrane systematic review, which included 11 randomized clinical trials comparing branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) with control interventions, has evaluated the potential benefits of BCAA for people with hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of BCAA versus any control intervention for people with hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Search methods**: Trials were identified through manual and electronic searches in The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index (August 2015).

- **Selection criteria**: The review included randomized clinical trials irrespective of bias control, language, or publication status.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Authors independently extracted data from published reports and collected additional data from the primary investigators. In this review update, primary outcomes were revised to include mortality (all cause), hepatic encephalopathy (number of people without improved manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy), and adverse events. The analyses included random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses. Subgroup, sensitivity, regression, and trial sequential analyses were performed to evaluate sources of heterogeneity, including intervention, participant and trial characteristics, and bias, using The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group's methods.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution versus lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1148FdPL]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

In this meta-analysis, for the first time, the efficacy of polyethylene glycol (PEG) was reviewed compared with lactulose on HESA improvement, adverse effects, hospital stay, and serum ammonia concentration. It was found that PEG was superior to lactulose in the treatment of an acute episode of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), which could deliver clinical improvement in HESA score and reduce the length of stay (LOS) without increasing the incidence of adverse events. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in serum ammonia levels.

PEG is a nonabsorbable, nondigestible macromolecule that is not metabolized by colonic microflora, and it can be commonly used for colonoscopy preparation, causing osmotic diarrhea through osmotic and volumetric expansion in the colon. Although the use of nonabsorbable disaccharides for HE therapy has not yet been supported or refuted by sufficient evidence, lactulose has always been used for the catharsis of the gut mainly through creating an acidic environment in the gut which helps in the conversion of soluble ammonia (NH3) to insoluble ammonium ion (NH4+), thereby resulting in decreased systemic absorption from the gut. Compared with lactulose, PEG was found to be more effective in catharsis or relieving constipation. Similar results were found in this study, suggesting that bowel cleansing with PEG is an immediate, effective, rapid, and safe therapeutic strategy for patients with acute HE. This is because PEG electrolyte solution is a more powerful cathartic agent than lactulose and may prevent electrolyte disturbances to help promote the improvement of encephalopathy.

Quality evaluation

The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to assess quality. In general, the risk of bias was high for participants who were not blinded due to significant differences in dosage and taste between PEG and lactulose, but it was unclear or low for most items. It was difficult to achieve participant blindness to the trial. The risk of bias for the included studies is shown in Figure 2.

Synthesis of results

Primary outcomes: Improvement rate in HESA score

Five studies with a total of 288 patients compared PEG (n = 143) with lactulose (n = 145) in the early 24 hours of treatment. Based on the Mantel-Haenszel fixed mode, the use of PEG significantly increased the HESA score more than lactulose within 24 hours (RR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.26–1.68; P = 0.000; Fig. 3, Supplementary File 2: Fig. S2A, Supplemental Digital Content 1). Neither publication bias (Egger test P = 0.077 > 0.05; Supplementary File 2: Figs. S2B, S2C, Supplemental Digital Content 1) nor significant heterogeneity (χ^2 = 3.73, P = 0.444, I^2 = 0.0%; Supplementary File 2: Fig. S2A, Supplemental Digital Content 1) were found in the five studies.

### Lactulose vs polyethylene glycol 3350-electrolyte solution for treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy: the HELP randomized clinical trial [^111QdVSH]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common cause of hospitalization in patients with cirrhosis. Pharmacologic treatment for acute (overt) HE has remained the same for decades. This study's objective was to compare polyethylene glycol 3350-electrolyte solution (PEG) and lactulose treatments in patients with cirrhosis admitted to the hospital for HE. It was hypothesized that rapid catharsis of the gut using PEG may resolve HE more effectively than lactulose.

The HELP (Hepatic Encephalopathy: Lactulose vs Polyethylene Glycol 3350-Electrolyte Solution) study is a randomized clinical trial conducted in an academic tertiary hospital involving 50 patients with cirrhosis (of 186 screened) admitted for HE. Participants were block randomized to receive treatment with PEG, 4-L dose (n = 25), or standard-of-care lactulose (n = 25) during hospitalization.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary endpoint was an improvement of 1 or more in HE grade at 24 hours, determined using the hepatic encephalopathy scoring algorithm (HESA), which ranges from 0 (normal clinical and neuropsychological assessments) to 4 (coma). Secondary outcomes included time to HE resolution and overall length of stay.

A total of 25 patients were randomized to each treatment arm. Baseline clinical features at admission were similar in the groups. Thirteen of 25 patients in the standard therapy arm (52%) had an improvement of 1 or more in HESA score, thus meeting the primary outcome measure, compared with 21 of 23 evaluated patients receiving PEG (91%) (p < 0.01).

### Primary versus secondary psychosis in a patient with congenital liver disease [^117M4DXV]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

During the present medical admission, lactulose was increased to 20 mL four times daily and rifaximin was continued. Paliperidone was restarted by the psychiatry team at 3 mg and gradually increased to 9 mg daily. The rationale for starting paliperidone over other antipsychotics is that this second-generation antipsychotic, the primary active metabolite of risperidone, is metabolized and excreted solely by the kidney. No dosage adjustment is required for hepatic impairment. Moreover, studies have shown switching risperidone to paliperidone yields improvement of liver enzymes during drug-induced hepatitis or liver cirrhosis. However, it is important to mention that long-term treatment with paliperidone, like other second-generation antipsychotic medications, carries the risk of metabolic side effects and subsequent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, now referred to as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, which may adversely affect outcomes in patients with cirrhosis.

After eight days of management on the medical service, his hepatic function improved, ammonia level decreased, but psychosis persisted, necessitating transfer to inpatient psychiatry. While in the psychiatric unit, his psychotic symptoms gradually abated. Despite the notable reduction in psychotic symptoms, some negative symptoms (blunted affect, psychomotor slowing) and cognitive impairment (inattention, executive dysfunction) persisted. Due to the patient's extensive history of medication non-adherence, a collaborative decision was reached between the patient and the treatment team.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^115L9Xru]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

This systematic review shows an increasing body of evidence for the use of rifaximin in addition to lactulose, as well as for lactulose therapy alone, in the long-term management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). In line with the guidelines, this evidence supports the use of lactulose therapy as secondary prophylaxis for the prevention of recurrence of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) events over the long term. In addition, one study has shown the effectiveness of lactulose as primary prophylaxis in the prevention of long-term OHE occurrence. Although there is very little direct head-to-head evidence of rifaximin versus lactulose over the long term, there is considerable evidence to support recommendations for the use of rifaximin as an add-on treatment to standard lactulose therapy in the secondary prophylaxis setting.

In terms of effectiveness, several long-term, open-label clinical trials and clinical practice studies have shown that, when added to lactulose therapy, rifaximin significantly reduces the recurrence of OHE events and the rate of HE-related hospitalization, in comparison with lactulose therapy alone. An exception to this was a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted by Ali et al, in which rifaximin was found to be no better than placebo when combined with lactulose therapy as secondary prophylaxis against OHE recurrence. In discussing the potential reasons for the discrepancy in the findings of this trial compared with those of the phase III trial by Bass et al, the authors point out that the study populations differed in terms of primary etiology of cirrhosis.

### Generlac [^112c2uKb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For the prevention and treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy, including the stages of hepatic pre-coma and coma, controlled studies have shown that lactulose solution therapy reduces blood ammonia levels by 25 to 50%. This reduction is generally paralleled by an improvement in the patients' mental state and EEG patterns. The clinical response has been observed in about 75% of patients, which is at least as satisfactory as the results from neomycin therapy. An increase in patients' protein tolerance is also frequently observed with lactulose solution therapy. In the treatment of chronic portal-systemic encephalopathy, lactulose solution has been administered for over 2 years in controlled studies.

### Dispelling myths in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy [^1139Jmbj]. Lancet (2005). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy suggest ammonia reduction as the main focus, based on strategies to reduce ammonia's generation and absorption in the colon by using lactulose and a reduced protein diet.

Two studies provide compelling and provocative data questioning the relevance of these interventions. Bodils Als-Nielsen and colleagues, in a systematic review of randomized trials, found insufficient evidence about whether non-absorbable disaccharides are beneficial (BMJ 2004; 328: 1046–50). In a small randomized study, Juan Cordoba and colleagues showed that diets with normal protein content can be administered safely during episodic hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis and that protein restriction does not have any beneficial effect during such episodes (J Hepatol 2004; 41: 38–43).

Two approaches to new therapies for hepatic encephalopathy are needed. First, it is important to focus on the interorgan metabolism of ammonia. The small intestine and kidneys might be important producers of ammonia, and muscle is an important organ that can remove ammonia. Novel therapies targeting these organs reduce ammonia. Second, research is needed to explore factors other than ammonia that might be important in hepatic encephalopathy, including the synergistic role of inflammation. The lack of conclusive data about the efficacy of any treatment supports the view that placebo-controlled trials of newer agents are needed and ethical. The emphasis should shift to aggressive management of the precipitating event.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^111jwtPz]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Three large single-center, open-label, randomized, controlled studies have assessed the long-term (≥ 6 months) safety and tolerability of lactulose therapy, compared with placebo, probiotics, and/or no therapy.

In a primary prophylaxis study, patients with cirrhosis without previous history of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) were randomized to receive lactulose therapy (n = 60) or no lactulose therapy (n = 60) for 12 months. All patients treated with lactulose remained adherent to treatment. The most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) with lactulose included diarrhea, distaste to lactulose, and abdominal bloating, which improved following reduction of lactulose dosing.

In a secondary prophylaxis study, patients with cirrhosis who had recovered from OHE were randomized to receive lactulose (n = 68), probiotics (n = 64), or no therapy (n = 65) for up to 12 months. All lactulose patients remained adherent to treatment. AEs in the lactulose group included diarrhea, distaste to lactulose, and abdominal bloating. Lactulose dosing was reduced in these patients but not stopped. In the probiotics group, AEs included constipation and abdominal distension, which were managed with dietary advice and intermittent use of proton pump inhibitors. In the no therapy group, only constipation was reported, which was managed with dietary modifications.

Similar results were observed in another secondary prophylaxis study, where patients were randomized to receive lactulose or placebo over a median follow-up duration of 14 months. All patients remained adherent to lactulose therapy.
