## Question

Infliximab to treat Graves ophthalmopathy crisis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using infliximab to treat a Graves ophthalmopathy crisis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical definition of a "crisis" in thyroid eye disease (TED) and the standard of care in that setting. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological rationale for TNF-α blockade in TED. Next, I will review the actual clinical evidence for infliximab in TED. After that, I need to compare infliximab with evidence-based alternatives and guideline recommendations. I will then examine safety and regulatory considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise management algorithm and state when, if ever, infliximab might be considered, ensuring I don't overstate limited data [^115dvwDT] [^116sy9Yn].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: a Graves ophthalmopathy "crisis" implies sight-threatening TED, chiefly dysthyroid optic neuropathy (DON) and/or severe corneal exposure threatening integrity, where rapid suppression of orbital inflammation is crucial to avert permanent vision loss. Standard first-line therapy in this scenario is high-dose intravenous glucocorticoids, with prompt consideration of urgent orbital decompression if vision fails to improve, because delays can be vision-threatening. Wait, let me verify the hierarchy: IV methylprednisolone pulses are superior to oral regimens, and early decompression is indicated when DON does not promptly respond, which aligns with established reviews and guidelines [^116EKCa5] [^113dSf2T] [^115dvwDT] [^113TgKRQ].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology to see whether TNF-α blockade is mechanistically plausible. Orbital fibroblasts and infiltrating immune cells drive inflammation, adipogenesis, and glycosaminoglycan accumulation; cytokines including TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, and chemokines (e.g. CXCL9/11) are upregulated in active disease. Hold on, I should verify that TNF-α has been implicated experimentally: yes, stimulation with IFN-γ and TNF-α upregulates key chemokines in orbital cells, and transcriptomic data show inflammatory activation in GO adipose/connective tissue, supporting a theoretical rationale for TNF-α inhibition. But mechanistic plausibility is not equivalent to clinical efficacy, so I must not jump to conclusions here [^116BN2RP] [^117KFbeu] [^115zAPrV] [^112emHcR].

> Now, I will examine the clinical evidence for infliximab in TED. I initially recalled there might be small open-label trials, but wait, let me verify: there are no randomized controlled trials or robust prospective cohorts specific to infliximab in TED; available data are limited to small case reports and a very small case series of orbital inflammation that included thyroid-associated cases, showing transient suppression with relapse around week 5 and authors cautioning limited experience. Guidelines also note that tumor necrosis factor-α blockade has had limited efficacy in open-label studies and that evidence for TNF inhibitors in TED is anecdotal or indicates a lack of efficacy. I should double-check that expert consensus echoes this skepticism, which it does [^117MYJtb] [^116EKCa5] [^112M91Ei] [^116sy9Yn].

> I need to compare this with evidence-based alternatives when IV steroids are inadequate or contraindicated. Rituximab has conflicting RCT data but is considered a second-line option in experienced centers for active, moderate-to-severe disease refractory to intravenous glucocorticoids. Teprotumumab has robust randomized data in moderate-to-severe active TED and is endorsed as an option by consensus statements; tocilizumab also has supportive prospective data in steroid-refractory cases. For DON, if vision does not improve promptly with IV steroids, urgent decompression is the established limb-salvaging step. Let me verify adjunctive radiation: randomized data are mixed, with no consistent benefit on proptosis and soft tissue outcomes compared with sham, and optic neuropathy populations were generally excluded, so radiation is not a substitute in a crisis. This hierarchy clearly places infliximab far behind proven options [^115dvwDT] [^116sy9Yn] [^115vHEM6] [^112B3RNM] [^113dSf2T] [^112fY2rh].

> I will now examine safety and risk–benefit, because in a crisis, even a plausible mechanism might be unacceptable if risks are high and benefits unproven. Infliximab carries serious risks: severe infections including TB and HBV reactivation, malignancy signals in controlled trial portions, infusion and delayed hypersensitivity reactions (including serum sickness–like events upon re-exposure), demyelinating disease (notably optic neuritis), hepatic injury including autoimmune hepatitis, and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events around infusion. Hold on, I should verify the specific warnings relevant to a sight-threatening eye scenario: the potential for demyelination/optic neuritis is particularly concerning in an optic neuropathy context, and the risk of serious infections is compounded if high-dose steroids are co-administered. Given the absence of high-quality efficacy data in TED and these well-characterized risks, the benefit–risk calculus for infliximab in a crisis is unfavorable [^112gF2X3] [^111KRSf8] [^1176b1YP] [^1128AyHi].

> I should confirm the regulatory and guideline status to ensure I'm not missing a niche endorsement. Infliximab is not approved for TED; its approved uses include RA, IBD, psoriatic disease, and spondyloarthropathies. Major TED guidance does not recommend TNF-α inhibitors; EUGOGO emphasizes IV steroids first-line, with rituximab as a potential second-line in expert centers, while ATA/ETA consensus highlights teprotumumab, rituximab, tocilizumab, and mycophenolate among considered options and explicitly notes the questionable role of TNF inhibitors due to anecdotal or negative evidence. Let me reconsider whether any guideline carves out a role in steroid-refractory DON; none do, and surgical decompression remains standard if vision fails to improve rapidly [^115dvwDT] [^116sy9Yn] [^112M91Ei].

> Translating this into a practical crisis algorithm: for sight-threatening TED, initiate high-dose IV methylprednisolone promptly, re-evaluate vision urgently, and proceed to urgent orbital decompression without delay if DON does not rapidly improve; in steroid-refractory active disease without immediate decompression needs, consider teprotumumab where available, rituximab in experienced hands, or tocilizumab as supported by prospective data. Wait, let me verify I'm not omitting radiation's place: given mixed RCT results and exclusion of DON, radiation is not a definitive solution in a crisis; it may be adjunctive in selected scenarios but should not delay decompression where indicated. In all cases, smoking cessation, euthyroid status, and multidisciplinary co-management are essential and should be optimized concurrently [^116EKCa5] [^115dvwDT] [^113dSf2T] [^112B3RNM] [^115vHEM6] [^116sy9Yn].

> But wait, what if all standard medical and surgical options have failed or are contraindicated? Even then, I need to ensure we do not overstep evidence. Infliximab should be considered, if at all, only within a clinical trial or a highly controlled, last-resort, multidisciplinary context after thorough counseling about uncertain efficacy and well-documented risks, with mandatory pre-treatment screening for latent TB and HBV and careful planning around concurrent immunosuppression. I should double-check that dosing from other indications should not be extrapolated as evidence-based for TED; RA or IBD regimens exist but do not constitute validated TED therapy and should not be used to justify off-label dosing in a crisis without data, which reinforces the trial-only stance [^112gF2X3] [^112uC7jP] [^111UgybE].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure the recommendation is clear and proportionate to the evidence. Despite a plausible TNF-α–based mechanism, there are no randomized data and only minimal, low-quality clinical experience with infliximab in TED, while guidelines question or discourage TNF-α inhibitors due to limited or negative evidence. In a vision-threatening TED crisis, do not delay proven therapy; use high-dose IV glucocorticoids with rapid escalation to urgent decompression as indicated, and employ evidence-supported biologics (teprotumumab, rituximab, tocilizumab) in appropriate, steroid-refractory contexts. Infliximab should not be used routinely and, if contemplated after exhaustion of established options, should be restricted to clinical trials with meticulous risk mitigation and shared decision-making [^116EKCa5] [^115dvwDT] [^116sy9Yn] [^112M91Ei].

---

Infliximab is **not recommended** for Graves ophthalmopathy crisis due to **limited evidence** and **significant risks** [^112M91Ei]. Current guidelines **do not support its use**; consider it only in rare, refractory cases when standard therapies fail and other biologics are unavailable. Infliximab has not shown consistent benefit in GO and carries risks of serious infections [^112gF2X3], infusion reactions [^1128AyHi], and malignancy [^111KRSf8]. First-line treatment remains **high-dose intravenous glucocorticoids**, with rituximab [^115vHEM6], tocilizumab [^112B3RNM], or teprotumumab as preferred second-line options.

---

## Pathophysiological rationale for infliximab use in GO

GO is driven by autoimmune inflammation with **TNF-α as a key cytokine** [^117KFbeu]; TNF-α promotes orbital fibroblast activation, glycosaminoglycan production, and tissue edema [^116BN2RP], contributing to proptosis, diplopia, and optic neuropathy. Infliximab, a chimeric anti–TNF-α antibody, is hypothesized to reduce orbital inflammation and tissue remodeling by neutralizing TNF-α [^114iZ7de].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting infliximab use in GO

Evidence for infliximab in GO is limited to small case series and anecdotal reports, with no robust RCTs [^112M91Ei]. A small retrospective series (n = 5) [^117MYJtb] reported symptom relief in orbital inflammation, including thyroid-associated orbital inflammation; however, effects were transient, with symptoms recurring around week 5 post-infusion. Another report described initial improvement in autoimmune lymphocytic hypophysitis [^114ZVwdR] with infliximab, but relapse occurred, necessitating rituximab for sustained remission. Overall, **evidence is insufficient** to support routine use in GO.

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

High-dose intravenous glucocorticoids (IVGCs) are **first-line** for moderate-to-severe active GO, with established efficacy in reducing inflammation and preventing vision loss. Rituximab [^115vHEM6], tocilizumab [^112B3RNM], and teprotumumab are preferred second-line options with demonstrated efficacy in steroid-resistant GO [^115dvwDT]. Current guidelines do not recommend infliximab due to limited evidence and safety concerns [^112M91Ei].

---

## Safety profile and potential risks

Infliximab **carries significant risks**, including:

- **Serious infections**: Reactivation of latent tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and opportunistic infections [^112gF2X3].
- **Infusion reactions**: Anaphylaxis, serum sickness–like reactions, and delayed hypersensitivity [^1128AyHi] [^1176b1YP].
- **Malignancy**: Increased risk of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly with prolonged use [^111KRSf8].
- **Autoimmune reactions**: Drug-induced lupus and other autoimmune phenomena [^112gF2X3].

These risks are **substantial**, particularly in immunocompromised patients or those with comorbidities [^112gF2X3].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the American Thyroid Association (ATA), European Thyroid Association (ETA), and European Group on Graves' Orbitopathy (EUGOGO) [^115dvwDT] do **not recommend infliximab** for GO. Rituximab, tocilizumab, and teprotumumab are preferred second-line options for steroid-resistant GO. It is generally omitted from recommended regimens because of limited evidence and safety concerns [^112M91Ei].

---

## Patient selection criteria and clinical scenarios

Given the limited evidence and significant risks, infliximab should **only be considered in rare, refractory cases** in which standard therapies (IVGCs, rituximab, tocilizumab, teprotumumab) have failed or are contraindicated. Careful patient selection and close monitoring are essential [^114Xzver].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up protocols

If infliximab is used, **strict monitoring is required**, including:

- **Baseline screening**: Tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and other infections [^112gF2X3].
- **Regular monitoring**: Clinical activity score (CAS), visual acuity, proptosis measurements, and adverse events [^116sy9Yn].
- **Laboratory monitoring**: Liver function tests, complete blood count, and inflammatory markers.
- **Imaging**: Orbital MRI or CT to assess disease progression and response.

---

## Long-term outcomes and relapse rates

Long-term outcomes and relapse rates with infliximab in GO are **unknown** due to limited data. Available reports suggest transient benefits with frequent relapses, indicating limited sustained efficacy [^117MYJtb] [^116uJRcX].

---

## Cost-effectiveness considerations

Infliximab is expensive and requires intravenous administration, which increases healthcare costs. Given limited evidence of efficacy and significant safety concerns, its cost-effectiveness in GO is **questionable** compared to established therapies.

---

Infliximab is **not recommended** for Graves ophthalmopathy crisis due to limited evidence and significant risks. Consider it only in rare, refractory cases when standard therapies fail and other biologics are unavailable [^115dvwDT].

In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-blocking agents, including infliximab products, more malignancies (excluding lymphoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer [NMSC]) have been observed in patients receiving those TNF-blockers compared with control patients. During the controlled portions of infliximab trials in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and plaque psoriasis, 14 patients were diagnosed with malignancies (excluding lymphoma and NMSC) among 4,019 infliximab-treated patients versus 1 among 1,597 control patients, with a rate of 0.52/100 patient-years among infliximab-treated patients versus a rate of 0.11/100 patient-years among control patients. The median duration of follow-up was 0.5 years for infliximab-treated patients and 0.4 years for control patients. The most common malignancies were breast, colorectal, and melanoma. The rate of malignancies among infliximab-treated patients was similar to that expected in the general population, whereas the rate in control patients was lower than expected.

In a clinical trial exploring the use of infliximab in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, the majority of lung or head and neck origin, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients had a history of heavy smoking [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Prescribers should exercise caution when considering the use of Renflexis in patients.

Regarding medical management for thyroid eye disease, more specifically with respect to management of moderate-to-severe orbitopathy, second-line therapy, EUGOGO 2021 guidelines recommend to consider administering rituximab as a second-line therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe and active Graves' orbitopathy of recent onset (< 12 months) if refractory to IV corticosteroids, as long dysthyroid optic neuropathy is excluded. Administer rituximab only in experienced centers that can manage potentially serious adverse events.

### Management of thyroid eye disease: A consensus statement by the American Thyroid Association and the European Thyroid Association [^114Xzver]. Thyroid (2022). High credibility.

Thyroid eye disease (TED) is an autoimmune condition closely related to Graves' disease. It is characterized by endomysial interstitial edema, expansion, and proliferation of cells within the fibrofatty compartment. This results in the clinical manifestations of periorbital edema, lid retraction, proptosis, diplopia, corneal breakdown, and, in rare cases, optic nerve compression. TED remains challenging for clinicians to evaluate and manage. Novel therapies have recently emerged, and their specific roles are still being determined.

Most patients with TED develop eye disease while being treated for hyperthyroidism under the care of endocrinologists. Endocrinologists, therefore, have a key role in diagnosis, initial management, and the selection of patients who require referral to specialist care. Given that the need for guidance to endocrinologists charged with meeting the needs of patients with TED transcends national borders, and to maximize an international exchange of knowledge and practices, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and European Thyroid Association (ETA) joined forces to produce this consensus statement (CS).

The scope was to address clinical assessment, develop criteria for referral to specialty care and treatment, and focus on medical and surgical treatment in nonpregnant adults (age ≥ 18 years) with TED. This CS is primarily aimed at endocrinologists, particularly those involved in the management of nonpregnant adult (> 18 years) patients with TED. A CS was selected as the forum, rather than a clinical practice guideline, to provide

### Renflexis [^1176b1YP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Infliximab products have been associated with hypersensitivity reactions that vary in their time of onset, and some cases have required hospitalization. Most hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, urticaria, dyspnea, and/or hypotension, have occurred during or within two hours of infusion.

However, serum sickness-like reactions have been observed in patients after initial therapy with infliximab products (i.e. as early as after the second dose) and when therapy with infliximab products was reinstituted after an extended period without treatment. Symptoms associated with these reactions include fever, rash, headache, sore throat, myalgias, polyarthralgias, hand and facial edema, and/or dysphagia. These reactions were associated with a marked increase in antibodies to infliximab products, loss of detectable serum concentrations of infliximab products, and possible loss of drug efficacy.

Renflexis should be discontinued for severe hypersensitivity reactions. Medications for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. acetaminophen, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and/or epinephrine) should be available for immediate use in the event of a reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and psoriasis clinical trials, re-administration of infliximab following a period without treatment resulted in a higher incidence of infusion reactions relative to regular maintenance treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Medical management of extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves disease [^115B7Yt2]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

To review preventive measures and the medical management of extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves disease, as well as to provide an overview of potential immune therapies, a literature review was conducted on investigative trials of treatments for Graves disease and its extrathyroidal manifestations.

Given new knowledge of the stages of the autoimmune cascade responsible for the development of these extrathyroidal manifestations, the possibility has been raised of performing randomized trials of agents shown to provide benefits in other immune conditions. Two randomized trials on the efficacy of rituximab in moderate-to-severe Graves ophthalmopathy have reported conflicting results.

Additional studies of rituximab and other agents are needed before they become routinely used in treating Graves disease. Meanwhile, the standard medical therapy for moderate-to-severe ophthalmopathy is intravenous (IV) or oral corticosteroids and, for dermopathy, local corticosteroid application with occlusive dressing. Because major adverse effects such as life-threatening hepatic failure can occur with very high doses of IV prednisolone, the cumulative total dose should not exceed 8 g.

### Does autoimmunity against thyroglobulin play a role in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy: a review [^112emHcR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The orbital reactions in patients with Graves' disease are complex, involving antibodies and T lymphocytes, as well as other mononuclear cells, homing receptors on orbital cells, and cytokines. Moreover, we must determine why it is that only approximately 50% of patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism develop ophthalmopathy. Environmental and genetic factors will play a role, an example being the presence of a recently shown informative single nucleotide polymorphism in the CASQ1 gene, which is linked to ophthalmopathy. Smoking is well recognized as a major risk factor for ophthalmopathy, and stress is likely to play an important role in its initiation. In conclusion, it does seem appropriate to give serious attention to the possibility that the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy is not just about the TSH receptor but involves contributions from thyroglobulin and other thyroid antigens as well.

### Autoimmunity and Graves' disease [^115esrNF]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment options for Graves' hyperthyroidism and the related ophthalmopathy (GO) are not uniformly effective and carry potentially serious side effects. As a result, efforts have been focused on the development of novel therapies. Progress has been made, particularly in the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) antagonists, as either monoclonal blocking antibodies or small-molecule ligands. In addition, rituximab (RTX) is the first targeted biological therapy to be studied as treatment for these conditions.

The dosage of infliximab IV for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in adults, specifically in cases that are severely active, acute, and unresponsive to conventional therapy, is administered as follows:

- **Initial phase**: Start at 5 mg/kg IV every 2–4 weeks over at least 2 hours at weeks 0, 2, and 6.
- **Maintenance phase**: Continue with 5 mg/kg IV every 8 weeks.

Measurement of TRAb is useful both as a diagnostic and prognostic tool and can help inform shared decision-making regarding the optimal therapy choice in Graves' thyrotoxicosis. High TRAbs suggest a greater likelihood of recurrence, but an individual may value the opportunity to avoid long‐term medication despite this; these data suggest that chance is approximately 50% in those who complete a course of ATD.

Clinical response

In Study RA I, all doses and schedules of infliximab+MTX resulted in improvement in signs and symptoms as measured by the American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR 20), with a higher percentage of patients achieving an ACR 20, 50, and 70 compared to placebo+MTX. This improvement was observed at Week 2 and maintained through Week 102. Greater effects on each component of the ACR 20 were observed in all patients treated with infliximab+MTX compared to placebo+MTX. More patients treated with infliximab reached a major clinical response than placebo-treated patients.

In Study RA II, after 54 weeks of treatment, both doses of infliximab+MTX resulted in statistically significantly greater response in signs and symptoms compared to MTX alone, as measured by the proportion of patients achieving ACR 20, 50, and 70 responses. More patients treated with infliximab reached a major clinical response than placebo-treated patients.

### Orbital radiation for Graves ophthalmopathy: A report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology [^112fY2rh]. Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

To investigate whether orbital radiation offers effective and safe treatment for Graves ophthalmopathy, medical literature databases were searched to identify all published reports relating to orbital radiation treatment for this condition. To be included in the technology assessment, reports had to provide original data, report on a case series or uncontrolled trial of at least 100 subjects or a randomized clinical trial of any size, focus on orbital radiation for the treatment of Graves ophthalmopathy, and follow-up patients for at least three months. Abstracted data included study characteristics, patient characteristics, treatment response, and safety information.

Fourteen studies were included in the technology assessment: five observational studies and nine randomized controlled trials.

- **Observational studies**: Three of the studies reported on treatment response, revealing overall favorable outcomes for 40% to 97% of patients. Additionally, three studies provided intermediate-term safety data. The risk of definite radiation retinopathy is 1% to 2% within 10 years after treatment. Patients treated with orbital radiation did not have an increased risk of secondary malignancy or premature death.

- **Randomized controlled trials**: The nine randomized trials were qualitatively heterogeneous. Patients with optic neuropathy generally were excluded from participating in the randomized trials. Three of the randomized trials were sham-controlled, but none showed that orbital radiation was more efficacious than sham irradiation for improving proptosis, lid fissure, or soft tissues.

### Overexpression of immediate early genes in active Graves' ophthalmopathy [^115zAPrV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

In Graves' ophthalmopathy, a major problem is an increase in the intraorbital adipose tissue volume. The aim of this work was to define mechanisms of orbital adipogenesis. This was an open-label prospective study, conducted at the Clinic of Endocrinology, University Hospital. The study consisted of patients (n = 5) with severe ophthalmopathy affecting the optic nerve and thyroid-healthy controls (n = 5). We performed lateral decompression of orbital tissue in patients unresponsive to corticosteroids and restorative surgery of the upper eyelid in thyroid-healthy controls.

We made large-scale measurements of gene expression using a microarray technique based on the determination of fluorescence intensities in cases and controls. A marker of adipose tissue, stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase, was overexpressed in ophthalmopathy, and selection criteria were set to favor the identification of genes known to be expressed in normal adipogenesis. The immediate early gene, cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer, 61 (CYR61), was overexpressed in addition to 15 other immediate early genes (IEGs), and the expression of selected IEGs was confirmed with RT-PCR: CYR61, cyclooxygenase-2, dual-specificity phosphatase 1, B cell translocation gene 2, and early growth response 1. CYR61-responsive genes, known to participate in inflammation, such as IL-1beta, matrix metalloproteinase-3, and vascular endothelial growth factor, were also overexpressed.

### Does autoimmunity against thyroglobulin play a role in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy: a review [^111S41QU]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

While most authors believe that autoimmunity against the TSH receptor expressed in the orbital connective tissue cells is the main reaction leading to the development of ophthalmopathy in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism, an older hypothesis that deserves fresh consideration is based on the notion that thyroglobulin (Tg) in the thyroid gland migrates retrogradely to the orbit. Here, it is recognized by Tg autoantibodies, leading to inflammation. We review new evidence that supports a role of Tg and propose a new hypothesis based on the idea that Tg is targeted in the orbit, initiating a complex cascade of reactions that result in Graves' ophthalmopathy.

### Management of Graves' ophthalmopathy [^113dSf2T]. Nature Clinical Practice. Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Management of Graves' ophthalmopathy is preferably done in a multidisciplinary setting. Smoking is associated with worse disease outcomes. (131)I therapy for hyperthyroidism can also worsen ophthalmopathy, especially if administered during active disease or to patients who smoke, have severe hyperthyroidism, or those with high levels of TSH-receptor-binding inhibitory immunoglobulins. Coadministration of steroids and (131)I therapy is recommended for such high-risk patients. (131)I therapy is safe for patients with inactive Graves' ophthalmopathy. Subtotal thyroidectomy and antithyroid drugs show no benefit or harm to eye changes. There is no good evidence that total thyroid ablation has additional benefit. Artificial teardrops, dark glasses, and prisms are very helpful. Dysthyroid optic neuropathy is best treated with intravenous pulsed methylprednisolone; if visual functions do not recover, urgent surgical decompression is indicated. A wait-and-see policy is recommended in mild Graves' ophthalmopathy because the natural history of this condition reveals a tendency to resolve spontaneously.

Active, moderately severe Graves' ophthalmopathy qualifies for immunosuppression: intravenous pulsed methylprednisolone is more efficacious and has fewer side effects than oral steroids. Once the disease is inactive, rehabilitative surgery has much to offer. Quality of life is seriously limited in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy and remains restricted even after all treatments. Consequently, there is an urgent need for improved treatment modalities, and antibody therapy has shown potential in preliminary studies.

### Efficacy of anti-thyroid medications in patients with Graves' disease [^111uQVt6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Out of 227 patients diagnosed with Graves' Disease (GD) during the study period, 189 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The majority of the study sample (72%) was female, with ages ranging from 18 to 80 years. Approximately 71.3% of the study sample had mild Graves' ophthalmopathy. The TRAb titer ranged from 0.9 to 36 IU/L. The median thyroid uptake on the 99mTc-pertechnetate scan was 10.0 (4.20, 16.69), consistent with GD diagnosis. The median follow-up period for patients was 22.0 months (9, 36).

All patients, except one, were treated with methimazole, with a median initial dose of 15 mg (10, 20), adjusted gradually as per the treating endocrinologist's discretion.

- **Clinical characteristics of the study sample**:
	- IQR: interquartile range
	- SD: standard deviation
	- ATDs: anti-thyroid drugs
	- Reference normal range free T4: 9–19 pmol/L
	- Reference normal range free T3: 2.9–4.9 pmol/L
	- Reference normal range of thyroid uptake on 99mTc-pertechnetate scan: 1–4%
	- Reference normal value TSH receptor antibodies level: < 1.8 IU/L

### Renflexis [^115RPWTX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In Study RA I, all doses and schedules of infliximab combined with methotrexate (MTX) resulted in improvement in signs and symptoms as measured by the American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR 20), with a higher percentage of patients achieving ACR 20, 50, and 70, compared to placebo plus MTX (Table 7). This improvement was observed at Week 2 and maintained through Week 102. Greater effects on each component of the ACR 20 were observed in all patients treated with infliximab + MTX compared to placebo + MTX. More patients treated with infliximab reached a major clinical response than placebo-treated patients.

In Study RA II, after 54 weeks of treatment, both doses of infliximab + MTX resulted in statistically significantly greater responses in signs and symptoms compared to MTX alone, as measured by the proportion of patients achieving ACR 20, 50, and 70 responses. More patients treated with infliximab reached a major clinical response than those given a placebo.

### Rationale of treatment in Graves ophthalmopathy [^1159rXrm]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Graves ophthalmopathy is a chronic and multisystem disorder caused by an autoimmune process, characterized by the presence of antibodies that stimulate a general fibroblastic reaction involving the thyroid gland, lower extremities, and orbital fat tissue and muscles. The clinical findings and therapies for the treatment of exophthalmos, such as changes in extrinsic eye motility, diplopia, optic nerve involvement, and lid retraction, were analyzed. Various types of surgical treatments currently available for Graves ophthalmopathy were evaluated to choose the best option for treating each case.

The surgical techniques included transpalpebral decompression by removal of intraorbital fat, three-wall osseous expansion, and zygomatic osteotomy. Adjunctive procedures involved lengthening of the levator muscle of the upper eyelid, the retractor of the lower eyelid (if necessary), and surgery of the extrinsic muscles to correct diplopia. These techniques were useful in treating the disease, which is characterized by chronic evolution and, at times, a "malignant" outcome. A total of 39 orbits were treated using different techniques of decompression and secondary adjunctive procedures. Results were analyzed following a minimum 6-month follow-up. It was evident that surgery greatly reduced the degree of exophthalmos and improved eye motility, diplopia, and visual acuity.

Close cooperation among a team of specialists, including an endocrinologist, ophthalmologist, neuroradiologist, surgeon, anesthesiologist, and radiotherapist, is essential for managing and quantifying treatment outcomes.

### Current concepts regarding Graves' orbitopathy [^114iZ7de]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Recent years have witnessed the development of novel therapies targeting different crucial steps/sites for Graves' orbitopathy (GO) development: B cells as antigen-presenting cells and autoantibody producers (rituximab), IGF-1R (teprotumumab), and IL-6 receptor (tocilizumab). The results are certainly promising for some drugs more than for others, but they need to be corroborated by larger studies. Given the complexity of the autoimmune orbital process, other biological agents such as tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, belimumab) interfering with a cytokine cascade might prove to be effective.

Iscalimab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD40 (found on the surface of antigen-presenting cells and thyrocytes), interrupts CD40 interaction with its ligand (CD154) and thereby abates the autoimmune response. It was used in a phase II study of 15 Graves' patients, resulting in normalization of thyroid status and a decrease in serum TSHR-Ab levels in 47%. In view of its mechanism of action, this agent might in the future prove beneficial for GO as well.

### Advances in treatment of active, moderate-to-severe Graves' ophthalmopathy [^116EKCa5]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Graves' ophthalmopathy is defined as autoimmune inflammation of extraocular muscles and orbital fat or connective tissue, usually in patients with Graves' disease. About one in 20 patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism has moderate-to-severe Graves' ophthalmopathy. Corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment, but new evidence about immune mechanisms has provided a basis to explore other drug classes.

- **Treatment comparison**: Intravenous methylprednisolone pulses are more effective and better tolerated than oral prednisone in the treatment of active, moderate-to-severe Graves' ophthalmopathy. Rituximab has also been suggested as a possible replacement for intravenous corticosteroids. Two randomized controlled trials of rituximab reached seemingly contradictory conclusions — rituximab was not better with respect to the primary outcome (clinical activity score) than placebo in one trial (which, however, was confounded by rather long Graves' ophthalmopathy duration) but was slightly better than intravenous methylprednisolone pulses in the other (disease flare-ups occurred only in the latter group). On the basis of evidence published so far, rituximab cannot replace intravenous methylprednisolone pulses, but could have a role in corticosteroid-resistant cases.

- **Alternative treatments**: Open-label studies of tumor-necrosis-factor-α blockade had limited efficacy, but other studies showed that interleukin-6 receptor antibodies were effective. Results of randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of the IGF-1 receptor antibody teprotumumab and the interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab are expected shortly.

### Glucocorticoids in Graves' orbitopathy: mechanisms of action and clinical application [^116BN2RP]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is the most common extra-thyroidal manifestation of autoimmune Graves' disease (GD). The prevalence of GO among patients with GD varies widely from 13% to 69% across different series. The incidence of GO is 3 cases per 100,000 males and 16 cases per 100,000 females in the United States (US). Most GO patients demonstrate extraocular muscle enlargement and expansion of orbital adipose/connective tissue. The increased orbital tissue volume and elevated intra-orbital pressure cause mechanical changes, which explain most of the signs and symptoms in GO.

- **Pathological processes**: The pathological processes within the orbit include inflammatory infiltration of retro-ocular tissues, de novo adipogenesis, and increased production of hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans (GAG) by orbital fibroblasts. These fibroblasts play a key role in the pathogenesis of GO. They proliferate and differentiate into myofibroblasts and adipocytes and produce excessive hydrophilic GAG, which leads to tissue edema. Orbital fibroblasts express the thyrotropin receptor (TSH-R) and are stimulated by circulating TSH-R autoantibodies (Ab). Functional stimulatory TSH-R-Ab are the specific biomarker of GO, closely correlating with disease activity and severity.

- **Interaction and inflammation**: Active interaction of orbital fibroblasts with mononuclear cells and production of different chemoattractants and cytokines lead to the perpetuation of orbital inflammation. The two key autoantigens, TSH-R and insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), are expressed on the surface of target orbital cells of GO patients. They form a complex network contributing to disease pathology.

### What to do for moderate-to-severe and active Graves' orbitopathy if glucocorticoids fail [^113TgKRQ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment of Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is a major challenge, and the outcome of medical therapy is unsatisfactory in about one-third of cases. Glucocorticoids are the first-line therapy for moderate-to-severe and active GO, more commonly given through the intravenous route. Uncertainty remains as to the best therapeutic approach when the initial glucocorticoid treatment provides an incomplete response or no response. The choice largely depends on personal experience because of the limited evidence in this field. In the author's view, if a first course of glucocorticoids provides a suboptimal response, a second course of intravenous (or oral) glucocorticoids associated with orbital radiotherapy should be given. An alternative might be represented by oral glucocorticoids associated with cyclosporine. The use of biological agents, with the most promising being rituximab, is for the time being experimental and warrants support from randomized clinical trials.

### Combined immunosuppressants and less steroids in active Graves' orbitopathy [^1123ZRqg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

Steroid therapy in Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is first-line treatment but has limitations, as it is potentially harmful at high doses and often refused by patients. A steroid-sparing therapy is a reasonable option as long as it is rapidly effective and devoid of long-term adverse reactions. Combined immunosuppressive therapy must be studied in randomized clinical trials designed to test efficacy and the potentially increased risk of side effects.

### Comparative effectiveness of various orbital decompression techniques in treating thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ovwoN]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), an organ-specific autoimmune disorder, is the most prevalent adult orbital disease. TAO, also named Graves' orbitopathy and Graves' ophthalmopathy, is the most frequent extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease. It is characterized by the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the retrobulbar and periorbital tissues, leading to a range of symptoms, including eyelid retraction, edema of the periorbital tissues and conjunctivae, exophthalmos, ocular surface irritation symptoms such as grittiness and watering, and the occurrence of restrictive strabismus and diplopia caused by the involvement of the extraocular muscles. In cases of severe disease progression, TAO can lead to vision-threatening conditions such as exposure keratopathy and dysthyroid optic neuropathy (DON), which can result in irreversible vision loss and potential disfigurement, significantly impacting the patient's quality of life and mental well-being.

Depending on the activity and severity of TAO, treatment options include drug therapy, orbital radiotherapy, surgery, or a combination. Surgical interventions for TAO include orbital decompression, strabismus correction, and blepharoplasty. Among these, orbital decompression surgery stands out as the cornerstone of surgical rehabilitation. The orbital walls are divided into four segments: medial, lateral, orbital roof, and floor. Owing to suboptimal outcomes and the potential for severe intracranial complications, the excision of the orbital roof is not commonly favored. Orbital decompression is accomplished by targeting other segments.

### Aesthetic refinements in the treatment of Graves ophthalmopathy [^116mZWyA]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Graves ophthalmopathy is a chronic, multisystem autoimmune disorder characterized by increased volume of intraorbital fat and hypertrophic extraocular muscles. Proptosis, impaired ocular motility, diplopia, lid retraction, and impaired visual acuity are treated with orbit decompression and fat reduction. The authors present the addition of skeletal augmentation to further improve periorbital aesthetics.

- **Methods**: Through a transconjunctival with lateral canthotomy incision, a balanced orbital decompression was executed, removing medial and lateral walls and medial floor. Intraorbital fat was excised. All patients underwent placement of porous polyethylene infraorbital rim implants and midface soft-tissue elevation, increasing inferior orbital rim projection and improving the globe-cheek relationship. From 2009 to 2012, 13 patients (11 female and two male; 26 eyes) with Graves ophthalmopathy underwent surgery at two institutions. Outcomes were evaluated for improvements of proptosis, diplopia, dry eye symptoms, and cosmetic satisfaction.

- **Results**: Postoperative follow-up ranged from 0.5 to 3 years (median, 1.5 years). The mean improvement on Hertel exophthalmometry was 5.4 mm. Diplopia resolved in three patients (23 percent). No patients had worsening diplopia, and 12 (92 percent) discontinued use of eye lubricants. All patients had cosmetic satisfaction. One patient suffered temporary inferior orbital nerve paresthesia. There were no infections, hematomas, or ocular complications.

- **Conclusions**: Skeletal augmentation is a useful adjunct to orbital decompression.

### Efficacy of anti-thyroid medications in patients with Graves' disease [^115aKU4S]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) level is known to predict clinical and biochemical outcomes among patients with Graves' disease (GD) treated with anti-thyroid drugs (ATD). The American Thyroid Association and European Thyroid Association recommend measuring TRAb at the end of the treatment period and before stopping ATD to guide the decision of whether to discontinue ATD, prolong low-dose ATD, or proceed with definitive therapy, such as radioactive iodine (RAI) or surgery.

We found that remission rate was inversely related to the initial TRAb level; thus, a lower TRAb level was observed in patients who achieved remission than in those who did not. In addition, we established that remission was achieved more often among females, patients with low baseline free T4, and patients with mild Graves' ophthalmopathy. These findings are, to an extent, consistent with previous studies. Karmisholt et al. determined that patients with higher free T4 and TRAb levels upon diagnosis were less likely to experience remission; however, there was no difference in the likelihood of remission based on gender or eye disease status. In contrast, Song et al. found that only the free T4 level at diagnosis predicts remission. Zuhur et al. observed that females achieved sustained remission more often than males did. Similar to this study, previous studies have associated Graves' ophthalmopathy severity and remission rates with ATD.

In Study RA I, all doses and schedules of infliximab + MTX resulted in improvement in signs and symptoms as measured by the American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR 20), with a higher percentage of patients achieving an ACR 20, 50, and 70 compared to placebo + MTX. This improvement was observed at Week 2 and maintained through Week 102. Greater effects on each component of the ACR 20 were observed in all patients treated with infliximab + MTX compared to placebo + MTX. More patients treated with infliximab reached a major clinical response than placebo-treated patients.

In Study RA II, after 54 weeks of treatment, both doses of infliximab + MTX resulted in statistically significantly greater responses in signs and symptoms compared to MTX alone, as measured by the proportion of patients achieving ACR 20, 50, and 70 responses. More patients treated with infliximab reached a major clinical response than placebo-treated patients.

### Ethical and sociocultural challenges in managing dead bodies during epidemics and natural disasters [^11158Ygy]. BMJ Global Health (2021). Low credibility.

The literature discusses the significance surrounding death, particularly the role of religious and cultural practices following a death. There are differences in funeral rites that influence the care of the dead body and have significant social and psychological importance for the families of the deceased, allowing them to mourn their loved ones.

For many practicing Muslims, burial is stipulated to happen within 24 hours. For many Christians, there is not such rigid adherence to a time frame. Christian burials often take place weeks after the death, accompanied by a wake to pay respect to the dead.

There are many instances, however, when due to restrictive policies, the chaos of a crisis, or an overwhelming number of dead bodies, it is impossible to perform the rites required by the religion or culture despite all efforts. This, in turn, aggravates the trauma for the families, who become distressed that their loved ones have not been treated respectfully. Sumathipala et al. report that neither collective nor individual religious rites were performed for the dead buried in mass graves in Sri Lanka following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. To maintain the dignity of the body, policymakers were mandated to cover each cadaver in white cloth if a casket was not available.

### Rituximab for thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy [^115vHEM6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is the most frequent extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease, affecting up to 50% of patients, and has a significant impact on quality of life. Rituximab (RTX) is a human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 receptor on B-lymphocytes. Preliminary work has shown that blocking this CD20 receptor with RTX may affect the clinical course of TAO by reducing inflammation and the degree of proptosis.

- **Objectives**: This review update, originally published in 2013, assesses the efficacy and safety of using RTX for the treatment of TAO.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2022, Issue 2), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS), and the ISRCTN registry.

### Ten year outcome of anti-thyroid drug treatment for first episode Graves' thyrotoxicosis: The predictive importance of TRAb [^111RpCPV]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

Anti-thyroid drugs (ATDs) are safe and effective in promptly restoring euthyroidism in people with Graves' thyrotoxicosis. Treatment is typically administered for a 12–18 month period, but recurrence following withdrawal is common, approximately 50% in Europe and up to 80% in North America. TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) are elevated at diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in approximately 97% of people with Graves' disease. In addition to their role in establishing the diagnosis of Graves' disease, TRAb has been associated with predicting the risk of recurrence following withdrawal of ATD, as well as the risk of radioiodine treatment failure.

Other features associated with increased risk for recurrence include younger age, large goitre size, male sex, orbitopathy, and cigarette smoking, although there is significant variability in the published evidence. Previous studies have not necessarily been consistent in assessing people who have completed a physician-directed course of ATD (with planned cessation), and most studies have been limited by extremely short follow-up (typically 1–2 years). This study sought to report the natural history of recurrence over a 10-year period and to establish risk factors for re-thyrotoxicosis following ATD withdrawal.

Different imaging methods applied in the evaluation of a patient with unilateral active Graves ophthalmopathy (GO) are discussed in the present paper. 99mTc-Anti-TNF-α scintigraphy is proposed as a promising method, not yet described, for the diagnosis of active ocular disease. It involves labeling a human monoclonal antibody directed against the TNF-α molecule (adalimumab) with technetium (99mTc). The method is based on demonstrating TNF-α as one of the cytokines involved in the initial active phase of GO development. This approach may provide a perspective to link diagnosis and therapy, including new target-based modalities.

### Monokine induced by interferon gamma (IFNgamma) (CXCL9) and IFNgamma inducible T-cell alpha-chemoattractant (CXCL11) involvement in Graves' disease and ophthalmopathy: modulation by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonists [^117KFbeu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

CXC alpha-chemokine CXCL10/IP-10 plays an important role in the initial phases of Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO). Human thyrocytes, orbital fibroblasts, and preadipocytes are stimulated to produce CXCL10 when treated with interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and TNFalpha. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) activation plays an inhibitory role in this process.

- **Objective**: Until now, no data are present in the literature about the involvement of CXCL9 and CXCL11 in Graves' disease and GO, or of PPARgamma activators' effect on these chemokines.

- **Methods**: It has been studied how IFNgamma and TNFalpha stimulation and PPARgamma activation affect CXCL9 and CXCL11 secretion in primary cultures of thyrocytes, orbital fibroblasts, and preadipocytes.

- **Results**: In primary cultures of thyrocytes, retrobulbar fibroblasts, and retrobulbar preadipocytes obtained from GO patients, CXCL9 and CXCL11 production was absent under basal conditions; CXCL9 and CXCL11 secretion was not induced by TNFalpha alone, whereas it was dose-dependently stimulated by treating cells with IFNgamma. The treatment with TNFalpha plus IFNgamma has a synergistic effect on CXCL9 and CXCL11 release. Treating all cell types with the PPARgamma agonist, rosiglitazone, or pioglitazone, the IFNgamma plus TNFalpha-induced CXCL9 and CXCL11 release was dose-dependently (0.1–20 microm) suppressed.

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that thyrocytes and retrobulbar cell types from patients with Graves' disease and ophthalmopathy participate in the self-perpetuation of inflammation, releasing CXCL9 and CXCL11 chemokines when stimulated.

### New insights into the pathogenesis and nonsurgical management of Graves orbitopathy [^113SjuSF]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2020). Low credibility.

Graves orbitopathy, also known as thyroid eye disease or thyroid-associated orbitopathy, is visually disabling, cosmetically disfiguring, and has a substantial negative impact on a patient's quality of life. There is increasing awareness of the need for early diagnosis and rapid specialist input from endocrinologists and ophthalmologists.

- **Treatment strategies**: Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment; however, recurrence occurs frequently once these are withdrawn. Furthermore, in over 60% of cases, normal orbital anatomy is not restored, and skilled rehabilitative surgery is required. Clinical trials have shown that considerable benefit can be obtained from the addition of antiproliferative agents, such as mycophenolate or azathioprine, in preventing deterioration after steroid cessation. Targeted biologic therapies have shown promise, including teprotumumab which reduces proptosis, rituximab (anti-CD20) which reduces inflammation, and tocilizumab, which potentially benefits both of these parameters. Other strategies, such as orbital radiotherapy, have had their widespread role in combination therapy called into question.

- **Pathophysiology and future directions**: The pathophysiology of Graves orbitopathy has been revised with the identification of new potential therapeutic targets. This review provides an up-to-date overview of the field, outlines the optimal management of Graves orbitopathy, and summarizes research developments in this area to highlight future research questions and direct future clinical trials.

### Management of thyroid eye disease: A consensus statement by the American Thyroid Association and the European Thyroid Association [^112M91Ei]. Thyroid (2022). High credibility.

- **Other agents tested in TED patients and clinically available**: Several additional agents have been tried in TED, including atorvastatin, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), azathioprine, cyclosporine, somatostatin analogues, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors. Only a few have been studied in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

An RCT comparing atorvastatin 20 mg daily for 24 weeks plus intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) (500 mg IV weekly for six weeks followed by 250 mg weekly for another six weeks) with IVMP alone found significantly greater improvement in the EUGOGO composite index (51%, 21/41 patients, vs. 28%, 11/39 patients). Relapses at 24 weeks were less likely in the atorvastatin plus IVMP arm (0/41 patients) than in the IVMP alone arm (15%, 6/39 patients). The GO-QOL improved more significantly in the combined therapy group (by 6.4 points) compared with the IVMP group.

Despite greater improvement in the composite index when atorvastatin was added to IVMP, there were no significant differences between groups in individual eye components such as CAS and diplopia, which improved in both groups; proptosis, visual acuity, and eye aperture improved in neither group.

IVIG appeared to have efficacy comparable to oral glucocorticoids (OGC) in the sole RCT, but due to the high cost, risk of infection transmission, and availability of other treatments, IVIG is not currently used in TED.

The roles of azathioprine (one RCT), cyclosporine (two RCTs), TNF alpha inhibitors, somatostatin analogues (four RCTs), and methotrexate are questionable, as the evidence is either anecdotal or indicates a lack of efficacy, or the side…

### Management of Graves thyroidal and extrathyroidal disease: An update [^112xCtQr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The CD40 molecule is abundantly expressed by thyrocytes and orbital target cells, and CD40–CD154 interaction modulates humoral immunity within the immunological synapse. Iscalimab, an anti-CD40 mAb and a potent inhibitor of the CD40-CD40 ligand (CD154) costimulatory pathway, was administered to patients with untreated GD. Iscalimab was very well tolerated, with half of the subjects responding to the drug. In comparison, B cell targeting therapies include rituximab, an anti-CD20 humanized mAb causing B cell depletion, and an anti-BAFF mAb (belimumab) preventing BAFF from interacting with its receptors. Rituximab has been tested in GD, leading to a decline of TSH-R-Abs. When administered to GO patients, grossly conflicting results were registered. High costs, low efficacy, and potential drug-related side effects (orbital edema and optic neuropathy) are major hurdles for the generalized use of rituximab in GO. Finally, when tested in an open-label study, a humanized recombinant IL6-R mAb (tocilizumab) positively improved the clinical course of the disease and extraocular muscle motility in patients with steroid-resistant GO. However, a subsequent tocilizumab placebo-controlled randomized trial in GO patients only partially reproduced the earlier reported impressive findings.

In conclusion, further controlled randomized studies are warranted to demonstrate the efficacy, safety, and clinical role of the above new compounds for GD and GO.

### Disease presentation and remission rate in Graves disease treated with antithyroid drugs: Is gender really a factor [^112AJEij]. Endocrine Practice (2019). Low credibility.

The male gender is considered an adverse prognostic factor for the remission of Graves disease treatment with antithyroid drugs (ATDs), although published data are conflicting. This often results in early consideration of radioiodine treatment and surgery for men. Our objective was to compare disease presentation and outcome in men versus women treated with ATDs. We conducted a retrospective study of 235 patients (64 men, 171 women) with Graves disease, who were evaluated for features at presentation and outcome at the end of follow-up between 2010 and 2015.

- **Results**: Disease presentation was similar in men and women for age at diagnosis (41.4 ± 14 years vs. 40 ± 15 years), duration of follow-up (6.6 ± 7 years vs. 7.7 ± 6 years), rates of comorbid autoimmune diseases, and rate of Graves ophthalmopathy. Smoking was more prevalent in males (31% vs. 15%; p = 0.009). Free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels were comparable. ATDs were first-line treatment in all males and in 168 of 171 females, for a median duration of 24 and 20 months, respectively (P = .55). Remission rates were 47% in men and 58% in women (P = .14). Males had fewer adverse events (9% vs. 18%) and treatment discontinuation (5% vs. 16%). Disease recurrence was comparable (14% vs. 20%; p = 0.32), as was the requirement for second-line treatment, either radioiodine therapy or thyroidectomy.

- **Conclusion**: Graves disease presentation is similar in men and women. Men treated with ATDs have high remission rates and similar recurrence rates compared to women, with fewer adverse events and less discontinuation of treatment.

A single-center experience with weekly adalimumab versus infliximab therapy in refractory uveitis was presented.

Adalimumab is currently the only non-corticosteroid therapy approved for the treatment of pediatric uveitis. Although it is approved for every two-week (Q2 week) dosing, many rheumatologists will increase the frequency to weekly (Q1) dosing if uveitis remains uncontrolled. We sought to assess the effectiveness of this approach compared to switching to infliximab in treating uveitis refractory to Q2 week adalimumab.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective chart review of children with uveitis treated with Q2 week adalimumab who switched to Q1 week adalimumab or monthly infliximab due to persistent uveitis. Patients seen in the Boston Children's Hospital rheumatology clinic between 2000 and 2018 with an ICD-9 or ICD-10 code of uveitis were included. The primary outcome measure was the percent of patients achieving sustained uveitis control. Time to control, frequency of uveitis recurrence, and ocular complications were also collected.

- **Results**: We identified 24 patients with persistent uveitis despite treatment with Q2 week adalimumab who were switched to either Q1 week adalimumab or Q4 week infliximab. Twelve of 19 patients (63%) who were switched to Q1 week adalimumab achieved sustained uveitis control.

### Inflectra [^1128AyHi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypersensitivity**: Infliximab products have been associated with hypersensitivity reactions that vary in their time of onset and, in some cases, have required hospitalization. Most hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, urticaria, dyspnea, and/or hypotension, have occurred during or within two hours of infliximab product infusion.

	- However, in some cases, serum sickness-like reactions have been observed in patients after initial therapy with infliximab products, as early as after the second dose, and when therapy was reinstituted following an extended period without treatment. Symptoms associated with these reactions include fever, rash, headache, sore throat, myalgias, polyarthralgias, hand and facial edema, and/or dysphagia. These reactions were associated with a marked increase in antibodies to infliximab products, loss of detectable serum concentrations of infliximab products, and possible loss of drug efficacy.

	- Inflectra should be discontinued for severe hypersensitivity reactions. Medications for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, such as acetaminophen, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and/or epinephrine, should be available for immediate use in the event of a reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.10) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	- In RA, CD, and Ps clinical trials, re-administration of infliximab following a period of no treatment resulted in a higher incidence of infusion reactions relative to regular maintenance treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In general, the benefit-risk of readministration of Inflectra after an extended period without treatment should be carefully considered.

### Efficacy profile and safety of very low-dose rituximab in patients with Graves' orbitopathy [^114BWF1h]. Thyroid (2021). High credibility.

Rituximab (RTX), a chimeric human-murine anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has been used for the treatment of active moderate-severe Graves' orbitopathy (GO) since 2004 as a second-line therapy in patients unresponsive to intravenous steroids. We conducted an open-label prospective study (EUDRACT 2012–001980–53) in which patients were treated with a single infusion of only 100 mg RTX to analyze the efficacy and safety of this low dose.

- **Methods**: Seventeen patients, of whom nine had disease that was unresponsive to intravenous methylprednisolone and eight with newly diagnosed GO, were enrolled. Disease activity was assessed with the clinical activity score (CAS) and severity with a composite ophthalmic score. Long-term surgical treatment and quality of life were also assessed, as well as treatment-related adverse events.

- **Results**: Mean baseline CAS was 4.56 ± 0.96 and decreased to 1.25 ± 1.14 at 24 weeks (p = 0.001). Disease inactivation occurred within 24 weeks in over 90% of patients and was unrelated to disease duration. Severity improved in about 60% of patients, with no relapses. All patients showed peripheral depletion of CD20+ and CD19+ cells at the end of RTX infusion (60 minutes). Two patients required surgical orbital decompression because of optic neuropathy (ON). Among adverse events observed, there was one patient who developed a cytokine release syndrome.

A dose of 100 mg RTX is effective in patients with active moderate-severe GO. Low doses are better tolerated, expose patients to immune suppression for a shorter period of time, and are extremely cost-effective.

### Long-term outcomes in corticosteroid-refractory Graves' orbitopathy treated with tocilizumab [^112B3RNM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Graves' orbitopathy (GO), also known as thyroid eye disease, is an inflammatory disorder that affects the orbital structures, leading to hypertrophy of the oculomotor muscles and adipose tissue. Typical signs of the disease include exophthalmos, eyelid retraction, strabismus, and inflammation of the conjunctival and periorbital tissues. In severe cases, the enlargement of the orbital contents can cause sight-threatening complications such as compressive optic neuropathy and corneal ulceration. Symptoms such as intense pain, dryness, photophobia, diplopia, and aesthetic consequences negatively impact patients' quality of life.

GO occurs in approximately 25% of patients with Graves' disease (GD) and represents the most common extrathyroidal disorder. Rarely, GO is diagnosed before the occurrence of thyroid symptoms. Women are at higher risk than men, but severe forms occur more frequently in men over 50 years of age.

It is thought that GO arises from cross-reactivity between the thyroid gland and orbital tissue antigens due to the recognition of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor (TSHR) and the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor (IGF-1R) as autoantigens on the cell surface of fibroblasts. The differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts or adipocytes following the upregulation of the TSHR/IGF-1R complex results in expanded orbital soft tissues. Histological findings show a mononuclear infiltrate predominantly characterized by CD4+ T cells and the overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, IL-17, and interferon.

### Avsola [^113okqm9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In Study I, within the subgroup of patients with more extensive psoriasis who had previously received phototherapy, 85% of patients treated with 5 mg/kg infliximab achieved a PASI 75 at Week 10 compared to 4% of patients on placebo.

In Study II, in the subgroup of patients with more extensive psoriasis who had previously received phototherapy, 72% and 77% of patients on 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg infliximab, respectively, achieved a PASI 75 at Week 10 compared to 1% on placebo. Among patients with more extensive psoriasis who had failed or were intolerant to phototherapy, 70% and 78% of patients on 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg infliximab, respectively, achieved a PASI 75 at Week 10 compared to 2% on placebo.

Maintenance of response was studied in a subset of 292 and 297 infliximab-treated patients in the 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg groups, respectively, in Study II. Stratified by PASI response at Week 10 and investigational site, patients in the active treatment groups were re-randomized to either a scheduled or as needed maintenance (PRN) therapy, beginning on Week 14.

- **Maintenance doses**: The groups that received a maintenance dose every 8 weeks showed a greater percentage of patients maintaining a PASI 75 through Week 50 compared to those receiving the as needed or PRN doses. The best response was maintained with the 5 mg/kg every 8-week dose. At Week 46, when infliximab serum concentrations were at trough level in the every 8-week dose group, 54% of patients in the 5 mg/kg group compared to 36% in the 3 mg/kg group achieved PASI 75.

### New therapeutic horizons for Graves' hyperthyroidism [^1142XSF1]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Adverse effects have been reported with RTX, the most frequent of which is a mild infusion reaction including throat itching and nasal congestion that resolves upon slowing the infusion, with or without the administration of hydrocortisone. Reports have also noted articular and gastrointestinal symptoms, specifically colitis, related to circulating immune complexes following RTX. The rare complication of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy has largely been reported in patients with predisposing comorbidities who have received multiple immunosuppressive agents.

An increased risk of serious infection has been reported in RTX-treated patients, but this tends to occur in those with concomitant severe immunodeficiency or underlying malignancy. RTX has been used for many years in the treatment of various autoimmune diseases. A review over 9.5 years involving repeated courses of RTX in rheumatoid arthritis patients demonstrated no evidence of an increased safety risk or increased reporting rates of any type of adverse events compared with placebo plus methotrexate. Additionally, the vast majority of studies using RTX in Graves' hyperthyroidism or GO have demonstrated no serious adverse events.

Newer second-generation CD20-depleting strategies, including ocrelizumab and ofatumumab — which theoretically have lower immunogenicity and improved tolerability — may provide a future option for Graves' patients.

### Management of thyroid eye disease: A consensus statement by the American Thyroid Association and the European Thyroid Association [^116sy9Yn]. Thyroid (2022). High credibility.

The management of thyroid eye disease (TED) involves a comprehensive evaluation of the patient, taking into account various factors that contribute to the condition.

- **Summary of key points**: It is critical to identify the natural history and pathogenesis of TED to develop preventive strategies. Early diagnosis and referral for TED specialty care are essential steps, with endocrinologists and ophthalmologists playing integral roles in patient management.

- **Patient assessment**: This includes assessing disease activity and severity, evaluating quality of life, conducting formal ophthalmology evaluations, and utilizing imaging techniques.

- **Overall approach to therapy**: A combination of local and lifestyle measures, along with systemic medical and surgical treatments, are considered. Setting appropriate care environments and ensuring timely ophthalmological referrals are crucial.

- **Therapy for mild TED**: Focuses on medical therapy and, in some cases, surgery for minimal changes in proptosis and lid retraction.

- **Management of moderate-to-severe TED**: Involves various medical therapies. Glucocorticoids are commonly used, but for those unresponsive or intolerant to intravenous glucocorticoids, alternative therapies such as teprotumumab, rituximab, mycophenolate, and tocilizumab are considered. There are other agents tested in TED patients that are clinically available, as well as investigational agents that show promise.

By integrating these approaches, health professionals aim to provide effective management and improve outcomes for patients with TED.

### The use of infliximab in ocular inflammation [^117MYJtb]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Experience with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha medications in ophthalmology has mainly been in treating resistant uveitis and scleritis. A few case reports and one case series detail the use of infliximab in orbital inflammatory disease treatment. However, experience with these agents in various orbital inflammatory conditions is still limited. We describe the successful suppression of inflammation with infliximab in idiopathic orbital inflammation, thyroid-associated orbital inflammation, and chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy.

This study is a retrospective observational case series of five cases of orbital and ocular inflammation. The effects of infliximab were observed in the treatment of three cases of orbital inflammation and two cases of chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy, all of which were unresponsive to alternative immune modulators. The patients experienced relief from symptoms and signs of inflammation in all five cases. However, this relief was not absolute, as symptoms returned around week 5 post-inflammation.

This report highlights the expanding role of biological agents in ophthalmology. Although not a definitive solution, they offer a valuable alternative to steroids in cases of refractory inflammation.

### Does autoimmunity against thyroglobulin play a role in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy: a review [^117PgLGC]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of the ophthalmopathy that occurs in approximately 40% of patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism, and less often and usually in a less severe form, in 25% of patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis, remains controversial. While most authors favor the hypothesis that autoimmunity against the TSH receptor (TSHr) expressed in the orbital fibroblasts, preadipocytes, and fibrocytes is the dominant autoimmune reaction that leads to orbital inflammation, not all the evidence supports this. Notably, Graves' disease and worsening ophthalmopathy may be associated with decreasing levels of TSHr antibodies in individual patients, and ophthalmopathy can develop many years after the onset of hyperthyroidism.

Most importantly, patients with so-called euthyroid Graves' disease have similar ophthalmopathy but no evidence for thyroid autoimmunity, including negative TSHr antibodies as measured in the TRAb assay and as thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin in a Thyreporter bio-assay, suggesting that other possibilities should be considered. Moreover, a recent case report showed that eye signs and other soft tissue manifestations of Graves' disease worsened in the context of psychological stress, with reduced levels of TSHr antibody occurring following stress.

Regardless of the nature of the inflammatory process in the orbital connective tissue, fat, and extraocular muscles (EOM), the eye disorder is presumed to begin in the thyroid, since the great majority of patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) have active thyroid inflammation.

Assessment of patients who achieved remission:

A total of 103 out of 189 patients (54.5%) achieved Graves' Disease (GD) remission. The free T4 level at the time of diagnosis was significantly lower in patients who achieved remission versus patients who did not, with a mean difference of 3.0 pmol/L (P = 0.038). Similarly, the TRAb level at diagnosis was significantly lower in patients who achieved remission than in patients who did not, with a median difference of 5.4 IU/L (P = 0.001). A significant proportion of the female patients (61.7%) achieved remission, while only 35% of the male patients achieved remission. The only two patients with severe ophthalmopathy and 67% of the patients with moderate ophthalmopathy did not achieve remission.

Of the patients who did not achieve remission, 22 patients underwent thyroidectomy, 17 patients received RAI, and 47 patients continued on anti-thyroid drugs (ATD).

### Does autoimmunity against thyroglobulin play a role in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy: a review [^116bNr55]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis and radioiodine treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism may serve as valuable models for understanding potential orbital changes in patients with thyroiditis. When the thyroid gland undergoes radioactive iodine treatment for Graves' hyperthyroidism, there is an initial exacerbation of thyroiditis, accompanied by the release of thyroid proteins and increased production of corresponding antibodies, including those against Tg, TPO, and TSHr.

Recent findings indicate that after radioiodine treatment, serum Tg concentrations rise, which correlates with an increase in TSHr antibody titers and an initial worsening of eye symptoms, followed by subsequent improvement (Wall et al, 2013, unpublished observations). It is probable, albeit unproven, that the number of thyroid antigen-sensitized T cells increases in the thyroid post-131 I treatment. These antibodies and sensitized T cells could migrate to orbital tissues, potentially exacerbating pre-existing eye conditions.

- **Evidence and hypotheses**: Studies that definitively link radioactive iodine treatment to worsening eye symptoms — or the development of new ophthalmopathy, though this remains contentious — would strongly indicate that autoimmunity against thyroid antigens contributes to the progression of ophthalmopathy in individuals with thyroid autoimmunity. Although there is no mechanistic data confirming that radioactive iodine exacerbates Graves' ophthalmopathy via increased thyroid destruction and the resultant release of Tg or Tg/anti-Tg immune complexes, this hypothesis currently guides our ongoing in vitro and clinical investigations.

### Relationship between longitudinal behaviour of some markers of eye autoimmunity and changes in ocular findings in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy receiving corticosteroid therapy [^113D7J8c]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether variations over time of TSH-receptor antibodies (TRAb) and antibodies against G2s (G2sAb) and extraocular muscles (EMAb) can predict worsening of ophthalmopathy in Graves' patients treated with intravenous glucocorticoid (IVGC) therapy.

Of 65 consecutive patients with treated Graves' disease and severe, active ophthalmopathy (GO) chosen to undergo IVGC treatment, only 57 patients, who were persistently euthyroid under methimazole therapy, were studied longitudinally for ocular parameters, TRAb, G2sAb, and EMAb before therapy, at the end of therapy, and subsequently every month for 21 months.

- **Measurements**: TRAb was detected by radioimmunoassay (RIA), G2sAb by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and EMAb by indirect immunofluorescence.

- **Results**: Forty-three out of 57 patients (75.4%, group 1) responded positively to therapy, showing improvement in diplopia and a decrease in proptosis and clinical activity score (CAS), but 14 (24.6%) did not (group 2). During the follow-up after IVGC therapy, 12 out of 43 patients in group 1 (28%) showed a worsening in GO (group 1a), while 31 (72%) had stable ocular conditions or further improvement (group 1b). At the start of the study, TRAb, G2sAb, and EMAb were not significantly different among the three groups. At the end of IVGC therapy, TRAb levels decreased significantly with respect to starting values in all three groups of patients, whereas G2sAb and EMAb decreased significantly in groups 1a and 1b but not in group 2. During the subsequent follow-up, 10 patients in group 1a one/two months before and all 1

### Opdivo [^11192LYA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Approximately 19% of patients with hyperthyroidism received methimazole, 7% received carbimazole, and 4% received propylthiouracil. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 9% (5/54) of patients. Hyperthyroidism resolved in 76% of the 54 patients. Of the 7 patients in whom Opdivo was withheld for hyperthyroidism, 4 reinitiated Opdivo after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence of hyperthyroidism.

- **Opdivo with ipilimumab**:
	- Opdivo 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg: Hyperthyroidism occurred in 9% (42/456) of patients with melanoma or HCC who received Opdivo 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, including Grade 3 (0.9%) and Grade 2 (4.2%) adverse reactions. Hyperthyroidism led to the permanent discontinuation of Opdivo with ipilimumab in no patients and withholding of Opdivo with ipilimumab in 2.4% of patients.

	- Approximately 26% of patients with hyperthyroidism received methimazole and 21% received carbimazole. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 17% (7/42) of patients. Hyperthyroidism resolved in 91% of the 42 patients. Of the 11 patients in whom Opdivo with ipilimumab was withheld for hyperthyroidism, 8 reinitiated treatment after symptom improvement; of these, 1 (13%) had recurrence of hyperthyroidism.

### Tumor necrosis factor antagonists: Preliminary evidence for an emerging approach in the treatment of ocular inflammation [^116uJRcX]. Retina (2007). Low credibility.

The anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibody infliximab and the soluble TNF receptor etanercept inhibit the pleiotropic actions of TNF and are widely used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), spondyloarthropathies (SpA), Crohn's disease, and psoriasis, with an acceptable safety profile. A pathogenetic role of TNF in ocular inflammatory conditions has recently emerged from small trials reporting preliminary results on the efficacy of these agents in patients with noninfectious uveitis, regardless of the origin of the disease.

The authors review the published experience, derived mostly from investigator-sponsored trials and uncontrolled case series, on the use of TNF antagonists in approximately 280 patients with various ocular conditions who were inadequately controlled on currently available therapy. These reports suggest that TNF antagonists, mainly infliximab, which may have better efficacy than etanercept, are useful in the treatment of ocular inflammation associated with Adamantiades-Behçet's disease, RA, JIA, SpA, Crohn's, sarcoidosis, and Graves' disease ophthalmopathy.

Infliximab was also beneficial in small numbers of patients with idiopathic uveitis or scleritis, birdshot retinochoroiditis, uveitic and diabetic cystoid macular edema, and age-related macular degeneration. The currently available data are nonrandomized and thus preliminary, providing the foundation and justification for randomized trials to assess efficacy and safety. Until such results are available, knowledge regarding the use of anti-TNF therapy remains limited.

### Epidemiology and prevention of Graves' ophthalmopathy [^117AhA35]. Thyroid (2002). Low credibility.

Graves' ophthalmopathy is clinically relevant in approximately 50% of patients with Graves' disease, with severe forms affecting 3% to 5% of patients. Two age peaks of incidence are observed in the fifth and seventh decades of life, with slight differences between women and men. The disease is more frequent in women than in men, although the female-to-male ratio is only 1:4 in severe forms of eye disease. The natural history of Graves' ophthalmopathy is incompletely defined, but in many instances, especially mild forms, the disease may remit or improve spontaneously.

The onset of the ophthalmopathy is, in most cases, concomitant with the onset of hyperthyroidism; however, eye disease may precede or follow hyperthyroidism. Cigarette smoking plays an important role in the occurrence of the ophthalmopathy and is also associated with a higher degree of disease severity and a lower effectiveness of its medical treatment.

Primary prevention, meaning the avoidance of the occurrence of the ophthalmopathy, is presently not feasible. However, smoking withdrawal in relatives of patients with Graves' disease might be important.

- **Secondary prevention**: Involves avoiding the progression of subclinical eye disease into overt and severe ophthalmopathy. In addition to refraining from smoking, early and accurate control of thyroid dysfunction, both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, as well as early diagnosis and treatment of mild eye disease, are important.

The role that management of hyperthyroidism may play in the course of Graves' ophthalmopathy is significant; however, while antithyroid drugs and thyroidectomy are not addressed in detail here, they remain relevant considerations for treatment.

### Does autoimmunity against thyroglobulin play a role in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy: A review [^116UWTKw]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The evidence for a role of autoimmunity against thyroglobulin (Tg) is, as is the case for the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHr), mainly circumstantial. In order to prove the "thyroid antigen hypothesis", it must be demonstrated that normal orbital fibroblasts and extraocular muscle (EOM) cells, to which Tg is attached, become targets for antibodies and/or sensitized T lymphocytes from patients with ophthalmopathy, but not from those without eye disease.

Comparisons can be made between Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) patient sera and normal sera, fibroblasts to which Tg is bound versus control antigen, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells or purified T-cell subsets from patients with GO versus those from patients with Graves' disease without eye signs. Additionally, mononuclear cells can be isolated from the thyroid of patients with GO and tested for reactivity against the same target cells, compared to mononuclear cells from patients with Graves' disease without ophthalmopathy.

Specific IgG autoantibodies obtained by affinity chromatography, and purified subpopulations of T cells targeting Tg can be incubated with Tg-coated EOM cells or orbital fibroblasts to confirm findings using serum and unfractionated mononuclear cells. Changes in gene expression for inflammatory markers and cytokine levels can be measured as endpoints. The study of potential benefits of selenium supplementation in GO is also possible in this model.

Serial studies of patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism can be conducted, measuring serum Tg antibodies and correlating them with eye signs. It has been suggested that Tg antibodies tend to be low in patients with ophthalmopathy and those without eye disease due to their absorption by the orbit.

### Does autoimmunity against thyroglobulin play a role in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy: a review [^115PiAqy]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

There is a significant positive correlation between serum Tg levels and the presence and severity of ophthalmopathy in patients with Graves' disease. In patients with Graves' disease, but not those with Hashimoto thyroiditis, Tg levels also correlate with serum titers of TSHr antibodies. This supports the notion that both TSHr and Tg may be released from the thyroid gland during thyroiditis and migrate to the orbit, where they become targets of autoantibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

### Graves orbitopathy: A perspective [^111kTg5H]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Advances in the past few years have helped clinicians understand some of the pathogenetic mechanisms of Graves orbitopathy (GO), particularly the role of receptors for TSH and insulin-like growth factor I in the orbit. Optimal treatment strategies have been formulated and published by the European Group on Graves' Orbitopathy, which are hoped to improve the management of patients with this condition. The administration of intravenous pulses of steroids has been established as a superior treatment approach compared with other steroid regimens. In addition, orbital radiotherapy was effective in a subgroup of patients with GO who had eye dysmotility. The use of immunotherapies for the treatment of GO is currently being explored; of these, rituximab has emerged as a promising new agent.

### Autoimmune lymphocytic hypophysitis in association with autoimmune eye disease and sequential treatment with infliximab and rituximab [^114ZVwdR]. Pituitary (2015). Low credibility.

Autoimmune lymphocytic hypophysitis is predominantly associated with other autoimmune endocrinopathies and is most commonly treated with glucocorticoids and/or decompressive pituitary surgery. Here, we report a new association and treatment modality for lymphocytic hypophysitis.

- **Methods**: A 52-year-old woman presented with scleritis, uveitis, facial palsy, and central diabetes insipidus, accompanied by a thickened pituitary stalk and enlarged pituitary on cranial MRI. Neurosarcoidosis was suspected, and treatment with glucocorticoids and methotrexate was initiated. Since symptoms persisted, infliximab (a monoclonal antibody that antagonizes tumor necrosis factor alpha) was added to her regimen. The patient initially improved, but after 6 months developed pituitary enlargement, bilateral optic neuritis, and panhypopituitarism. To ascertain the nature of the pituitary lesion, she underwent transsphenoidal biopsy, which revealed lymphocytic hypophysitis with numerous CD20-positive B lymphocytes. The pathological finding suggested that the administration of rituximab (a monoclonal antibody that lyses B cells expressing CD20) could be useful. Following two courses of rituximab, the pituitary mass resolved and the corticotroph axis partially recovered. The patient has remained in remission during 3 years of follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: This is the first report of hypophysitis occurring with the triad of scleritis, uveitis, and optic neuritis, as well as the first immunotherapy based on the sequential use of infliximab and rituximab.
