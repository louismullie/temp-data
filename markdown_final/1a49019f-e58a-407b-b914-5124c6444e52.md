## Question

In a patient with transaminitis likely secondary to alcohol use, and with plans to discuss obtaining an acute hepatitis panel, and with elevated alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, what else should I do for this patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what else to do for a patient with suspected alcohol-associated transaminitis, elevated alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, and plans to discuss obtaining an acute hepatitis panel. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical pattern and hepatic origin of the abnormalities. Then, I should verify disease severity and whether this meets criteria for severe alcohol-associated hepatitis. Next, I will need to ensure appropriate first-line imaging to exclude obstruction. After that, I should review alternative or coexisting etiologies, assess fibrosis noninvasively, initiate immediate management with abstinence, nutrition, and infection screening, consider corticosteroids if indicated, set up monitoring, and define referral thresholds to hepatology and transplant pathways, all while cross-checking each step against guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the hepatic origin and pattern, because ALP elevation is not liver-specific. I need to order a GGT to corroborate that the ALP is hepatobiliary in origin and to support a cholestatic or mixed pattern; GGT elevation increases the likelihood this is liver rather than bone derived, though I should remember GGT is sensitive but nonspecific and can be elevated with alcohol or medications, so I should interpret it in context [^115eFu7U] [^117MpALN]. Next, I should fractionate bilirubin into direct and indirect components; if predominantly unconjugated, I must pause and check hemolysis labs (CBC, reticulocytes, LDH, haptoglobin) or consider Gilbert's, whereas a conjugated predominance fits hepatocellular injury and/or cholestasis and warrants imaging and etiologic workup rather than mere retesting [^115Txxj6] [^112RBbyZ].

> Wait, let me verify that I complete a core aetiology panel up front rather than deferring it. That should include CBC with platelets, PT/INR, albumin to assess synthetic function, and a basic metabolic panel given the prognostic impact of renal dysfunction in acute liver syndromes; adding GGT here also aligns with core panel recommendations for abnormal liver tests and helps confirm cholestasis, while remembering that enzymes reflect injury and albumin/INR reflect function, which is crucial for triage and referral decisions [^116MUPTF] [^112RBbyZ] [^112nyTDM]. Hold on, I should not simply repeat abnormal tests without investigating the cause unless there is a clear transient insult; persistence is common and delays care, so moving to cause-finding now is appropriate in this scenario of mixed injury and jaundice risk [^113XoUqa] [^1163SZ3e].

> I need to check disease severity now to determine urgency and whether corticosteroids are indicated. I will calculate MELD; a MELD greater than 20 defines severe alcohol-associated hepatitis and is the most accurate tool for risk stratification, with the greatest steroid benefit typically in MELD 25–39, and for MELD greater than 50 I must have a careful risk–benefit discussion and consider alternatives and goals of care early [^113DNk5J] [^114Bwnox]. I should also confirm Maddrey's Discriminant Function; a DF of 32 or higher indicates severe disease and supports considering prednisolone if no contraindications, while tracking clinical red flags such as worsening bilirubin, INR above 1.5, rising creatinine, or encephalopathy that would signal acute decompensation and a need for hospitalization [^111MrgXR] [^1176PvPM]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost focused only on DF; MELD is superior for prognostication in AH, so I should prioritize MELD in discussions and use DF as supportive, not the sole determinant [^113DNk5J].

> Next, I should review imaging, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about obstruction without appropriate first-line tests. Given a cholestatic or mixed pattern with elevated ALP and bilirubin, a right upper quadrant ultrasound is the initial modality to look for biliary dilatation from stones, strictures, or mass, as well as liver morphology, congestion, and features of portal hypertension; if portal hypertension is suspected, I should add Doppler to evaluate hepatic and portal venous flow, and escalate to MRCP if ultrasound is nondiagnostic and suspicion persists [^112SbFyr]. I should also remember that in suspected choledocholithiasis or cholangitis, liver biochemical tests and biliary imaging are standard parts of evaluation to avoid missing surgically or endoscopically correctable causes [^111peK8x].

> I will now examine alternative or coexisting etiologies, because alcohol-associated disease often overlaps with other conditions. I need a meticulous medication, supplement, and herbal history to assess DILI, using ALT, ALP, and bilirubin patterns and thresholds to classify injury and considering that DILI is a diagnosis of exclusion requiring careful chronology of exposure and recovery after withdrawal; if cholestasis remains unexplained, MRCP for PSC may be appropriate, especially in those with IBD [^112mcruX] [^112nyTDM]. I should also screen for autoimmune hepatitis with ANA, SMA, and IgG when the pattern is atypical, remembering that marked ALP elevation can suggest PBC or PSC variants and that AIH transaminases can span from mild to very high, particularly in acute presentations; if cholestasis is disproportionate, I should check an antimitochondrial antibody for PBC and consider AMA-positive cholestasis pathways [^115AgRSj] [^117MpALN] [^112nyTDM]. Finally, I need to check iron studies with transferrin saturation, because TSAT above 45% raises concern for hereditary hemochromatosis, whereas isolated hyperferritinemia is common in ALD and metabolic liver disease and should not be overinterpreted as genetic iron overload without TSAT corroboration [^112nyTDM].

> Let me consider fibrosis staging next, since prognosis and referral hinge on it. I should calculate FIB-4 as an initial blood-based assessment and recognize that higher values, particularly above commonly used thresholds, suggest advanced fibrosis and warrant expedited hepatology referral and imaging-based staging, in line with guidance to use FIB-4 and elastography in ALD [^1155DZgq]. Then I should obtain transient elastography; in alcohol-associated disease, liver stiffness in the 12–15 kPa range can help rule in advanced fibrosis, but because inflammation can inflate stiffness early, I should repeat measurement after at least 4 weeks of abstinence to avoid overestimating stage and to track improvement or progression longitudinally [^113xQUus] [^113QFrqt] [^114h6MUJ]. Hold on, I should verify that serial changes are interpreted in clinical context rather than rigid cutoffs; current guidance emphasizes individualized interpretation of longitudinal stiffness with supporting clinical evidence, which I will apply here [^113biJp8] [^115AdM53].

> I need to ensure immediate management steps are in place while the workup proceeds. Complete alcohol abstinence is foundational, and I should involve addiction medicine early because even modest alcohol intake worsens outcomes when liver injury is present; I will advise complete cessation and set up supports accordingly [^113DNk5J] [^1123m6K8]. Admission is indicated for severe AH by MELD above 20 or DF at least 32, or for decompensation, infection, or inability to maintain intake; in hospital, I must provide nutrition of roughly 1.2–1.5 g/kg protein and 30–35 kcal/kg/day, along with thiamine and folate supplementation, and proactively screen for infection with blood, urine, and, if ascites, ascitic cultures because infection is common and often occult in AH [^1176PvPM] [^113tTTo5]. Let me double-check goals of care and renal risk as well, because iodinated contrast can precipitate AKI; noncontrast imaging or MRCP should be preferred when feasible in this hemodynamically tenuous group [^113tTTo5].

> Now, regarding specific pharmacotherapy, I should confirm corticosteroid eligibility because this hinges on both severity and contraindications. Prednisolone 40 mg daily for 28 days can improve 28‑day survival in severe AH, provided there is no active uncontrolled infection, GI bleeding, or severe renal failure; the Lille score at day 7 will guide continuation, and nonresponders should have steroids stopped to avoid harm [^111MrgXR] [^111Qtj3E]. I should also remember that the magnitude of benefit appears greatest in MELD 25–39, and that for MELD above 50 I need a careful risk–benefit and goals‑of‑care discussion given high competing risks and potential futility of steroids alone [^114Bwnox]. But wait, let me verify that infection has been screened and treated before initiating steroids, because steroids in the setting of unrecognized infection can worsen outcomes; this is why early cultures and antibiotic management are integral to the algorithm in jaundiced AH [^113tTTo5].

> Next, I should review monitoring and reassessment, because early trends change decisions. I will follow serial AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin, INR, and creatinine at least weekly during the acute phase, with close watch for AKI, which is common and portends worse prognosis in AH; I will recalculate MELD as it evolves to reassess risk and treatment trajectory [^113DNk5J]. I should confirm alcohol abstinence support and consider objective biomarkers such as urine ethyl glucuronide and phosphatidylethanol to monitor relapse risk and engage patients in recovery interventions that are not confounded by liver dysfunction, which can improve accuracy and guide counseling [^113Fz5H9]. Let me reconsider timing of reassessment imaging too; repeating elastography after several weeks of abstinence will help refine fibrosis staging once inflammatory confounders subside and can inform long‑term planning and surveillance needs [^113QFrqt] [^114h6MUJ].

> I should confirm referral thresholds now to avoid delays in advanced care. Urgent hepatology referral is warranted for MELD above 20 or DF at least 32, evidence of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, diagnostic uncertainty, or if early liver transplantation might be considered in select severe AH patients who meet stringent criteria; equally, in patients with multiple organ failures who are steroid nonresponders and ineligible for transplant, early palliative care should be offered to align treatment with goals and symptom needs [^117MFJ1z] [^114tbH1m]. Hold on, I should verify that the transplant center's early AH protocols are engaged when appropriate, as pathways and criteria vary, and early involvement can be critical for time‑sensitive evaluation in nonresponders [^117MFJ1z].

> Finally, to synthesize, this mixed hepatocellular–cholestatic pattern in suspected alcohol-associated liver disease demands confirmation of the pattern with GGT and bilirubin fractionation, calculation of MELD and DF to define severity, urgent first‑line ultrasound to exclude biliary obstruction, a focused but comprehensive evaluation for coexisting etiologies including DILI, autoimmune cholestatic disease, and iron overload, noninvasive fibrosis staging with FIB‑4 and elastography with abstinence‑adjusted interpretation, immediate institution of abstinence, nutrition, and infection screening, consideration of corticosteroids in severe AH with day‑7 Lille reassessment, close laboratory monitoring, and prompt hepatology referral for advanced disease or transplant evaluation, as supported by contemporary guidelines and imaging appropriateness criteria [^115eFu7U] [^114Bwnox] [^112SbFyr] [^112nyTDM] [^113QFrqt] [^111MrgXR] [^1176PvPM].

---

For a patient with transaminitis likely from alcohol use and elevated ALP and total bilirubin, **order right upper quadrant ultrasound** to assess for biliary obstruction or mass [^112SbFyr], and **obtain GGT to confirm hepatic ALP** [^115eFu7U]. Check **INR, albumin, and platelets** to assess liver synthetic function and screen for acute liver failure [^111kfRcp]. Evaluate for hemolysis (LDH, haptoglobin, reticulocyte count) [^112XLmib] and review medications for drug-induced liver injury [^112mcruX]. If ultrasound is inconclusive, proceed to MRCP or CT [^115Txxj6]. Refer to **hepatology** if advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis is suspected [^1155DZgq], and counsel on alcohol abstinence with support services [^117MFJ1z].

---

## Immediate laboratory evaluation

- **Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)**: Confirms hepatic origin of ALP [^115eFu7U]; elevated in cholestasis and alcohol-related liver disease [^112XLmib].

- **Fractionated bilirubin**: Differentiates conjugated (cholestatic/hepatocellular) from unconjugated (hemolysis/Gilbert) hyperbilirubinemia [^113EquiN] [^112XLmib].

- **INR, albumin, platelet count**: Assess synthetic function and screen for acute liver failure or advanced fibrosis [^112RBbyZ] [^111kfRcp].

- **Hemolysis labs**: LDH, haptoglobin, reticulocyte count to exclude hemolysis as a cause of hyperbilirubinemia [^112XLmib] [^113EquiN].

---

## Imaging studies

Right upper quadrant **ultrasound** is first-line to evaluate biliary obstruction, gallstones [^111peK8x], strictures, or masses [^112SbFyr]. If ultrasound is inconclusive or suspicion remains high, **MRCP or CT** should be used to further assess biliary obstruction or mass lesions [^115Txxj6].

---

## Additional laboratory tests

- **Autoimmune markers**: ANA, ASMA, AMA to evaluate for autoimmune hepatitis, PBC, or PSC [^112XLmib] [^115AgRSj].

- **Metabolic tests**: Iron studies, ceruloplasmin, alpha-1 antitrypsin levels to exclude hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^112XLmib] [^117MpALN].

- **Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) evaluation**: Review medications and consider DILI, especially with recent drug exposure [^112mcruX] [^1166BbqX].

---

## Clinical assessment and monitoring

Quantify alcohol intake, counsel on abstinence [^117MFJ1z], and refer to **addiction services** [^113DNk5J] [^1155DZgq]. Monitor for **complications** such as jaundice, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and renal dysfunction, and hospitalize if severe [^111kfRcp] [^1176PvPM]. Recheck LFTs, INR, and bilirubin regularly to track progression or resolution.

---

## Indications for specialist referral

- **Advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis**: Refer to hepatology for further evaluation and management [^1155DZgq] [^114h6MUJ].

- **Severe alcoholic hepatitis**: MELD > 20 or MDF ≥ 32 warrants specialist care and consideration of corticosteroids [^114Bwnox] [^113DNk5J] [^111MrgXR].

- **Unclear diagnosis**: Persistent unexplained abnormalities despite initial workup require specialist input [^112nyTDM].

Elevated ALP and total bilirubin in alcohol-related transaminitis require a **structured approach**, with confirmation of hepatic ALP with GGT [^115eFu7U], assessment of synthetic function [^112RBbyZ], exclusion of hemolysis [^113EquiN], and imaging for obstruction [^112SbFyr]. Escalate to MRCP/CT [^115Txxj6] and specialist care if indicated [^1155DZgq] [^114Bwnox], and prioritize alcohol abstinence [^117MFJ1z] and complication monitoring [^111kfRcp].

### ACG clinical guideline: Alcohol-associated liver disease [^114Bwnox]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol-related liver disease, specifically concerning corticosteroids, the ACG 2024 guidelines recommend administering corticosteroids to patients with severe alcohol-associated hepatitis who have a MELD score greater than 20. It is important to recognize that patients with a MELD score ranging from 25 to 39 derive maximum benefit from corticosteroid treatment. When considering corticosteroids for patients with a MELD score greater than 50, it is essential to carefully discuss the risks and benefits.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® abnormal liver function tests [^112SbFyr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Liver function tests are commonly obtained in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Various overlapping lab patterns can be seen due to derangement of hepatocytes and bile ducts function. Imaging tests are pursued to identify underlying etiology and guide management based on the lab results. Liver function tests may reveal mild, moderate, or severe hepatocellular predominance and can be observed in alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease, acute hepatitis, and acute liver injury due to other causes.

A cholestatic pattern with elevated alkaline phosphatase, with or without elevated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, can arise from various causes of obstructive biliopathy. Acute or subacute cholestasis with conjugated or unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia may occur due to prehepatic, intrahepatic, or posthepatic causes. The initial and complementary imaging modalities to be used in clinical scenarios presenting with abnormal liver function tests are discussed.

The American College of Radiology appropriateness criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles, such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112XLmib]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical pattern recognition for liver blood tests can be categorized into three common patterns of abnormal results, aiding in diagnosis:

- **Isolated raised bilirubin**: This is most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome, which affects 5–8% of the population. Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. Repeat liver blood tests using a fasting sample with a full blood count, as well as direct and indirect bilirubin tests. In this case, the total bilirubin should rise further due to the indirect component, with no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, exclude haemolysis by requesting reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, and haptoglobin tests. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (greater than 40 μmol/L), consider rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome and pursue genetic testing.

- **Cholestatic**: Predominantly elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, neoplasia), hepatic congestion, and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may manifest with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders affecting bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP might be linked to vitamin D deficiency and not be liver-related, or it may correspond to increased values during periods of rapid growth in childhood. The presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the presence of liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, GGT is characteristically unaltered.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^116MUPTF]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The analysis from the BALLETS study was predicated on the identification of adults with established causes of liver disease such as autoimmune liver disease, viral hepatitis, or metal storage disorders, which were found in just 5% of those with abnormal liver blood tests. Thus, these data would support a strategy of a streamlined panel with high sensitivity without generating large numbers of false positives, which have the potential to lead to greater patient anxiety, over-investigation, and considerably increased costs.

- **Recommendation 1**: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, ALT, ALP, and GGT, together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months (level 2b, grade B).

If there is a clear indication of a specific clinical risk — for example, in high-risk groups such as injecting drug users, migrants from high-prevalence areas, or prisoners — then some aspects of second-line testing can be undertaken simultaneously. In many patients with liver damage, an assessment of liver fibrosis is critical in making decisions about referral and management. In adults, clues to the level of liver fibrosis can be gleaned from the use of non-invasive algorithms such as the AST to ALT ratio. An AST:ALT ratio of > 1 indicates advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis; hence the inclusion of this ratio in algorithms has the potential to assess the risk of significant fibrosis in adults with abnormal liver blood tests. However, non-invasive markers have not been sufficiently validated in children to be routinely applied in clinical practice.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115eFu7U]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) is abundant in the liver and also present in the kidney, intestine, prostate, and pancreas, but not in bone. Therefore, it can be useful in confirming that an elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is of liver and not bony origin. GGT is most commonly elevated as a result of obesity, excess alcohol consumption, or may be induced by drugs. Although an elevated GGT has low specificity for liver disease, it is one of the best predictors of liver mortality. It is particularly useful in children to establish the likelihood of biliary disease when ALP is not a reliable indicator. Predominant causes of cholestasis in children include congenital abnormalities of the biliary tract and genetic disorders affecting bile synthesis and excretion.

### Elevated liver enzymes: Emergency department-focused management [^111MfEZb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are a common problem faced by emergency physicians. This issue has become more prevalent with the introduction of laboratory panels and automated routine laboratory testing. Fortunately, not all patients with irregularities in liver enzymes have underlying pathology. This emergency medicine-focused review discusses various biochemical tests, their underlying biological basis, and provides an algorithmic approach to interpreting abnormalities.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an overview of the evaluation and management of patients with elevated LFTs.

- **Discussion**: The liver is a complex organ with multiple roles. Key biochemical markers of hepatic function can be organized into the groupings of hepatocellular, cholestatic, or functioning liver, based on underlying enzymatic roles. Pathologic alterations to these markers can be algorithmically assessed by separating disease processes within these groupings, followed by an assessment of the magnitude of enzymatic elevation. This review conducts an in-depth evaluation of the differential diagnosis and emergency department-centered clinical response to elevated LFTs, based on subcategories of mild, moderate, and severe transaminase elevation.

- **Conclusions**: By understanding the biochemical basis of each LFT, it is possible to correlate laboratory findings with a patient's clinical presentation. An algorithmic approach can help narrow the spectrum of a differential diagnosis, assisting providers in ensuring appropriate management.

- **Laboratory findings**:
	- **Elevation of plasma triglycerides (see warnings**: lipids), decrease in serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, elevations of serum cholesterol during treatment.
	- Increased alkaline phosphatase, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), GGTP, or LDH (see warnings: hepatotoxicity).
	- **Elevation of fasting blood sugar, elevations of CPK (see precautions**: laboratory tests), hyperuricemia.
	- Decreases in red blood cell parameters, decreases in white blood cell counts (including severe neutropenia and rare reports of agranulocytosis; see precautions: information for patients), elevated sedimentation rates, elevated platelet counts, thrombocytopenia.
	- White cells in the urine, proteinuria, microscopic or gross hematuria.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113XoUqa]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

In response to abnormal liver blood tests, as indicated in Figure 1, the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes, it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to identify the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised due to intercurrent illness; however, when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal upon retesting after one month, and even after two years, 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests, it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding.

In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a pediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

- **Response to abnormal liver blood tests**: This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure, and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside the evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine the choice of pathway.

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^1155Yms9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117J7mYC]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

- **Recommendation 9**: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available).

Patients flagged up with the AUDIT-C but drinking less than 25 U/L require repeat testing of liver blood tests to organize appropriate monitoring. If the AST is persistently over 100 U/L, then consideration should be given to an assessment of liver fibrosis, as for the higher-risk group.

- **Research recommendation 2**: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^115AgRSj]. Gut (2025). High credibility.

Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels at presentation are typically about 10 times higher than normal, although they can be modestly raised or occasionally normal. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be mildly raised in active disease; however, marked elevation suggests primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) variant syndromes (Section N).

The presentation of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) might vary between races. African-American patients, compared to Caucasian patients, are typically younger and have a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Caucasian patients exhibit more cholestatic histological features and a higher rate of non-response to treatment, which cannot be fully explained by differences in access to medical care.

- **Severity assessment**: Although no unified severity classification exists for AIH, there are seven distinct patterns. These patterns incorporate an understanding of acute and chronic liver disease and are determined by the severity of the acute (mild, icteric, severe, fulminant) and chronic (mild, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated) components of liver injury:

	- **Asymptomatic disease**: (a) mild or (b) with fibrosis/cirrhosis.

Asymptomatic patients might not have mild disease. While they tend to have lower serum transaminase levels than symptomatic patients, the severity of necro-inflammation and fibrosis are similar, as is the rate of death or transplantation. Treating asymptomatic patients is associated with improved survival (Section F).

Chronic hepatitis is the most common form of AIH, typically with an insidious onset.

### COVID-19 and liver injury: where do we stand [^116ge95N]? Annals of gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Cai et al recently evaluated the clinical characteristics of 417 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with abnormal liver tests. Liver test abnormality was defined by the elevation of ALT > 40 U/L, AST > 40 U/L, ALT and total bilirubin > 1 mg/dL, while patients with ALT and/or AST > 3x ULN were classified as having hepatocyte-type liver injury. The authors compared liver function tests on admission and during hospitalization concerning COVID-19 severity. On admission, 170 (41%) patients had abnormal liver test results, while 33 (5%) had signs of hepatocyte-type liver injury. The presence of abnormal liver tests became more pronounced during hospitalization within 2 weeks, while 26.7% of the patients progressed to severe pneumonia. Moreover, patients with hepatocyte-type injury or mixed-type injury (the combination of both ALT/AST > 3× ULN and GGT/ALP > 2× ULN) at admission had higher odds of progressing to severe pneumonia (OR 2.73, 95%CI 1.19–6.3, and OR 4.44, 95%CI 1.93–10.23, respectively). However, during hospitalization, the use of lopinavir/ritonavir was correlated with liver injury (OR 4.44 to 5.03, both P < 0.01), indicating a possible DILI as cofactor. Moreover, a liver biopsy from one patient who died showed that liver function impairment during hospitalization could be partly due to the drugs used for treatment, or due to sepsis and shock. The authors concluded that patients with abnormal liver tests had higher risks of progressing to severe disease, but the detrimental effects on the liver were mainly related to certain medications used during hospitalization.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1133f5Yq]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Liver function tests (LFTs), which are perceived to be inexpensive, are checked ever more frequently in both primary and secondary care. This is done in an attempt to exclude liver disease, monitor potential adverse effects of drugs on the liver such as statins, and investigate the generally unwell patient. These tests often produce an abnormal result, the clinical significance of which is unclear. In many cases, though, LFTs are requested in response to non-specific symptoms where there is little potential link between symptoms and likelihood of liver disease, or they are performed for unrelated reasons such as chronic disease monitoring. This commonly presages a cycle of additional liver blood tests in an otherwise asymptomatic individual. Notably, most patients referred to hospitals with abnormal liver tests do not have any evidence of significant liver disease. For example, University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust received 130,849 requests for liver blood tests in 2016 from 82 general practices. Of these, 38,636 (30%) contained at least one abnormal result, defined as being outside the stated reference range. The Abnormal Liver Function Investigations Evaluation (ALFIE) study from Tayside in Scotland showed that over a 10-year period, 25% of the community population aged over 16 had liver blood tests, with about a third having at least one abnormal value. Although an abnormal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was predictive of liver disease (HR = 4.2), the rate of detection was remarkable.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113Fz5H9]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for alcohol-related liver disease, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, the AASLD 2020 guidelines recommend considering the use of alcohol biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis of alcohol use disorder and to support recovery. It is preferable to use urine and hair ethyl glucuronide, urine ethyl sulfate, and phosphatidylethanol, as they are not affected by liver disease.

### Extensive testing or focused testing of patients with elevated liver enzymes [^113vf1Rq]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Many patients have elevated serum aminotransferases, reflecting numerous underlying conditions, both common and rare. Clinicians typically use one of two evaluative strategies: testing for all diseases simultaneously (extensive) or initially testing for only common diseases (focused).

- **Methods**: We simulated the evaluation of 10,000 adult outpatients with elevated alanine aminotransferase to compare both testing strategies. Model inputs utilized population-based data from the US (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) and Britain (Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies). Patients were followed until a diagnosis was reached or a diagnostic liver biopsy was deemed necessary. The primary outcome measured was cost in US dollars per diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included doctor visits per diagnosis, false-positives per diagnosis, and confirmatory liver biopsies ordered.

- **Results**: The extensive testing strategy had the lowest monetary cost, yielding diagnoses for 54% of patients at $448 per patient compared to 53% for $502 under the focused strategy. The extensive strategy also required fewer doctor visits (1.35 vs. 1.61 visits per patient). However, the focused strategy generated fewer false positives (0.1 vs. 0.19 per patient) and more biopsies (0.04 vs. 0.08 per patient). Focused testing becomes the most cost-effective strategy when considering pre-test probabilities and prior evaluations performed. This includes when the respective prevalence of alcoholic, non-alcoholic, and drug-induced liver disease exceeds 51.1%, 53.0%, and 13.0%. Focused testing is also the most cost-effective when these conditions are met.

### Modest alcohol intake and mortality in individuals with elevated alanine aminotransferase levels: a nationwide cohort study [^1123m6K8]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

In conclusion, a small amount of alcohol intake was associated with increased liver-related and all-cause mortality among individuals with elevated ALT levels. Subjects with elevated ALT levels should be advised to completely abstain from alcohol, as even a small amount of alcohol intake may be harmful for them.

### Brief communication: Clinical implications of short-term variability in liver function test results [^117Gq1fp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Clinicians sometimes order liver tests as part of a screening examination or general work-up. Guidelines do not recommend routine retesting of abnormal results in asymptomatic patients.

- **Objective**: To characterize the magnitude of intraindividual variability of liver test results and determine the proportion of adults with persistently elevated levels after one positive test.

- **Design**: Reliability study.

- **Setting**: The NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) III First and Second Examinations (1988 to 1994).

- **Participants**: 1864 men and women age 18 years or older living in the United States.

- **Measurements**: Repeated measurements (mean, 17.5 days apart) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and bilirubin.

- **Results**: Using NHANES III cutoffs for normal levels, 38% of adults with initially elevated bilirubin levels had normal levels at the second examination. These proportions were 36%, 31%, 17%, and 12% for AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase, respectively. More than 95% of initially normal results remained normal. The results did not differ by alcohol consumption; hepatitis A, B, or C serologic status; recent infection; body mass index; or sociodemographic characteristics. Intraindividual variability was significantly higher for bilirubin (coefficient of variation, 23.4%) and ALT (coefficient of variation, 20.4%) than for AST (coefficient of variation, 13.9%), gamma-glutamyltransferase (coefficient of variation, 13.8%), and alkaline phosphatase.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels: Causes and evaluation [^112yo3Df]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Mild, asymptomatic elevations (less than five times the upper limit of normal) of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels are common in primary care. It is estimated that approximately 10% of the U.S. population has elevated transaminase levels. An approach based on the prevalence of diseases that cause asymptomatic transaminase elevations can help clinicians efficiently identify common and serious liver disease.

The most common causes of elevated transaminase levels are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. Uncommon causes include drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis B and C, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Rare causes include alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic sources, such as thyroid disorders, celiac sprue, hemolysis, and muscle disorders, are also associated with mildly elevated transaminase levels.

The initial evaluation should include an assessment for metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance (i.e. waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting lipid level, and fasting glucose or A1C level); a complete blood count with platelets; measurement of serum albumin, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin; and hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen testing. The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score and the alcoholic liver disease/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease index can be helpful in the evaluation of mildly elevated transaminase levels. If testing for common causes is consistent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and is otherwise unremarkable, a thorough follow-up may be warranted for further investigation.

### ACG clinical guideline: Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests.

Hepatocellular injury is defined as a disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as a disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase levels compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin, and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT is associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy, normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males and 19 to 25 IU/l for females; levels above this should be assessed.

The degree of elevation of ALT and/or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessing for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should also be conducted.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol-related liver disease, particularly concerning the assessment of liver fibrosis, the WFUMB 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining liver stiffness measurement again after at least four weeks of abstinence in patients with excessive alcohol consumption and increased liver stiffness. This is especially advised if there are signs of inflammatory activity, such as aspartate transaminase levels greater than 70 U/L and/or increased bilirubin.

### Drug-induced liver injury: recent advances in diagnosis and risk assessment [^1142Ngsv]. Gut (2017). High credibility.

- **Role of currently performed liver tests in assessing DILI**: Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) often presents as an acute viral hepatitis-like syndrome, lacking distinct symptoms that point specifically to drug etiology unless skin rashes or cutaneous manifestations suggest drug toxicity. The clinical spectrum of DILI mimics nearly every other liver disorder. Although blood eosinophilia is uncommon in large series of patients with DILI, its presence clearly suggests a drug allergy. Histopathological findings in DILI resemble many other liver disorders, limiting the diagnostic value of liver biopsy. However, a biopsy can be useful for establishing an alternative diagnosis when underlying liver disease worsens, such as in alcoholic hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).

- **Diagnostic workup**: A diagnostic workflow for assessing suspected DILI cases is shown in figure 3. Serum aminotransferases, including ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TB) levels, remain the hallmark for detecting and classifying liver damage, even though they are not specific for DILI. Minor increases in aminotransferases, resulting from adaptive and reversible liver responses to the drug (e.g. statins) or from pre-existing liver disease (e.g. fatty liver), should not be classified as DILI. An international expert group has proposed the following thresholds for a diagnosis of DILI: (a) ALT value ≥ 5× upper limit of normal (ULN), and (b) ALP value ≥ 2× ULN.

### Approach to the liver biopsy in the patient with chronic low-level aminotransferase elevations [^116HcWAh]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pathologists sometimes encounter a liver biopsy from an asymptomatic patient with unexplained low-level parenchymal liver enzyme elevations. These biopsies often have minor histologic changes but are otherwise almost entirely normal. This can lead to the quandary of whether the features are clinically meaningful and how one must formulate a diagnosis from the possibly nonspecific findings of a near-normal biopsy. The following discussion focuses on the histologic changes that can be seen in these biopsies and the practical issues involved in making a diagnosis that provides useful information to the clinician. The literature and textbooks addressing the histologic and clinical features of these cases are reviewed, with an emphasis on the clinical implications of finding nonspecific histologic alterations in these patients.

### Modest alcohol intake and mortality in individuals with elevated alanine aminotransferase levels: A nationwide cohort study [^113ui9gb]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are widely used to screen liver diseases, and many asymptomatic individuals show elevated ALT levels. As elevated ALT level indicates liver injury, even a small amount of alcohol intake may be harmful in subjects with elevated ALT levels. However, there is limited evidence of the effect of light to moderate alcohol intake in this subgroup.

- **Methods**: A cohort of 367,612 men and women without established liver diseases (including chronic viral hepatitis, alcohol-associated liver disease, cirrhosis, liver transplantation, or rare forms of liver disease) who underwent at least 1 health screening exam between 2009 and 2015 were assessed for liver-related and all-cause mortality. Elevated ALT levels were defined as ≥ 34U/L for men and ≥ 25U/L for women.

- **Results**: In participants with normal ALT levels, the fully-adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) for liver-related mortality comparing light and moderate drinkers to non-drinkers were 0.73 (0.51–1.05) and 1.06 (0.73–1.52), respectively. In participants with elevated ALT levels, the corresponding hazard ratios were 1.57 (1.08–2.28) and 2.09 (CI 1.46–2.99), respectively (p value for alcohol intake by ALT interaction < 0.01). For all-cause mortality, the fully-adjusted hazard ratios comparing light and moderate drinkers to non-drinkers in participants with normal ALT levels were 0.72 (0.66–0.77) and 0.89 (0.82–0.97), respectively. In participants with elevated ALT levels, the corresponding hazard ratios were 0.93 (0.81–1.08) and 1.31 (1.14–1.50), respectively.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^115Txxj6]. American Family Physician (2025). Low credibility.

Jaundice is an indication of hyperbilirubinemia and is caused by derangements in bilirubin metabolism. It is typically apparent when serum bilirubin levels exceed 3 mg/dL and can indicate serious underlying disease of the liver or biliary tract. A comprehensive medical history, review of systems, and physical examination are essential for differentiating potential causes such as alcoholic liver disease, biliary strictures, choledocholithiasis, drug-induced liver injury, hemolysis, or hepatitis.

Initial laboratory evaluation should include assays for bilirubin (total and fractionated), a complete blood cell count, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio. Measuring fractionated bilirubin allows for determination of whether the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated.

Ultrasonography of the abdomen, computed tomography with intravenous contrast media, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are first-line options for patients presenting with jaundice, depending on the suspected underlying etiology. If the etiology of jaundice is unclear despite laboratory testing and imaging, liver biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of the disease.

### Modest alcohol intake and mortality in individuals with elevated alanine aminotransferase levels: a nationwide cohort study [^117F6tYb]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Liver injury or liver disease is usually asymptomatic until complications of liver failure or portal hypertension develop. Therefore, liver function tests, including bilirubin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and aminotransferase levels, are the mainstay for identifying early liver injury or liver disease.

While alkaline phosphatase, GGT, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) can be produced by organs other than the liver, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is exclusively produced in hepatocytes and is widely used as a specific biomarker of liver injury or liver disease. As serum ALT measurement is relatively inexpensive, it is frequently used to screen for, or exclude liver disease, and it is common to find asymptomatic individuals with abnormally elevated ALT levels. Subjects with elevated ALT levels are recommended to undergo additional workup to establish the etiology of liver injury.

In these subjects, the most common causes of elevated ALT levels are alcohol-associated liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis, and NAFLD. When alcohol-associated liver disease or chronic viral hepatitis are identified as the causes of elevated ALT, evidence and practice guidelines recommend complete abstinence. In subjects with other causes of elevated ALT levels (mostly subjects with NAFLD), it is controversial if they require complete abstinence, and information regarding this issue is limited. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the association of light to moderate alcohol intake with liver-related mortality and all-cause mortality among individuals with elevated ALT levels.

### How are abnormal results for liver function tests dealt with in primary care? Audit of yield and impact [^114FH32S]. BMJ (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether abnormal results for liver function tests are investigated in primary care, along with the findings upon full investigation.

- **Design**: This study utilized a retrospective audit and prospective clinical investigation.
- **Setting**: The study was conducted at a university hospital and surrounding general practices, catering to approximately 330,000 people.
- **Subjects**: The subjects were adults with abnormal liver function test results, based on tests requested by their doctor between January 1 and June 30, 1995.
- **Interventions**: All patients with gamma-glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or alkaline phosphatase concentrations at least twice the upper limit of the reference range were studied. A median of 15 months later (range 12–21), records of hospital attendances and further investigations were examined. Where investigations were incomplete, records from the general practice were examined, and suitable patients were invited to attend the liver clinic.
- **Main outcome measures**: Investigations requested by the doctor and final diagnoses reached.

Results indicated that 933 patients with abnormal liver function tests were identified, and follow-up data were obtained for 873 (94%). Of these patients, 531 were already under hospital review. Of the remaining 342 patients, 157 were suitable for investigation; the others had died, moved away, were elderly, or had repeat liver function tests with normal results. No further tests were requested for 91 (58%) of these patients, 66 had been partially investigated by their doctor, and in seven patients, results suggesting a treatable chronic liver disease had not been followed up. On investigation, 97 (62%) had an identifiable condition.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^114h9YzH]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests, such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, can reveal serious underlying conditions or have transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis.

The medical history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations.

The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause. In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time; albumin; complete blood count with platelets; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies.

Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

Perform hepatic laboratory tests prior to initiation of treatment to evaluate for hepatic function and injury. Do not start Veozah if either aminotransferase is ≥ 2 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) or if the total bilirubin is ≥ 2 x ULN for the evaluating laboratory. Perform follow-up hepatic laboratory testing monthly for the first 3 months, at 6 months, and 9 months of treatment. Advise patients to discontinue Veozah immediately and seek medical attention, including hepatic laboratory tests, if they experience signs or symptoms that may suggest liver injury, such as new onset fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, jaundice, pale feces, dark urine, or abdominal pain. Discontinue Veozah if transaminase elevations are > 5 x ULN, or if transaminase elevations are > 3 x ULN and the total bilirubin level is > 2 x ULN. If transaminase elevations > 3 x ULN occur, perform more frequent follow-up hepatic laboratory tests until resolution.

### Limiting the testing of AST: A diagnostically nonspecific enzyme [^112fbgcP]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Annually, millions of pairs of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) tests are ordered. These enzymes are highly correlated, and ALT is far more specific diagnostically than AST. To reduce AST testing, we suggest measuring AST only when ALT exceeds a predetermined limit.

- **Methods**: We derived the proportions of elevated ASTs that would not be measured based on 15 months of paired inpatient and outpatient ALT and AST data.

- **Results**: For inpatients, a 35 U/L ALT limit for initiating AST testing would reduce AST testing by 51%, missing only 3% and 7.5% of ASTs exceeding 50 U/L and 35 U/L, respectively. In outpatients, AST testing can be reduced by more than 65%, with fewer missed elevated ASTs (0.5% and 2% of the ASTs exceeding 50 U/L and 35 U/L, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: Conservatively, $100 million could be saved annually in the US health care budget by selectively limiting AST testing in just the US outpatient environment.

### Mayzent [^114JhxC2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Liver injury**: Elevations of transaminases may occur in Mayzent-treated patients. Recent (i.e. within the last 6 months) transaminase and bilirubin levels should be reviewed before initiation of Mayzent therapy.

	- In Study 1, elevations in transaminases and bilirubin were observed in 10.1% of Mayzent-treated patients compared to 3.7% of patients receiving placebo, mainly because of transaminase [alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase/gamma-glutamyltransferase (ALT/AST/GGT)] elevations. In Study 1, ALT or AST increased to three and five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 5.6% and 1.4% of Mayzent-treated patients, respectively, compared to 1.5% and 0.5% of patients receiving placebo, respectively. ALT or AST increased eight and ten times ULN in Mayzent-treated patients (0.5% and 0.2%, respectively) compared to no patients receiving placebo. The majority of elevations occurred within 6 months of starting treatment. ALT levels returned to normal within approximately 1 month after discontinuation of Mayzent. In clinical trials, Mayzent was discontinued if the elevation exceeded a 3-fold increase and the patient showed symptoms related to hepatic dysfunction.

	- Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, rash with eosinophilia, or jaundice and/or dark urine during treatment, should have liver enzymes checked. Mayzent should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed. Although there are no data to establish that patients with preexisting liver disease…

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112RBbyZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. Historically, they have been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality often relates not to liver dysfunction but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason, this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs, as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice.

Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation, convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin, and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline, an abnormal liver blood test is defined as a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is emerging literature suggesting that the reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms: unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation, whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system. Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises the unconjugated and conjugated fractions.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115wEbB4]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel?

There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. However, the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality, in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver aetiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting, GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients. The addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30% and, notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk being observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically with respect to screening for comorbidities, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend that in settings with laboratory testing access, clinicians should conduct or arrange for a comprehensive metabolic profile or basic metabolic profile. This includes a hepatic panel and a complete blood count (CBC) with differential to evaluate the patient's electrolytes, liver function, renal function, and immune function.

In settings with limited laboratory testing access, it is advised to obtain results when feasible to assist with treatment planning decisions. Address any detected nutritional deficiencies. Initial screening may also include laboratory tests for hepatitis, HIV (with consent), and tuberculosis.

### Traditional markers of excessive alcohol use [^113zmXjm]. Addiction (2003). Low credibility.

The blood tests used traditionally as markers of excessive drinking are the liver enzymes: gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and the red blood cell volume (mean corpuscular volume: MCV). Here, we review the nature of these markers' association with alcohol use, their practical application in detecting, assessing, or monitoring drinking, and the increases in understanding of these markers in the past 10 years.

Articles were identified via Medline search and perusal of bibliographies. The conventional markers have imperfect sensitivity and specificity, but they have an added clinical role in the detection of complications of drinking and comorbid conditions that may increase the risk of drinking. GGT may, in part, be a marker of the oxidative stress associated with ethanol metabolism. Markers are more likely to be elevated in those aged more than 30 years and in regular drinkers with a longer drinking history. The markers may be useful in opportunistic case finding, motivating patients to change drinking habits, and monitoring treatment response. Increased prevalence of obesity and hepatitis C must be considered in the interpretation of liver enzyme results. The liver enzymes are prognostic indicators for several medical conditions and for mortality.

These conventional tests are widely available and relatively inexpensive. While they have limited sensitivity and specificity in detecting excessive drinking, they also provide valuable data on complications of drinking and comorbid conditions.

### Claravis [^117H8kX8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Elevation of plasma triglycerides, decrease in serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and elevations of serum cholesterol may occur during treatment (see WARNINGS, Lipids). There may also be increased alkaline phosphatase, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), GGTP, or LDH levels (see WARNINGS, Hepatotoxicity).

Elevation of fasting blood sugar and elevations of CPK levels have been noted (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests), along with hyperuricemia. Decreases in red blood cell parameters and white blood cell counts, including severe neutropenia and rare reports of agranulocytosis, have been observed (see PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients). Elevated sedimentation rates, elevated platelet counts, and thrombocytopenia can also occur.

Additionally, some patients experience white cells in the urine, proteinuria, and microscopic or gross hematuria.

### Clinical significance of elevated liver transaminases in HIV-infected patients [^116CrpnV]. AIDS (2019). Low credibility.

Elevation of liver transaminases is common in patients infected with HIV. Although this is usually an incidental finding during regular work-ups, HIV-infected patients with transaminase elevations require additional visits for laboratory studies and clinical assessments and often undergo interruptions and changes in antiretroviral therapy (ART). Alanine aminotransferase is present primarily in the liver, thus serving as a surrogate marker of hepatocellular injury. Aspartate aminotransferase is present in the liver and other organs, namely the cardiac and skeletal muscle, kidneys, and brain. Serum levels of both liver transaminases predict liver-related mortality. Moreover, serum fibrosis biomarkers based on alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase predict all-cause mortality.

In a busy clinical setting, a diagnostic approach to elevated liver transaminases could be complicated given the frequency and nonspecificity of this finding. Indeed, HIV-infected individuals present multiple risk factors for liver damage and chronic elevation of transaminases, including coinfection with hepatitis B and C viruses, alcohol abuse, hepatotoxicity due to ART, HIV itself, and frequent metabolic comorbidities leading to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This review provides an update on the epidemiology of elevated liver transaminases, summarizes the main etiologic contributors, and discusses the prognostic significance and a pragmatic approach to this frequent finding in the clinical practice of HIV medicine.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^113EquiN]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice in adults can be an indicator of significant underlying disease. It is caused by elevated serum bilirubin levels in the unconjugated or conjugated form. The evaluation of jaundice relies on the history and physical examination.

The initial laboratory evaluation should include fractionated bilirubin, a complete blood count, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyltransferase, prothrombin time and/or international normalized ratio, albumin, and protein. Imaging with ultrasonography or computed tomography can differentiate between extrahepatic obstructive and intrahepatic parenchymal disorders. Ultrasonography is the least invasive and least expensive imaging method.

A more extensive evaluation may include additional cancer screening, biliary imaging, autoimmune antibody assays, and liver biopsy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with increased bilirubin production caused by red blood cell destruction, such as hemolytic disorders, and disorders of impaired bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs in disorders of hepatocellular damage, such as viral and alcoholic hepatitis, and cholestatic disorders, such as choledocholithiasis and neoplastic obstruction of the biliary tree.

### Natural history and development of a novel composite endpoint in patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis: Data from a prospective multicenter study [^11675tXE]. Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

The clinical course and outcomes of alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) remain poorly understood. Major adverse liver outcomes (MALO) do not capture the added risk of return to drinking (RTD). We examined the natural history of AH and developed a composite endpoint using a contemporary observational cohort of AH.

- **Methods**: A cohort of 1127 participants, including 712 AH patients, 256 heavy drinking (HD) controls without clinically evident liver disease, and 159 healthy controls, were prospectively followed for 6 months at eight United States centers as part of the Alcoholic Hepatitis Network (AlcHepNet) consortium. Outcomes included mortality and a composite endpoint (AlcHepNet composite index) that included death, liver transplantation, hepatic decompensation (new onset/worsening ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding), liver-related hospital admission, MELD increase ≥ 5, and return to drinking (RTD).

- **Results**: Of 712 AH patients (age 45 ± 10.7 years; 59.1% male), 558 (79.0%) had severe and 148 (21.0%) had moderate AH. A total of 232 (32.5%) died, and 86 (12.1%) underwent liver transplantation. Mortality rates in moderate AH and severe AH were 0.7% versus 17.2% (30 days), 3.4% versus 26.5% (90 days), and 8.8% versus 30.5% (180 days), respectively (all p < 0.001). Composite liver/alcohol use events were noted in 459 (64.5%) AH patients. Higher MELD score, lower mean arterial pressure, and baseline leukocytosis were associated with higher 90-day mortality in AH (all p < 0.05). College education and higher alkaline phosphatase were associated with lower mortality. HD controls had low mortality.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol-related liver disease, more specifically with respect to the assessment of liver fibrosis, the AASLD 2025 guidelines recommend using imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment. Specifically, they suggest utilizing transient elastography-measured controlled attenuation parameter and MRI-PDFF or MRS over blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment tests when available for the assessment of hepatic steatosis in adult patients.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112nyTDM]. Gut (2018). High credibility.

Investigations should include a standard liver aetiology screen or core panel to identify the cause of damage and exclude additional pathologies. There is uncertainty as to whether the entire extended liver aetiology screen should be undertaken in response to abnormal liver blood tests, but in most situations, only the core panel should be performed, with the extended panel reserved for patients with no clear cause. The choice of blood tests in the core panel is influenced by prevalence (BALLETS) in the UK and the identification of treatable causes of liver disease.

Patients with evidence of hepatitis B (HBsAg positive), HCV (antibody positive then PCR positive), autoimmune hepatitis (raised IgG ± positive autoantibodies), primary biliary cholangitis (cholestatic liver enzymes + positive anti-mitochondrial antibody), PSC (cholestatic liver enzymes ± history of inflammatory bowel disease), or haemochromatosis (raised ferritin and transferrin saturation > 45%) should be referred to a specialist clinic in accordance with locally agreed guidance. An isolated elevated serum ferritin result is commonly seen in dysmetabolic iron overload syndrome as found in the setting of alcohol excess, NAFLD, and other chronic liver diseases and does not reflect haemochromatosis. The presence of dilated bile ducts requires further assessment and consideration of urgent hospital referral depending on the clinical setting.

In the BALLETS study, in a cohort of 1290 adults in primary care, fully characterised and followed up for 2 years, less than 5% of people with abnormal liver blood test results had subsequent serious liver disease.

### Alanine aminotransferase: a clinical and regulatory tool for detecting liver injury-past, present, and future [^116xdYTr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

The assay of serum activity of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has become the primary screening tool for detecting acute liver injury. But what does an elevated value mean? It is not what it is too often mistakenly believed to indicate. It is not a test of liver function. It does not necessarily predict worse effects to come in a given person. It is not a valid measure of the severity of liver injury or dysfunction. It is too unspecific to be reliable in screening for relatively rare effects on the liver.

Although these are substantial limitations, ALT is a very useful biomarker if understood and used properly. It is important to consider how and why these erroneous concepts came to have such wide acceptance, and how elevations of ALT activity for evaluating patients and subjects under study might be interpreted better.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The extent of abnormality in liver blood tests is often presumed to correlate with prognosis. This assumption has led to the use of threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval to guide further investigation. However, literature does not support this assumption, indicating that prognosis is more accurately determined by diagnosis and the context in which tests are requested.

Consider two patients for illustration: a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection may have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C might have ALT values within the normal reference interval. Ten years later, the patient with hepatitis A will likely be alive and well, regardless of management, while the patient with hepatitis C is at significant risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease if not properly investigated and diagnosed. Indeed, the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease, and hepatitis C — are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Consequently, despite the increased use of liver blood tests, patients often present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable with earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the upper limit of normal for many liver enzymes, such as ALT, may be too high. This is probably a consequence of including patients with occult NAFLD in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges.

### ACG clinical guideline: Alcoholic liver disease [^112kzRmb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for alcoholic hepatitis" is a clinical tool designed to identify patients with alcohol-related liver disease. It is particularly aimed at individuals with a history of heavy alcohol use and symptoms consistent with liver disease.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include the following five key elements:

- **Rapid onset or worsening of jaundice**: There should be rapid development or exacerbation of liver-related complications.

- **Serum total bilirubin level**: This should be greater than 51 mcmol/L or 3 mg/dL.

- **Elevated liver enzymes**: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be more than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal but less than 400 U/L, with an AST/ALT ratio greater than 1.5.

- **Heavy alcohol use documentation**: There should be evidence of heavy alcohol consumption until 8 weeks before the onset of symptoms.

- **Exclusion of other liver diseases**: Other potential liver diseases should be ruled out.

The diagnostic criteria are fulfilled if all five components are present. If any component is absent, the diagnostic criteria for alcoholic hepatitis are not satisfied. This tool aids clinicians in accurately diagnosing alcoholic hepatitis, facilitating appropriate treatment and management of the condition.

### A multicenter study into causes of severe acute liver injury [^111pLJvM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of ≥ 1000 IU/L often is stated to include three main etiologies: ischemic hepatitis, acute viral hepatitis (typically hepatitis A and hepatitis B), and drug-induced (more specifically, acetaminophen/paracetamol) liver injury (DILI). Unfortunately, there is a paucity of studies examining the most common causes of acute liver injury (ALI), and those that have been published have been small, single-center, or have examined less severe increases in ALT or AST levels.

We conducted a multicenter study of all patients with an ALT and/or AST level ≥ 1000 IU/L. Our study had three main goals:

- **Determine the most common causes of an ALT and/or AST level ≥ 1000 IU/L**: Along with their relative frequencies.
- **Determine differences in etiology based on hospital type**: For example, differences between liver transplant centers, community hospitals, and Veterans Affairs hospitals.
- **Confirm or disprove the differential heuristic**: Specifically, that ischemic hepatitis, acute viral hepatitis, and acetaminophen toxicity are the most common etiologies.

### ACG clinical guideline: Alcohol-associated liver disease [^117MFJ1z]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol-related liver disease, specifically concerning the initial evaluation, the ACG 2024 guidelines recommend counseling patients with heavy drinking. If there is evidence of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) detected through noninvasive tests, patients should be advised about the risk of progressive liver disease and referred to a hepatology specialist for further management.

### ACG clinical guideline: Alcohol-associated liver disease [^113DNk5J]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is the most common cause of advanced hepatic disease and a frequent indication for liver transplantation worldwide. Harmful alcohol use, as the primary risk factor, has led to an increase in ALD-related healthcare burdens over the past decade. The spectrum of ALD ranges from early asymptomatic liver injury to advanced disease with decompensation and portal hypertension.

Patients with ALD progress faster and often present at an advanced stage compared to those with other etiologies of liver disease. A unique phenotype of advanced disease is alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), which may present with a rapid onset or worsening of jaundice and acute on chronic liver failure. Severe forms of AH convey a 1-month mortality risk of 20%-50%. The model for end-stage liver disease score is the most accurate tool to stratify AH severity, with a score greater than 20 defined as severe disease.

Corticosteroids are currently the only available therapeutic option with proven efficacy for patients with severe AH, providing a survival benefit at 1 month in 50%-60% of patients. Abstinence from alcohol is a crucial determinant of long-term outcomes, but achieving it is challenging in ALD patients with concurrent alcohol use disorder (AUD). As patients with ALD are rarely treated for AUD, there is a need for strategies to overcome barriers to AUD treatment and to promote a multidisciplinary integrated care model. This model should include hepatologists, addiction medicine providers, and social workers to comprehensively manage the dual pathologies of liver disease and AUD.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^112mcruX]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, relying on a detailed medical history, including medication exposure, the pattern and course of liver biochemistry tests before and after drug discontinuation, and exclusion of other causes of liver disease. The initial laboratory testing for DILI includes serum aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and total and direct bilirubin levels, whereas serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) levels are a marker of severity.

Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: (1) serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; (2) total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl along with elevated serum AST, ALT, or ALP level; or (3) INR > 1.5 with elevated serum AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI may present with lower levels of laboratory abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries because of NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

A diagnosis of DILI relies on careful elicitation of clinical history and drug exposures along with exclusion of other more common causes of liver injury.

### Epidiolex [^115k4dmG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In general, transaminase elevations of greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in the presence of elevated bilirubin without an alternative explanation are an important predictor of severe liver injury. Early identification of elevated liver enzymes may decrease the risk of a serious outcome. Patients with elevated baseline transaminase levels above 3 times the ULN, accompanied by elevations in bilirubin above 2 times the ULN, should be evaluated prior to initiation of Epidiolex treatment.

Prior to starting treatment with Epidiolex, obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin levels. Serum transaminases and total bilirubin levels should be obtained at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after initiation of treatment with Epidiolex, and periodically thereafter or as clinically indicated. Serum transaminases and total bilirubin levels should also be obtained within 1 month following changes in Epidiolex dosage and addition of or changes in medications that are known to impact the liver. Consider more frequent monitoring of serum transaminases and bilirubin in patients who are taking valproate or who have elevated liver enzymes at baseline.

If a patient develops clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (e.g. unexplained nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine), promptly measure serum transaminases and total bilirubin. Interrupt or discontinue treatment with Epidiolex as appropriate. Discontinue Epidiolex in any patients with elevations of transaminase levels greater than…

### Monitoring for hepatotoxicity: What is the predictive value of liver "function" tests [^113EvKTy]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a major reason drugs fail during development or are withdrawn from the market. The ability to predict, detect, and avoid DILI through appropriate patient selection and effective monitoring has proved to be an elusive goal. Many approved drugs have labeling recommendations for serum enzyme monitoring intended to detect and prevent hepatotoxicity, but such monitoring is often seen as inconvenient, uncomfortable, costly, and inefficient by both patients and doctors; thus, monitoring recommendations are poorly followed, if at all. This review considers whether monitoring works to prevent DILI, whether monitoring recommendations are derived from data or opinions, and whether any better alternatives exist.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1163SZ3e]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

As with the extent of liver blood test derangement, there are assumptions that the duration reflects clinical significance, necessitating routine repeat testing for patients with mildly abnormal liver blood tests. This is based on the belief that many abnormalities may be transient and will normalize, precluding significant liver disease. While this may be true for some acute liver diseases, it is not the case for many chronic liver diseases, such as HCV and NAFLD, where even normalized tests do not imply absence or resolution of disease.

Moreover, as demonstrated by the BALLETS study, 84% of adults still had abnormal tests when repeated one month later. When repeating blood tests to check for normalization, the total cost of investigation, including recalling the patient, obtaining and transporting the blood sample to the laboratory, and the cost of analysis, must be considered. Therefore, a strategy of simply repeating abnormal tests can only be justified where there is certainty that the abnormality will resolve in response to an identified acute insult. In other cases, detection of the first abnormality should trigger an investigation of the aetiology, or repeat testing to assess progression or disease severity where there is a suspicion that the underlying cause may require urgent referral or admission.

### Medical management of severe alcoholic hepatitis: Expert review from the clinical practice updates committee of the AGA Institute [^113tTTo5]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this clinical practice update is to review diagnostic criteria for severe acute alcoholic hepatitis and to determine the best practices for this life-threatening condition. The recommendations in this review are based on clinical trials, systematic reviews including meta-analyses, and expert opinion to develop an approach to diagnosis and management.

- **Best practice advice 1**: Abstinence from drinking alcohol is the cornerstone of treatment for alcoholic hepatitis (AH).

- **Best practice advice 2**: Patients with jaundice and suspected AH should have cultures of blood, urine, and ascites, if present, to determine the presence of bacterial infections regardless of whether they have fever.

- **Best practice advice 3**: Patients with AH who have jaundice should be admitted to the hospital to encourage abstinence, restore adequate nutrition, and exclude serious infections.

- **Best practice advice 4**: Imaging of the liver is warranted as part of the evaluation, but caution should be used in administering iodinated contrast dye, as it increases the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI).

- **Best practice advice 5**: Patients with AH require a diet with 1–1.5 g protein and 30–40 kcal/kg body weight for adequate recovery. If the patient is unable to eat because of anorexia or altered mental status, a feeding tube should be considered for enteral feeding. Parenteral nutrition alone is inadequate.

- **Best practice advice 6**: Severity and prognosis of AH should be evaluated using Maddrey Discriminant Function (MDF), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), age, and bilirubin.
