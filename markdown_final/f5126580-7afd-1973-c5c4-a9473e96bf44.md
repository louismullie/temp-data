## Question

PSA in 40 year old male

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about PSA testing in a 40-year-old man, including whether to test, how to interpret results, and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's baseline risk and how that shifts the threshold for early testing. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about starting PSA at age 40 and in whom. Next, I will examine the prognostic value of a baseline PSA in the 40s and how to interpret common results. After that, I need to outline practical next steps, including when to repeat PSA, when to consider secondary biomarkers or MRI, and when to biopsy. Finally, I should integrate shared decision-making and summarize a risk-adapted plan with concrete intervals and thresholds, making sure I double-check any numeric claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: a 40-year-old man is below the age where routine population screening has proven mortality benefit, so any consideration of PSA at 40 should be individualized and risk-adapted rather than blanket screening, and I need to ensure I anchor this to the highest-quality guidance before moving forward [^08920ec1] [^4314b27c].

> I need to check who is "high risk" at 40 and thus a candidate for earlier discussion and possibly a baseline PSA. The strongest indications include Black ancestry, a strong family history (especially multiple first-degree relatives or early-onset disease), and known pathogenic variants such as BRCA2, with several guidelines supporting consideration of baseline PSA from age 40 to 45 in these groups, whereas average-risk men generally start the conversation later, typically around 45 to 50, and I should confirm that nuance explicitly [^d8e6fb7f] [^0b363d77] [^4314b27c] [^ecb6ad77].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about benefit in younger men. I should verify the evidence base. Large randomized trials demonstrating mortality benefit enrolled men aged 50 to 69, so for 40-year-olds the evidence is indirect and observational; that said, multiple cohorts show that a single baseline PSA in midlife strongly predicts future aggressive cancer, metastasis, and prostate cancer mortality, which is why guidelines allow or support earlier testing in higher-risk men with shared decision-making [^08920ec1] [^4314b27c] [^da314e65] [^33f4a5f8].

> Next, I should review how to interpret a baseline PSA at 40. Median PSA in men in their 40s is roughly 0.4 to 0.7 ng/mL, and values below about 1.0 ng/mL are associated with very low long-term risk of clinically significant disease, whereas values above the age-specific median carry substantially higher future risk; importantly, a PSA around 1.0 ng/mL is not a biopsy threshold but a risk-stratification marker for follow-up intensity, and I need to ensure I don't conflate these concepts [^4314b27c] [^426b8a68] [^33f4a5f8].

> Wait, let me verify the practical cut points and intervals. Many contemporary guidelines endorse a risk-adapted approach: if PSA is less than 1.0 ng/mL at 40, extending the interval before the next PSA to 4 to 8 years is reasonable; if PSA is 1.0 to 2.0 ng/mL, repeating in 2 to 4 years is sensible; if PSA is above 2.0 ng/mL, closer follow-up and consideration of secondary testing are appropriate, recognizing that biopsy decisions still hinge on overall risk and confirmation of elevation rather than a single value [^728a4528] [^574b3055] [^4314b27c].

> I should double-check the action steps after a new elevation. The first rule is to repeat the PSA in a few weeks to months to confirm persistence, because 25% to 40% of isolated elevations normalize on retesting; empiric antibiotics are not recommended for asymptomatic men, and transient causes like recent ejaculation, infection, or instrumentation should be accounted for before labeling an elevation as true [^d7e32915] [^b525b511].

> Let me consider secondary testing before biopsy. If the confirmed PSA is in the 3 to 10 ng/mL range, using a validated risk calculator, obtaining a %free PSA or 4K score, and/or performing prostate MRI can meaningfully refine the probability of clinically significant cancer and reduce unnecessary biopsies; MRI-targeted biopsy when indicated improves detection of significant disease while decreasing low-grade diagnoses, though I should confirm that MRI is not a substitute for repeating a newly elevated PSA [^aaa1b212] [^fdb13c1f] [^d7e32915].

> But wait, what if the patient is average risk and prefers to avoid early testing? I need to ensure shared decision-making captures that screening in the 40s increases detection of low-risk disease and biopsies without proven mortality benefit in this exact age group, so deferring PSA until the mid-40s or later is reasonable; conversely, if the patient is high risk and values early risk stratification, a baseline PSA at 40 to 45 with risk-adapted follow-up can be justified despite the uncertainty [^4314b27c] [^08920ec1] [^ea068a0f].

> I will now examine concrete scenarios to make this actionable. If a 40-year-old Black man with a family history has a baseline PSA of 1.2 ng/mL, I would repeat PSA in 6 to 12 months to confirm, and if sustained or rising, consider %free PSA or 4K score and MRI before biopsy; if a 40-year-old average-risk man has a PSA of 0.6 ng/mL, I would extend the next PSA to around age 45 to 48 and counsel on symptoms; if a 40-year-old with BRCA2 has a PSA of 2.1 ng/mL, I would shorten the interval to 6 to 12 months and proceed to MRI and shared decision-making about biopsy if the elevation persists, aligning with high-risk pathways [^d8e6fb7f] [^574b3055] [^aaa1b212].

> Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating certainty. The balance of benefits and harms for starting at 40 is favorable mainly for those with higher baseline risk, and even then the mortality benefit is inferred rather than proven in randomized trials of 40-year-olds; therefore, documentation of informed consent, clear follow-up plans, and alignment with patient values are essential to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment while capturing the cancers most likely to matter [^08920ec1] [^4314b27c] [^ea068a0f].

> In summary, I need to ensure the plan is risk-adapted and evidence-aligned: for a 40-year-old, do not routinely screen unless the patient is high risk by ancestry, family history, or genetics; if screening is chosen, obtain a baseline PSA, interpret it using age-specific medians and risk strata, repeat any new elevation before further workup, and deploy secondary biomarkers or MRI to refine biopsy decisions; for low-risk results, extend intervals, and for higher-risk results, intensify follow-up, all within a shared decision-making framework that acknowledges uncertainty and patient preferences [^4314b27c] [^574b3055] [^d7e32915] [^aaa1b212].

PSA testing in a 40-year-old male is **not routinely recommended** for average-risk men [^08920ec1] because randomized trials have not shown a mortality benefit in this age group [^notfound]. However, a **baseline PSA at 40–45** can be considered for risk stratification in higher-risk men (Black race, strong family history, or BRCA2 mutation) [^d8e6fb7f] [^4314b27c], as it predicts future risk of aggressive cancer and can guide screening frequency [^33f4a5f8] [^da314e65]. If PSA is < 1 ng/mL, the long-term risk is low and screening intervals can be extended; if PSA is ≥ 1 ng/mL, closer follow-up is reasonable [^728a4528] [^574b3055]. Routine screening should be individualized with shared decision-making, balancing potential benefits against the risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^ea068a0f] [^f6b8865b].

## Normal PSA levels in a 40-year-old male

Median PSA levels in men in their 40s are **approximately 0.4–0.7 ng/mL** [^4314b27c] [^da314e65]. Levels below 1.0 ng/mL are generally considered low risk, whereas levels above the age-specific median (about 0.7 ng/mL) indicate higher future risk of prostate cancer [^426b8a68] [^574b3055].

---

## Clinical significance of PSA levels at age 40

PSA at age 40 has **prognostic value** for future prostate cancer risk, including aggressive disease and mortality [^33f4a5f8] [^7fca3afe]. Men with PSA ≥ 1 ng/mL at 40 have a higher lifetime risk than those with PSA < 1 ng/mL, supporting risk-adapted screening strategies [^426b8a68] [^574b3055].

---

## Benefits and risks of PSA screening at age 40

### Potential benefits

Potential benefits include **early detection** of clinically significant prostate cancer, which may improve outcomes [^a72ea42a], and **risk stratification**, whereby baseline PSA helps tailor future screening intensity to individual risk [^33f4a5f8] [^574b3055].

---

### Potential risks

Potential risks include **overdiagnosis** — detecting indolent cancers unlikely to cause symptoms or death — and **overtreatment**, with treatment-related harms such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction [^ea068a0f] [^b7d9193c]. False positives can also lead to unnecessary biopsies and anxiety [^b525b511].

## Current guidelines and recommendations

| **Organization** | **Recommendation for 40-year-old males** |
|-|-|
| USPSTF | - Routine PSA screening not recommended <br/> - Individualize for high-risk men [^08920ec1] |
| AUA | - Consider baseline PSA at 40–45 for high-risk men <br/> - Shared decision-making emphasized [^4314b27c] [^f6b8865b] |
| EAU | - Risk-adapted screening <br/> - Baseline PSA at 40 for high-risk men [^d8e6fb7f] [^728a4528] |
| NCCN | - Consider early PSA for high-risk men <br/> - Individualize decisions [^1ab0a4a5] |

---

## Risk stratification based on PSA levels

PSA levels at 40 can **guide future screening intensity**:

- **PSA < 1 ng/mL**: Low long-term risk; extend screening intervals [^426b8a68] [^574b3055].
- **PSA 1–2 ng/mL**: Moderate risk; consider closer follow-up [^574b3055].
- **PSA > 2 ng/mL**: Higher risk; consider more frequent screening or further evaluation [^574b3055].

---

## Factors influencing PSA levels

Several factors can **affect PSA levels** in a 40-year-old male:

- **Age**: PSA tends to rise with age, though less pronounced in the 40s [^e4e861c1].
- **Race/ethnicity**: Black men have higher median PSA and cancer risk [^c45934ca] [^6e07e860].
- **Family history**: Strong family history increases risk and may justify earlier testing [^d8e6fb7f] [^ecb6ad77].
- **Lifestyle factors**: Ejaculation, bike riding, and some supplements can transiently elevate PSA [^d7e32915].

---

## Follow-up and management strategies

If PSA is elevated at 40, **repeat PSA testing** should be done to confirm persistence before further workup [^d7e32915]. Use shared decision-making to discuss risks, benefits, and patient preferences [^f6b8865b]. Consider secondary biomarkers (e.g. %free PSA, 4K score) or MRI to refine risk before biopsy [^aaa1b212] [^7007c27b].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

PSA testing at 40 is **not routinely recommended** for average-risk men, but a baseline PSA can be considered for higher-risk individuals to guide future screening [^08920ec1] [^4314b27c]. PSA levels should be interpreted in context, with shared decision-making to balance benefits and harms [^ea068a0f].

### Strategy for detection of prostate cancer based on relation between prostate specific antigen at age 40–55 and long term risk of metastasis: case-control study [^33f4a5f8]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

PSA concentrations can indicate not only the current risk of cancer — and hence the need for prostate biopsy — but are also predictive of the future risk of prostate cancer metastasis and cancer specific death. Screening programmes can be designed to focus on men at highest risk, with three lifetime PSA tests between the ages of 45 and 60 sufficient for at least half of the male population. This is likely to reduce the risk of overdiagnosis while still enabling early cancer detection among those most likely to gain from early diagnosis. As such, a risk stratified approach to PSA screening will improve the ratio of its benefits and harms.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^ecb6ad77]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) recommendations for higher-risk men — The ACS continues to recommend that African American men and men who have a family history of a first-degree relative with prostate cancer be provided information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits surrounding prostate cancer screening beginning at age 45 years. For men who have multiple first-degree relatives diagnosed with prostate cancer before age 65 years, this discussion should take place beginning at age 40 years. For men who choose to be screened, the ACS recommends integrating established risk factors into an individualized risk assessment, particularly when PSA levels fall into what currently would be considered the high-normal range of 2.5 ng/mL to 4.0 ng/mL.

### Who and when should we screen for prostate cancer? Interviews with key opinion leaders [^24b4473c]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Screening for prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is controversial. Screening is currently transitioning from being an all-or-nothing-question, to finding new ways of individualized testing. However, consensus remains to be reached within guideline groups and worldwide experts regarding who – and when – to screen, if at all. In this Q & A, we invite seven of the world's key opinion leaders in the field, both proponents and skeptics, to elaborate on what they believe the current screening policy should be. The authors have all published widely on PSA, and comprise a wide variety of experience in areas such as urology, epidemiology, evidence-based medicine, and medical decision-making.

Currently, only one guideline group, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), recommends against screening for all men. Most other guideline groups recommend shared decision-making, involving a discussion of the pros and cons of screening. To aid in decision-making, some propose using a risk-stratified approach taking into account multiple factors along with a PSA measurement. However, the specifics of such an approach are a subject of debate; for instance, the appropriate age limits of screening remain to be defined. Randomized screening trials, including the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and the Göteborg trial have provided evidence that regular PSA-screening can reduce prostate cancer mortality by 21–44% at 13–14 years of follow-up; the age groups studied in these trials were 55–69 and 50–64 years, respectively. Thus, the question remains regarding the screening of men outside this age range. There is a growing body of evidence on the benefits of commencing screening in the mid-40s. While the American Urological Association (AUA) bases its recommendation on the 55–69 age group based on the ERSPC results, the European Urological Association recommends a baseline PSA be obtained at 40–45 years of age.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^85798bd1]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

PSA thresholds for prompting biopsy — no universal cutoff: In considering whether a biopsy should be performed based on overall or high-grade cancer risk, "no absolute PSA level exists that is applicable to all men". Instead, "the risk level at which a biopsy should be considered should be based on factors related to a man's life expectancy (age, comorbidities) as well as a man's concern regarding his risk", and because detection and treatments can entail harms, "the level of risk at which a biopsy should be undertaken should be based on a man's integration of these considerations into his decision making".

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^da9ad53e]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and cancer risk — historical thresholds and biopsy-era findings: A PSA value of 4.0 ng/mL was accepted as the upper limit of normal, but prostate cancer rates were significant at lower PSA levels (between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL), and men with PSA levels < 2.5 ng/mL were believed to have low risk. With biopsies performed across all PSA levels, PSA "should not be considered 'elevated' or 'normal', because prostate cancer was identified at all levels of PSA, including values < 1.0 ng/mL", and "the higher the PSA, the higher the risk of cancer", with aggressive cancers identified at higher levels.

### Men (aged 40–49 years) with a single baseline prostate-specific antigen below 1.0 ng / mL have a very low long-term risk of prostate cancer: results from a prospectively screened population cohort [^426b8a68]. Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the use of a baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal examination in men (aged 40–49 years) in predicting long-term prostate cancer risk in a prospectively followed, representative population cohort.

Patients and Methods

Since 1990, a random sample of men in Olmsted County (aged 40–49 years) has been followed up prospectively (n = 268), with biennial visits, including a urologic questionnaire, PSA screening, and physical examination. The ensuing risk of prostate cancer (CaP) was compared using survival analyses.

Results

Median follow-up was 16.3 years (interquartile range 14.0–17.3, max 19.1). For men with a baseline PSA < 1.0 ng/mL (n = 195), the risk of subsequent Gleason 6 CaP diagnosis by 55 years was 0.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0%-1.7%) and 15.7% (95% CI 6.5%-24.9%) for men with a baseline PSA ≥ 1.0 ng/mL. No man with a low baseline PSA developed an intermediate or high risk CaP, whereas 2.6% of men with a higher baseline PSA did (95% CI 0.58%-4.6%).

Conclusion

Men (aged 40–49 years) can be stratified with a baseline PSA. If it is below 1.0 ng/mL, there is very little risk for developing a lethal CaP, and as many as 75% of men might be able to avoid additional PSA screening until 55 years. Conversely, men aged 40–49 years with a baseline PSA level > 1.0 ng/mL had a significant risk of CaP diagnosis and should be monitored more closely.

### Prostate specific antigen best practice statement: 2009 update [^830748f3]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

We provide current information on the use of PSA testing for the evaluation of men at risk for prostate cancer, and the risks and benefits of early detection.

Materials and Methods

The report is a summary of the American Urological Association PSA Best Practice Policy 2009. The summary statement is based on a review of the current professional literature, clinical experience and the expert opinions of a multispecialty panel. It is intended to serve as a resource for physicians, other health care professionals, and patients. It does not establish a fixed set of guidelines, define the legal standard of care or pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases.

Results

There are two notable differences in the current policy. First, the age for obtaining a baseline PSA has been lowered to 40 years. Secondly, the current policy no longer recommends a single, threshold value of PSA, which should prompt prostate biopsy. Rather, the decision to proceed to prostate biopsy should be based primarily on PSA and DRE results, but should take into account multiple factors including free and total PSA, patient age, PSA velocity, PSA density, family history, ethnicity, prior biopsy history and comorbidities.

Conclusions

Although recently published trials show different results regarding the impact of prostate cancer screening on mortality, both suggest that prostate cancer screening leads to overdetection and overtreatment of some patients. Therefore, men should be informed of the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening before biopsy and the option of active surveillance in lieu of immediate treatment for certain men diagnosed with prostate cancer.

### Strategy for detection of prostate cancer based on relation between prostate specific antigen at age 40–55 and long term risk of metastasis: case-control study [^c49de2cb]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Overview of findings

PSA concentration can be used to predict of long term risk of metastasis or death from prostate cancer. It can identify a small group of men at greatly increased risk compared with a much larger group highly unlikely to develop prostate cancer morbidity if rescreening is delayed for seven or eight years. As PSA screening was extremely rare in this cohort, our findings can be used to design screening programmes by determining the age at which men should start to undergo screening and the interval between screenings. Men at low risk of death from prostate cancer without screening have little to gain from being screened but still risk overdiagnosis and overtreatment; men likely to die from prostate cancer without screening could avoid cancer specific mortality if they choose to be screened.

In an earlier paper, we showed that PSA concentration at age 60 had a strong association with the risk of death from prostate cancer by age 85 (AUC 0.90), with extremely low risk (≤ 0.2%) in men with PSA concentration below the median (≤ 1.0 µg/L). Taken together with our current data, this suggests a simple algorithm for prostate screening. All men with a reasonable life expectancy could be invited for PSA screening in their mid to late 40s. Men with a PSA concentration < 1.0 µg/L would be advised to return for screening in their early 50s and then again at age 60, whereas men with PSA ≥ 1.0 µg/L would return for more frequent screening, with literature suggesting repeat tests every two or four years. The choice of 1.0 µg/L as a tentative threshold might vary according to preference. At age 60, men with PSA at median or lower — that is, ≤ 1.0 µg/L (or possibly below the highest quarter, ≤ 2.0 µg/L, depending on preference) — would then be exempted from further screening; men with a higher concentration would continue to undergo screening until around 70. Particular focus should be placed on men in the highest 10% of PSA concentrations at age 45–55, who will contribute close to half of all deaths from prostate cancer occurring before the age of 70–75. Some of these men will have concentrations above current thresholds for consideration of biopsy — such as 3 µg/L — and should be referred to a urologist. The remaining men could be told that, although they will probably not die from prostate cancer (with a mean risk of metastasis within 25 years close to 10%), they are at much higher risk than average and that it is especially important that they return for regular, frequent, and possibly more elaborate screening. It is also worth considering whether management of these men should become proactive, with reminder letters and attempts to follow-up non-compliers by telephone. Most importantly, the proposed PSA concentration of 1.0 µg/L to discriminate a low from a higher risk group is not suggested to serve as an indication for biopsy but rather be used to determine the frequency and intensity of subsequent monitoring.

### Update on PSA testing [^9dc2a0b8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2007). Low credibility.

The use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer screening has increased dramatically over the past decade. Determining the most efficient way to use PSA testing and how to interpret total PSA levels and changes in PSA values over time remain challenging. Guidelines for early detection of prostate cancer have a direct impact on the number of unnecessary tests performed and are critical for developing a successful screening approach for prostate cancer. The age at which PSA screening should begin, PSA testing intervals, and the importance of understanding fluctuations in PSA values over time are discussed in the framework of recent discoveries in the field. Results from ongoing randomized trials will confirm whether prostate cancer screening is an effective method for reducing deaths from prostate cancer and what approaches will provide the most cost-effective screening strategies.

Table 4
Proportion of deaths or metastases from prostate cancer captured by respective categories of increased concentrations of PSA at age 45–49 or 51–55

Given that these lower risk men cannot be exempted from subsequent screening, our next question concerned the appropriate screening interval. Figure 1, table 2, and table 3 show that the absolute risk of metastasis remains low within 15 years' follow-up for men with lower PSA concentrations (that is, age median or lower). One possible cut point to determine more versus less frequent screening would be ≤ 1.0 µg/L: the risk of metastasis within 15 years is no higher than 0.4% (table 2) for any cohort, suggesting that a screening interval less than five years for these men is unnecessary. The proportions of men with PSA ≤ 1.0 µg/L were 73% and 59% at age 45–49 and 51–55, respectively; 56% had PSA ≤ 1.0 µg/L at both time points.

Figure 2 and table 4 examine our objective concerning risk concentration: 44% (95% confidence interval 34% to 53%) of deaths within 25–30 years were in men in the highest 10th of PSA concentrations (≥ 1.6 µg/L) at age 45–49, with a similar proportion in the highest 10th (≥ 2.4 µg/L) at age 51–55. This suggests that close to half of all prostate cancers destined to lead to death would be detected early by careful surveillance of a small high risk subgroup.

As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated analyses using different age ranges, such as 42.5–47.5 (to assess the characteristics of PSA at age 45). No result was materially affected. We also examined the predictive accuracy of a model including both PSA and PSA velocity compared with PSA alone in men with a second sample. PSA velocity did not improve prediction of death from prostate cancer. Even after we excluded patients with outlying values, the C index increased by only 0.002.

### Baseline prostate-specific antigen compared with median prostate-specific antigen for age group as predictor of prostate cancer risk in men younger than 60 years old [^189639cc]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Limited data are available concerning the extent to which the initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement in men younger than age 60 predicts for the risk of prostate cancer (CaP) and how this compares to other known risk factors.

Methods

From 1991 to 2001, 13,943 men younger than 60 years old participated in a CaP screening study. Men aged 40 to 49 years were eligible for the study if they had a positive family history or African-American heritage, and men older than 50 years were screened without respect to risk factors. The CaP detection rate, PSA velocity, pathologic features, and treatment outcomes were evaluated as a function of the baseline PSA level.

Results

The median PSA level was 0.7 ng/mL for men aged 40 to 49 years and 0.9 ng/mL for men aged 50 to 59. A baseline PSA level between the median and 2.5 ng/mL was associated with a 14.6-fold and 7.6-fold increased risk of CaP in men aged 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 years, respectively. A greater baseline PSA value was also associated with a significantly greater PSA velocity, more aggressive tumor features, a greater biochemical progression rate, and a trend toward a greater cancer-specific mortality rate.

Conclusions

In men younger than 60, a baseline PSA value between the age-specific median and 2.5 ng/mL was a significant predictor of later CaP and was associated with a significantly greater PSA velocity. A young man's baseline PSA value was a stronger predictor of CaP than family history, race, or suspicious digital rectal examination findings. A greater baseline PSA level was associated with significantly more adverse pathologic features and biochemical progression.

### Prostate-specific antigen at or before age 50 as a predictor of advanced prostate cancer diagnosed up to 25 years later: a case-control study [^7fca3afe]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

A PSA level measured at a single occasion in blood drawn at age up to 50 is a very strong predictor of being diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer up to 25 years later. This raises the possibility that screening for prostate cancer could be risk-stratified so that men at highest risk are the focus of the most intensive screening efforts.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline part I: prostate cancer screening [^4314b27c]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

AUA/SUO prostate cancer screening — baseline PSA initiation in midlife states: Clinicians may begin prostate cancer screening and offer a baseline PSA test to people between ages 45 to 50 years. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). For people at average risk, there is no randomized evidence showing a benefit to initiation of routine screening before 45 years of age, and trials demonstrating benefit began at ages 50 and 55 years, respectively. Observational studies have demonstrated a prognostic value of obtaining a baseline PSA in early midlife; a review of eight PSA studies in younger people showed baseline PSA measurements were robust predictors of aggressive prostate cancer, metastasis, and disease-specific mortality many years later, and baseline PSA was a stronger predictor of prostate cancer risk than race and family history. Reported median PSA levels ranged from ~0.4 to 0.7 ng/mL in patients in their 40s and from ~0.7 to 1 ng/mL in patients in their 50s. The prevalence of prostate cancer is low among patients aged 40 to 45 years, and modeling shows that lowering the screening start age to 40 to 45 years instead of 50 to 55 years slightly increased the probability of lives saved, but substantially increased the number of PSA tests.

### Strategy for detection of prostate cancer based on relation between prostate specific antigen at age 40–55 and long term risk of metastasis: case-control study [^da57c9cf]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Screening for prostate cancer with the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test became widespread long before the availability of randomised evidence as to its value. There is now evidence that PSA screening is associated with reduced mortality from prostate cancer in men who would not otherwise be screened, although this comes at considerable harms in terms of the number of men who need to be screened, undergo biopsy, and be treated to prevent one man experiencing prostate cancer metastasis or dying.

That said, PSA screening is not a single intervention and men can be screened in different ways. There is surprisingly little evidence to support many aspects of contemporary screening guidelines. In particular, the age at which screening starts and the frequency of PSA testing is rarely justified in terms of empirical data. Recent evidence has suggested that a single PSA measurement can predict the long term risk of clinically relevant prostate cancer. This suggests that a baseline concentration could be used to determine whether a man might benefit from subsequent PSA tests and, if so, when these should be administered.

We used data from the Malmö Preventive Project cohort to develop an evidence based schema for prostate cancer testing. We retrospectively analysed PSA in previously unthawed, archived, anticoagulated blood plasma obtained at baseline from a large highly representative population based cohort of men who had not been screened for PSA and had been followed for 25–30 years. As such, the cohort provides a "natural experiment" for investigating the association between PSA and long term prostate cancer outcomes.

Using this cohort, we previously showed that PSA concentration at age 60 can predict the risk of death from prostate cancer by age 85 (AUC of 0.90). In particular, the 25 year risk of death from prostate cancer in men with PSA below the median (≤ 1 µg/L) is low (0.2%) and suggests that half of the men at age 60 could be exempt from further screening. We determined the risk of metastasis or death from prostate cancer within 25–30 years based on PSA measured close to the time when screening is normally recommended to begin. As there was little screening for prostate cancer in our cohort, these results can be used to determine which men are most likely to benefit from screening.

### Viewpoint: expanding prostate cancer screening [^a7b72074]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer screening is controversial, and major professional associations offer differing screening guidelines. The authors address 3 key issues about prostate cancer screening: 1) the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria to recommend a prostate biopsy, 2) the appropriate age to start screening, and 3) the appropriate age to stop screening. The authors argue, on the basis of evidence published since 2000, that data supporting the efficacy of PSA screening are convincing. They recommend screening for risk assessment for average-risk men beginning at age 40 years, screening selected healthy men older than age 70 years, and lowering the PSA threshold for considering biopsy to 2.5 ng/mL for all men.

### Baseline prostate-specific antigen testing at a young age [^da314e65]. European Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Prostate cancer screening is highly controversial, including the age to begin prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. Several studies have evaluated the usefulness of baseline PSA measurements at a young age.

Objective

Review the literature on baseline PSA testing at a young age (≤ 60 yr) for the prediction of prostate cancer risk and prognosis.

Evidence Acquisition

PubMed was searched for English-language publications on baseline PSA and prostate cancer for the period ending April 2011.

Evidence Synthesis

In most published series, median PSA levels in the general male population range from approximately 0.4 to 0.7 ng/ml in men in their 40s and from approximately 0.7 to 1.0 ng/ml in men in their 50s. Evidence from both nonscreening and screening populations has demonstrated the predictive value of a single baseline PSA measurement for prostate cancer risk assessment. Specifically, men with baseline PSA levels above the age-group-specific median have a greater risk of prostate cancer diagnosis during the next 20–25 yr. Additional studies confirmed that higher baseline PSA levels at a young age are also associated with a greater risk of aggressive disease, metastasis, and disease-specific mortality many years later.

Conclusions

Baseline PSA measurements at a young age are significant predictors of later prostate cancer diagnosis and disease-specific outcomes. Thus baseline PSA testing may be used for risk stratification and to guide screening protocols.

### Men under the age of 55 years with screen detected prostate cancer do not have less significant disease compared to older men in a population of patients in Australia [^8af1706f]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) testing remains controversial with a diverse range of recommendations on whom to offer testing to amongst authorities worldwide. In 2013, the American Urological Association (AUA) changed their PSA testing guidelines to not recommend testing in men under 55 years of age without significant risk factors (such as a family history of prostate cancer or African ethnicity). This is in contrast to the 2009 AUA guidelines that recommended PSA screening start at 40 years. The AUA argues that the rates of 'insignificant' prostate cancer in men under 55 are so high that the potential harms of PSA-testing in this population (over diagnosis and overtreatment) outweigh the benefits (early detection and treatment). The concept of insignificant prostate cancer is evolving but generally refers to a low grade, small volume, organ confined prostate cancer that is unlikely to manifest clinically in a patient's lifetime without treatment.

Furthermore, the AUA cites a lack of high-quality evidence to support PSA screening in men 40–55 years. Specifically, two recently performed large randomized clinical trials– the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer screening trial (PLCO) and European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) did not include men under 55 years and therefore do not inform the decision.

In light of the AUA guideline changes, we aim to identify the rates of insignificant and high-risk prostate cancer in men diagnosed with prostate cancer in two centres in Sydney, Australia. In contrast to the AUA, we hypothesise that there is no significant difference between the rates of insignificant and high-risk cancer between men ≤ 55 years and > 55 years.

What is the value of screening for prostate cancer among men at high risk?

The value of screening for prostate cancer in the general population is controversial. Three large randomized controlled trials of PSA screening and mortality produced mixed results. The European ERSPC study and the Gotenberg study found a 20–30% and 52% reduction in prostate cancer mortality respectively, whereas the US PLCO trial showed no mortality difference between the treatment and control arms. The US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends a discussion of the risks and benefits of PSA screening in men aged between 55 and 69 (and against screening for men over 70). The NCCN recommends that men with a germline mutation that increases the risk for prostate cancer consider annual PSA screening from age 40 (NCCN Guidelines V 2.2021 Prostate Cancer Early Detection). The NCCN also recommends annual screening in men with a family history and men of African descent from age 40, but notes that the evidence does not show a mortality benefit associated with earlier screening. The American Cancer Society recommends starting a discussion about screening at the age of 40 for men at high risk, including those with more than one first-degree relative who had prostate cancer at an early age (a very small group).

The IMPACT study targets PSA screening specifically for male BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers (and controls) between ages 40 and 69. A biopsy is offered for those with a PSA > 3.0 ng/ml. A preliminary analysis demonstrated that men who carry a BRCA2 mutation have a higher incidence of prostate cancer, a younger age at diagnosis and more clinically significant tumours than noncarrier controls. The IMPACT study group concluded that men who carry a BRCA2 mutation should be offered annual PSA screening, but further follow-up is needed for BRCA1 carriers.

To some extent, the impact of PSA screening is limited by the sensitivity of the test and the possibility of diagnosing indolent disease. Alternative screening modalities include multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Segal et al. screened 188 BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers with no previous prostate biopsy with PSA and MRI. Sixteen prostate cancers (8.5%) were diagnosed at the initial round of screening. MRI screening only missed one cancer (6%), while the PSA test alone missed five (31%). Further follow-up is needed to determine if there is an effect on mortality. The utility of screening in carriers will be determined when a large number of men who are identified to be at high risk are screened and followed.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^20e7557b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy — prostate cancer screening and monitoring when considering treatment: The baseline evaluation should identify and exclude men with a history of prostate cancer or those at high risk, and organizations strongly encourage shared decision making regarding screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and digital rectal examination (DRE). Clinicians should consider screening and monitoring for all hypogonadal men who are 55 to 69 years of age, are being considered for T-replacement therapy, are in excellent health, and have a life expectancy > 10 years. This should start at age 40 in higher-risk men (such as African Americans and those with a first-degree male relative with prostate cancer). Men < 40 years do not need prostate monitoring, and in men diagnosed > 70 years of age, the risk of death from prostate cancer is not high enough to warrant monitoring. Baseline risk assessment should consider age, family history, race, prior biopsy, elevated PSA, and examination findings; clinicians can estimate risk using a prostate cancer risk calculator.

### 2008 US preventive services task force recommendations and prostate cancer screening rates… [^21c99f7d]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor: The US Preventive Services Task Force recently drafted a grade D recommendation against prostate-specific antigen –based screening for prostate cancer. 1 If this recommendation becomes final, how it will affect clinical practice remains unclear. In 2008, the USPSTF issued a grade D recommendation against PSA-based screening in men aged 75 years or older. 2 We evaluated changes in national screening rates before and after this recommendation. For this study men aged 40 years or older without prostate cancer or other prostate-related conditions who visited a physician in the prior year were included. The NHIS contains 13 questions on timing and reason for PSA testing. Men were asked "What was the main reason you had this PSA test — was it part of a routine exam, because of a problem, or some other reason". The final cohort had 5332 men from 2005 and 4640 men from 2010.

The PSA screening rates were unchanged in all age groups over time. In men aged 75 years or older, PSA screening was unchanged between 2005 and 2010. In 2010, PSA screening was more common in men aged 75 years or older than in men aged 40 to 49 years and 50 to 59 years but not in men aged 60 to 74 years. Large population-based studies have demonstrated PSA screening in men aged 75 years or older is inappropriately high given the limited likelihood of benefit. 4, 5 Despite the USPSTF recommendation against prostate cancer screening in men aged 75 years or older in 2008, PSA screening rates did not change. Our findings must be interpreted within the context of the study design.

### Lifetime benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen–based risk-stratified screening for prostate cancer [^08788544]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2020). Medium credibility.

It has long been understood that controlling the harm–benefit trade-off of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening is critical for its sustainability. Strategies for reducing harms while preserving benefits include screening less frequently, using higher thresholds for biopsy referral in older men, and tailoring screening algorithms by PSA level.

The recommendation to stratify screening by PSA level is largely based on studies that stored ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid plasma in an unscreened cohort of Swedish men aged 44–60 years in the 1980s. Prostate cancer cases diagnosed up to 25 years later had statistically significantly higher PSA levels at their baseline blood draw than those not diagnosed. There was also a strong association between baseline PSA and prostate cancer mortality: 44% of prostate cancer deaths occurred in men with PSA in the top 10% of the PSA distribution at ages 44–49 years. In addition, only 0.2% of men with PSA below 1.0 ng/mL at age 60 years died from prostate cancer within 25 years. Other studies, including screened and unscreened cohorts, have confirmed that baseline PSA predicts the risk of future prostate cancer diagnosis or prostate cancer death. These studies have motivated proposals to tailor the screening intensity to a man's current PSA level. However, the implications of such stratified policies for clinically important outcomes, such as prostate cancer deaths or overdiagnosis, compared with current practices have not been evaluated. Despite this, some guidelines are already incorporating PSA-stratified screening. The European Association of Urology guideline states that targeting men at a higher risk of prostate cancer (older than age 50 years, or with PSA > 1.0 ng/mL at age 40 years, or > 2.0 ng/mL at age 60 years) might reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies. The American Urological Association guideline suggests that baseline PSA may be used to guide alternative screening strategies that screen less frequently.

### Who and when should we screen for prostate cancer? Interviews with key opinion leaders [^5bb8334d]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Our personal view is that PSA screening should indeed involve shared decision-making, but we believe the focus should primarily be on behavior, rather than preference. For this purpose, we have published a decision-support tool called the 'Simple Schema', which acknowledges that the majority of harms of screening result from unnecessary treatment of low-risk disease and therefore focuses on the importance of active surveillance as the appropriate, evidence-based management strategy for low-risk cancer. We further believe that PSA screening should be a risk-stratified approach aimed at detecting lethal prostate cancer. This is based on evidence that only a small proportion of men with moderately elevated PSA have aggressive disease and that overdiagnosis is strongly influenced by age and PSA levels. For instance, we have shown that almost half of the excess incidence of cancer associated with PSA testing occurs in men over 70 – a group in which screening is likely of little, if any, benefit – and that the effects of screening men in their 60s is highly dependent on their PSA level, with an excellent ratio of harms to benefits in patients with PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL but zero benefit in patients with a lower PSA. Therefore, the current guidelines in place at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center restrict screening in men over 60 to those with above average PSAs and dramatically restrict screening in men over 70 to a small number of men with exceptional health and high PSA. Additionally, biopsy is recommended only after a repeat PSA and further work-up, and the frequency of screening is stratified depending on baseline PSA, which has been shown to be a very strong predictor of long-term prostate cancer metastasis and death.

We were interested in hearing the experts elaborate on these nuances of screening as we believe this would help us forward in striving to identify the group of men who might benefit from screening and those who might not.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^975eef6f]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

How this recommendation was created

Our international panel included patient partners (men at risk of prostate cancer), general practitioners, general internists, urologists, epidemiologists, methodologists, and statisticians. They determined the scope of the question that the recommendation should address and what outcomes are most important to patients considering screening.

No person had financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimised and managed (see appendix 1 on bmj.com).

The panel identified eight critical outcomes needed to inform the recommendations: all-cause mortality; prostate cancer mortality; incidence of prostate cancer diagnoses (all stages); incidence of localised cancer (stage I and II); incidence of advanced cancer (stage III and IV); complications from biopsies (such as bleeding, pain, infections, and hospital readmissions), complications from prostate cancer treatment (such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction); and quality of life. The panel also identified three additional patient-important outcomes: false positive rates (men with elevated PSA levels who will have negative biopsy); false negative rates (men with a normal PSA result who will subsequently be diagnosed with cancer), and the anxiety and uncertainty related to concerns about having prostate cancer. The panel asked that potential subgroups effects be explored according to age, screening interval, family history, being of African descent, and being of lower socioeconomic level. They also asked for a sensitivity analysis of the effect of screening restricted to trials at lower risk of bias.

To inform the recommendation, the panel members requested two systematic reviews, on the following questions:

What are the benefits and harms of PSA screening versus no screening?
What evidence describes the values and preference of men considering PSA screening?

Two parallel teams conducted these systematic reviews, which are linked to this publication.

The panel met to discuss the evidence and formulate a recommendation. They followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy recommendation, including use of the GRADE approach to interpret the evidence and create recommendations (see appendix 2 on bmj.com). The panel considered the balance of benefits, harms, and burdens of PSA screening; the quality of the evidence for each outcome; and typical and expected variations in patient values and preferences, as well as feasibility and acceptability. Recommendations can be strong or weak, for or against a course of action. The recommendations take a patient centred perspective which de-emphasises public health, societal, and health payer point of view.

### Risk of prostate cancer for young men with a prostate specific antigen less than their age specific median [^d317bb73]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

We previously reported that the median prostate specific antigen for men 40 to 49 years old is 0.7 ng/ml and that a baseline prostate specific antigen between 0.7 and 2.5 ng/ml is associated with a 14.6-fold increased risk of prostate cancer. Although this suggests the need for close followup of men in their 40s with a prostate specific antigen level greater than 0.7 ng/ml, the appropriate screening strategy for men with a level less than the age specific median is unclear.

Materials and Methods

From a large prostate cancer screening study 581 participants 40 to 49 years old with a baseline prostate specific antigen level less than 0.7 ng/ml were identified. All men were classified as high risk due to a positive family history and/or black heritage. Changes in prostate specific antigen over time, the cancer detection rate and pathological tumor features were examined as a function of the baseline prostate specific antigen.

Results

At a median followup of 13 months 2 patients with an initial prostate specific antigen level less than 0.7 ng/ml reached the threshold for biopsy, and a single patient was diagnosed with prostate cancer. A significantly greater proportion of men with a baseline prostate specific antigen level greater than the age specific median had a prostate specific antigen velocity greater than 0.75 ng/ml per year (9% vs 3%, p = 0.009) and were diagnosed with prostate cancer before age 50 (4.6% vs 0.16%, p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Men 40 to 49 years old with a prostate specific antigen less than the age specific median have a low risk of prostate cancer in the short term. Performing a baseline prostate specific antigen measurement in the fifth decade led to few additional biopsies, and was extremely useful for risk stratification since men with levels greater or less than the age specific median had strikingly different risk profiles.

### Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test-NCI… [^90ddbdfb]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

What is the PSA test. Prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, is a protein produced by normal, as well as malignant, cells of the prostate gland. Both prostate cancer and several benign conditions can cause PSA levels in the blood to rise. Some organizations do recommend that men who are at higher risk of prostate cancer have routine PSA testing, beginning at age 40 or 45. Those at higher risk include Black men, men with inherited variants in BRCA2, and men whose father or brother had prostate cancer. The current recommendation of the United States Preventive Serves Task Force, which applies both to the general population and to those at increased risk due to race/ethnicity or family history, is as follows:

- For individuals aged 55 to 69 years, the decision to undergo periodic PSA-based screening for prostate cancer should be an individual one.

Before making the decision, a person should discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician and consider these in the context of their own values and preferences.
- PSA-based screening for prostate cancer is not recommended for individuals 70 years and older. Currently, Medicare provides coverage for an annual PSA test for all Medicare-eligible individuals over 50. Many private insurers cover PSA screening as well. What is a normal PSA test result. There is no single threshold that distinguishes a normal versus an abnormal PSA result. This is in part because there is no specific PSA level that means that someone has prostate cancer. However, the higher someone's PSA level, the likelier it is that prostate cancer is present. In general, a PSA level above 4. 0 ng/mL is considered abnormal and may result in a recommendation for prostate biopsy.

However, because PSA levels increase with age, some doctors apply a higher cutoff for older men and a lower cutoff for younger men. However, a single elevated PSA measurement in someone who has a history of prostate cancer does not always mean that the cancer has come back. Someone who has been treated for prostate cancer should discuss an elevated PSA level with their doctor. The doctor may recommend repeating the PSA test or performing other tests to check for evidence of a recurrence. The doctor may look for a trend of rising PSA level over time rather than a single elevated PSA level.

Prostate cancer screening — age-related evidence scope and counseling: The 3 large randomized clinical trials predominantly included men aged 55 to 69 years. There is inadequate evidence on starting screening at a younger age or to obtain a baseline PSA level, and evidence in men 70 years or older does not support routine screening. Although some older men may request screening, men older than 70 years who request screening should be aware of the reduced likelihood of benefit and the increased risk of false-positive test results and complications of diagnosis and treatment.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline part I: prostate cancer screening [^4f618112]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

AUA/SUO prostate cancer screening — PSA thresholds and age-specific cutoffs note that the definition of an elevated PSA has changed over time, with a commonly cited threshold of 4 ng/mL based on early studies and another cited threshold of 3 ng/mL from ERSPC. The knowledge that PSA generally increases with age in people without prostate cancer has led to the consensus that the threshold above which a PSA level should be considered elevated should increase with age, and that the original threshold of 4 ng/mL is too high for people in their 40s and 50s and too low for people in their 70s and 80s who have a high risk of overdiagnosis. Most studies identifying age-varying thresholds specify threshold values of 2.5 ng/mL for people in their 40s, 3.5 ng/mL for people in their 50s, 4.5 ng/mL for people in their 60s, and 6.5 ng/mL for people in their 70s.

|Family history of prostate cancer|- From 45 years of age|

### Variation of serum prostate-specific antigen levels: an evaluation of year-to-year fluctuations [^b525b511]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is frequently used in early detection programs for prostate cancer. While PSA testing has resulted in an increase in prostate cancer detection, its routine use has been questioned because of a lack of specificity.

Objective

To determine whether year-to-year fluctuations in PSA levels are due to natural variation and render a single PSA test result unreliable.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective analysis of an unscreened population of 972 men (median age, 62 years) participating in the Polyp Prevention Trial (1991–1998). Five consecutive blood samples were obtained during a 4-year period and were assessed for total and free PSA levels.

Main Outcome Measure

Abnormal PSA test result based on a PSA level higher than 4 ng/mL; a PSA level higher than 2.5 ng/mL; a PSA level above the age-specific cutoff; a PSA level in the range of 4 to 10 ng/mL and a free-to-total ratio of less than 0.25 ng/mL; or a PSA velocity higher than 0.75 ng/mL per year.

Results

Prostate biopsy would have been recommended in 207 participants (21%) with a PSA level higher than 4 ng/mL; in 358 (37%) with a level higher than 2.5 ng/mL; in 172 (18%) with a level above the age-specific cutoff; in 190 (20%) with a level between 4 and 10 ng/mL and a free-to-total ratio of less than 0.25 ng/mL; and in 145 (15%) with a velocity higher than 0.75 ng/mL per year. Among men with an abnormal PSA finding, a high proportion had a normal PSA finding at 1 or more subsequent visits during 4-year follow-up: 68 (44%) of 154 participants with a PSA level higher than 4 ng/mL; 116 (40%) of 291 had a level higher than 2.5 ng/mL; 64 (55%) of 117 had an elevated level above the age-specific cutoff; and 76 (53%) of 143 had a level between 4 and 10 ng/mL and a free-to-total ratio of less than 0.25 ng/mL.

Conclusion

An isolated elevation in PSA level should be confirmed several weeks later before proceeding with further testing, including prostate biopsy.

### Strategy for detection of prostate cancer based on relation between prostate specific antigen at age 40–55 and long term risk of metastasis: case-control study [^56e13384]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Fig 1 Cumulative incidence of evidence of metastasis or death from prostate cancer by centile of PSA concentration at various ages

Our second objective was to determine whether men with PSA concentrations below the median in their mid to late 40s could be exempted from further screening. Although the absolute risk of metastasis within 25 years for men with PSA below median at age 45–49 was 0.85%, with a corresponding estimate for men aged 51–55 of 1.63% (fig 1, table 2, and table 3), a substantial proportion (28%, 95% confidence interval 22% to 35%) of the men with evidence of prostate cancer metastases at long term follow-up (median 27 years) had PSA concentration below median (< 0.68 µg/L) at age 45–49, while 18% (95% confidence interval 10% to 26%) had PSA below median (< 0.85 µg/L) at age 51–55 (table 4). These estimates seem too high to conclude that any subsequent PSA based screening would not be necessary for men with PSA below median before age 55. Furthermore, the Lorenz curves in figure 2clearly illustrate the difficulty to determine any particular PSA concentration at age 45–49 or 51–55 below which the proportion of men dying from prostate cancer by 30 years' follow-up would be sufficiently low to conclude that subsequent PSA testing would not be necessary.

Better use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for early detection coupled with imaging and biomarkers to improve specificity should decrease the risk of over-detection, and this reduced over-detection along with active surveillance in appropriate patients should reduce overtreatment AND preserve the relatively low rates of prostate cancer mortality.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^dc278201]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society prostate cancer early detection — PSA thresholds and shared decision-making are outlined as follows: we continue to recommend that men who are at greater risk for developing prostate cancer at earlier ages — African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer in nonelderly relatives — should be provided the opportunity for informed decision-making at a younger age than men who are at average risk. Recognizing that lowering the PSA threshold for biopsy will increase the rate of overdiagnosis, we consider the traditional PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL to be a reasonable threshold for further evaluation. Acknowledging that there is no true PSA cutoff point that distinguishes cancer from noncancer, we suggest that providers consider individualized decision making when PSA levels fall in the indeterminate range between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL, particularly in men who are at increased risk for high-grade cancer based on non-PSA risk factors. Until that time, however, it will remain incumbent on health care providers and the health care system as a whole to provide men with the opportunity to decide whether they wish to pursue early detection of prostate cancer.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening interval evidence and modeling — Although many U.S. men are tested annually, there is no strong evidence to recommend one interscreening interval over another, and different intervals have not been compared in a randomized controlled trial setting. The ERSPC had a screening interval of 4 years (and a PSA threshold level for biopsy of 3.0 ng/mL) in most centers, and these results provide support for a benefit of screening less frequently than every year. Modeling studies project that screening every 2 years would reduce tests and unnecessary biopsies by 50% while retaining 93% of the years of life saved; another model showed almost 50% fewer tests and unnecessary biopsies and reduced overdiagnosis by 13% while retaining 87% of the years of life saved; a third model retained 95% of the years of life saved. All assumed a PSA cutoff of 4.0 ng/mL with screening starting at 50 years, and one showed similar results starting at 40 years. The average delay in diagnosis when moving from annual screening to every 2 years is estimated as between 5 months and 6 months. In men with very low PSA levels, conversion to a PSA above 4.0 ng/mL within 2 years or even 4 years after the initial test is very unlikely; for example, with an initial PSA < 1.0 ng/mL, only 0.24% had a positive test (PSA > 4 ng/mL) the following year and 0.51% at 2 years, whereas with an initial PSA of 1 ng/mL or 2 ng/mL, only 1.2% were positive at 1 year and 2.6% at 2 years.

### Prostate cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^14b8272f]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Patient selection — Epstein criteria for pathologically "insignificant" (very-low-risk) prostate cancer — identify disease by clinical stage T1c, biopsy Grade Group 1, the presence of disease in fewer than 3 biopsy cores, ≤ 50% prostate cancer involvement in any core, and PSA density < 0.15 ng/mL/g; physicians are cautioned against using these as the sole decision maker because as many as 8% of cancers qualifying as insignificant were not organ-confined. A consensus of the NCCN Guidelines Panel was reached that insignificant prostate cancer, especially when detected early using serum PSA, poses little threat to individuals with a life expectancy of less than 20 years, and lead time bias from PSA early detection ranges from an estimated 12.3 years in a 55-year-old individual to 6 years in a 75-year-old individual.

### Men under the age of 55 years with screen detected prostate cancer do not have less significant disease compared to older men in a population of patients in Australia [^26e23b74]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Larger studies need to be designed to assess whether our findings remain consistent, particularly amongst different geographical/ethnic populations. Future trails should include men > 40 years to more thoroughly assess prostate cancer screening benefits in terms of prostate cancer-specific mortality. Ideally, there would be exclusion of subjects with a family history of prostate cancer- as this is a known prostate cancer risk factor that alters PSA screening choice. Nevertheless, it is estimated that only 5–10% of prostate cancer is related to a positive family history and this would not explain the similarities in rates of high-risk prostate cancer in men ≤ 55 and > 55 years in our study.

Limitations of this study include reliance on a third-party for availability of recorded and collected data. There were cases of missing subject data that resulted in the exclusion of some participants. Ideally, there would be an equal sample size of men ≤ 55 and > 55 years in the study, however if consecutive subjects are chosen this is challenging to accomplish as more men > 55 years have PSA testing and prostate biopsies. Screening calculators such as the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) screening calculator may be used for an individualised assessment of prostate cancer risk.

### Ethnic differences in prostate-specific antigen levels in men without prostate cancer: a systematic review [^c45934ca]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Black men are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer than White men. Raised prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels can indicate an increased risk of prostate cancer, however it is not known whether PSA levels differ for men of different ethnic groups.

Methods

PubMed and Embase were searched to identify studies that reported levels of PSA for men of at least two ethnic groups without a prostate cancer diagnosis or symptoms suggestive of prostate cancer. An adaptation of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess risk of bias and study quality. Findings were stratified into the following broad ethnic groups: White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, and Other. Data were analysed in a narrative synthesis due to the heterogeneity of reported PSA measures and methods in the included studies.

Results

A total of 654 197 males from 13 studies were included. By ethnicity, this included 536 201 White (82%), 38 287 Black (6%), 38 232 Asian (6%), 18 029 Pacific Island (3%), 13 614 Maori (2%), 8 885 Hispanic (1%), and 949 Other (< 1%) men aged ≥ 40 years old. Black men had higher PSA levels than White men, and Hispanic men had similar levels to White men and lower levels than Black men.

Conclusions

Black men without prostate cancer have higher PSA levels than White or Hispanic men, which reflects the higher rates of prostate cancer diagnosis in Black men. Despite that, the diagnostic accuracy of PSA for prostate cancer for men of different ethnic groups is unknown, and current guidance for PSA test interpretation does not account for ethnicity. Future research needs to determine whether Black men are diagnosed with similar rates of clinically significant prostate cancer to White men, or whether raised PSA levels are contributing to overdiagnosis of prostate cancer in Black men.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, high-risk population, ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining early PSA screening (baseline PSA followed by risk-adapted follow-up) in males aged > 50 years, or earlier in individuals with any of the following:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Family history of prostate cancer|- > 45 years of age|
|African-Americans|- > 45 years of age|

### Prostate-specific antigen testing in men aged 40–64 years: impact of publication of clinical trials [^a9cbf12b]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

We assessed the impact of the publication of trials and changes in recommendations on the rates of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in men aged 40 to 64 years by analyzing monthly medical claims for PSA testing in a commercial insurance database from 2001 to 2011, covering more than 1.5 million men in each year. The testing rates for men aged 40 to 49 years, 50 to 59 years, and 60 to 64 years were 12.1%, 32.7%, and 42.7%, respectively, in 2001 vs 15.7%, 34.2%, and 42.0%, respectively, in 2011. Men aged 40 to 49 years experienced a gradual increase in testing rate from 2001 through 2008 (annual change in PSA testing per 10,000 men [AC] = 4.37; P < .001), which became flat from mid-2009 through 2011(AC = -0.06; P = 0.98). The slope of PSA testing rates did not change in men aged 50 to 59 years or 60 to 64 years with the publication of the results of the large trials in 2009 or with the subsequent changes in recommendations on PSA testing.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA guideline [^3e259c0f]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The guideline purpose is to provide the urologist with a framework for the early detection of prostate cancer in asymptomatic average risk men.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review was conducted and summarized evidence derived from over 300 studies that addressed the predefined outcomes of interest (prostate cancer incidence/mortality, quality of life, diagnostic accuracy and harms of testing). In addition to the quality of evidence, the panel considered values and preferences expressed in a clinical setting (patient-physician dyad) rather than having a public health perspective. Guideline statements were organized by age group in years (age < 40; 40 to 54; 55 to 69; ≥ 70).

Results

Except prostate specific antigen-based prostate cancer screening, there was minimal evidence to assess the outcomes of interest for other tests. The quality of evidence for the benefits of screening was moderate, and evidence for harm was high for men age 55 to 69 years. For men outside this age range, evidence was lacking for benefit, but the harms of screening, including over diagnosis and overtreatment, remained. Modeled data suggested that a screening interval of two years or more may be preferred to reduce the harms of screening.

Conclusions

The Panel recommended shared decision-making for men age 55 to 69 years considering PSA-based screening, a target age group for whom benefits may outweigh harms. Outside this age range, PSA-based screening as a routine could not be recommended based on the available evidence.

### Who and when should we screen for prostate cancer? Interviews with key opinion leaders [^b2927000]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A Vickers and S Carlsson: You say: " No statistically significant difference in prostate cancer mortality was observed between screening and control groups in men aged less than 54, 55–59, and 60–64 years ". What conclusion do you draw from that?

D Ilic: The rate ratios (RR) for the respective age groups are as follows, < 54 (RR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.28–2.49); 55–59 (RR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.93–1.03); and 60–64 (RR = 0.90, 95% CI, 0.71–1.15). These results would indicate that there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that screening significantly reduces the risk of prostate cancer mortality in these groups. For example, the risk ratio and confidence intervals for the < 54 age group indicate great variability for the potential of benefit and harm as a result of screening. It should be noted that the AUA recently modified their guideline recommending against PSA screening in men under 40 years of age, and in men aged 40–54 years at average risk. For men aged 55–69 years, a shared approach to decision-making was advocated.

### Literature review of the burden of prostate cancer in Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Canada [^e2a7229b]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In Europe, prostate cancer is now the most common cancer in men, accounting for 23% of all male cancers (n = 417,000 cases) and 10% of cancer-related deaths in males (n = 92,000 deaths) in 2012. Prostate cancers are heterogeneous in terms of presentation and morphology but nearly all are classified as adenocarcinomas and in many instances remain asymptomatic until locally advanced or metastatic. The incidence of prostate cancer is strongly related to age, and in the UK it is estimated that 1 in 8 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. However, in a large proportion of men, prostate cancer is indolent or slow growing so may not become clinically significant during the lifetime of the patient, such that the number of men who die with prostate cancer by far exceeds the number of men who die due to prostate cancer. Indeed, autopsy studies in men who died from causes other than prostate cancer report an incidental prostate cancer prevalence at the time of death ranging from 5% at age < 30 years to 59% at age > 79 years.

In Western Europe and North America opportunistic screening for elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels is commonly performed in middle-aged and elderly men. PSA is a serine protease that is expressed almost exclusively in the epithelial cells of the prostate gland and elevated PSA levels are a key indicator of prostate cancer. However, increased PSA levels can also occur as a result of several other conditions including, most notably, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. Men with elevated PSA levels are therefore commonly referred for digital rectal examination (DRE) and/or biopsy to confirm the presence of cancer. In many settings PSA screening has contributed to enhanced detection, diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, but it is a contentious issue owing to the potential for over-diagnosis and over-treatment of prostate cancers that may not become clinically significant during the lifetime of the patient. Screening remains opportunistic rather than routine in many settings. In the United States, in 2008 the Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against routine screening due to its psychological harms and uncertainty around its clinical benefits. However, the USPSTF recently updated its recommendations for men aged 55–69 years, stating that men should be informed of the potential benefits and harms of PSA screening and that the final decision should rest with the individual. Other investigators have also suggested that population-based screening could lead to over-treatment.

Testosterone titration phase: Not Recommended. Stable phase: In men without a history of prostate cancer, testing should be conducted utilizing a shared decision-making approach, in accordance with the AUA Early Detection of Prostate Cancer Guideline. Prostate cancer patients on testosterone therapy should have their PSA levels monitored on the same schedule as men without testosterone deficiency; however, clinicians may choose to increase the frequency of testing.

### A multiparametric approach to improve upon existing prostate cancer screening and biopsy recommendations [^7007c27b]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide an overview of how genetic, serum, and urine biomarkers can help identify men at high risk for prostate cancer (PCa) and aggressive disease and men who would benefit from prostate biopsy.

Recent Findings

Screening for PCa is controversial because of concerns about overdiagnosis and overtreatment of nonlife-threatening tumors. Therefore, an approach to screening that includes a detailed family history with genetic testing of risk single nucleotide polymorphisms and high-penetrance genetic variants should be considered. After an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level has been confirmed, obtaining additional information (family history, biomarkers, and imaging) should be considered before recommending a prostate biopsy.

Summary

There are now genetic tests that can help identify men who would benefit from PSA testing. Additional biomarker and imaging tests should be offered to those men who are confirmed to have elevated PSA values. These new biomarkers and imaging tests can improve the specificity of PSA testing while missing a small percentage of high-grade tumors. The path forward involves a multiparametric risk assessment based on clinical data and these new tests.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline part I: prostate cancer screening [^d7e32915]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

AUA/SUO prostate cancer screening — management of a newly elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) states: For people with a newly elevated PSA, clinicians should repeat the PSA prior to a secondary biomarker, imaging, or biopsy. (Expert Opinion). In people with a newly elevated PSA, it will return to a normal level in 25% to 40% upon retesting, and in STHLM-3 (2 PSA tests 8 weeks apart) among 1,686 biopsied patients with a PSA of 3 to 10 ng/mL, 283 (17%) had a PSA that returned to normal (< 3 ng/mL). The Panel also strongly supports that empiric antibiotics should not be utilized to treat an elevated PSA in an asymptomatic person. Neither digital rectal examination (DRE) nor bicycle riding appreciably alters the PSA, most controlled studies evaluating ejaculation suggest it either does not significantly impact or modestly increases (~10%) PSA, the half-life of PSA is 2 to 3 days, and a repeat PSA in a few months is recommended with recognition that urinary tract infections and instrumentation cause transient increases and that PSA elevations in these settings should be repeated after appropriate time periods to allow for PSA to reach baseline level.

### Risk-based prostate cancer screening [^cbe0a565]. European Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Widespread mass screening of prostate cancer (PCa) is not recommended because the balance between benefits and harms is still not well established. The achieved mortality reduction comes with considerable harm such as unnecessary biopsies, overdiagnoses, and overtreatment. Therefore, patient stratification with regard to PCa risk and aggressiveness is necessary to identify those men who are at risk and may actually benefit from early detection.

Objective

This review critically examines the current evidence regarding risk-based PCa screening.

Evidence Acquisition

A search of the literature was performed using the Medline database. Further studies were selected based on manual searches of reference lists and review articles.

Evidence Synthesis

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been shown to be the single most significant predictive factor for identifying men at increased risk of developing PCa. Especially in men with no additional risk factors, PSA alone provides an appropriate marker up to 30 yr into the future. After assessment of an early PSA test, the screening frequency may be determined based on individualized risk. A limited list of additional factors such as age, comorbidity, prostate volume, family history, ethnicity, and previous biopsy status have been identified to modify risk and are important for consideration in routine practice. In men with a known PSA, risk calculators may hold the promise of identifying those who are at increased risk of having PCa and are therefore candidates for biopsy.

Conclusions

PSA testing may serve as the foundation for a more risk-based assessment. However, the decision to undergo early PSA testing should be a shared one between the patient and his physician based on information balancing its advantages and disadvantages.

Early detection of prostate cancer — screening recommendations state that clinicians should offer prostate cancer screening beginning at age 40 to 45 years for people at increased risk based on Black ancestry, germline mutations, or strong family history of prostate cancer, and should offer regular screening every 2 to 4 years to people aged 50 to 69 years; clinicians may personalize the re‑screening interval or discontinue screening following SDM, may use digital rectal exam (DRE) alongside PSA to establish risk, should not use PSA velocity as the sole indication for a secondary biomarker, imaging, or biopsy, may use validated risk calculators to inform SDM regarding prostate biopsy, and when the risk of clinically significant prostate cancer is sufficiently low based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging data, clinicians and patients may forgo near‑term prostate biopsy.

American Cancer Society guideline — early detection of prostate cancer: For providers and their patients who choose to be tested, the guideline offers guidance on testing frequency and actions based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and it considers the traditional PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL a reasonable threshold for further evaluation; acknowledging that there is no true PSA cutoff point distinguishing cancer from noncancer, it suggests that providers consider individualized decision making when PSA levels fall in the indeterminate range of 2.5 ng/mL to 4.0 ng/mL, particularly for men at increased risk for high-grade cancer based on non-PSA risk factors.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^26f0a78a]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test thresholds and performance — Using a threshold of 4 ng/mL in average-risk men, the rate of PSA test positivity varies between 9% and 11%, the cancer detection rate is about 3%, the positive predictive value (PPV) ranges from 28% to 32%, and specificity remains high (92%-94%). When lower thresholds are used (2.0 ng/mL or 2.5 ng/mL), PPVs are substantially higher among men with a positive family history (38%-43%) with variable specificity (64%-93%). PSA screening in higher risk populations is characterized by higher detection rates and higher PPVs, but it is stated that we still do not know whether PSA screening performs better in higher risk men in terms of reduced prostate-specific mortality; the ERSPC observed no effect of age on mortality and neither the PLCO nor the ERSPC has reported subgroup analyses examining the impact of ethnicity or family history.

### Ethnic differences in the age-related distribution of serum prostate-specific antigen values: a study in a healthy Korean male population [^e4e861c1]. Urology (2000). Low credibility.

Objectives

To further improve the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a screening test for prostate cancer in Asian countries, we sought to establish the normal distribution of serum PSA values in Korean men, because, until recently, studies conducted to establish normal serum PSA values have involved few Asian populations.

Methods

Between May 1995 and June 1997, 5805 healthy Korean men 30 to 79 years old who visited our hospital for a routine health checkup were entered into a prospective study of early screening for prostate cancer. All men underwent detailed clinical examinations, including a digital rectal examination and serum PSA determination. All men who were more than 50 years old with abnormal digital rectal examination findings and/or an elevated serum PSA level (greater than 4.0 ng/mL) also underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided sextant biopsy. Four were found to have cancer and were excluded from the analysis.

Results

The median serum PSA concentration (5th to 95th percentile range) was 0.8 ng/mL (0.2 to 1.8) for patients 30 to 39 years old (n = 1382); 0.8 ng/mL (0.2 to 2.0) for patients 40 to 49 years old (n = 1776); 0.9 ng/mL (0.2 to 2.4) for those 50 to 59 years old (n = 1775); 1.0 ng/mL (0.2 to 3.9) for men 60 to 69 years old (n = 746); and 1.3 ng/mL (0.5 to 6.3) for patients 70 to 79 years old (n = 122). The serum PSA concentration correlated with age (P < 0.001), with an increase by approximately 1.2% annually, although the statistical correlation was weak (r = 0.16). Almost no change occurred in the median serum PSA value in patients 50 years old or younger; a gradual increase was observed in patients older than 50. In those 50 years old or older, the median and 95th percentile serum PSA values for Korean men were lower than those for white men.

Conclusions

Contrary to earlier observations that the serum PSA level strongly correlates with age, the influence of age on serum PSA was found to be weaker in this study. Moreover, the results also demonstrated that the distribution of the serum PSA level differs along ethnic lines. The cutoff value for serum PSA in mass screening for prostate cancer should be adjusted in nonwhite races.

### The effects of population-based prostate-specific antigen screening beginning at age 40 [^8b742db0]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate population-based prostate cancer (CaP) testing of men in their 40s, given the paucity of prospective data evaluating the consequences of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in younger men for CaP.

Materials and Methods

A total of 1052 men in their 40s were followed longitudinally for prostate outcomes, from 1990 to 2010. A random subset of 268 men was selected to undergo biennial CaP testing including PSA testing, transrectal ultrasound, and a digital rectal examination. A representative population of 609 men with a subset of 159 men who also began CaP testing in their 50s was also evaluated as a comparison group. Risk of prostate biopsy (PBx), CaP, or death from CaP was compared between CaP-tested and the routine-care population cohort.

Results

Median follow-up was 17.2 years. Men aged 40–49, who underwent CaP testing were 2.4 times more likely to undergo a PBx (hazard ratio [HR] 2.4 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8–3.3) and 2.2 times more likely to be diagnosed with low-risk CaP (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.12–4.0). Those initiating CaP testing a decade earlier were 2.2 times and 1.7 times more likely to be biopsied and be diagnosed with CaP for any given age (HR 2.2 95% CI 1.4–3.5 and 1.7 95% CI 1.1–2.7, respectively).

Conclusion

CaP testing in men beginning at age 40 resulted in a significant increase in the risk of PBx and diagnosis of low-risk CaP, without a measurable reduction in risk of CaP-death in this low-risk population. However, given the natural history of CaP, a longer follow-up is needed to confirm this finding.

### Prostate-specific antigen at or before age 50 as a predictor of advanced prostate cancer diagnosed up to 25 years later: a case-control study [^53237213]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Current US prostate screening guidelines recommend that all men over age 50 who have a life expectancy of at least 10 years should have an annual digital examination and PSA test. Results from ongoing screening trials show that these recommendations result in over-diagnosis and over-treatment. For example, the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized Screening Study for Prostate Cancer have shown that almost 50% of screen-detected cancers are indolent (organ-confined, Gleason 6 or less, and 0.5 cc or less in volume) and thus unlikely to affect a man's survival or quality of life. Over-treatment is associated not only with high morbidity, such as poor erectile, bowel and urinary function resulting from surgery or radiotherapy, but also high healthcare costs. A screening program that focused on those at highest risk of prostate cancer morbidity or mortality might well have a superior benefit-to-harm ratio compared with the current approach of screening all men. One scenario might be to make exceptional efforts to ensure that all men obtain a PSA test in their mid to late forties. Although a man with a PSA elevated above the threshold for biopsy (e.g. 3 ng/ml) could be referred for immediate biopsy, this would be very rare (~1–2% in the current data set); the primary purpose of the early PSA test would be to determine which men should be invited back for regular screening at age 50 and which men advised that PSA screening is unlikely to benefit them.

This study is based on a previously published case-control study in which we attempted to predict the occurrence of prostate cancer at any stage. We did not re-match for this study and hence patients with a prostate cancer diagnosis were not included in the sample from which controls were selected. We note that kallikrein levels of these 301 participants are likely to be higher than those of Malmö Preventive Medicine participants not diagnosed with prostate cancer, thus inflating differences between cases and controls in our current analysis. However, the original Malmö Preventive Medicine cohort contains approximately 21,270 participants who could act as controls, from whom 436 controls were randomly chosen to be included in our current analysis. As there were 462 prostate cancer cases, we would expect prostate cancer patients to comprise approximately 2% of the control group. Therefore, we conclude that our failure to sample from non-advanced prostate cancer cases is unlikely to have any major effect on the current results.

### Prostate specific antigen predicts the long-term risk of prostate enlargement: results from the Baltimore longitudinal study of aging [^1d0341bc]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a predictor of prostate growth in men with lower urinary tract symptoms. The long-term risk of prostate enlargement as a function of PSA among community dwelling volunteers is unknown.

Materials and Methods

A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to study the relationship between baseline PSA level at ages 40 to 49.9 years in 194 men, 50 to 59.9 in 191 and 60 to 69.9 in 144, and prostate enlargement, defined as a prostate volume larger than the 75th percentile for age decade, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging in a longitudinal study of aging (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, National Institute on Aging). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to estimate the probability of freedom from prostate enlargement with time as a function of baseline PSA level.

Results

The relative risk of prostate enlargement was 3- to 6-fold higher for men 40 to 49.9 years old with a baseline PSA of 0.31 ng./ml. or more compared to men with PSA levels of 0.30 ng./ml. or less at baseline. The relative risk was increased 5- to 9-fold in men 50 to 59.9 years old and 11-fold in those 60 to 69.9 years old when comparing men with PSA greater than 0.80 ng./ml. and greater than 1.70 ng./ml. with those with PSA 0.50 or less. The cumulative probability of freedom from prostate enlargement at 20 years was 0.89 (95% confidence interval ([CI] 0.79–0.99) and 0.63 (0.52–0.74) for men 40 to 49.9 years old with PSA levels below and above 0.30 ng./ml., respectively. For men 50 to 59.9 years old the 10-year probability of freedom from prostate enlargement was 0.90 (95% CI 0.84–0.96) and 0.59 (0.43–0.74) when PSA levels were below and above 0.80 ng./ml., respectively. At age 60 to 69.9 years the 10-year probability of freedom from prostate enlargement was 0.83 (95% CI 0.72–0.93) and 0.27 (0.09 to 0.48) when PSA levels were below and above 1.70 ng./ml., respectively.

Conclusions

These data demonstrate the long-term risk of prostate enlargement by PSA level. Risk stratification based on PSA level may be useful to identify men at greatest risk for adverse events due to prostate enlargement and selection of men for future benign prostatic hyperplasia studies.

### Psa-based prostate cancer… [^93cba56e]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

The AAFP does not recommend routine prostate-specific antigen -based screening for prostate cancer. For men aged 55 through 69 who are considering periodic prostate cancer screening, clinicians should discuss the risks and benefits and engage in shared decision-making that enables an informed choice. Screening for prostate cancer using PSA may prevent mortality from prostate cancer for a small number of men, while putting many men at risk for long term harms, such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Whether this potentially small benefit in mortality outweighs the potential harms is dependent on the values and preferences of individual men. Therefore, for men who express a desire for prostate cancer screening, it should only be performed following a discussion of the potential benefits and harms.

Men aged 70 years and older have a higher rate of prostate cancer, but because they are more likely to die from a cause other than their prostate cancer, the potential benefit screening is diminished. Older men experience more harms from screening, including increased rates of false positives, overdiagnosis, and increased risk of harms from biopsy and treatment. For these reasons, prostate cancer screening should not be done in men aged 70 years and older. Screening for prostate cancer using PSA may prevent mortality from prostate cancer for a small number of men, while putting many men at risk for long term harms, such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Whether this potentially small benefit in mortality outweighs the potential harms is dependent on the values and preferences of individual men. Therefore, for men who express a desire for prostate cancer screening, it should only be performed following a discussion of the potential benefits and harms.

The studies of prostate cancer screening used different screening intervals and different PSA thresholds. The ideal screening strategy has not been determined, but single screens were not shown to be effective. For men who choose to undergo screening for prostate cancer, they should not be screened more frequently than every 2 years. A PSA level of 4. 0 ng/mL is a commonly used cutoff, but thresholds vary. Lower thresholds will result in higher rates of false positives, overdiagnosis, and associated harms, while higher thresholds may minimize harms but potentially lower the mortality benefit. Digital Rectal Exam does not improve detection of prostate cancer and should not be performed as a part of screening.

PSA screening — AUA/SUO guideline (2023) states that clinicians should engage in shared decision-making (SDM) with people for whom prostate cancer screening would be appropriate and proceed based on a person's values and preferences (Clinical Principle); when screening for prostate cancer, clinicians should use prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as the first screening test (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A); for people with a newly elevated PSA, clinicians should repeat the PSA prior to a secondary biomarker, imaging, or biopsy (Expert Opinion); and clinicians may begin prostate cancer screening and offer a baseline PSA test to people between ages 45 to 50 years (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B).

### What do the screening trials really tell us and where do we go from here? [^efb8403e]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Publication of apparently conflicting results from 2 large trials of prostate cancer screening has intensified the debate about prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and has led to a recommendation against screening from the US Preventive Services Task Force. This article reviews the trials and discusses the limitations of their empirical results in informing public health policy. In particular, the authors explain why harm-benefit trade-offs based on empirical results may not accurately reflect the trade-offs expected under long-term population screening. This information should be useful to clinicians in understanding the implications of these studies regarding the value of PSA screening.

### Low-value prostate-specific antigen screening in older males [^597ea56b]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in males worldwide. While screening for prostate cancer may reduce prostate cancer–specific mortality, it comes at the risk of overdiagnosis, particularly in older males or those with comorbid medical conditions. Screening with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in males who are unlikely to benefit from intervention for prostate cancer exposes these individuals to anxiety, invasive biopsies, and possible overtreatment, which could lead to unnecessary clinical consequences.

Given the lack of evidence of clinical benefit of PSA screening for prostate cancer in older males, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) published revised guidelines in 2018 that advised against PSA screening for prostate cancer in males 70 years or older due to the risk of false-positive results and overdiagnosis of indolent disease. These guidelines now recommend that males aged 55 to 69 years make the personal decision to undergo PSA screening after discussing its potential benefits and risks with their physician.

To characterize the factors associated with low-value PSA screening in males 70 years or older, we analyzed a cohort of males from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a nationwide survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We hypothesized that, despite the advice to the contrary, PSA screening in older males remains overused.

### Prostate cancer foundation screening guidelines for black men in the United States [^6e07e860]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In the United States, Black men are at highest risk for being diagnosed with and dying from prostate cancer. Given this disparity, we examined relevant data to establish clinical prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening guidelines for Black men in the United States.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search identified 1848 unique publications for screening. Of those screened, 287 studies were selected for full-text review, and 264 were considered relevant and form the basis for these guidelines. The numbers were reported according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.

Results

Three randomized controlled trials provided Level 1 evidence that regular PSA screening of men 50 to 74years of age of average risk reduced metastasis and prostate cancer death at 16 to 22years of follow-up. The best available evidence specifically for Black men comes from observational and modeling studies that consider age to obtain a baseline PSA, frequency of testing, and age when screening should end. Cohort studies suggest that discussions about baseline PSA testing between Black men and their clinicians should begin in the early 40s, and data from modeling studies indicate prostate cancer develops 3 to 9years earlier in Black men compared with non-Black men. Lowering the age for baseline PSA testing to 40 to 45years of age from 50 to 55years of age, followed by regular screening until 70years of age (informed by PSA values and health factors), could reduce prostate cancer mortality in Black men (approximately 30% relative risk reduction) without substantially increasing overdiagnosis.

Conclusions

These guidelines recommend that Black men should obtain information about PSA screening for prostate cancer. Among Black men who elect screening, baseline PSA testing should occur between ages 40 and 45. Depending on PSA value and health status, annual screening should be strongly considered.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline part I: prostate cancer screening [^574b3055]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

AUA/SUO prostate cancer screening — personalized re-screening and discontinuation: Clinicians may personalize the re-screening interval, or decide to discontinue screening, based on patient preference, age, PSA, prostate cancer risk, life expectancy, and general health following SDM. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). The randomized trials (PLCO, Goteborg-1, ERSPC) screened patients aged 50 to 69 years every 1 to 4 years and demonstrated a reduction in prostate cancer mortality. Risk-stratified re-screening intervals and biopsy thresholds may be tailored for select patients, with the re-screening interval 1 to 4 years for patients with PSA levels of 1 to 3 ng/mL between ages 45 to 70 years, and prolonged for patients aged 55 to 70 years with a PSA < 1 ng/mL or with PSA below the age-specific median. In the Malmö Preventive Project cohort, among patients aged 40 to 55 years, the 15-year risk of metastasis for those with PSA below the median was 0.09% at ages 45 to 49 years and 0.23% at ages 51 to 55 years. In the Physicians' Health Study cohort, among patients 40 to 59 years of age, 82%, 71%, and 86% of lethal cases occurred in those with PSA above the median at ages 40 to 49 years (median PSA 0.68 ng/mL), 50 to 54 years (median PSA 0.88 ng/mL), and 55 to 59 years (median PSA 0.96 ng/mL), respectively, and both studies suggest risk-stratified screening based on midlife PSA should be considered in patients aged 45 to 59 years.

### Distribution of serum prostate-specific antigen in healthy Korean men: influence of ethnicity [^9228269e]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the normal distribution of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in healthy Korean men. The subjects included men younger than 40 years of age, because information on serum PSA levels in younger men is scarce.

Methods

Between January 1997 and December 1998, the serum PSA levels of the subjects who visited our hospital for a routine health checkup were determined. All men who were older than 50 years with abnormal digital rectal examination findings and/or an abnormal serum PSA level (greater than 4.0 ng/mL) underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided sextant biopsy. Two men who were found to have cancer were excluded from the analysis. The detection rate of prostate cancer for men with abnormal digital rectal examination findings and/or an abnormal serum PSA level was 2.0% for men 50 to 59 years old; 0.0% for men 60 to 69 years old; and 11.1% for men 70 to 79 years old. A total of 8297 men (aged 20 to 79 years) were included in the study.

Results

The median serum PSA level (5th to 95th percentile range) was 0.90 ng/mL (0.33 to 2.25) for men 20 to 29 years old; 0.89 ng/mL (0.30 to 2.35) for men 30 to 39 years old; 0.89 ng/mL (0.30 to 2.36) for men 40 to 49 years old; 0.96 ng/mL (0.32 to 2.96) for men 50 to 59 years old; 1.22 ng/mL (0.33 to 3.78) for men 60 to 69 years old; and 1.25 ng/mL (0.30 to 7.49) for men 70 to 79 years old. The median and 95th percentile serum PSA levels of Korean men younger than 50 years were higher, but those for men 50 years old or older were lower than in other races. In our study cohort, the serum PSA level weakly correlated with age (r = 0.088, P < 0.001). The serum PSA level weakly correlated with age in men 50 years old or older (r = 0.116, P < 0.001) but in men younger than 50 years, it did not correlate (r = 0.000, P = 0.987).

Conclusions

These results suggest that the distribution and cutoff value of the serum PSA level in Korean men differ from those in other races. In addition, our findings raise the question of whether lowering the PSA cutoff may enhance the detection of cancer in this population with low prostate cancer rates.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^59f163a8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy — prostate monitoring and urological referral — specifies that for men 55–69 years and for men 40–69 years at increased risk for prostate cancer who choose prostate monitoring, clinicians should perform digital rectal examination and check prostate-specific antigen (PSA) before initiating treatment and then recheck PSA and digital rectal examination 3–12 mo after initiating T treatment; we recommend a urological consultation for hypogonadal men receiving testosterone treatment if during the first 12 months there is a confirmed increase in PSA concentration > 1.4 ng/mL above baseline, a confirmed PSA > 4.0 ng/mL, or a prostatic abnormality detected on digital rectal examination, and after 1 year, prostate monitoring should conform to standard guidelines for prostate cancer screening based on the race and age of the patient; clinicians should confirm PSA elevations by repeating the test, and in men whose baseline PSA is between 2.6 and 4 ng/mL, an increase > 4 ng/mL during testosterone treatment should be interpreted with repeat testing and referral decisions guided by a confirmed increase of > 1.4 ng/mL above baseline as well as an absolute PSA level of > 4 ng/mL; obtain urological consultation if there is an increase in serum PSA concentration > 1.4 ng/mL within 12 mo of initiating T treatment, a confirmed PSA > 4 ng/mL, detection of a prostatic abnormality on DRE, or substantial worsening of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

### Do African-American men need separate prostate cancer screening guidelines? [^2e107f73]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

PSA levels are higher among African Americans

In general, African American men present with higher PSA values when compared to white men. Several studies have shown that African American men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer have higher serum PSA levels at diagnosis than Caucasian men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer, suggesting that perhaps African Americans have a higher tumor cell burden. Furthermore, African American men with or without evidence for prostate cancer have a higher PSA density (when the prostate is controlled for volume) than Caucasians. However, the differences between African Americans and Caucasians in PSA velocity is controversial (assuming there is any difference at all). In one study, Caucasians had higher PSA velocities than African American men of a similar age, despite the fact that African Americans had a higher baseline PSA value, age-for-age. This finding could be attributed to laboratory test access as perhaps African American men may have had fewer PSA tests over time, thus impacting their velocity score despite higher individual PSA values. Another study, reported that PSA velocity is higher in Caucasians only in the 60–69 age bracket, whereas in the 40–49 age group, PSA velocity is higher in African Americans. Nonetheless, despite the fact that PSA levels, density, and velocity appear different in African-American men compared to Caucasians, the USPSTF has issued guidelines that are not race specific.

Mortality rate

An undeniable certainty is that regardless of previous screening recommendations, African American men have had a higher mortality rate from prostate cancer (two- to three-fold higher) and are carrying a larger prostate cancer burden than their Caucasian contemporaries. African American men also are less likely to have health insurance and a higher proportion of them are of lower SES. In regards to SES, however, its impact on prostate cancer outcomes is controversial. For instance, Xu et al. reported that after adjusting for SES, the differences in prostate cancer mortality were eliminated. This is particularly relevant to screening because even among African Americans, screening guidelines may differ based on SES.

### Prostate cancer statistics, 2025 [^b7d9193c]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer screening

PSA is a blood biomarker produced by both prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer. Serum PSA concentration was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1986 to monitor disease progression but has been used to screen for prostate cancer since the late 1980s.PSA screening can detect prostate cancer 5 to 7 years before it would be detected by digital rectal examination or cause symptoms, but it also results in overdiagnosis (tumors that would never progress to cause symptoms or death). Reducing these harms through more targeted screening including genetic testing for risk assessment and conservative management of low‐risk disease has been the focus of contemporary early detection research.

In 2018, the USPSTF updated its prostate cancer screening recommendation for men aged 55–69 years to informed decision‐making regarding "periodic PSA‐based screening", including a discussion with their clinician about the benefits and harms of screening. This recommendation is similar to American Cancer Society guidelines since 2010, which recommend that asymptomatic men with at least a 10‐year life expectancy make an informed decision with their health care provider about whether to be screened beginning at age 50 years for men at average risk, age 45 years for Black men, and as early as age 40 years for men at even higher risk. Although evidence is limited, a recent review supports screening Black men at age 45 years at potentially more frequent intervals than other men depending on baseline PSA level.

Among men aged 50 years and older, 37% report having a PSA test within the past year. Screening is highest among White men, gay men, those with higher education and income, and those with private insurance or Medicare insurance (aged 65 years and older). Screening peaked in 2008 at 44% before declining to 34% in 2013. Interestingly, PSA testing has consistently been higher in men aged 70 years and older than in those aged 55–69 years (24% higher in 2023; Figure 6), despite USPSTF recommendations against screening in this age group. In part, this may be because Medicare has covered PSA testing for all men aged 50 years and older since 2000. In fact, one study published in 2021 found that, among men with private insurance, screening was highest in the recommended screening age group. This could be because of stricter coverage requirements for private insurers compared with Medicare, in which the beneficiaries have higher prevalence of screening than men with private insurance within the recommended screening age group.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^7b4df17e]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer screening recommendations — men who choose to be screened after considering benefits and risks should follow these directives: Screening is recommended with PSA with or without DRE; screening should be conducted yearly for men whose PSA level is 2.5 ng/mL or greater; for men whose PSA is less than 2.5 ng/mL, screening intervals can be extended to every 2 years; a PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL or greater historically has been used to recommend referral for further evaluation or biopsy, which remains a reasonable approach for men at average risk for prostate cancer; for PSA levels between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL, health care providers should consider an individualized risk assessment that incorporates other risk factors and may be used to recommend a biopsy, noting that African American race, family history of prostate cancer, increasing age, and abnormal DRE increase risk and that a previous negative biopsy lowers risk.

### Targeted screening for prostate cancer in high risk families: early onset is a significant risk factor for disease in first degree relatives [^fc88c41e]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Targeted screening for prostate cancer in high risk families is generally suggested by ages 40 to 45 years in first degree relatives. We support this concept by reporting higher risk and earlier onset of the disease in these families.

Materials and Methods

We proposed serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing in 40 to 70-year-old first degree relatives of 435 patients with prostate cancer treated between July 1994 and June 1997. A previous systematic genealogical analysis allowed us to define the familial prostate cancer status of each patient as sporadic or familial.

Results

Of the 747 potential candidates 442 (59%) accepted into the study have been screened, including 240 who were 40 to 49 years old (mean age 44.8) and 202 who were 50 to 70 years old (mean age 57.4). Two of the 240 subjects (0.8%) had PSA greater than 4 ng./ml. in the 40 to 49-year-old group. Prostate biopsies were negative in 1 relative but diagnostic for prostate cancer in the other. In the 50 to 70-year-old group 25 of 202 subjects (12.4%) had a PSA of greater than 4 ng./ml. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 9 individuals (4.5%), 9 had negative biopsy results, 1 died before biopsy and 6 refused biopsy. The proportion of relatives with PSA greater than 4 ng./ml. and prostate cancer detection was not different according to familial status (sporadic or familial) but it was significantly higher in first degree relatives with early onset prostate cancer in the family at ages younger than 65 years (p = 0.037 and 0.012, respectively).

Conclusions

Our results emphasize the usefulness of PSA screening in high risk families, including those without obvious hereditary features. Furthermore, early onset prostate cancer is a significant risk factor for prostate cancer in first degree relatives.

### What's new in screening in 2015? [^c562c5ca]. Current Opinion in Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review was to highlight important articles in the field of prostate cancer screening published during 2015 and early 2016. Four major areas were identified for the purpose: screening strategies, post-United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2011–2012, screening trends/patterns, and shared decision making.

Recent Findings

Several studies furthered the evidence that screening reduces the risk of metastasis and death from prostate cancer. Multiplex screening strategies are of proven benefit; genetics and MRI need further evaluation. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening rates declined in men above age of 50 years, as did the overall prostate cancer incidence following the USPSTF 2011–2012 recommendation against PSA. The consequences of declining screening rates will become apparent in the next few years. More research is needed to identify the most optimal approach to engage in, and implement, an effective shared decision-making in clinical practice.

Summary

Data emerging in 2015 provided evidence on the question of how best to screen and brought more steps in the right direction of 'next-generation prostate cancer screening'. Screening is an ongoing process in all men regardless of whether or not they might benefit from early detection and treatment. After the USPSTF 2011–2012 recommendation, the rates of PSA testing are declining; however, this decline is observed in all men and not solely in those who will not benefit from the screening. The long-term effect of this recommendation might not be as anticipated. More studies are needed on how to implement the best available evidence on who, and when, to screen in clinical practice.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^fdb13c1f]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Costs and resources

Results from a recent cost-effectiveness study modelled for the US suggested that screening between the ages of 55 and 69 years combined with active surveillance for low risk men could only be cost-effective at a $100 000 threshold if the screening frequency remains low (every four years) and active surveillance is offered to all men with low risk prostate cancer (that is, Gleason score ≤ 6 and stage ≤ T2a). Strategies with shorter screening intervals or in which immediate treatment is offered to all men were not cost-effective. Although the Rapid Recommendations panel focused on the patients' priorities rather than those of society, our recommendation is compatible with these findings.

Uncertainties for future research

Recent evidence suggests that incorporating MRI in the investigation of those with a positive PSA test result decreases the false positive rate, and thus the number of patients undergoing unnecessary biopsies, and may also increase the accuracy of biopsies in those who do have prostate cancer. The Rapid Recommendations panel considered addressing this issue in the guideline, but the impact of MRI on long term outcomes of prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and complications of treatment remains uncertain. Sophisticated decision modelling might shed light on this issue, but the panel decided not to conduct such an analysis because of logistic and feasibility considerations, and because the panel's review of the evidence suggests that modelling would introduce further uncertainties regarding the impact of MRI on patient-important outcomes.

Key research question to inform decision makers and future guidelines include

Could new screening and diagnostic techniques reduce the harms and burden of the diagnostic procedure by better identifying non-progressive and slowly progressive cancer from cancer that is likely to become symptomatic and affect quality or length of life? These strategies may include genetic markers or biomarkers, risk stratification tools, or MRI guided biopsy. For example, two recent high quality studies on MRI guided biopsy have shown encouraging results of MRI to reduce overdiagnosis, but the impact of this strategy on long term, patient-important outcomes (such as prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and complications of treatment) remains uncertain.
For men opting for screening, what would be the ideal age range and screening interval? Randomised trials varied in their offer of a one-off or repeated PSA testing and it remains uncertain which strategy is more suitable.
What is the impact of screening on men at higher baseline risk (men with a family history of cancer, of African descent, and of lower socioeconomic status)? Are their values and preferences different from those of men in the general population?

### Pathology consultation on prostate-specific antigen testing [^dbb540e8]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide clarity on the pros and cons of using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a screening tool for prostate cancer.

Methods

Case scenarios and a literature review of recently published clinical trial data are presented to provide evidence of the controversy.

Results

PSA is a sensitive biomarker for detecting diseases of the prostate, but it is limited in its ability to distinguish cancerous from noncancerous conditions or aggressive from indolent cancers and has resulted in a considerable amount of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

Conclusions

The analytical methodology for total PSA testing is both reliable and cost-effective, but patients should be encouraged to talk to their providers to understand the benefits and harms associated with this testing.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^070286b7]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer — patient selection and very-low-risk criteria identify "insignificant" disease as clinical stage T1c, biopsy Grade Group 1, disease in fewer than 3 biopsy cores, < 50% involvement in any core, and PSA density < 0.15 ng/mL/g; physicians are cautioned against using these as the sole decision maker, as up to 8% were not organ-confined postoperatively. The panel states that such cancer poses little threat to individuals with a life expectancy of less than 20 years, with PSA early-detection lead time bias ranging from an estimated 12.3 years at age 55 to 6 years at age 75. The NCCN Panel consensus is that active surveillance is preferred for all patients with very-low-risk prostate cancer and life expectancy greater than 10 years.

### Relationship between albumin-globulin ratio and prostate-specific antigen: a cross-sectional study based on NHANES 2003–2010 [^1b9fe1b2]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is expected to be the second most common type of cancer and the fifth largest cause of cancer-related mortality among males by 2020, according to the World Cancer Statistics. Almost all reputable clinical guidelines from the past few decades have suggested using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to identify prostate cancer. However, PSA is characterized by its high sensitivity and low specificity, which often lead to diagnostic biases. Many factors are known to affect the PSA level, such as age, prostatitis, certain medications and prostate size.

The albumin-globulin ratio (AGR), as everyone knows, is calculated by dividing the serum albumin count by the globulin count. Albumin responds to the nutritional state of human body while globulin responds to its immunoinflammatory state. There is a significant controversy around the link between the level of albumin and PSA. It has been observed that middle-aged males with a lower serum albumin level have higher PSA readings. Similar to this, a different study found a nonlinear relationship between the level of serum albumin and PSA, with a negative relationship observed between them when the serum albumin level was over 41 g. In contrast, a cross-sectional study noted that dietary protein intake was positively associated with an elevated PSA level when dietary protein intake exceeded a threshold of 181.8 g. A growing body of research suggests that immune inflammation plays an important role in the development of prostate cancer. Previous studies have shown that platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) seems to have a higher accuracy in screening for prostate cancer, which, together with neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), has significant predictive value for the development of metastatic prostate cancer. However, there is still no consensus on the relationship between AGR and prostate. It has been noted that a lower level of AGR before treatment is strongly associated with poorer pathologic outcomes; AGR may be a reliable serologic marker for prostate cancer. A retrospective analysis noted that patients suffering prostate cancer with a lower preoperative AGR level had a worse tumor recurrence-free survival. However, a meta-analysis of studies noted a failure to demonstrate a potential predictive role of AGR in the prognosis of non-metastatic prostate cancer.

In conclusion, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the level of serum AGR and PSA among American males of over 40, who had non-prostate cancer.

Prostate-specific antigen screening in high-risk populations — Test positivity generally increases with advancing age; in men younger than age 50 years, test positivity, based on a 4-ng/mL PSA cutoff, ranges between 2% and 3% and increases up to as high as 28% among men ages 70 years and older, while the prostate cancer detection rate and positive predictive value (PPV) are lower among men younger than age 50 years (1%-2%, and 6%-38%, respectively) compared with older men (13% and 39%-58%, respectively), and specificity decreases with increasing age (from 97% to 98% in younger adults compared with 80% in older adults); in African American men ages 70 to 79 years, based on a 4-ng/mL PSA cutoff, test positivity reportedly may be as high as 54% with a prostate cancer detection rate of 25% and a PPV of 59%.

### The trends in prostate specific antigen usage amongst United Kingdom urologists – a questionnaire based study [^002a3391]. BMC Urology (2008). Low credibility.

This lack of compliance with the Department of Health PSA guidelines is likely to be due to the paucity of evidence supporting the recommended age-related PSA cut-offs, and this was commented on by a number of participants.

The only published report suggesting PSA age-related cut-offs is a study by Oesterling et al. in 1993. This population-based study in Olmstead County, USA, recruited 2119 men between the ages of 40–79, to investigate the natural history of benign prostatic hyperplasia. A quarter of these men were randomly chosen to undergo a PSA test, a digital rectal examination and a Trans-Rectal Ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy. PSA values for the 88% of men with no evidence of prostate cancer were evaluated. On this basis, PSA cut-offs were suggested of 2.5 ng/ml for 40–49 year olds, 3.5 ng/ml for 50–59 year olds, 4.5 ng/ml for 60–69 year olds and 6.5 ng/ml for 70–79 year olds based upon the serum PSA 95 th percentiles. Interestingly this was the most widely used set of PSA cut-offs in our study, being used by 36% of respondents.

Testosterone therapy — prostate cancer risk evaluation and monitoring — In hypogonadal men 55 to 69 years old being considered for testosterone therapy and with a life expectancy > 10 years, we suggest discussing the potential benefits and risks of evaluating prostate cancer risk and engaging the patient in shared decision making regarding prostate cancer monitoring; for patients who choose monitoring, clinicians should assess prostate cancer risk before starting testosterone treatment and 3 to 12 months after starting testosterone. In hypogonadal men being considered for testosterone therapy who are 40 to 69 years old and at increased risk of prostate cancer, we suggest discussing prostate cancer risk with the patient and offering monitoring options, and we suggest that clinicians offer evaluation of prostate cancer risk beginning at age 40 in high-risk men; in patients who agree to monitoring, clinicians should evaluate PSA levels and perform a digital prostate examination at baseline and at 3 to 12 months after starting testosterone treatment, and after 1 year of testosterone-replacement therapy, we suggest clinicians follow guidelines for prostate cancer screening based on the age and race of the patient.

### Emerging PSA-based tests to improve screening [^7b909503]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

This article updates advances in prostate cancer screening based on prostate-specific antigen, its derivatives, and human kallikrein markers. Many men are diagnosed with indolent disease not requiring treatment. Although there is evidence of a survival benefit from screening, the numbers needed to screen and treat remain high. There is risk of exposing men to the side effects of treatment for nonthreatening disease. A screening test is needed with sufficiently good performance characteristics to detect disease at an early stage so treatment may be offered with curative intent, while reducing the number of negative or unnecessary biopsies.

Background Prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, is a protein produced by normal, as well as malignant, cells of the prostate gland. The PSA test measures the level of PSA in a man's blood. For this test, a blood sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis. In 2012 the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended against prostate cancer screening. In May 2018, the USPSTF published a final recommendation statement to update PSA screening guidelines for two subsets of the population:

- for men age 70 years and older, the USPSTF recommends against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer, and
- for men ages 55 to 69 years, the USPSTF recommends that clinicians inform them about the potential benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer, stating that the decision about whether to be screened for prostate cancer should be an individual one.

### Ethnic differences in distribution of serum prostate-specific antigen: a study in a healthy Chinese male population [^d42b7399]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the normal distribution of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in healthy Chinese men, because, until recently, studies conducted to establish normal serum PSA values have not involved a Chinese population.

Methods

Between September 1999 and December 2001, 1096 healthy Chinese men aged 23 to 85 years, who had undergone a routine health examination, were recruited to this study. All underwent detailed clinical examinations, including serum PSA determination and digital rectal examination. All men with abnormal digital rectal examination findings and/or an abnormal serum PSA level (greater than 4.0 ng/mL) underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided sextant biopsy.

Results

The median serum PSA concentration was 0.50 ng/mL (95th percentile 1.20) for men 23 to 29 years old (n = 77); 0.55 ng/mL (95th percentile 1.21) for men 30 to 39 years old (n = 189); 0.54 ng/mL (95th percentile 1.23) for men 40 to 49 years old (n = 233); 0.82 ng/mL (95th percentile 2.35) for men 50 to 59 years old (n = 177); 0.93 ng/mL (95th percentile 3.20) for men 60 to 69 years old (n = 265); and 1.17 ng/mL (95th percentile 3.39) for men 70 years old or older (n = 155). The serum PSA concentration correlated with age (P < 0.001), with an increase of approximately 1.1% annually. No change occurred in the median serum PSA value and 95th percentile in men younger than 50 years old; a gradual increase was observed in men older than 50 years. In those 50 years old or older, the median and 95th percentile serum PSA values for Chinese men were significantly lower than those for other races and even for other Asian men.

Conclusions

These findings further confirm that the serum PSA level correlates with age. Moreover, the distribution and cutoff value of the serum PSA level differs along ethnic lines. In addition, our findings raise the question of whether lowering the PSA cutoff may enhance the detection of cancer in Chinese men who have the lowest prostate cancer rate.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^487ec31e]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF response to public comment — public comment occurred from April 11 to May 8, 2017; the USPSTF cited evidence when recommending against screening in men older than 70 years, including trial results without mortality benefit and increased likelihood of harms; it also stated that it found inadequate evidence that screening younger men or performing baseline PSA-based screening provides benefit.

### Diagnostic value of free prostate-specific antigen among men with a prostate-specific antigen level of… [^1186341b]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The percentage of free prostate-specific antigen (%fPSA) improves the diagnostic accuracy for prostate cancer when the serum level of total PSA (tPSA) is elevated. Approximately 14% of men with a tPSA below 3 microg/l have prostate cancer on biopsy, but the diagnostic value of %fPSA in such men is rather unknown. The purpose was to estimate the impact of %fPSA on future prostate cancer risk among men with a normal tPSA in prostate cancer screening.

Subjects and Methods

The first round of the Finnish arm of the European Randomized Trial for Screening of Prostate Cancer in 1996 to 1999 comprised 20,793 men aged 55–67 yr. Screen-negative men (tPSA level below 3.0 microg/l, n = 17,680) were followed up until the end of 2003. Cumulative risk of prostate cancer was calculated as a function of %fPSA.

Results

During the median follow-up of 5.8 yr (range, 0–7.7 yr), 327 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and 25% of them had a Gleason score of 7 or higher. Five years after the first screening, cumulative risk of prostate cancer was 1.7% (95%CI, 1.5–1.9%). Men with a %fPSA in the lowest quartile (< 14.2%) showed a 6.9-fold risk compared with those with a level in the highest quartile (> 23.7%).

Conclusions

In men with a low serum tPSA, a low %fPSA is a strong predictor of later diagnosis of prostate cancer.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to risk assessment, undiagnosed, EANM/EAU/ESTRO/ESUR/ISUP/SIOG 2025 guidelines recommend to use one of the following tools to decide on biopsy indication in asymptomatic males with a PSA level of 3–20 ng/mL and a normal DRE:

- risk-calculator, provided it is correctly calibrated to the population prevalence

- prostate MRI

- additional serum or urine biomarker test.

### Would you recommend prostate-specific antigen screening for this patient? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^a72ea42a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer is the third most common cancer type in the United States overall, accounting for 9.5% of new cancer cases and 5% of cancer deaths. The goal of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening is to identify early-stage disease that can be treated successfully. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reviewed evidence on the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening and treatment of screen-detected prostate cancer. It found that PSA-based screening in men aged 55 to 69 years prevents approximately 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer over 13 years per 1000 men screened and 3 cases of metastatic cancer per 1000 men screened, with no reduction in all-cause mortality. No benefit was found for PSA-based screening in men aged 70 years and older. On the basis of its review, the USPSTF concluded that the decision for men aged 55 to 69 years to have PSA-based screening should be an individual one and should include a discussion of the potential benefits and harms. Here, 2 experts-an internist and a urologist-discuss the key points of a shared decision-making conversation about PSA-based prostate cancer screening, the PSA-based screening strategy that optimizes benefit and minimizes harm, and the PSA threshold at which they would recommend further diagnostic testing.

### Congruence of cancer screening recommendations between the USPSTF and the top ten US cancer centers: a cross sectional study [^e843dbba]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 6
Cancer centers whose websites included a discussion of the potential harms associated with screening, stratified by cancer type.

Furthermore, there is a lack of clarity regarding the development process of the recommendations from each cancer center. While some centers directly referenced the USPSTF or other professional society guidelines, many did not. It is likely that the consensus of treating providers at the cancer centers played a significant role in the development of these recommendations; however, the extent of this involvement is not clearly described. Indeed, some of the discrepancies between the Top Ten US Cancer Centers and the USPSTF can be explained by guidelines from other bodies with conflicting recommendations. Although guidelines from both professional societies and the USPSTF are based on available evidence, they are reviewed and updated on different timelines. For example, the American College of Radiology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) advise annual mammography starting at age 40. NCCN further advises a clinical breast examination every 1–3 years from age 25 to 40, and annually afterwards. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises mammograms every 1–2 years starting at age 40, with consideration of biannual mammograms after age 55. ACS advises that mammograms should initially be completed annually starting at age 45, though may be done biannually after the age of 55. Similarly for prostate cancer, the AUA recommends consideration for initiating testing for average-risk men between 45 and 50 years with PSA as first line screening test at a personalized screening interval. They also advise that DRE may be used alongside PSA to establish the risk of clinically significant prostate cancer. ACS recommends considering PSA testing at 50 years old, with timing for subsequent testing interval dependent on the value of the initial test.NCCN recommends considering PSA testing at 45 years old with consideration for baseline DRE, and further testing interval dependent on the initial baseline value. For cervical cancer, ACOG, Society of Gynecologic Oncologists, and the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology have all endorsed the USPSTF guidelines. However, ACS recommends initiating screening with hrHPV alone every 5 years starting at 25 years through 65. Thus, just as it is difficult for patients to know what to do with so much conflicting guidance, the same can be true for the individual cancer centres and providers trying to consolidate conflicting advice from multiple guidelines to provide advice for their patients. Healthcare providers, who ultimately have the discretion to recommend a specific screening strategy for their individual patient, may not rely on one resource but rather try to merge all the available evidence and guidelines with their clinical experience, and the context of patient and system factors in which they practice.

### Operating characteristics of prostate-specific antigen in men with an initial PSA level of 3.0 ng / mL or lower [^821f024f]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Three fourths of US men older than 50 years have been screened with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for prostate cancer.

Objective

To estimate the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for PSA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Calculation of PSA ROC curves in the placebo group of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, a randomized, prospective study conducted from 1993 to 2003 at 221 US centers. Participants were 18 882 healthy men aged 55 years or older without prostate cancer and with PSA levels less than or equal to 3.0 ng/mL and normal digital rectal examination results, followed up for 7 years with annual PSA measurement and digital rectal examination. If PSA level exceeded 4.0 ng/mL or rectal examination result was abnormal, a prostate biopsy was recommended. After 7 years of study participation, an end-of-study prostate biopsy was recommended in all cancer-free men.

Main Outcome Measures

Operating characteristics of PSA for prostate cancer detection, including sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curve.

Results

Of 8575 men in the placebo group with at least 1 PSA measurement and digital rectal examination in the same year, 5587 (65.2%) had had at least 1 biopsy; of these, 1225 (21.9%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Of 1213 cancers with Gleason grade recorded, 250 (20.6%) were Gleason grade 7 or greater and 57 (4.7%) were Gleason grade 8 or greater. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) for PSA to discriminate any prostate cancer vs no cancer, Gleason grade 7 or greater cancer vs no or lower-grade cancer, and Gleason grade 8 or greater cancer vs no or lower-grade cancer were 0.678 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.666–0.689), 0.782 (95% CI, 0.748–0.816), and 0.827 (95% CI, 0.761–0.893), respectively (all P values < .001 for AUC vs 50%). For detecting any prostate cancer, PSA cutoff values of 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, and 4.1 ng/mL yielded sensitivities of 83.4%, 52.6%, 32.2%, and 20.5%, and specificities of 38.9%, 72.5%, 86.7%, and 93.8%, respectively. Age-stratified analyses showed slightly better performance of PSA in men younger than 70 years vs those 70 years or older with AUC values of 0.699 (SD, 0.013) vs 0.663 (SD, 0.013) (P = 0.03).

Conclusion

There is no cutpoint of PSA with simultaneous high sensitivity and high specificity for monitoring healthy men for prostate cancer, but rather a continuum of prostate cancer risk at all values of PSA.

### Use of 2.6 ng / mL prostate specific antigen prompt for biopsy in men older than 60 years [^ddbfbb54]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Since the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test as an aid to early prostate cancer detection, using a cutoff of 4.0 ng/ml in 1994, this cutoff has been widely adopted to recommend prostate biopsy. There has been recent investigation into lowering the PSA prompt for biopsy, especially in men younger than 60 years. We determined how a lower cutoff would perform in men older than 60 years.

Materials and Methods

From a prostate cancer screening study we studied 782 consecutive men who underwent prostate biopsy for PSA greater than 2.5 ng/ml or suspicious digital rectal examination. Biopsy results were evaluated as a function of patient age.

Results

Clinical and pathological characteristics of cancers detected in the PSA range 2.6 to 4.0 ng/ml were similar regardless of patient age. Overall PSA between 2.6 and 4.0 ng/ml was associated with a cancer detection rate of 16.2% using a sextant biopsy technique. PSA velocity was similar in men with prostate cancer in all age groups.

Conclusions

More than 15% of men with PSA 2.6 to 4.0 ng/ml who are 40 years or older have prostate cancer detected with sextant needle biopsies. PSA velocity, tumor stage, Gleason grade and tumor volume were similar in all age groups.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline part I: prostate cancer screening [^9f87942c]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Future directions in prostate cancer screening — screening and diagnosis remain intensely debated with many unanswered questions, and research is encouraged through clinical trials and modeling studies that prioritize inclusion of historically underrepresented populations. Shared decision making (SDM) regarding whether to screen, how frequently, and when to proceed to secondary testing or biopsy is critically important, but clinicians tend to discuss benefits more than harms; there is an unmet need for multilingual decision aids for people with varying health literacy. For populations at higher risk (e.g., concerning family history, Black ancestry, genetic risk, or elevated baseline prostate-specific antigen [PSA]), targeted and perhaps more intensive screening warrants investigation, whereas people with a very low likelihood of clinically significant cancer may benefit from less intensive or discontinuation of screening. A more comprehensive understanding is required of how race and ethnicity affect the operating characteristics of PSA, secondary biomarkers, and prostate imaging, recognizing that many undergoing screening are of mixed or unknown race and ethnicity. Efforts should be made by clinicians, payors, and health care systems to bridge this gap.

### Empirical estimates of prostate cancer overdiagnosis by age and prostate-specific antigen [^41f229f7]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Data are given as percent risk with 95% confidence interval for two screened cohorts separately. Data are not given for PSA < 3 ng/ml in the ERSPC cohort as biopsy was restricted to men with elevated PSA. ERSPC, European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer; PCPT, Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial; PSA, prostate specific antigen.

Figure 2
Risk of biopsy detectable cancer in a screened population divided by the 25 year risk of death from prostate cancer (solid black line), distant metastasis (solid grey line), and clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer (dashed black line) in an unscreened cohort, by PSA level at age 60. The dashed grey line at a ratio of 1 is included as reference. Risk of biopsy detectable cancer was obtained from the PCPT. The clinical endpoints were obtained from the Malmö cohort. PCPT, Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial; PSA, prostate specific antigen.

Across PSA levels, the risk of biopsy-detectable cancer is similar to the risk of a clinical diagnosis of cancer within 25 years. The ratio of these two risks ranges from slightly above 2 for low PSAs to close to 1 for PSAs above common biopsy thresholds, such as 4 ng/ml. We assume that most men with elevated PSA at age 60 and who subsequently develop prostate cancer would have had a positive biopsy had they been biopsied at 60. If such an assumption is correct, these results suggest that a high proportion of 60 year olds with screen-detected cancer following an elevated PSA will develop prostate cancer that is detectable by symptoms over the course of the subsequent 25 years, that is, the rate of overdiagnosis is low.

### Relationship between baseline prostate-specific antigen on cancer detection and prostate cancer death: long-term follow-up from the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer [^af046054]. European Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer (PCa) is associated with, besides a decrease in metastatic disease and PCa-specific mortality (PCSM), an increase in the incidence of PCa, as demonstrated in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian screening trial (PLCO) after correcting for contamination and in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) trial. A considerable proportion of the excess incidence due to PSA-based screening concerns overdiagnosis, for which detection and subsequent treatment most likely only result in harm. The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines recommend that men should not undergo PSA testing without counseling on the potential risks and benefits; if the decision is to perform a PSA test, a risk-based strategy should be followed. This risk-based strategy was further elaborated in the EAU 2021 position paper and in the recent recommendations on early detection of PCa. A very low PSA level has implications for further testing, with a screening interval of up to 8 yr for those younger than 60 yr and a recommendation to refrain from further testing for those aged ≥ 60 yr. The Göteborg-1 trial recently showed that age is a predictor for finding screen-detected Gleason ≥ 7 PCa. It is obvious that both a man's initial PSA level and his remaining life span are crucial in the balance between further testing to avoid missing a diagnosis within the window of curability and overdiagnosis with subsequent overtreatment. The general idea is that men with life expectancy of < 10–15 yr are unlikely to benefit from (further) screening.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^ea068a0f]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

What you need to know

PSA testing has increased the number of men diagnosed with and treated for prostate cancer, but many of these men would never have experienced any symptoms or death from prostate cancer
This guideline makes a weak recommendation against offering systematic PSA screening based on an updated systematic review. The recommendation is weak because there may be a small, though uncertain, benefit of screening on prostate cancer mortality
Men who place more value on avoiding complications from biopsies and cancer treatment are likely to decline screening. In contrast, men who put more value in even a small reduction of prostate cancer mortality (such as men at high baseline risk because of family history or African descent, or those concerned to rule out the diagnosis) may opt for screening
Shared decision making is needed for men considering screening to make a decision consistent with their individual values and preferences. However, clinicians need not feel obligated to systematically raise the issue of PSA screening with their patients

What is the role of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in prostate cancer? An expert panel produced these recommendations based on a linked systematic review. The review was triggered by a large scale, cluster randomised trial on PSA screening in men without a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer published in 2018 (box 1). It found no difference between one-time PSA screening and standard practice in prostate cancer mortality but found an increase in the detection of low risk prostate cancer after a median follow-up of 10 years.

Box 1
Results of the CAP Randomized Clinical Trial

This cluster-randomised trial of 419 582 British men was published in March 2018. After a median follow-up of 10 years, there was no significant difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality in men receiving care by general practices randomised to a single PSA screening intervention compared with men receiving care by practices randomised to standard practice without screening. The detection of low risk prostate cancer cases was higher in the PSA screening group. Although the trial had limitations, such as low adherence to PSA testing in the intervention arm (36%) and a follow-up of only 10 years, its findings do not support the use of single PSA testing for population based screening.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^9320e156]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Decision making with calculated risks in two clinical scenarios: For Man A (age 55 years) with PSA 1.0 ng/mL, abnormal-nodule on rectal examination, no family history, Caucasian race, and no prior negative prostate biopsy, the calculated risk of cancer is 29.1%, low-grade cancer 26.3%, and high-grade cancer 2.8%. For Man B (age 65 years) with PSA 2.5 ng/mL, normal rectal examination findings, no family history, African American race, and no prior negative prostate biopsy, the risk of cancer is 26.5%, low-grade cancer 15.7%, and high-grade cancer 10.8%; Man B "has a 4-fold higher risk of potentially life-threatening cancer than Man A". PSA indicates prostate-specific antigen.

### Viewpoint: limiting prostate cancer screening [^87b34c16]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer screening is controversial, and major professional associations offer differing screening guidelines. The author addresses 3 key issues about prostate cancer screening: 1) the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria to recommend a prostate biopsy, 2) the appropriate age to start screening, and 3) the appropriate age to stop screening. The author argues, on the basis of evidence published since 2000, that data supporting the efficacy of PSA screening remain unconvincing. The author recommends that screening should not be expanded to include average-risk men younger than age 50 years or older than age 75 years and that a PSA threshold below 4.0 ng/mL should not be used to trigger biopsy referral.

### The case for tailored prostate cancer screening: an NCCN perspective [^3ec88ffd]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

A preponderance of clinical evidence supports a significant public health benefit for screening and early detection of prostate cancer in selected men. The challenge lies in maximizing early diagnosis of potentially aggressive but curable disease while minimizing diagnosis and treatment of indolent disease. A tailored approach to population screening in appropriately counseled men, using an evidence-based strategy with judicious prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, will reduce prostate-cancer mortality yet limit overdetection of clinically insignificant disease. Use of newer biomarkers that increase specificity for prostate cancer detection, including percentage of free PSA, 4Kscore, prostate health index, prostate cancer antigen 3, and multiparametric MRI may be considered under certain circumstances.

### PSA testing in general practice [^2f9d22dc]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

A questionnaire was sent to 400 general practitioners (GPs), concerning prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. Regarding the indications for PSA testing, 80% of GPs test men with urinary tract symptoms, 65% test men with a positive family history, 62% test on patient request, and 21% test men with unrelated symptoms. When PSA is measured, 91% of GPs inform their patient, and 71% discuss the significance of an abnormal result. The mean age range for PSA testing was from 50 years, without an upper age limit. The mode PSA threshold for referral was 6.6 ng/ml. De facto PSA screening appears to be widely practised.
