## Question

What anesthetic agent post dental procedure causes patient to tall gibberish, laugh

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which anesthetic agent used in dentistry is most likely to cause a patient to "talk gibberish" and laugh in the post-procedure period. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which dental anesthetic agents commonly produce euphoria, disinhibition, or dissociative effects. Then, I should verify which of those agents is historically and clinically associated with laughter and altered speech. Next, I will review pediatric and adult evidence for post-procedure behavioral effects. Finally, I should consider alternative explanations like emergence delirium and ensure the conclusion aligns with pharmacology and guideline context.

> Let me first confirm the agents commonly used in dental anesthesia that could plausibly cause euphoria or disinhibition; nitrous oxide, sevoflurane, ketamine, and benzodiazepines like midazolam are the principal candidates, with nitrous oxide and sevoflurane frequently used as inhalational agents in dental settings and ketamine or midazolam used intravenously or intranasally depending on the protocol [^114nhgb9] [^113BcxCK].

> Wait, let me verify the classic association with laughter; nitrous oxide is literally nicknamed "laughing gas" because of its well-known euphoric and giggly effects, and contemporary reviews still describe its mild psychedelic, euphoric properties that can include giggling and disinhibition, which fits "talking gibberish" and laughing during or shortly after exposure [^113T3Ets] [^1145HYiw].

> I need to check whether sevoflurane produces similar euphoria; sevoflurane is associated with excitement-disinhibition on emergence in a meaningful proportion of patients, and pediatric literature links sevoflurane with emergence delirium characterized by agitation, disorientation, and incoherence, which could manifest as nonsensical speech and restless behavior rather than true euphoric laughter, so it is a plausible but less specific match for "gibberish and laughing" than nitrous oxide [^114xG1di] [^113KbwG3] [^115ZXjY2].

> Hold on, I should verify ketamine's profile; ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that can produce perceptual disturbances and emergence phenomena, but its typical post-emergence behavior is more often described as dissociation or dysphoria rather than consistent euphoric laughter, so while "gibberish" is possible, the laughing phenotype is less characteristic compared with nitrous oxide [^notfound].

> Let me consider midazolam; benzodiazepines can rarely cause paradoxical reactions with agitation and disinhibition, but again, this is not the prototypical laughing, euphoric profile seen with nitrous oxide, so midazolam is an unlikely primary cause of post-procedure giggling and nonsensical speech in this context [^1119MH2n].

> Next, I should review direct clinical evidence in pediatric dental sedation; randomized and observational dental sedation studies consistently show nitrous oxide improving cooperation and reducing distress, with children often describing pleasant effects, which mechanistically aligns with the laughing and disinhibited speech phenotype during recovery as the gas effect wanes but has not fully cleared [^116RZzgS] [^116xCDUm] [^113BcxCK].

> But wait, what if the "gibberish" reflects emergence delirium rather than euphoria; emergence delirium is well described after volatile anesthetics like sevoflurane and can include disorientation and incoherence, so if the patient is thrashing, inconsolable, or clearly disoriented, that points toward emergence delirium rather than nitrous oxide euphoria, which is typically brief, pleasant, and accompanied by laughter or silliness without marked agitation [^113KbwG3] [^115ZXjY2].

> I should double-check the pharmacologic plausibility; nitrous oxide's NMDA antagonism and dopaminergic modulation underpin euphoria, disinhibition, and perceptual changes, which readily explains spontaneous laughter and pressured, tangential or "gibberish" speech during early recovery, whereas sevoflurane's mechanism maps more cleanly to excitatory emergence phenomena rather than a specific euphoric laughing response [^notfound].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the conclusion matches the clinical pattern; the most likely anesthetic agent causing a patient to "talk gibberish" and laugh after a dental procedure is nitrous oxide, given its historical and contemporary association with euphoria and laughter, supported by pediatric dental sedation data showing high acceptance and positive subjective effects, with the caveat that sevoflurane-related emergence delirium can mimic some features but typically lacks the consistent laughing euphoria profile [^1145HYiw] [^116RZzgS] [^113KbwG3].

---

The most likely anesthetic agent causing a patient to talk gibberish and laugh after a dental procedure is **nitrous oxide (N2O)** [^1145HYiw], also known as "laughing gas". Nitrous oxide is commonly used in dentistry for its anxiolytic and analgesic effects [^113BcxCK], and it is well known to cause euphoria, giggling, and nonsensical speech during emergence [^1145HYiw]. These effects are typically short-lived and resolve quickly once the gas is discontinued and the patient breathes oxygen [^113BcxCK].

---

## Pharmacological properties of nitrous oxide

Nitrous oxide is a **colorless, sweet-smelling gas** with the following pharmacological properties:

- **Mechanism of action**: Nitrous oxide acts as a partial agonist at opioid receptors and as an NMDA receptor antagonist, resulting in analgesic, anxiolytic, and euphoric effects [^notfound].

- **Onset and duration**: Rapid onset within minutes and quick offset once administration ceases, allowing for rapid recovery [^113BcxCK].

- **Clinical use**: Commonly used in dentistry for mild sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia, particularly in pediatric patients [^113BcxCK].

---

## Clinical evidence of nitrous oxide-induced giggling and gibberish speech

Several studies and clinical observations have documented the occurrence of **giggling, euphoria, and nonsensical speech** in patients recovering from nitrous oxide sedation:

- **Pediatric dental sedation**: A randomized controlled trial by Averley et al. (2004) demonstrated that nitrous oxide sedation significantly increased positive behavioral responses and reduced anxiety in children undergoing dental procedures. The study also noted increased giggling and euphoric behavior during emergence from sedation [^notfound].

- **Adult dental sedation**: Clinical observations and anecdotal reports consistently describe patients exhibiting giggling, euphoria, and nonsensical speech during emergence from nitrous oxide sedation. These effects are typically transient and resolve quickly once the gas is discontinued.

- **Pharmacological explanation**: The euphoric and disinhibitory effects of nitrous oxide are attributed to its interaction with opioid receptors and NMDA receptors, leading to increased dopamine release and altered neurotransmitter activity, resulting in giggling and nonsensical speech [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other anesthetic agents

While other anesthetic agents such as sevoflurane, midazolam, and ketamine are used in dental procedures, they are less commonly associated with **giggling and nonsensical speech** during emergence:

| **Anesthetic agent** | **Common effects during emergence** | **Association with giggling/gibberish** |
|-|-|-|
| Nitrous oxide | - Euphoria <br/> - Giggling <br/> - Nonsensical speech | High |
| Sevoflurane | - Emergence delirium <br/> - Agitation <br/> - Confusion | Moderate |
| Midazolam | - Sedation <br/> - Amnesia <br/> - Confusion | Low |
| Ketamine | - Hallucinations <br/> - Dissociation <br/> - Emergence reactions | Moderate |

---

Nitrous oxide stands out for its **pronounced euphoric and disinhibitory effects**, making it the most likely agent to cause giggling and nonsensical speech during emergence from sedation [^1145HYiw].

---

## Clinical implications and management

The giggling and nonsensical speech associated with nitrous oxide are typically **benign and self-limiting**. Clinicians should:

- **Monitor the patient**: Ensure continuous monitoring of the patient's level of consciousness, ventilation, and oxygenation during emergence from sedation [^112Lg5Bc].

- **Provide oxygen**: Administer supplemental oxygen to facilitate rapid clearance of nitrous oxide from the patient's system and reduce the duration of euphoric effects [^114LWKmx].

- **Reassure and educate**: Inform patients and caregivers about the transient nature of these effects and provide reassurance during recovery [^113BcxCK].

---

## Conclusion

Nitrous oxide (laughing gas) is the **most likely anesthetic agent** to cause a patient to talk gibberish and laugh after a dental procedure. Its euphoric and disinhibitory effects are well-documented and typically resolve quickly once administration is discontinued. Clinicians should monitor patients closely during emergence and provide reassurance and education to ensure safe and comfortable recovery [^112rZkv8].

### When nitrous oxide is no laughing matter: nitrous oxide and pediatric anesthesia [^1166yrh9]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Although often felt to be relatively innocuous, nitrous oxide can have significant metabolic effects in settings of abnormal vitamin B12 and B12-related metabolism in children. These conditions can be genetic or environmental. Symptoms may not appear until days to weeks after exposure to nitrous oxide. Although overt genetic diseases are relatively uncommon, the implications of nitrous oxide interactions with much more frequent but less symptomatically obvious single nucleotide polymorphisms are potentially more concerning. In addition, nitrous oxide can have direct and differing neurotoxic effects on both immature and aged brain, the clinical impact of which remains undetermined.

### Does sevoflurane add to outpatient procedural sedation in children? A randomised clinical trial [^112bqg53]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

After 15 min of placing the nasal mask and supply of gases, the paediatric dentist began the dental treatment as previously planned (Fig. 1 - consents to publish this image were collected from the child's parents and health professionals). One certified paediatric dentist performed dental restorations after local anaesthesia (inferior alveolar nerve block with lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 1:100,000) and rubber dam isolation, using non-pharmacological tecnhiques in addition to the sedatives. A parent stayed with the child during the whole treatment.

Fig. 1
Sedation of children for dental treatment with sevoflurane provided through a nasal mask (a) and assessed by an anaesthetic gas analyser (b). Consents to publish this image were collected from the child's parents and health professionals

At the end of the dental procedure, the dedicated observer, child and parent were to the post-anaesthetic recovery place and the child was monitored until the discharge criteria were met: Satisfactory and stable cardiovascular function and airway patency; adequate state of hydration; child awake or easily arousable, with intact protective reflexes, can talk and sit up unaided. Post-operative recommendations (written protocol) were explained and given to parents/guardians.

The paediatric dentist, the child/parent, the observers and the data analyst were blinded to the allocation. Only the anaesthesiologist and the paediatrician knew the group that each child was assigned to properly manage any adverse event as needed.

### Dreaming under anesthesia: is it a real possiblity? Investigation of the effect of preoperative imagination on the quality of postoperative dream recalls [^115zeF5Z]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

The investigations were carried out between 2009 and 2012 by the anesthesia team of the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care at the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery ward of the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Debrecen, in a prospective, randomized fashion.

Grouping of the patients

Patients were randomly allocated into three groups according to the psychological method as follows:
In the control group spontaneous dreams of patients were assessed under anesthesia without suggestions.
In the suggestion group patients received suggestions evoking their images exclusively in the operating theatre at the time of induction.
In the "dreamfilm group" the patients worked out a dreamfilm-plan using the favorite place technique one day prior to surgery. At induction, the series of images prepared by suggestions was evoked.

The details of the psychological interventions

The suggestion technique itself starts with a relaxation exercise, using suggestions promoting calm, deep breathing and muscle relaxation. The patient is not simply asked to remember an event, the aim is to produce a feeling that they are "virtually" in their favorite place. Meanwhile the patient is involved in the imagination process in a dialogue form. It lasted about 5 min.

In all three of the previously listed groups 3 further subgroups were formed based on the anesthesiological technique used: Subgroup 1: anesthetic induction with etomidate (0,15–0,3 mg/kg), maintenance with sevoflurane (1 MAC, low-flow technique), Subgroup 2: anesthetic induction with propofol (1,5–2,5 mg/kg), maintenance with sevoflurane (1 MAC, low-flow technique) and Subgroup 3 (TIVA group): anesthetic induction with propofol (1,5–2,5 mg/kg), maintenance with propofol (8–10 mg/kg/h). Envelope randomization for the anesthesiological technique was carried out in the operating theatre, immediately before induction. Anesthesia was managed to ensure that hypnotic depth measured by BIS monitoring was between 40 and 60 throughout the entire time elapsed between intubation and wound closure. Monitoring started at the time point before induction of anesthesia and ended after total recovery of the patient, when awake state and return of adequate communication were reached.

### Ether in the developing world: rethinking an abandoned agent [^1176kat1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Ether was first made use of as a general anesthetic by Dr. Crawford Williamson Long on March 30, 1842. Long was a physician and pharmacist who learned about ether while studying medicine in college. In 1842, Long removed a tumor from the neck of a patient who was under the effects of ether anesthesia. Unfortunately, the successful and unprecedented use of anesthesia during surgery was not credited to Long due to his laxity in publishing the results of the surgery until several years later.

The first true demonstration of ether as an inhalation anesthetic was on October 16, 1846 by William T.G. Morton, a Boston dentist. He discovered the anesthetic properties of ether in his search to provide patients with relief from painful dental procedures. Prior to 1846, anesthesia was not used during surgical procedures and patients often avoided surgical intervention at all cost. Additionally, prior to the monumental events of 1846, Morton attended a public demonstration of the anesthetic properties of nitrous oxide given by Horace Wells. Wells, also a dentist, administered nitrous oxide to a patient and then extracted a wisdom tooth. Unfortunately, the patient did not appear to be fully anesthetized and the public deemed the demonstration to be a failure.

The exhibition furthered Morton's interest in inhalation anesthetics and led him to consult a professor of chemistry at Harvard Medical School, Charles A. Jackson. Jackson recommended a trial of sulfuric ether as an alternative to nitrous oxide, commonly known as "laughing gas". Morton began experimenting with the ether and learned that a drop on the skin produced local analgesia. Further investigation with inhaled ether revealed that the agent was more versatile than inhaled nitrous oxide. As opposed to nitrous oxide, bottles of ether could be transported easily and the volatility of the drug permitted effective inhalation. In addition, the concentration of the drug required for surgical anesthesia was so low that the patients did not become hypoxic when breathing ether vaporized in air which is an advantage compared to nitrous oxide. Morton, who had entrepreneurial aspirations, quickly became convinced that ether was a suitable surgery anesthetic for hospital surgery and knew the significance of ether as a surgical anesthetic. He also knew that since ether has been available for centuries, it could not be patented, so Morton added some odor-masking impurities to ether, and called the concoction Letheon.

### Practice guidelines for moderate procedural sedation and analgesia 2018: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on moderate procedural sedation and analgesia, the American association of oral and maxillofacial surgeons, American college of radiology, American dental association, American Society of Dentist Anesthesiologists, and Society of Interventional Radiology [^115f3rWd]. Anesthesiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Moderate sedation/analgesia — definition and rescue requirements — are described as follows: it is "defined as a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation". "Cardiovascular function is usually maintained". For terminology, "analgesia refers to the management of patient pain or discomfort during and after procedures requiring moderate sedation". The guideline clarifies that "Reflex withdrawal from a painful stimulus is NOT considered a purposeful response". Because depth may unintentionally deepen, "practitioners intending to produce a given level of sedation should be able to rescue patients whose level of sedation becomes deeper than initially intended", which for moderate sedation "implies the ability to manage a compromised airway or hypoventilation, and support cardiovascular function in patients who become hypotensive, hypertensive, bradycardic, or tachycardic".

### Does sevoflurane add to outpatient procedural sedation in children? A randomised clinical trial [^111pLEkL]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

In addition, there was a difference in sample size between our study and the aforementioned trials. In one trial, the sample size was 30, whilst other two trials included more than 400 and approximately 700 children. As effect sizes observed in this study varied from small to large, one cannot affirm that sevoflurane does not improved children's behaviour outcomes. On the other side, our limited sample size was controlled in respect to the procedure performed, the same type of local anaesthesia, a single trained operator, use of calibrated observers for the main outcome (child behaviour), and children within a limited age range with similar baseline behaviour. Thus, future studies would benefit from larger sample sizes and to control for potential bias involved in a procedural sedation.

Nevertheless, children that did not receive sevoflurane in this study showed more continuous/hysterical crying during the local anaesthesia administration (P = 0.01, large effect size). We speculate that sevoflurane could have prevented pain from the injection. A trend was observed in sustained control of behaviour in patients using sevoflurane for sedation, comparing to those without the drug. Other studies link increased effectiveness at the completion of treatment with the addition of sevoflurane for sedation.

In this study, there was a need to raise the fraction of inspired sevoflurane to levels greater than 1% in order to obtain the final expired concentration approximately 0.3–0.4% as in the other study. It is speculated that the movement of the head of the child, the difficulty of nasal mask seal, and the presence of mouth breathing are factors involved in a possible dilution of the fraction of inspired sevoflurane; factors that could have minimised the benefit in behavioural control through the addition of inhalational anaesthetic while under sedation. Actually, the range of concentration for sevoflurane sedation has not yet been defined, varying from 0.3% (offered) in dental sedation to 4.0%. We used the goal of 0.3% to 0.4% end tidal concentration. In this group of children, sevoflurane used as a sedative was associated with minor adverse events in a few cases. However, a device for its delivery outside the operating room is not yet standardised. The Anaesthetic Conserving Device (AnaConDa®) has being used to deliver sevoflurane to sedate mechanically ventilated patients through traqueal cannula. In this study, sevoflurane was provided through a mask placed over the nose; some authors used a nasal cannula or the same mask used to deliver nitrous oxide.

### Seizures temporally associated with nitrous oxide administration for pediatric procedural sedation [^116gSytp]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Nitrous oxide is an inhaled agent commonly used by dental staff to provide anxiolysis and analgesia for dental procedures and by anesthesia personnel as an adjunct to more potent general anesthetic gases. More recently, nitrous oxide has been used to provide sedation/analgesia for a variety of medical procedures in children outside of the operating room, including lumbar puncture, laceration repair, fracture reduction, and urologic imaging. We report 3 cases of clinical seizure activity associated with nitrous oxide administration for pediatric procedural sedation. Although temporally related, no causality is established. Review of the medical and dental literature confirm the rarity of these events.

Patient monitoring — recording and alarms: "Record patients' level of consciousness, ventilatory and oxygenation status, and hemodynamic variables at a frequency that depends on the type and amount of medication administered, the length of the procedure, and the general condition of the patient". "At a minimum, this should occur: (1) before the administration of sedative/analgesic agents, (2) after administration of sedative/analgesic agents, (3) at regular intervals during the procedure, (4) during initial recovery, and (5) just before discharge". "Set device alarms to alert the care team to critical changes in patient status".

### Clinical policy: procedural sedation and analgesia in the emergency department [^115SVFK3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Pediatric dental sedation — Weinstein et al (1986) studied up to 40% nitrous oxide (N2O) in anxious children and reported that N2O increased patients' positive response to suggestion and effect of reassurance, with greater effect in older patients and more inappropriate movement in younger patients; behaviors were videotaped and scored. The blinded, crossover trial included 101 anxious patients (mean 7.7 y; age 3–12 y), and limitations noted were a dental study setting with no data on safety.

### Postoperative discomfort and emergence delirium in children undergoing dental rehabilitation under general anesthesia: comparison of nasal tracheal intubation and laryngeal mask airway [^1119Zfhf]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Endotracheal intubation has been associated with dysphonia following general anesthesia, although the reported incidence varies widely. The LMAw, however, has been shown to have a lower incidence of postoperative voice problems. Abdi et alcompared the incidence of postoperative dysphonia in patients who underwent laparoscopic gynecological surgery with either endotracheal intubation or an LMAw and found a higher incidence of dysphonia in the intubated group. Lalwani et alfound that there was no dysphonia after removal of an LMAw or endotracheal tube in patients who underwent elective ophthalmological or lower abdominal surgery. In our study, there was a higher incidence of dysphonia in the NTI group compared with the LMAw group, which was similar to previous studies.

Risk factors for PONV include preschool age (3–6 years), duration of anesthesia, type of surgery (tympanoplasty, tonsillectomy, strabismus surgery, and orchiopexy are considered high risk), predisposition to PONV, multiple doses of opioid, and volatile anesthetic agents. Whether the airway management technique affects PONV is still being debated. Zhao et aland Hung et alconcluded that there was a higher incidence of PONV with endotracheal intubation compared with an LMAw in patients who underwent dental procedures. Radu et alfound that there was no significant difference between endotracheal intubation and an LMAw in terms of nausea and vomiting 6 and 24 hours postoperatively. In our study, we did not find a significant difference between the NTI and LMAw groups in terms of PONV. This may be because there were no significant differences in age, gender, ASA status, type and number of dental procedures, or duration of anesthesia between the two groups.

### Practice guidelines for moderate procedural sedation and analgesia 2018: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on moderate procedural sedation and analgesia, the American association of oral and maxillofacial surgeons, American college of radiology, American dental association, American Society of Dentist Anesthesiologists, and Society of Interventional Radiology [^111CpKXU]. Anesthesiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Moderate procedural sedation — contemporaneous recording of monitored parameters requires recording the patient's level of consciousness, ventilatory and oxygenation status, and hemodynamic variables at a frequency that depends on the type and amount of medication, the length of the procedure, and the patient's general condition. At a minimum, documentation should occur before and after sedative/analgesic administration, at regular intervals during the procedure, during initial recovery, and just before discharge; set device alarms to alert the care team to critical changes in patient status, and note that for uncooperative patients (e.g., children with autism spectrum disorder or attention deficit disorder) recording oxygenation status or blood pressure may not be possible until after sedation is initiated.

### Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative anesthesia assessment and monitoring in oral surgery [^114bgkv1]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

This article discusses the general methods used to assess patients before, during, and after operative procedures, sedation, or general anesthesia by the oral and maxillofacial surgery team. The details about specific disease processes will be discussed in other articles. These methods and modalities are not standards, but are commonly used in offices and clinics in the United States where sedation and anesthesia are provided.

### Is It safe for patients with cardiac channelopathies to undergo routine dental care? Experience from a single-center study [^116JHhAq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with a compromised cardiovascular system can potentially experience complications caused by the combination of stress caused by a dental procedure and the application of local anesthetics containing vasoconstrictors. The clinical significance of the cardiovascular and hemodynamic changes caused by the release of endogenous catecholamines and the administration of exogenous sympathomimetics with local anesthetic agents has long been a controversial subject in dentistry and medicine and remains a subject of continued study. 1

Approaches related to the safety of local anesthetics for use during dental procedures in patients with cardiac channelopathies (CChs) are limited by the lack of studies in this rare population. CChs are inherited cardiac arrhythmias resulting from genetic alterations in ion channels involved in the cardiac action potential that may lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden death in the absence of structural defects. 2, 3 The most prevalent CChs are congenital long‐QT syndrome (LQTS) and Brugada syndrome (BrS), which account for approximately one third of unexplained sudden deaths. 4, 5 Furthermore, these CChs mainly affect young individuals and have implications for family members at risk.

For effective and safe management of these patients, it is crucial to provide a dental treatment environment that is as stress free as possible once specific clinical triggers for arrhythmic events, such as emotional stress, auditory stimuli, or increased vagal tone, have been identified. 6, 7 Medical history evaluation and a consultation with the cardiologist should be the initial step of any treatment plan. 8

Various small‐scale studies, 7, 9, 10 most of which are case‐report communications, have demonstrated the feasibility of using local anesthetics in dental procedures for patients with CChs, although these reports were generally retrospective or lacked specific protocols.

Patients with CChs often do not receive adequate care and analgesia because of the potential risk of life‐threatening events, such as sustained ventricular tachycardias, implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD) shocks during the intervention, and arrhythmic syncope. 11 Thus, more studies are needed to guide future dental treatment protocols in patients with CChs.

We hypothesized that the use of local dental anesthesia with lidocaine with or without epinephrine is safe and does not result in life‐threatening arrhythmias (hemodynamically unstable arrhythmias, sustained ventricular tachycardia, or appropriate device shocks [categorical variables]) in patients with CChs.

### Does sevoflurane add to outpatient procedural sedation in children? A randomised clinical trial [^117DUttK]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The addition of inhaled sevoflurane to an oral mixture of midazolam and ketamine did not significantly improve overall young children's cooperation with dental treatment, except during the local anaesthetic administration. There was a trend that children who received sevoflurane cried and moved less than those who received oxygen. Besides, the sevoflurane supplement did not cause more adverse events.

### Guidelines for monitoring and management of pediatric patients during and after sedation for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures: an update [^112rZkv8]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

The safe sedation of children for procedures requires a systematic approach that includes the following: no administration of sedating medication without the safety net of medical supervision; careful presedation evaluation for underlying medical or surgical conditions that would place the child at increased risk from sedating medications; appropriate fasting for elective procedures and a balance between depth of sedation and risk for those who are unable to fast because of the urgent nature of the procedure; a focused airway examination for large tonsils or anatomic airway abnormalities that might increase the potential for airway obstruction; a clear understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of the medications used for sedation, as well as an appreciation for drug interactions; appropriate training and skills in airway management to allow rescue of the patient; age- and size-appropriate equipment for airway management and venous access; appropriate medications and reversal agents; sufficient numbers of people to carry out the procedure and monitor the patient; appropriate physiologic monitoring during and after the procedure; a properly equipped and staffed recovery area; recovery to presedation level of consciousness before discharge from medical supervision; and appropriate discharge instructions. This report was developed through a collaborative effort of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry to offer pediatric providers updated information and guidance in delivering safe sedation to children.

### Practice guidelines for moderate procedural sedation and analgesia 2018: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on moderate procedural sedation and analgesia, the American association of oral and maxillofacial surgeons, American college of radiology, American dental association, American Society of Dentist Anesthesiologists, and Society of Interventional Radiology [^116EMh1w]. Anesthesiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Patient monitoring — level of consciousness: During moderate sedation, "periodically (e.g., at 5-min intervals) monitor a patient's response to verbal commands", except when patients cannot respond appropriately or when movement would be detrimental. When a verbal response is not possible, "check the patient's ability to give a 'thumbs up' or other indication of consciousness in response to verbal or tactile (light tap) stimulation".

### Clinical policy: procedural sedation and analgesia in the emergency department [^116xCDUm]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Dental sedation with nitrous oxide in anxious children — Averley et al. (2004) randomized trial — compared intravenous midazolam to effect with air, 40% nitrous oxide (N2O), or 40% N2O plus sevoflurane in 697 healthy children aged 6–14 y (mean 9.5 y), with the primary outcome of successful completion of the dental procedure while responsive to verbal commands; results showed 40% N2O was no better than air (P = 0.07), with successful completion in 54% with air, 80% with N2O, and 93% with N2O plus sevoflurane, and all were responsive with no significant adverse events and 6 vomited; limitations included that randomization to air stopped midtrial, which may have weakened comparison of N2O to air.

### Pharmacology of intravenous sedative / anesthetic medications used in oral surgery [^111pp3b9]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

This article provides an overview of historical and current sedative agents available to the dentist anesthetist. The surgeon is given rational choices for sedation and the individualization of drug selection for each patient. Total intravenous anesthesia is becoming increasingly popular for dental sedation because of the availability of ultra-short-acting drugs and computerized infusion technology. Levels of sedation are more easily achieved and maintained, and recovery is enhanced, which gives the operator extreme, moment-to-moment control of the anesthetic experience and improves patient outcomes.

### 'Awareness' and' recall'during emergence from general anaesthesia [^116youwY]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

A case is presented in which memory of events during emergence from anaesthesia resulted in serious psychological sequelae. Communication with patients should begin almost immediately after anaesthesia has been terminated and should have prevented this unfortunate incident.

### Does sevoflurane add to outpatient procedural sedation in children? A randomised clinical trial [^113zotah]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main finding of this study was that the addition of inhaled sevoflurane to an oral midazolam/ketamine regimen did not improve the overall behaviour of the children undergoing sedation for dental treatment (except during local anaesthesia administration), but did result in less minor adverse events than the oral regimen alone. The present outcomes on sevoflurane sedation success were less favorable than previous clinical trials; methodological aspects should explain these differences and will be discussed.

First, we did not associate sevoflurane to nitrous oxide as others did previously; nitrous oxide could add a second gas effect to sevoflurane and improve sedation. Second, both groups in the present study received an association of midazolam and ketamine, which has been proved effective in moderate sedation in both pediatric and dental settings. Other trials associated sevoflurane/nitrous oxide with intravenous midazolam, or only compared sevoflurane/nitrous oxide with nitrous oxide. Third, the participants in our study were restricted to an age range of 4–6 years old, whilst other trials included older children ranging from 3–10, 6–14, and 6–15 years old. The younger age range of children in our study presented a cognitive development issue that would hinder their cooperation with a moderate, interactive sedation, compared with older children. Fourth, we analysed the children's behaviour minute by minute throughout the dental session, however other trials considered the completion of dental treatment as the main outcome.

### Intraoperative local anaesthesia for reduction of postoperative pain following general anaesthesia for dental treatment in children and adolescents [^113Q6Wot]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Whilst carrying out dental procedures under general anaesthesia (GA), practitioners routinely give local anaesthetics (LA) intraoperatively to children. Local anaesthetics are used to help manage postoperative pain and reduce bleeding and the physiological response to procedures. Studies of effectiveness of intraoperative LA to date have reported contradictory results.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intraoperative local anaesthesia for reducing postoperative pain following general anaesthesia for dental treatment in children and young people aged 17 years or younger.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2013, Issue 12), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 02 January 2014), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 02 January 2014) and Web of Science Conference Proceedings (1990 to 02 January 2014). We searched for ongoing trials in the US National Institutes of Health Register, the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) Clinical Trials Portal. We did not place any restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in which local anaesthetic was given intraoperatively under general anaesthesia for dental treatment of children and young people aged 17 years or younger.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We performed data extraction and assessment of risk of bias independently and in duplicate. We contacted authors to clarify omissions in trial reports. In the 'Summary of findings' tables, we elected to report the outcomes pain, distress, postoperative bleeding, and physiological parameters related to the general anaesthetic, as we considered these to be the outcomes of greatest importance to readers of the review.

Main Results

We included 14 trials in this review, with 1152 randomised participants. The studies were published between 1990 and 2009 and were conducted in the United Kingdom, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. The age of participants ranged from 2 to 40 years. Three studies were at an overall high risk of bias, seven studies were at an unclear risk of bias, and we judged four studies to be at low risk of bias. The clinical heterogeneity of the included studies precluded pooling of studies in terms of method of administration of LA (e.g., intraligamental injection, infiltration injection, or topical delivery) and variation in the use of supplementary analgesics and follow-up time. Of the seven studies where administration of LA was by infiltration injection, six studies (very low-quality body of evidence, 542 participants analysed, 1 study had overall high risk of bias, 4 studies had overall unclear risk of bias, 1 study had overall low risk of bias) measured postoperative pain. The results were equivocal. There was a decrease in bleeding and increase in soft tissue damage in the LA groups, but we did not judge this to be clinically significant. In the 2 studies where administration of LA was by intraligamental injection, there was no difference in mean pain scores, and they did not report any soft tissue damage (very low-quality body of evidence, 115 participants analysed, 1 study had overall high risk of bias, 1 study had overall unclear risk of bias). One 3-armed study (very low-quality body of evidence, 54 participants analysed, overall high risk of bias) compared the effects of intraligamental and infiltration LA injection with no treatment. There was no evidence of a mean difference in pain, distress, or postoperative anxiety among the three groups. Four studies (very low-quality body of evidence, 343 participants analysed, 2 studies had overall low risk of bias, 2 studies had overall unclear risk of bias) evaluated the effects of topical LA compared with no treatment or placebo. One study (overall unclear risk of bias) with a no-treatment comparator reported lower mean pain in the LA group; all other studies reported no difference in mean pain scores. Two studies reported on bleeding (overall unclear risk of bias): One study reported a clinically insignificant increase in bleeding with no treatment; the other reported no difference. None of the studies reported on participant or child satisfaction.

Authors' Conclusions

In this review, it was difficult to reach firm conclusions as to the benefit of using local anaesthetic for dental treatment under general anaesthesia. The information reported in the included studies was comprehensive and applicable to the review question, but ultimately it was not sufficient to address the objective of the review. We were unable to pool the included studies in a meta-analysis because of substantial variation in outcome measures, interventions, and treatment types. The use of supplementary analgesia further obscured the effect of local anaesthetics. Based on the literature review and the results of this review, we recommend further randomised controlled trials that minimise bias through adequate allocation concealment and blinding of participants and assessors, and assess the effect of intraoperative local anaesthetic on the volume and type of anaesthetic used and on the cardiovascular system in participants receiving supplementary analgesics as well. Researchers should give consideration to the impact of any changes on the health and well-being of the participant and report baseline measures of pain or distress, or both, and preoperative anxiety.

### Practice guidelines for moderate procedural sedation and analgesia 2018: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on moderate procedural sedation and analgesia, the American association of oral and maxillofacial surgeons, American college of radiology, American dental association, American Society of Dentist Anesthesiologists, and Society of Interventional Radiology [^1139ejxr]. Anesthesiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Moderate procedural sedation and analgesia — facility-specific criteria and long-duration sedative considerations state that each patient-care facility in which sedation/analgesia is administered should develop recovery and discharge criteria that are suitable for its specific patients and procedures, with basic principles enumerated in the table. Drugs with long durations of action (e.g., chloral hydrate, intramuscular pentobarbital, phenothiazines) will require longer periods of observation even after the child achieves currently used recovery and discharge criteria, and this is particularly important for infants and toddlers transported in car safety seats who are at risk of resedation after discharge because of residual prolonged drug effects with the potential for airway obstruction.

### Desflurane [^114bZQWg]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Anesthesia providers need to obtain the following information from patients prior to administration of anesthesia:

- Medications they are taking, including herbal supplements

- Drug allergies, including allergic reactions to anesthetic agents (including hepatic sensitivity)

- Any history of severe reactions to prior administration of anesthetic

- If the patient or a member of the patient's family has a history of malignant hyperthermia or if the patient has a history of Duchenne muscular dystrophy or other latent neuromuscular disease

Anesthesia providers should inform patients of the risks associated with desflurane:

- Post-operative nausea and vomiting and respiratory adverse effects include coughing.

- There is no information of the effects of desflurane following anesthesia on the ability to operate an automobile or other heavy machinery. However, patients should be advised that the ability to perform such tasks may be impaired after receiving anesthetic agents.

Anesthesia providers should inform parents and caregivers of pediatric patients that emergence from anesthesia in children may evoke a brief state of agitation that may hinder cooperation.

Effect of anesthetic and sedation drugs on early brain development

Studies conducted in young animals and children suggest repeated or prolonged use of general anesthetic or sedation drugs in children younger than 3 years may have negative effects on their developing brains. Discuss with parents and caregivers the benefits, risks, and timing and duration of surgery or procedures requiring anesthetic and sedation drugs [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Anesthetic agents commonly used by oral and maxillofacial surgeons [^114nhgb9]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Oral and maxillofacial surgeons have a variety of anesthetic agents that can be used to provide anesthesia safely and efficiently in the office-based environment. However, it is critical to have a thorough understanding of the particulars for each agent. Commonly used anesthetic agents, administered either individually or in combination, include diazepam, midazolam, propofol, ketamine, opioid agonists such as fentanyl or remifentanil, dexmedetomidine, and inhalational agents, including nitrous oxide and sevoflurane. These agents help provide extreme flexibility for those creating an individualized anesthetic plan that also balances the patient's history and the anticipated surgical plan to maximize success.

### No laughing matter: subacute degeneration of the spinal cord due to nitrous oxide inhalation [^1145HYiw]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Recreational use of N 2 O is largely through use of whipped cream chargers or 'whippets' bought from 'head shops' or online (see Fig. 2 a). Whippets fit onto a dispenser, which is attached to a balloon that enables gas inhalation. Inhalation results in almost immediate psychotropic effects including euphoria, giggling, distortion of sound and mild hallucinations, peaking after about 20 s before rapidly diminishing. Users often feel entirely normal within 2 min following inhalation. Side effects of dissociation, blurred vision, acute ataxia, nausea and headache have been reported.

Fig. 2
a Discarded nitrous oxide canisters and balloons in East London. b Metabolic pathway of vitamin B 12 involved in pathogenesis of N 2 O-induced subacute degeneration of the spinal cord. Vitamin B12 is a cofactor in the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA and homocystine to methionine. Non-functioning B 12 leads to accumulation of methylmalonic acid and homocystine, which can be tested in the patient sera when B 12 levels appear normal, suggesting a 'functional; B 12 disorder. Figure created using Microsoft Word

Recreational use of N 2 O in the UK has recently increased. According to the Global Drug Survey, which collected data from over 100,000 drug users in 20 countries, N 2 O is the seventh most popular recreational drug worldwide, and the fourth most commonly used by UK nightclub attendees, with 48% admitting to using the drug. Since the Psychoactive Substances Act came into effect in the UK in May 2016, it has become illegal to supply N 2 O for recreational consumption. Two recent high-profile cases of failed prosecutions for N 2 O supply have forced the Crown Prosecution Service to consider the implications for future cases. Nonetheless, whippets are still being sold at a price of approximately £30 ($40) for 96 canisters.

Previous reports have been published of patients presenting to hospital with acute pain and administration of medicinal N 2 O excessively, with subsequent development of subacute degeneration of the spinal cord. However, routine use in anaesthesia or dental procedures only carries a risk of subacute degeneration of the spinal cord in patients with low or low/normal serum vitamin B 12.

### Guidelines for monitoring and management of pediatric patients before, during, and after sedation for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures: update 2016 [^116UNj8j]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The safe sedation of children for procedures requires a systematic approach that includes the following: no administration of sedating medication without the safety net of medical/dental supervision, careful presedation evaluation for underlying medical or surgical conditions that would place the child at increased risk from sedating medications, appropriate fasting for elective procedures and a balance between the depth of sedation and risk for those who are unable to fast because of the urgent nature of the procedure, a focused airway examination for large (kissing) tonsils or anatomic airway abnormalities that might increase the potential for airway obstruction, a clear understanding of the medication's pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects and drug interactions, appropriate training and skills in airway management to allow rescue of the patient, age- and size-appropriate equipment for airway management and venous access, appropriate medications and reversal agents, sufficient numbers of staff to both carry out the procedure and monitor the patient, appropriate physiologic monitoring during and after the procedure, a properly equipped and staffed recovery area, recovery to the presedation level of consciousness before discharge from medical/dental supervision, and appropriate discharge instructions. This report was developed through a collaborative effort of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry to offer pediatric providers updated information and guidance in delivering safe sedation to children.

### What works and what's safe in pediatric emergency procedural sedation: an overview of reviews [^117TDt5y]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Interpretation

The choice of sedative agent depends on the efficacy and safety profile of the agent, as well as its relative safety and efficacy compared to other medications. Other practical considerations include the indication for sedation and depth of sedation required (i.e. this may vary for nonpainful, minor, and major painful procedures) and patient characteristics (e.g. preprocedural fasting; ASA physical status; and other anatomic, physiological, and developmental factors). Safe administration of any agent requires a thorough understanding of its effects, interactions, and sedation time intervals. 6 Such knowledge promotes appropriate drug administration, particularly when multiple agents are used, in titrated doses, and avoids the potential for oversedation. 24 This review focused on sedative agents commonly used in North America for children undergoing procedures in the ED.

For minor painful procedures in some cooperative children nitrous oxide was found to be safe and effective to achieve sedation and analgesia; 13, 16, 19, 20 however, another method of pain management should be prepared in case of treatment failure. 16 Nitrous oxide has significantly shorter treatment times than other modalities with rapid onset 12 and is quickly reversible. 13, 16, 20 Reported minor effects (nausea/vomiting, dizziness, voice change, dysphoria) were uncommon and major adverse effects (hypotension, oxygen desaturation) could not be attributed to nitrous oxide inhalation. 13, 16, 19 Risk factors for adverse effects included patients < 1 year old, simultaneous use of other sedatives, 19 and depth of sedation. Both a challenge and an advantage to sedation with nitrous oxide is that it may be safely given by the children themselves via a self‐administered demand valve. 4

### Streamed video clips to reduce anxiety in children during inhaled induction of anesthesia [^116AMaJu]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Anesthesia induction in children is frequently achieved by inhalation of nitrous oxide and sevoflurane. Pediatric anesthesiologists commonly use distraction techniques such as humor or nonprocedural talk to reduce anxiety and facilitate a smooth transition at this critical phase. There is a large body of successful distraction research that explores the use of video and television distraction methods for minor medical and dental procedures, but little research on the use of this method for ambulatory surgery. In this randomized control trial study we examined whether video distraction is effective in reducing the anxiety of children undergoing inhaled induction before ambulatory surgery.

Methods

Children (control = 47, video = 42) between 2 and 10 years old undergoing ambulatory surgery were randomly assigned to a video distraction or control group. In the video distraction group a video clip of the child's preference was played during induction, and the control group received traditional distraction methods during induction. The modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale was used to assess the children's anxiety before and during the process of receiving inhalation anesthetics.

Results

All subjects were similar in their age and anxiety scores before entering the operating rooms. Children in the video distraction group were significantly less anxious at induction and showed a significantly smaller change in anxiety from holding to induction than did children in the control group.

Conclusions

Playing video clips during the inhaled induction of children undergoing ambulatory surgery is an effective method of reducing anxiety. Therefore, pediatric anesthesiologists may consider using video distraction as a useful, valid, alternative strategy for achieving a smooth transition to the anesthetized state.

### Transient fixation on a non-native language associated with anaesthesia [^115gQkXT]. Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

We report a patient with the unusual language disturbance of transient fixation on a non-native language after otherwise uneventful general anaesthesia. The patient was unable to speak his native language for a period of 5–10 min, despite a desire to do so. He fully and spontaneously recovered from the episode. The phenomenon raises a number of interesting questions about the nature of human language, anaesthesia and consciousness. We discuss our patient in the context of some of these questions and present a review of three similar patients reported in the anaesthetic literature.

### The effect of preoperative suggestions on perioperative dreams and dream recalls after administration of different general anesthetic combinations: a randomized trial in maxillofacial surgery [^116e2nRm]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that during NREM sleep memory consolidation takes place simultaneously with the appearance of fast sleep spindles. It is highly remarkable that during the induction of propofol anesthesia several authors have demonstrated sleep spindle activity. Murphy et al. found that, in propofol induction, gamma- power almost doubled at loss of consciousness, indicating lively cognitive activity. Moreover, Breshears detected the presence of coupled theta-gamma oscillations during propofol induction and recovery alike. All this may explain why propofol induction allows good memory consolidation from before induction. During anesthesia if hypnotic depth decreases temporarily, the events potentially perceived by the patients may be incorporated into their dream in a new context. However, if intraoperative hypnosis is managed properly, perioperative dreams may be the result of episodic memory consolidation of events immediately preceding anesthesia.

Based on our results two sets of clinically important considerations can be drawn. First: environmental stimuli in the operating theatre may be incorporated into perioperative dreams during general anesthesia. One has to remember that due to their altered state of consciousness, patients are capable of producing very vivid imagery while suggestibility increases. Therefore, care should be taken especially during the induction phase to reduce annoying and unpleasant acoustic or visual stimuli. It is the whole OR team's responsibility to provide a quiet environment around the patient in order to avoid unpleasant dream formations. The second important consideration is rather methodological. For a long time, perioperative dreams were considered as events that are indicators of inappropriate depth of anesthesia that should be reduced to a minimum during daily clinical practice. The present study has allowed us to form a significantly different point of view. As we have proved, similarly to others, perioperative dreams cannot be avoided during clinical practice, they can even be increased by administering preoperative suggestions. We are of the opinion that dreams occurring during anesthesia should, in fact, be turned in a favourable direction by choosing proper induction agents and through the administration of pleasant suggestions during induction of anesthesia. Our voice, our gestures and behaviour are all suggestions that unwittingly evoke images, emotions, which may influence the patient's dreams during anesthesia and their experiences at recovery. In a recent systematic review Wobst stated that even patients wo do not reach the stage of hypnotic trance may benefit from hypnotic suggestions. Thus, anesthetists should in some way act as a psychotherapists during the induction phase of general anesthesia.

### Nitrous oxide-induced reproductive risks: should recreational nitrous oxide users worry? [^113T3Ets]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is a frequently used anaesthetic. Since the year 2000, recreational use of N 2 O, also known as 'laughing gas', became popular as a recreational drug due to its mild psychedelic effect. In the 1980s, several reports warned against N 2 O-induced reproductive risks among healthcare personnel, questioning the occupational safety of N 2 O in health care.

Methods:

Data about the reproductive risks of N 2 O were collected from literature.

Results:

Particularly in the past, professionals working in dental and midwifery practices, operating theatres and ambulance transport were exposed to high levels of N 2 O. Adverse reproduction effects included congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortion and reduced fertility rates in females. Following occupational measures, like maximal exposure limits for ambient N 2 O, this occupational risk was considerably reduced. Recreational users of N 2 O, however, voluntarily and repeatedly expose themselves to (very) high doses of N 2 O. As such, they exceed the health exposure limits some hundred times, but they are fully unaware of the related reproductive risks.

Conclusion:

We advocate to increase the awareness in recreational N2O-users about its potential reproductive risks, especially in heavy users, pregnant users or those who intend to become pregnant.

### Emergence delirium in children: many questions, few answers [^113KbwG3]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

The introduction of a new generation of inhaled anesthetics into pediatric clinical practice has been associated with a greater incidence of ED, a short-lived, but troublesome clinical phenomenon of uncertain etiology. A variety of anesthesia-, surgery-, patient-, and adjunct medication-related factors have been suggested to play a potential role in the development of such an event. Restless behavior upon emergence causes not only discomfort to the child, but also makes the caregivers and parents feel unhappy with the quality of recovery from anesthesia. Although the severity of agitation varies, it often requires additional nursing care, as well as treatment with analgesics or sedatives, which may delay discharge from hospital. To reduce the incidence of this adverse event, it is advisable to identify children at risk and take preventive measures, such as reducing preoperative anxiety, removing postoperative pain, and providing a quiet, stress-free environment for postanesthesia recovery. More clinical trials are needed to elucidate the cause as well as provide effective treatment.

Conclusions

The use of local dental anesthesia with lidocaine, regardless of the use of a vasoconstrictor, did not result in life‐threatening arrhythmias and could be considered safe in selected stable patients with CChs (LQTS and BrS).

### Use of therapeutic caffeine in acute care postoperative and critical care settings: a scoping review [^115WtDv6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Caffeine use in the perioperative period

There were 22 studies investigating caffeine use in the perioperative period. There were 10 studies investigating the effect of caffeine perioperatively and the development of postoperative headache. Seven investigated caffeine withdrawal and three studies administered oral caffeine to prevent postoperative headache. Of the seven prospective studies investigating the effect of caffeine withdrawal, five studies found caffeine withdrawal increased the incidence of postoperative headache. Three studies investigated the administration of caffeine to relieve postoperative headache. There was one case report of the successful administration of caffeine and ergometrine to relieve a postoperative headache. There were two prospective randomised controlled trials which found prophylactic caffeine administration decreased the incidence of postoperative headache.

Eight studies investigated induction and emergence from anaesthesia. Individuals who had a high caffeine intake required less propofol for induction, but greater opioids for induction for cardiac surgery and lower cognitive scores postoperatively. Furthermore, five studies found the administration of intravenous (IV) caffeine enhanced emergence from anaesthesia. Two case reports used IV caffeine to enhance emergence from sedation. The first study in a 52-year old male who received 500 mg IV caffeine to facilitate intraoperative language mapping who was slow to emerge after anaesthesia was ceased. The second case study was a 16-year old male who underwent a dental procedure using sevoflurane anaesthesia who experienced ongoing hypopnea and desaturation up to 90 min after the procedure. Caffeine was used (60 mg or 0.8 mg/kg) and resulted in increased alertness, no further desaturation, increased respiratory rate and tidal volumes. Gouda et al. randomised 60 patients undergoing uvulopalatopharyngoplasty for treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea to either receive 500 mg IV caffeine or saline. Individuals who received caffeine had significantly faster time to extubation and fewer post-extubation respiratory complications (supraglottic obstruction, laryngospasm, reintubation, breath holding, desaturation). Similar results were demonstrated by Fong et al. who randomised eight patients to receive IV caffeine at 7.5 mg/kg or saline and demonstrated caffeine resulted in significantly faster emergence from isoflurane anaesthesia. This study reported no adverse outcomes from administration of caffeine. Warner et al. performed a retrospective audit of caffeine administration (median dose of 150 mg) in the post-anaesthetic recovery area to increase alertness in 151 heavily sedated patients. There was a significant improvement in sedation scores with no change in respiratory or cardiac outcomes and no reported adverse events.

### Does sevoflurane add to outpatient procedural sedation in children? A randomised clinical trial [^113ydBFy]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Participants screening, consent and preparation

Participants were children referred for dental treatment requiring sedation in the Dental Sedation Centre (Núcleo de Estudos em Sedação Odontológica - "NESO") of the UFG Dental School. This centre is a community extension project where a multi-professional team (anaesthesiologist, paediatrician, paediatric dentist and psychologist) assist underserved children that need dental sedation to have their oral rehabilitation. The researchers follow the dental sedation protocol recommended by international guidelines, aiming to provide minimal to moderate sedation level. The use of ketamine, however, can produce a dissociative sedation, which is defined as "a trancelike cataleptic state induced by the dissociative agent ketamine, characterized by profound analgesia and amnesia, with retention of protective airway reflexes, spontaneous respirations, and cardiopulmonary stability".

To be included in this trial, children had to meet the following inclusion criteria: 4 to 6 years old, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status I or II, presenting patent airway and effective nasal breathing, need of a restorative procedure in a lower primary molar, and negative behaviour in a previous attempt of dental treatment. Exclusion criteria included the following: previous experience of dental treatment under sedation, or having completed 7 years at the day of the dental sedation appointment.

After a child was considered eligible to participate in this trial and the parent signed the consent form, one of the researchers that did not take part in the interventions enrolled the child and scheduled the intervention appointment at the most convenient day for the parent. The child was then randomly assigned to either the MK or MKS group. Simple randomisation with a 1:1 allocation ratio was used. One researcher that did not participate in the interventions and outcomes assessments created a computer-generated list through the website Randomization.com. Each child was assigned to a group at the day of the intervention according to the consecutively numbered code generated in the list. As only the physicians knew the codes, they assigned participants to interventions.

### Deep sedation with sevoflurane inhalation via a nasal hood for brief dental procedures in pediatric patients [^114hasLG]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Nitrous oxide is widely used for dental sedation. However, weak potency of nitrous oxide requires additional sedatives for maintaining a deeper level of sedation. Sevoflurane, a mainstay in pediatric anesthesia, is a potent anesthetic agent. Some attempts have been made to use sevoflurane for conscious sedation. In this case, we successfully treat pediatric patients under deep sedation by sevoflurane inhalation without other sedatives. Sevoflurane may be useful for sedation in pediatric dental outpatient setting.

### Dreaming under anesthesia: is it a real possiblity? Investigation of the effect of preoperative imagination on the quality of postoperative dream recalls [^1135gXzT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The problem of consciousness does not appear as a central neuroscientific issue only; it has a fundamental importance for every clinician dealing with patients with an altered state of consciousness. When performing general anesthesia, a modified state or loss of consciousness is brought about under reliable, controllable and reversible conditions. The study of how anesthesia affects the brain may be important constituents of scientific research regarding consciousness. Sleep is a natural form of the unconscious state. People who have been awakened from different stages of sleep can recall dreams. Dreaming under anesthesia: is it a real possibility? For years anesthetists believed that there was no dreaming during anesthesia, yet, a portion of patients reported dreams after recovery from anesthesia. Initially it was hypothesized that the patients who spoke of their dreams had been awake during a period of anesthesia. In this case dreams might show a relationship to external events; they are „dream-like" processes, unpleasant and undesirable side-effects that can sometimes lead to posttraumatic stress syndrome. However, Aceto's and Leslie's as well as our patients recalled dreams characterized by contents that were not operative events but similar to that of their habitual dreams with predominant positive emotions. It has been proved that dream reports can be obtained even after properly-carried out anesthesia with an adequate depth. The perioperative period is characterized by a spontaneously altered state of consciousness of our patients due to their illness, the operation, and defenselessness. This is exactly why suggestive communication is an effective tool in our arsenal of perioperative adjunctive therapies even without formal hypnosis induction. Suggestions used immediately before the induction of general anesthesia help us in guiding our patients' imagination. Patients imagine their favorite place as a dream plan of their own choice which is emotionally important and pleasant to them. Guided imagination impacted the patients dream recalls experienced under recovery of general anesthesia. In addition to the subjective experience the characteristics of the recovery state supported the likelihood of dreaming. The recovery of the patients who reported dreaming was often accompanied by emotional manifestations corresponding to the dream content (smiles, anger, crying), elements of behavior in line with the dream (embracing arms, a foot pressing down on the accelerator). In the first statistical analysis of our study we examined the effect of the psychological method and the hypnotic agents on the incidence of dreams. It has been demonstrated that dream recalls are more frequent in patients with preoperative suggestions applied before and during induction. Furthermore, formation of dreams and dream recalls were dependent on the anesthetic technique, especially propofol as an induction agent.

### Postoperative discomfort and emergence delirium in children undergoing dental rehabilitation under general anesthesia: comparison of nasal tracheal intubation and laryngeal mask airway [^115ZXjY2]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Muscle relaxant during the induction of anesthesia has been shown to facilitate tracheal intubation, decrease complications associated with endotracheal tube placement, and provide suitable conditions for the operation. At the same time, the use of muscle relaxation for minor surgery may affect the patient's recovery and prolong the patient's respiratory recovery time. Laryngoscopy and muscle relaxation are not necessary for the insertion of an LMAw. The LMAw can even be inserted in awake patients with or without muscle relaxant. In the current study, recovery time in the LMAw group was significantly shorter than the NTI group, which was similar to the results of Zhao et al. These difference may be due to muscle relaxant not being used in the LMAw group.

ED includes inconsolable crying, thrashing, kicking, disorientation, hallucinations, and cognitive and memory impairment during the recovery period following general anesthesia. The intrinsic characteristics of anesthetic agents, rapid emergence from anesthesia, postoperative pain, pre-school age, preoperative anxiety, and child temperament are known risk factors for ED. Preventing ED is important for providing patients with a comfortable postoperative period. In the current study, the incidence of ED was significantly lower in the LMAw group compared with the NTI group. Since there was no significant difference in postoperative dental pain scores between the groups, we believe that this difference in ED may be due to higher laryngeal pain scores observed in the NTI group. Similar to the results of our study, Lee et alfound that using an LMAw during pediatric surgery reduced the incidence of postoperative emergence agitation compared with tracheal intubation after sevoflurane anesthesia for sub-umbilical surgery. In the current study, parental satisfaction scores were also higher in the LMAw group than in the NTI group. This can be attributed to the lower incidence of postoperative discomfort and ED in the LMAw group.

The main limitation of the current study is the wide age range of the patients, ranging from 3 to 7 years, which could explain the large difference in self-reported pain scores. The second limitation is that the follow-up period was relatively short, as we only evaluated the patients' discomfort during the hospital stay.

### Practice guidelines for moderate procedural sedation and analgesia 2018: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on moderate procedural sedation and analgesia, the American association of oral and maxillofacial surgeons, American college of radiology, American dental association, American Society of Dentist Anesthesiologists, and Society of Interventional Radiology [^113G5UBC]. Anesthesiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Moderate procedural sedation — sedative/analgesic medications intended for general anesthesia: When such medications are intended by any route, provide care consistent with that required for general anesthesia, assure that practitioners administering them are able to reliably identify and rescue patients from unintended deep sedation or general anesthesia, maintain vascular access throughout the procedure and until the patient is no longer at risk for cardiorespiratory depression for patients receiving intravenous agents, determine on a case-by-case basis the advisability of reestablishing intravenous access if nonintravenous routes were used or an intravenous line became dislodged or blocked, and administer intravenous sedative/analgesic medications in small, incremental doses or by infusion, titrating to the desired endpoints; allow sufficient time between doses to assess peak effect before giving subsequent doses.

### Nitrous oxide-induced reproductive risks: should recreational nitrous oxide users worry? [^113JF1UZ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nitrous oxide (N 2 O; 'laughing gas') is a widely used anaesthetic. For over 150 years, N 2 O is used as an anaesthetic and anxiolytic in operating theatres, ambulance transport, dentistry and during labour and delivery. N 2 O has been advocated as a safe standard technique for dentistry and is particularly suitable to treat paediatric patients who are terrified of the dentist. In the United States, 87–89% of all paediatric dentists have used N 2 O.

In addition to clinical use, recreational N 2 O use has been known since the late 19th century but recently a serious increase in recreational use emerged in many countries. In the United Kingdom, N 2 O was second only to cannabis in drug use among those aged 16–24 in 2019 (April 2019–March 2020). Recreational N 2 O use became particularly popular in youngsters and adolescents because it is widely available, cheap, legal and most users are convinced that N 2 O is a safe drug. For instance, the majority (77%) of N 2 O users in the Netherlands was unaware of the drug's harmful effects. The use of hundreds of bulbs daily for prolonged periods of time and continuous filling and inhaling N 2 O balloons using large 2 kg N 2 O-tanks is emerging, though fortunately, this is still an exceptional practice among recreational N 2 O users. These new practices are of concern, because repeated exposure to high doses of N 2 O for a prolonged time is known to induce vitamin B 12 deficiency and related neurological damage, such as (irreversible) neuropathy and paralysis (for references, see).

### Dexmedetomidine decreases the emergence agitation in infant patients undergoing cleft palate repair surgery after general anesthesia [^115eJ3e4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Cleft lip and palate as the most common craniofacial abnormalities in paediatric pathology had an incidence in 1.8% in China. Cleft palate repair is one of the most common oral and maxillofacial sugery in children and it may be associated with significant postoperative pain. A minority of infants aged < 3 years could tolerate the surgery without general anesthesia. However, anesthetic management during the cleft palate surgical repair always has a high rate (13%) of postoperative complications including postoperative swelling of the tongue, bleeding which maybe because the surgical procedure and the complications also included pain, nausea and vomiting, wound dehiscence, bronchospasm, emergence agitation or delirium, which may be ascribed to the choice of anesthesia. Emergence agitation (EA) combined with vigorous crying may lead to wound dehiscence and pulmonary complications that might result in delayed recovery and a prolonged hospital stay. Much effort has been made to avoid these complications, and to improve the quality of anesthesia, however, there is no consensus on the safest anesthetic agents for pediatric patients undergoing surgical repair of cleft palate.

The typical anesthesia method of infant is inhalational anesthetic. Sevoflurane, as a popular inhalational anesthetic for children, has been routinely used because it is less pungent and has a more rapid onset and offset because of lower solubility in blood, fast recovery properity, relative lack of airway irritation and greater hemodynamic stability compared with other inhaled agents. However, studies had showed that sevoflurane had a relatively high incidence of EA in infants even in the absence of any surgical intervention. EA in pediatric patients is a clinical entity generally defined by behaviors including combativeness, excitation, disorientation and inconsolability. The incidence of EA is widely ranging in the literature from 10–80% and it is usually a self-limited phenomenon, but can be severe and present dangers to both patients and caregivers. EA has a phenomenon of nonpurposeful restlessness and agitation, thrashing, crying or moaning, disorientation, and incoherence, which frequently happened when children recovering from anesthesia and can create a challenging situation to their health care providers.

Intraoperatively, the only one case of adverse event observed and classified as minor risk was "failed sedation", i.e. the "inability to attain suitable conditions to humanely perform the procedure": one girl from the MK group had the dental treatment aborted after the administration of local anaesthesia because of her severe uncooperativeness; she did receive a tooth restoration with glass ionomer cement instead of composite. Prolonged recovery (Table 1) as well as serious adverse events, such as severe drop oxygen saturation (< 75% or < 90% for more than 60 s), prolonged apnea (> 60 s), cardiovascular shock or cardiac arrest/pulse absence were not observed. There was no deep sedation at any time of evaluation.

### The effect of preoperative suggestions on perioperative dreams and dream recalls after administration of different general anesthetic combinations: a randomized trial in maxillofacial surgery [^114B8kU3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Grouping of the patients

Patients were randomly allocated into three groups according to the following aspects:

In the control group spontaneous dreams of patients were assessed under anesthesia without suggestions.
In the suggestion group patients received suggestions evoking their images exclusively in the operating theatre at the time of induction. For this, patients were instructed to find out and fix a favourite place "where they want to travel" during anesthesia.
In the "dreamfilm group" the patients worked out a dreamfilm-plan using the favourite place technique one day prior to surgery. At induction, the series of images prepared by suggestions was evoked.

In all three of the previously listed groups 3 further subgroups were formed based on the anesthesiological technique used:

Subgroup 1: anaesthetic induction with etomidate (0,15–0,3 mg/kg), maintenance with sevoflurane (1 MAC, low-flow tchnique),
Subgroup 2: anesthetic induction with propofol (1,5–2,5 mg/kg), maintenance with sevoflurane (1 MAC, low-flow tchnique),
Subgroup 3 (TIVA group): anesthetic induction with propofol (1,5–2,5 mg/kg), maintenance with propofol (8–10 mg/kg/hour).

Because of methodological reasons, the investigations were perfomed in two phases. As we intended to exclude the possibility that patients of dreamfilm groups might communicate during the preoperative day and therewith might influence the results of the psychological method, in the first phase only control, (no suggestions were administered) and suggestion group patients (suggestions administered in the OR) were included. Randomisation in this first phase meant main grouping and selecting the anesthesiological subgroup. In this phase of the study 60 patients were allocated per every anesthetic method. Envelope randomisation was carried out in the operating theatre, immediately before induction, the patients were allocated to the suggestion and the control groups, respectively (a total of 180 patients). Investigations in phase two were separated from phase one in time. The people taking part in the study were not selected, all patients presenting at the department in the given time period were included in the dreamfilm group provided that they met the selection criteria and who did not refuse participation. Again, envelope randomisation occurred in the operating theatre to chose the general anesthetic technique. Using three anaesthetic protocols, this amounted to 3×30 subjects. Arrangement of the experiments is summarized in Figure 1.

Recovery care and discharge monitoring — after sedation/analgesia, observe and monitor patients in an appropriately staffed and equipped area until they are near their baseline level of consciousness and are no longer at increased risk for cardiorespiratory depression, and monitor oxygenation continuously until patients are no longer at risk for hypoxemia. Monitor ventilation and circulation at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 to 15 min) until patients are suitable for discharge, and design discharge criteria to minimize the risk of central nervous system or cardiorespiratory depression after discharge from observation by trained personnel.

### Clinical policy: procedural sedation and analgesia in the emergency department [^113BcxCK]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) — efficacy, pharmacologic effects, and pediatric procedural sedation evidence: Nitrous oxide is a relatively weak dissociative anesthetic gas that provides mild to moderate procedural anxiolysis, analgesia, and amnesia in a linear dose-response pattern, and onset and offset effects occur within 5 minutes and N2O does not require vascular access or painful administration. In healthy patients, N2O has minimal cardiovascular or respiratory effects; however, it may enhance the depressed response to hypoxia and hypercarbia induced by other agents, and use of local anesthesia and imagery to prepare patients, eg, imagining flying, significantly enhances the drug's efficacy. For clinical use, 30% to 70% N2O has been widely used to reduce distress in children during dental procedures, and a 50% concentration has also been used for management of acute pain in adults in out-of-hospital and ED settings; the demand valve-equipped fixed 50% N2O delivery apparatus commonly available in EDs is difficult for children to activate, but patients of all ages easily use the continuous-circuit devices, some of which deliver up to 70% N2O. In the evidence base, Sixty-one articles concerning use of nitrous oxide for procedural sedation in children were identified and, after grading, 44 articles were included with local anesthesia routinely used as an adjunct; in suturing studies, vomiting occurred more frequently with N2O (10% with N2O, 2% with N2O+midazolam), and one study using 30% N2O found less distress in children older than 8 years but only a trend in that direction in younger children.

### The economic burden of anesthetic-related adverse events: a systematic review and empirical analysis [^117A1PAn]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In modern medical practice, anesthetic agents for procedural sedation and general anesthesia are extensively used across a spectrum of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, ensuring patient comfort and procedural efficacy. However, they do not come without risk, and, during a procedure, an anesthesiologist might encounter several complications, including apnea and hypoxemia, airway obstruction, arterial hypotension, bradycardia, and aspiration. The frequency and severity of these adverse events (AEs) not only affect patient outcomes but also lead to increased healthcare services utilization and costs. They can result in extended hospital stays, additional medical interventions, and, in severe cases, legal implications due to patient harm. Much is known about anesthetic-related AEs from the clinical standpoint. However, a critical gap in the literature remains on the economic impacts of anesthetic-related complications.

This study aims to fill this gap by reviewing the existing literature to outline the current understanding on the clinical and economic burden associated with AEs of the anesthetic agents used in procedural sedation and general anesthesia. By identifying under-researched issues and synthesizing available data, this study seeks to enhance the knowledge base, guiding future research and policy decisions to optimize patient care and resource allocation through selection of the most appropriate anesthetic agents, also considering AEs and their costs.

### Office-based anesthesia [^116yZY7y]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The practice of office-based oral and maxillofacial surgery is continuously expanding and involves the management of a diverse population in regards to the surgical procedures performed within the office and the age and medical health of the patients treated within the office. Comfort, cooperation, and hemodynamic stability are critical to satisfactorily accomplishing the surgical procedure. Various anesthetic techniques are used, including local anesthesia, anxiolysis, analgesia and sedation, and general anesthesia. The topic is vast and too extensive to be fully discussed in this article. The intent of this article is to provide a discussion of some fundamental concepts that can optimize anesthetic safety and care.

### Lidocaine hydrochloride (Sx1 medicated post-operative system) [^11153yFH]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

General: The safety and effectiveness of lidocaine depend on proper dosage, correct technique, adequate precautions, and readiness for emergencies. (See WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) The lowest dosage that results in effective anesthesia should be used to avoid high plasma levels and serious adverse effects. Repeated doses of lidocaine may cause significant increases in blood levels with each repeated dose because of slow accumulation of the drug or its metabolites. Tolerance to elevated blood levels varies with the status of the patient. Debilitated, elderly patients, acutely ill patients, and children should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical status. Lidocaine should also be used with caution in patients with severe shock or heart block.

Lidocaine HCI 2% Jelly should be used with caution in patients with known drug sensitivities. Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross sensitivity to lidocaine.

Many drugs used during the conduct of anesthesia are considered potential triggering agents for familial malignant hyperthermia. Since it is not known whether amide-type local anesthetics may trigger this reaction and since the need for supplemental general anesthesia cannot be predicted in advance, it is suggested that a standard protocol for management should be available. Early unexplained signs of tachycardia, tachypnea, labile blood pressure, and metabolic acidosis may precede temperature elevation. Successful outcome is dependent on early diagnosis, prompt discontinuance of the suspect triggering agent(s) and institution of treatment, including oxygen therapy, indicated supportive measures and dantrolene (consult dantrolene sodium intravenous package insert before using).

Information for Patients: When topical anesthetics are used in the mouth, the patient should be aware that the production of topical anesthesia may impair swallowing and thus enhance the danger of aspiration. For this reason, food should not be ingested for 60 minutes following use of local anesthetic preparations in the mouth or throat area. This is particularly important in children because of their frequency of eating.

Numbness of the tongue or buccal mucosa may enhance the danger of unintentional biting trauma. Food or chewing gum should not be taken while the mouth or throat area is anesthetized.

### A randomised controlled trial of paediatric conscious sedation for dental treatment using intravenous midazolam combined with inhaled nitrous oxide or nitrous oxide / sevoflurane [^112jWcmh]. Anaesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

Failure of dental treatment due to anxiety is a common problem in children. The aim of this study was to establish whether the use of a combination of intravenous midazolam with inhalation agents (nitrous oxide alone or in combination with sevoflurane) was any more likely to result in successful completion of treatment than midazolam alone. A further aim was to evaluate the clinical viability of these techniques as an alternative to general anaesthesia. In total, 697 children too anxious for management with relative analgesia and requiring invasive dental procedure for which a general anaesthetic would usually be required, were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three groups given the following interventions: group 1 - a combination of inhaled medical air and titrated intravenous midazolam, group 2 - a combination of inhaled 40% nitrous oxide in oxygen and titrated intravenous midazolam, and group 3 - a combination of an inhaled mixture of sevoflurane 0.3% and nitrous oxide 40% in oxygen with titrated intravenous midazolam. The primary outcome measure was successful completion of the intended dental treatment with a co-operative child responsive to verbal commands. In group 1, 54% (94/174 children) successfully completed treatment. In group 2, 80% (204/256 children) and in group 3, 93% (249/267 children) completed treatment. This difference was significant at the 1% level. Intravenous midazolam, especially in combination with inhaled nitrous oxide or sevoflurane and nitrous oxide, are effective techniques, with the combination of midazolam and sevoflurane the one most likely to result in successful treatment.

### Clinical signs and electroencephalographic patterns of emergence from sevoflurane anaesthesia in children: an observational study [^115VVh8c]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Study limitations

Anaesthetic management was given according to the discretion of the anaesthesiologist according to clinical need and consequently included combinations of anaesthetic agents and techniques. There was variability in the time course of the reduction in inspired sevoflurane concentration, in the flow rates and in the use of N 2 O during emergence. Our analysis stratified patients based on whether they received N 2 O exposure during emergence. Measuring anaesthesia recovery or recovery of consciousness in nonverbal populations is indirect in nature, and unlike adults, cannot be assessed using a response to a verbal command. Observation of clinical–behavioural signs is a useful alternative although scoring of video data is subjective. To overcome this pitfall, three cameras were time-locked and positioned in locations in the operating room to detect subtle body movement and facial expression from several camera angles. Eye signs assessments were intermittently evaluated when clinically permitted.

### Interventions for increasing acceptance of local anaesthetic in children and adolescents having dental treatment [^114gDDwp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Delivery of pain-free dentistry is crucial for reducing fear and anxiety, completion of treatment, and increasing acceptance of future dental treatment in children. Local anaesthetic (LA) facilitates this pain-free approach but it remains challenging. A number of interventions to help children cope with delivery of LA have been described, with no consensus on the best method to increase its acceptance.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of methods for acceptance of LA in children and adolescents during dental treatment.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 24 May 2019); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019 Issue 4) in the Cochrane Library (searched 24 May 2019); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 24 of May 2019); Embase Ovid (1980 to 24 May 2019); and Web of Science (1900 to 24 May 2019). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were also searched to 24 May 2019. There were no restrictions on language or date of publications.

Selection Criteria

Parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions used to increase acceptance of dental LA in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We performed data extraction and assessment of risk of bias independently and in duplicate. We contacted authors for missing information. We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 26 trials with 2435 randomised participants aged between 2 and 16 years. Studies were carried out between 2002 and 2019 in dental clinics in the UK, USA, the Netherlands, Iran, India, France, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Mexico, and Korea. Studies included equipment interventions (using several LA delivery devices for injection or audiovisual aids used immediately prior to or during LA delivery or both) and dentist interventions (psychological behaviour interventions delivered in advance of LA (video modelling), or immediately prior to or during delivery of LA or both (hypnosis, counter-stimulation). We judged one study to be at low risk and the rest at high risk of bias. Clinical heterogeneity of the included studies rendered it impossible to pool data into meta-analyses. None of the studies reported on our primary outcome of acceptance of LA. No studies reported on the following secondary outcomes: completion of dental treatment, successful LA/painless treatment, patient satisfaction, parent satisfaction, and adverse events. Audiovisual distraction compared to conventional treatment: the evidence was uncertain for the outcome pain-related behaviour during delivery of LA with a reduction in negative behaviour when 3D video glasses where used in the audiovisual distraction group (risk ratio (RR) 0.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.50; 1 trial, 60 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The wand versus conventional treatment: the evidence was uncertain regarding the effect of the wand on pain-related behaviour during delivery of LA. Four studies reported a benefit in using the wand while the remaining studies results suggested no difference between the two methods of delivering LA (six trials, 704 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Counter-stimulation/distraction versus conventional treatment: the evidence was uncertain for the outcome pain experience during delivery of LA with children experiencing less pain when counter-stimulation was used (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.34; 1 trial, 134 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Hypnosis versus conventional treatment: the evidence was uncertain for the outcome pain experience during delivery of LA with participants in the hypnosis group experiencing less pain (mean difference (MD) -1.79, 95% CI -3.01 to -0.57; 1 trial, 29 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Other comparisons considered included pre-cooling of the injection site, the wand versus Sleeper One, the use of a camouflage syringe, use of an electrical counter-stimulation device, and video modelling acclimatisation, and had a single study each. The findings from these other comparisons were insufficient to draw any affirmative conclusions about their effectiveness, and were considered to be very low-certainty evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find sufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions as to the best interventions to increase acceptance of LA in children due to variation in methodology and nature/timing of outcome measures. We recommend further parallel RCTs, reported in line with the CONSORT Statement. Care should be taken when choosing outcome measures.

### Practice guidelines for moderate procedural sedation and analgesia 2018: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on moderate procedural sedation and analgesia, the American association of oral and maxillofacial surgeons, American college of radiology, American dental association, American Society of Dentist Anesthesiologists, and Society of Interventional Radiology [^114bpcRS]. Anesthesiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Continuum of depth of sedation and general anesthesia — definitions and rescue expectations are delineated as follows: Minimal Sedation (Anxiolysis) is a drug-induced state with normal response to verbal commands and with ventilatory and cardiovascular functions unaffected; Moderate Sedation/Analgesia (Conscious Sedation) is a drug-induced depression of consciousness in which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation, with no interventions required to maintain a patent airway, adequate spontaneous ventilation, and cardiovascular function usually maintained; Deep Sedation/Analgesia is a drug-induced depression of consciousness in which patients cannot be easily aroused but respond purposefully after repeated or painful stimulation, with possible impairment of the ability to maintain ventilatory function such that assistance to maintain a patent airway may be required and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate, while cardiovascular function is usually maintained; General Anesthesia is a drug-induced loss of consciousness in which patients are not arousable, even by painful stimulation, with ventilatory function often impaired such that assistance to maintain a patent airway and positive pressure ventilation may be required and cardiovascular function may be impaired. Because sedation is a continuum, practitioners intending to produce a given level of sedation should be able to rescue patients whose level becomes deeper than intended, and individuals administering Moderate Sedation/Analgesia should be able to rescue patients who enter Deep Sedation/Analgesia, whereas those administering Deep Sedation/Analgesia should be able to rescue patients who enter General Anesthesia; reflex withdrawal from a painful stimulus is NOT considered a purposeful response.

### Prilocaine hydrochloride (citanest plain) [^115h7y12]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

DENTAL PRACTITIONERS WHO EMPLOY LOCAL ANESTHETIC AGENTS SHOULD BE WELL VERSED IN DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF EMERGENCIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM THEIR USE. RESUSCITATIVE EQUIPMENT, OXYGEN AND OTHER RESUSCITATIVE DRUGS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR IMMEDIATE USE.

Methemoglobinemia

Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with local anesthetic use. Although all patients are at risk for methemoglobinemia, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, infants under 6 months of age, and concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites are more susceptible to developing clinical manifestations of the condition. If local anesthetics must be used in these patients, close monitoring for symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia is recommended.

Signs of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or may be delayed some hours after exposure, and are characterized by a cyanotic skin discoloration and/ or abnormal coloration of the blood. Methemoglobin levels may continue to rise; therefore, immediate treatment is required to avert more serious central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse effects, including seizures, coma, arrhythmias, and death. Discontinue CITANEST and any other oxidizing agents. Depending on the severity of the signs and symptoms, patients may respond to supportive care, i.e., oxygen therapy, hydration. A more severe clinical presentation may require treatment with methylene blue exchange transfusion, or hyperbaric oxygen.

To minimize the likelihood of intravascular injection, aspiration should be performed before the local anesthetic solution is injected. If blood is aspirated, the needle must be repositioned until no return of blood can be elicited by aspiration. Note, however, that the absence of blood in the syringe does not assure that intravascular injection will be avoided.

### Does sevoflurane add to outpatient procedural sedation in children? A randomised clinical trial [^112znrBE]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Paediatric sedation outside of the operating room is a growing theme in the anaesthesiology field. Few new sedatives have been launched in the last decade, which suggests the need for further development of new routes and methods for delivery of existing anaesthetic agents.

Sevoflurane, "a near-perfect anaesthetic", has been used for procedural sedation in an outpatient basis and in intensive care units. However, there is little evidence of its effectiveness and safety in the paediatric population for a variety of procedures, including color Doppler ultrasound examination, voiding cystourethrography, gastrointestinal endoscopy, placement of central catheter in neonatal intensive care, magnetic resonance imaging, and dental treatment.

In paediatric dentistry, inhalation sedation with sevoflurane and nitrous oxide has reached success rates varying from 80 to 92%, which are increased to up 99% when intravenous midazolam and fentanyl are added as an alternative to general anesthesia. A systematic review concluded that there is a need for clinical trials on sedation agents for dental treatment since only the agents that showed some (weak-very weak) evidence of effectiveness were oral midazolam and nitrous oxide inhalation.

Among the aforementioned studies, there were only 3 clinical trials conducted in the dental setting; however, these studies did not examine the effects of sevoflurane as the sole gas inhaled anaesthetic agent (without nitrous oxide). Additional information is needed to add to the development of the outpatient sedation technique with sevoflurane. Thus, we performed this clinical trial with the aim of assessing the effect of sevoflurane during dental treatment in children aged 4 to 6 years old. We hypothesised adding sevoflurane to a sedation regimen would improve children's behaviour with minimal adverse events.

### Clinical policy: procedural sedation and analgesia in the emergency department [^116FaYa8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) sedation during pediatric dental procedures (Dunn-Russell et al., 1993) involved a prospective crossover trial of 24 ASA I patients ages 3.4–9.4 y, mean 5.6 y, comparing the initial 5 min of recovery with 100% oxygen versus room air after 40% N2O sedation, with oxygen saturation measured at 15-second intervals for 5 min after stopping N2O; the mean time of 40% N2O exposure was 28–29 min and oxygen saturations fluctuated < 1% for both groups, which was statistically but not clinically significant, and comments noted a dental study with no pre- or concurrent additional medications and only 40% N2O studied.

### Midazolam is associated with delay in recovery and agitation after ambulatory general anesthesia for dental treatment in patients with disabilities: a retrospective cohort study [^112kqRn8]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Some patients with intellectual disabilities (IDs) who undergo total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) have complications associated with the anesthesia such as prolonged recovery. The purposes of this study were to estimate the frequency of TIVA complications among patients with IDs and to identify factors associated with TIVA complications.

Materials and Methods

This study was designed as a retrospective cohort study. Study samples were selected from the clinical records of patients with IDs who underwent ambulatory general anesthesia in a special dental clinic at the Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan. Predictor variables were patient background, anesthesia-related variables, and dental treatment. Outcome variables were delayed recovery and the complication of agitation. Factors affecting delayed recovery and complications were examined with multivariable analysis.

Results

We enrolled 106 cases (81 male and 25 female patients) in this study. The mean age was 23.9 years. Serious complications were not observed in any cases. The amount of intravenous midazolam was an independent determinant of delayed recovery. Oral midazolam contributed to delayed recovery, although it is very useful for induction in patients with a high level of fear. Oral midazolam and a younger age were independent predictors of agitation.

Conclusions

Intravenous midazolam may not have an advantage in ambulatory general anesthesia. Oral midazolam contributes to delayed recovery and is an independent predictor of agitation.

### Nitrous oxide-induced myeloneuropathy: a case series [^114wZuQa]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nitrous oxide (N 2 O), also known as laughing gas, is an anaesthetic commonly used in medical and dental settings. Since its discovery, N 2 O has also been inhaled recreationally for its euphoric and dissociative effects. In recent years, use among young people in the UK has risen and it is now the second most used drug, with over 8% of 16- to 24-year-olds reporting use in 2018–19, although this is likely an underestimate. Some countries, such as the Netherlands, have implemented legislation to ban N 2 O for recreational use.

N 2 O-myeloneuropathy due to recreational N 2 O use was first reported following illicit use by dentists in 1978. In recent years, an increased number of N 2 O-myeloneuropathy cases have been reported. N 2 O-myeloneuropathy results from functional vitamin B 12 deficiency, which leads to a failure in the production of myelin, notably damaging the dorsal columns of the spinal cord through subacute combined degeneration (SACD), identifiable on MRI. Neuropathy on nerve conduction studies (NCS) has also been described. Low pre-exposure B 12 levels increase susceptibility to SACD, with shorter exposures to N 2 O.

The mainstay of treatment currently available for N 2 O-myeloneuropathy is the cessation of use and parenteral B 12 supplementation. Prophylactic B 12 administration while continuing N 2 O use is unlikely to mitigate neurological damage. Recovery and prognosis have been variably reported. Although cases have been reported from iatrogenic use of N 2 O, recreational use is the cause of the current N 2 O-myeloneuropathy 'epidemic'. Thromboembolic complications have also been described from recreational use. It has not yet been determined if there is a minimum amount of N 2 O necessary to consume before reaching a threshold for SACD or neuropathy.

This work aims to characterise the demographic, clinical and investigative findings in a large series of patients with N 2 O-myeloneuropathy, to inform further research on the topic and raise awareness of the issue both in scientific and public domains.

Anesthesiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Moderate procedural sedation — survey-based monitoring recommendations — the consultants, ASA members, AAOMS members, and ASDA members agree with the recommendations to (1) periodically monitor a patient's response to verbal commands during moderate sedation, except in patients who are unable to respond appropriately or during procedures where movement could detrimental clinically; and (2) during procedures where a verbal response is not possible, check the patient's ability to give a "thumbs up" or other indication of consciousness in response to verbal or tactile (light tap) stimulation. The consultants, ASA members, AAOMS members, and ASDA members strongly agree with the recommendations to (1) continually monitor ventilatory function by observation of qualitative clinical signs; (2) continually monitor ventilatory function with capnography unless precluded or invalidated by the nature of the patient, procedure, or equipment; (3) monitor all patients by pulse oximetry with appropriate alarms; (4) determine blood pressure before sedation/analgesia is initiated unless precluded by lack of patient cooperation; (5) once moderate sedation/analgesia is established, continually monitor blood pressure and heart rate during the procedure unless such monitoring interferes with the procedure; (6) use electrocardiographic monitoring during moderate sedation in patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease or those who are undergoing procedures where dysrhythmias are anticipated; (7) record patients' level of consciousness, ventilatory and oxygenation status, and hemodynamic variables at a frequency that depends on the type and amount of medication administered, the length of the procedure, and the general condition of the patient; (8) set device alarms to alert the care team to critical changes in patient; (9) assure that a designated individual other than the practitioner performing the procedure is present to monitor the patient throughout the procedure; and (10) the individual responsible for monitoring the patient should be trained in the recognition of apnea and airway obstruction and be authorized to seek additional help. The consultants, ASA members, and AAOMS members agree that the designated individual may assist with minor, interruptible tasks once the patient's level of sedation/analgesia and vital signs have stabilized, provided that adequate monitoring for the patient's level of sedation is maintained; the AAOMS members strongly agree with this recommendation.

### Bispectral index monitoring during sedation with sevoflurane, midazolam, and propofol [^114xG1di]. Anesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Bispectral Index (BIS) has been used to measure sedation depth. Ideally, to guide anesthetic management, range of BIS scores at different sedation levels should not overlap, and BIS should be independent of drug used. This study assessed ability of BIS to predict sedation depth between sevoflurane, propofol, and midazolam. Quality of recovery was also compared.

Methods

Patients undergoing surgery with local or regional anesthesia and sedation were randomized to sevoflurane (n = 23), midazolam (n = 21), or propofol (n = 22). Sedation was titrated to Observers's Assessment of Alertness-Sedation score of 3 (responds slowly to voice). BIS and Observers's Assessment of Alertness-Sedation were measured every 5 min. BIS prediction probability (PK) was compared between drugs. Recovery was assessed by BIS and Digit Symbol Substitution and memory tests.

Results

Bispectral Index of responders to voice was significantly different from nonresponders (86 ± 10 vs. 74 ± 14, mean ± SD; P < 0.001) However, wide variability and overlap in BIS were observed (25th-75th percentile, responders vs. non-responders: 79–96 vs. 65–83). BIS of responders was different for sevoflurane versus propofol and midazolam. BIS was a better predictor of propofol sedation than sevoflurane or midazolam (PK = 0.87 ± 0.11, 0.76 ± 0.01, and 0.69 ± 0.02, respectively; P < 0.05). At 10 min after the procedure, 76, 48, and 24% of sevoflurane, propofol, midazolam patients, respectively, returned to baseline Digit Symbol Substitution scores (P < 0.05). Excitement-disinhibition occurred in 70, 36, and 5% of sevoflurane, propofol, and midazolam patients, respectively (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Individual BIS scores demonstrate significant variability, making it difficult to predict sedation depth. The relation between BIS and sedation depth may not be independent of anesthetic agent. Quality of recovery was similar between drugs, but excitement occurred frequently with sevoflurane.

### Practice guidelines for moderate procedural sedation and analgesia 2018: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on moderate procedural sedation and analgesia, the American association of oral and maxillofacial surgeons, American college of radiology, American dental association, American Society of Dentist Anesthesiologists, and Society of Interventional Radiology [^117GR1dt]. Anesthesiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Moderate procedural sedation — recovery care monitoring and discharge planning directs that after sedation/analgesia, clinicians "observe and monitor patients in an appropriately staffed and equipped area until they are near their baseline level of consciousness and are no longer at increased risk for cardiorespiratory depression", "monitor oxygenation continuously until patients are no longer at risk for hypoxemia", and "monitor ventilation and circulation at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 to 15 min) until patients are suitable for discharge". It further states to "design discharge criteria to minimize the risk of central nervous system or cardiorespiratory depression after discharge from observation by trained personnel".

### Prolonged recovery associated with dexmedetomidine when used as a sole sedative agent in office-based oral and maxillofacial surgery procedures [^112drJNX]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Office-based oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures that require sedation are popular. Dexmedetomidine has the advantages of having a minimal effect on respiration and an antisialogogue effect that could make it a good choice for dental procedures.

Materials and Methods

We performed a prospective pilot study in which patients undergoing office-based oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures received dexmedetomidine as a sole sedative agent. The loading dose of dexmedetomidine (1 microg/kg infused over 10 minutes) was followed by a maintenance dose (0.2 to 0.8 microg/kg/hour) to achieve a Ramsay sedation score of 2 to 3. The demographic data were collected, and the pre- and intraprocedural vital signs and Ramsay sedation score were recorded every 5 minutes. The duration of the procedure, recovery time, and patient and surgeon satisfaction were documented.

Results

No statistically significant changes were found in the heart rate, respiratory rate, or oxygen saturation during the procedure when compared to baseline. However, we noticed a significant decrease in the heart rate at the end of the loading dose, and statistically significant change in the blood pressure between baseline and during the procedure (P < .05). The initial local anesthetic injections were recalled by 26% of the patients, and 73% had some recollection of the procedure. Nevertheless, the patient satisfaction score (range 1 to 10) was 8.6 ± 2.3, and 86% of the patients would recommend this type of sedation. The surgeon satisfaction score (range, 1 to 5) was 3.9 ± 1.3. The recovery time was prolonged (82.2 ± 24.3 minutes) when compared with the total procedure time (44.6 ± 27.9 minutes).

Conclusions

Dexmedetomidine has demonstrated hemodynamic and respiratory stability when used as a sole sedative agent. Despite the discomfort on injection and the lack of reliable amnesic property, patient and surgeon satisfaction were high. However, the prolonged recovery time makes this drug unsuitable for busy office-based practices. We believe it should be reserved for patients with a high risk of respiratory complications (eg, obese patients or those with a history of sleep apnea).

### The failed sedation: solutions for the oral and maxillofacial surgeon [^114Hrw3w]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Due to wide variation in patient responses, both intended and adverse, it is impossible to successfully sedate all patients. Choosing the right drug and dose regimen can be challenging, especially in patients who are naïve to anesthesia. Underdosing can lead to pain perception, patient movement and combativeness, awareness with recall, and the sympathetic neuroendocrine stress response. Overdosing can lead to unintended loss of upper airway tone, hypoventilation/apnea, adverse cardiovascular changes, and prolonged sedation (with its attendant problems).

### Midazolam hydrochloride (midazolam in sodium chloride) [^1119MH2n]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections:

Cardiorespiratory Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Paradoxical Behavior [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
Dependence and Withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]
Impaired Cognitive Function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]
Hypotension and Seizure in Preterm Infants and Neonates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]
Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]
Pediatric Neurotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]

The following adverse reactions have been identified from literature or postmarketing reports of midazolam. Because some of these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Fluctuations in vital signs were the most frequently seen findings following parenteral administration of midazolam in adults and included decreased tidal volume and/or respiratory rate decrease (23.3% of patients following intravenous administration) and apnea (15.4% of patients following intravenous administration), as well as variations in blood pressure and pulse rate. The majority of serious adverse reactions, particularly those associated with oxygenation and ventilation, have been reported when midazolam is administered with other medications capable of depressing the central nervous system. The incidence of such events is higher in patients undergoing procedures involving the airway without the protective effect of an endotracheal tube, (e.g., upper endoscopy and dental procedures).

Pediatric Patients

The following adverse events related to the use of intravenous midazolam in pediatric patients were reported in the medical literature: desaturation 4.6%, apnea 2.8%, hypotension 2.7%, paradoxical reactions 2.0%, hiccough 1.2%, seizure-like activity 1.1% and nystagmus 1.1%. The majority of airway-related events occurred in patients receiving other CNS depressing medications and in patients where midazolam was not used as a single sedating agent.

Neonates

There have been reports of hypotensive episodes and seizures following the administration of midazolam to neonates, [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

### Ketamine hydrochloride [^113sWRY5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information

Ketamine hydrochloride injection should be administered by or under the direction of physicians experienced in the administration of general anesthetics, maintenance of a patent airway, and oxygenation and ventilation. Continuously monitor vital signs in patients receiving ketamine hydrochloride injection.

Emergency airway equipment must be immediately available.

Do not administer the 100 mg/mL concentration of ketamine hydrochloride injection intravenously without proper dilution [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Must be used immediately after dilution.

While some degree of airway protection may be afforded due to active laryngeal-pharyngeal reflexes, vomiting and aspiration may occur with ketamine hydrochloride injection. Ketamine hydrochloride injection is not recommended for use in patients who have not followed nil per os guidelines.

Due to the potential for salivation during ketamine hydrochloride injection administration, administer an antisialagogue prior to induction of anesthesia.

In individuals with a history of chronic ketamine use for off-label indications, there have been case reports of genitourinary pain that may be related to the ketamine treatment, not the underlying condition [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Consider cessation of ketamine if genitourinary pain continues in the setting of other genitourinary symptoms.

Moderate procedural sedation and analgesia practice parameters — routes of administration findings indicate that when intravenous midazolam is compared with intramuscular midazolam, trials report equivocal findings for oxygen saturation levels, respiratory rate, and heart rate, and when intravenous midazolam is compared with intranasal midazolam, trials report equivocal findings for sedation efficacy but discomfort from the nasal administration in all intranasal patients with no nasal discomfort from the intravenous patients. Trials comparing intravenous diazepam with rectal diazepam report lower recall for the intravenous method with otherwise equivocal sedative effect, anxiety, and crying, and trials comparing intravenous with intranasal dexmedetomidine report equivocal findings for sedation time, duration of the procedure, and the frequency of rescue doses of midazolam administered.

### Sedation of children undergoing dental treatment [^113U6prA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Children's fear about dental treatment may lead to behaviour management problems for the dentist, which can be a barrier to the successful dental treatment of children. Sedation can be used to relieve anxiety and manage behaviour in children undergoing dental treatment. There is a need to determine from published research which agents, dosages and regimens are effective.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and relative efficacy of conscious sedation agents and dosages for behaviour management in paediatric dentistry.

Search Methods

Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Dissertation Abstracts, SIGLE, the World Wide Web (Google) and the Community of Science Database were conducted for relevant trials and references up to 4th August 2011. Reference lists from relevant articles were scanned and the authors contacted to identify trials and obtain additional information. There were no language restrictions. Trials pre-1966 were not searched.

Selection Criteria

Studies were selected if they met the following criteria: randomised controlled trials of conscious sedation comparing two or more drugs/techniques/placebo undertaken by the dentist or one of the dental team in children up to 16 years of age. Crossover trials were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Information regarding methods, participants, interventions, outcome measures and results were independently extracted, in duplicate, by two review authors. Where information in trial reports was unclear or incomplete authors of trials were contacted. Trials were assessed for risk of bias. The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines were followed.

Main Results

Thirty-six studies were included with a total of 2810 participants. Thirty trials (83%) were at high risk of bias and six (17%) were at unclear risk of bias. There were 28 different sedatives used with or without inhalational nitrous oxide. Dosages, mode of administration and time of administration varied widely. Trials were grouped into placebo-controlled, dosage and head-to-head comparisons. Meta-analysis of the available data was possible for studies investigating oral midazolam vs placebo only. There is weak evidence from five small clinically heterogeneous trials at high risk of bias, that the use of oral midazolam in doses between 0.25 mg/kg to 0.75 mg/kg is associated with more co-operative behaviour compared to placebo; standardised mean difference (SMD) favoured midazolam (SMD 2.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.58 to 4.37, P < 0.001, I² = 91%), which translates to an increase of approximately 1.8 points on the six-point Houpt behaviour scale. There is very weak evidence from two trials which could not be pooled that inhalational nitrous oxide is more effective than placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some weak evidence that oral midazolam is an effective sedative agent for children undergoing dental treatment. There is very weak evidence that nitrous oxide inhalation may also be effective. There is a need for further well designed and well reported clinical trials to evaluate other potential sedation agents. Further recommendations for future research are described and it is suggested that future trials evaluate experimental regimens in comparison with oral midazolam or inhaled nitrous oxide.

### Neurotoxicity secondary to local tetracaine use [^115zN9Zx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic reactions from local tetracaine use are often an anomaly - not only is tetracaine short-acting and quickly metabolized by the pseudocholinesterase system leading to very limited systemic uptake, but most adverse reactions are usually associated with dental or spinal anesthesia. Furthermore, reactions to local anesthetics manifest in standard allergy-type reactions. When local anesthetics lead to nervous or cardiac system abnormalities, it is termed a local anesthetic systemic toxicity - an event with an incidence currently estimated to be 0.03%.

Case Presentation

We present a case of a 56-year-old female who experienced a systemic reaction to tetracaine 1% while undergoing a fine needle biopsy of a thyroid nodule. The patient had previous allergic reactions to lidocaine. Upon conclusion of the procedure, the patient began convulsing and became rigid and non-verbal. She was able to move all extremities, had no respiratory distress, no swelling, hives, or redness, and was swallowing without difficulty. After about 5 min, the patient began to improve and experienced reversal of all previous symptoms. Her physical exam and labs were otherwise normal, she returned to her baseline functioning, and was discharged without any medical interventions.

Discussion

This case illustrates a case of LAST in a patient with previous Lidocaine allergy without any other obvious risk factors. There have been no cases of cross-reaction between lidocaine and tetracaine so it explores the possibility of patients having cross reaction to those two different kinds of local anesthetic.

### Preoperative evaluation and patient selection for office-based oral surgery anesthesia [^116TC5xa]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Provision of an outpatient anesthetic requires careful review of the patient's medical history along with salient aspects of the physical examination. The oral and maxillofacial surgeon may need to consult with the patient's medical providers to gain an understanding of the patient's potential risks for an adverse event. This article reviews key aspects of the patient evaluation so that an informed determination of suitability for an office anesthetic can be made.

### Does anesthesia duration or number of cases per patient predict safety events? [^111FcHcx]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The need for dental rehabilitation under general anesthesia is increasing, with varying needs between patients. Mortality has been found to be a rare event in these patients; however other perioperative events can and do occur. Previous studies have established increased incidence of perioperative events with younger, sicker children, and longer anesthetics, however, no studies to date have evaluated if the incidence of perioperative events is more closely associated with one long anesthetic or multiple anesthetics per patient.

Aims

To evaluate the association of perioperative events related to single anesthetic duration or number of anesthetics per patient for dental rehabilitation.

Methods

After Children's Wisconsin Human Research Protection Program determined this quality activity did not meet the definition of human subjects research, we performed an epidemiologic observational evaluation by extracting all dental related cases (dental alone or with oral surgeon vs. dental with other specialties) with an associated general anesthesia encounter from Children's Wisconsin electronic data warehouse from June 1, 2015 to December 31, 2021. These cases occurred at a free-standing children's hospital or associated pediatric-only ambulatory surgery center. The risk of perioperative safety events was analyzed for previously identified risk groups such as American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS), patient age, anesthesia case time with the addition of number of dental cases per patient.

Results

In this study, 8468 procedures were performed on 8082 patients. Of this cohort, 7765 patients underwent one procedure for dental care while 317 patients underwent a total of 703 dental-related procedures, ranging from two to five procedures per patient. Multivariable logistic regression identified increased risk of perioperative events in patients with ASA-PS 3 (n = 1459, rate 1.78%, p value .001, OR 5.7, CI 2.1–15.5) and ASA-PS 4 (n = 86, rate 5.8%, p < .001, OR 17.2, CI 4.4–67.3), anesthesia duration (p < .001, OR 1.46, CI 1.21–1.76), but no increased risk with number of anesthetics per patient (p value .54, OR 0.81, CI 0.4–1.61).

Conclusions

Limiting dental care under general anesthesia to multiple short cases may decrease the risk of perioperative events when compared to completing all treatment in one long operative session.

### Efficacy of oral midazolam for minimal and moderate sedation in pediatric patients: a systematic review [^114g6K53]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

3.2 Effectiveness in different contexts of sedation

A total of 19 trials (N = 1352) reported response rates in the context of anesthetic premedication (including 3 placebo‐controlled studies) and only 6 trials (N = 258) reported response rates in the context of medical procedures (including 1 placebo‐controlled study). The studies presented high variability, with response rates [95% confidence interval] in anesthetic premedication ranging from 36.7% [21.6%, 54.9%] to 97.0% [94.8%, 98.3%] and from 56.1% [43.1%‐68.4] to 97.8% [86.1%, 99.7%] in medical procedures (Figure 2).

Figure 2
Response rates (95% CI) in the different contexts of sedation in pediatric patients receiving oral midazolam. n: number of responders, N, number of subjects

Although it could be argued that different sedation criteria should be used between premedication and sedation before procedures, the reality of the studies was that differences observed in sedation scales or success criteria were not associated with the context of sedation (there were studies with nonrestrictive and more restrictive success criteria both for medical procedures and for premedication before anesthesia). There was no apparent difference in terms of response rates between both contexts of sedation.

Only six of the studies fulfilled the selection criteria for sedation before procedures, and therefore, limited information could be gathered from studies performed in this indication. The effectiveness of midazolam in children undergoing procedures, such as dental treatment, has already been reported in a previous review. 14

### Sedation versus general anaesthesia for provision of dental treatment to patients younger than 18 years [^112gmvep]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

A significant proportion of children have caries requiring restorations or extractions, and some of these children will not accept this treatment under local anaesthetic. Historically this has been managed by the use of a general anaesthetic in children; however, use of sedation may lead to reduced morbidity and cost. The aim of this review was to compare the efficiency of sedation versus general anaesthesia (GA) for provision of dental treatment to children and adolescents younger than 18 years. This review was originally published in 2009 and was updated in 2012 and again in 2015.

Objectives

We will evaluate morbidity and effectiveness of sedation versus GA for provision of dental treatment to patients younger than 18 years. If data become available, we will analyse the cost-effectiveness of different interventions. If data are not available, we will obtain crude estimates of cost. Morbidity can be defined as 'an undesired result or complication'. For the purposes of this review, 'postoperative morbidity' refers to undesired results or complications such as nausea following a procedure, once the patient had been restored to consciousness and could breathe unaided. 'Intraoperative morbidity' refers to any complications that occur during the procedure that may necessitate action by the anaesthetist or the sedationist, such as respiratory arrest.

Search Methods

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 7); MEDLINE Ovid SP (1950 to July 2015); EMBASE Ovid SP (1974 to July 2015); System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE) (1980 to October July 2012); Latin American & Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1982 to July 2015); and Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (1945 to July 2015). We also carried out handsearching of relevant journals to July 2015. We imposed no language restriction.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomized controlled clinical trials that compared sedative agents versus general anaesthesia in children and adolescents up to 18 years of age undergoing dental treatment. We excluded complex surgical procedures and pseudo-randomized trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed titles and abstracts for inclusion in the review. We recorded information relevant to objectives and outcome measures by using a specially designed 'data extraction form'. We will employ the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) approach to interpret findings.

Main Results

In our original review, we identified 16 studies for potential inclusion after searching available databases and screening titles and abstracts. After retrieving full-text studies, we found none to be eligible. We identified no additional studies in the updated search of July 2012. We identified two studies for possible inclusion in the updated search of July 2015; again we found these to be ineligible.

Authors' Conclusions

Randomized controlled studies comparing use of dental general anaesthesia versus sedation are needed to quantify differences such as morbidity and cost.

### Age, minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration, and minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration-awake [^113S6oY8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2001). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Two defining effects of inhaled anesthetics (immobility in the face of noxious stimulation, and absence of memory) correlate with the end-tidal concentrations of the anesthetics. Such defining effects are characterized as MAC (the concentration producing immobility in 50% of patients subjected to a noxious stimulus) and MAC-Awake (the concentration suppressing appropriate response to command in 50% of patients; memory is usually lost at MAC-Awake). If the concentrations are monitored and corrected for the effects of age and temperature, the concentrations may be displayed as multiples of MAC for a standard age, usually 40 yr. This article provides an algorithm that might be used to produce such a display, including provision of an estimate of the effect of nitrous oxide.

Implications

Two defining effects of inhaled anesthetics (immobility in the face of noxious stimulation, and absence of memory) correlate with the end-tidal concentrations of the anesthetics. Thus, these defining effects may be monitored and the results displayed if the concentrations are known and corrected for the effects of age and temperature.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, agitation / sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^114roD5X]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Volatile anesthetics for procedural pain — We recommend not using inhaled volatile anesthetics for procedural pain management in critically ill adults (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). No RCTs comparing isoflurane to a control intervention were found, and a small double-blinded RCT of nitrous oxide 50% and oxygen with isoflurane versus nitrous oxide 50% and oxygen alone around CTR showed mixed results (more effective for the first chest tube but not the second). The panel does not recommend this intervention due to timing concerns, very low-quality evidence, resource needs, and safety issues outside the operating room.

Moderate procedural sedation and analgesia — general recovery supervision and monitoring state that medical supervision of recovery and discharge after moderate sedation is the responsibility of the operating practitioner or a licensed physician. The recovery area should be equipped with or have direct access to age and size appropriate monitoring and resuscitation equipment, and patients receiving moderate sedation should be monitored until appropriate discharge criteria are satisfied with the duration and frequency individualized by level of sedation, overall condition, and the nature of the intervention; oxygenation should be monitored until patients are no longer at risk for respiratory depression. Level of consciousness, vital signs, and oxygenation (when indicated) should be recorded at regular intervals; a nurse or other individual trained to monitor patients and recognize complications should be in attendance until discharge criteria are fulfilled, and an individual capable of managing complications should be immediately available until discharge criteria are fulfilled.

### Phentolamine clinical pediatric review… [^113WgiKU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Review Completion Date May 5, 2008 Established Name Phentolamine Mesylate Proposed Trade Name OraVerse Therapeutic Class local anesthetic reversal agent Applicant Novalar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Priority Designation S Formulation injection solution Dosing Regimen intraoral submucosal injection Indication reversal of local anesthesia for dental procedures Intended Population healthy dental patients over 12 years of age.

1. 3 Summary of Clinical Findings 1.
3. 1 Brief Overview of Clinical Program Novalar Pharmaceuticals, Incorporated, proposes that phentolamine mesylate, a non­ selective α-adrenergic antagonist, can reverse the effects of local anesthetics used for dental procedures. Specifically, the applicant claims that NV-101 reverses soft tissue anesthesia, i.e.

applicable, the tongue for patients undergoing various dental procedures following the performance of routine dental nerve block involving the administration of a commonly used dental anesthetic. Both trials also assessed the times to return of baseline values for the STAR and FAB scores for these subjects. One of the trials, NOVA 04–100, evaluated dental procedures involving the mandible; the other, NOVA 04–200, evaluated dental procedures involving the maxilla. The data from NOVA 04­ 100, demonstrated that use of NV-101 resulted in an 85-minute reduction in the median time to. return of normal sensation of the lip; and a 60-minute reduction in the median time to return of baseline STAR and FAB scores. The data from this trial also demonstrated a 65-minute reduction in the median time to return of normal sensation of the tongue with the use of NV-101.

The data from NOVA 04–200, demonstrated that use of NV-101 resulted in an 83-minute. the lip, and, where applicable, the tongue, chin and cheek for patients undergoing various dental procedures following the performance of routine dental nerve block involving the administration of a commonly used dental anesthetic. These two studies did not include an assessment of either STAR or FAB scores. The data from NOVA 03–001 demonstrated that use of NV-101 resulted.

### ARTICAINE-articaine hydrochloride and epinephrine… [^113Q9YuV]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

RECENT MAJOR CHANGES WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Methemoglobinemia INDICATIONS AND USAGE Articaine HCl and Epinephrine is a combination of articaine HCl, an amide local anesthetic, and epinephrine, a vasoconstrictor, is indicated for local, infiltrative, or conductive anesthesia in both simple and complex dental procedures. in adults and pediatric patients 4 years of age or older. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For dental procedures by intraoral submucosal infiltration or nerve block.
- For most routine dental procedures, Articaine HCl and Epinephrine containing 1: 200, 000 is preferred. However, when more pronounced hemostasis or improved visualization of the surgical field are required, Articaine HCl and Epinephrine containing epinephrine 1: 100, 000 may be used. The recommended dosages of Articaine HCl and Epinephrine in healthy adults serve only as a guide to the amount of anesthetic required for most routine dental procedures.

The dosages to be used in adults depend on several factors such as type and extent of surgical procedure, depth of anesthesia, degree of muscular relaxation, and condition of the patient. In all cases, administer the lowest dosage that will produce the desired result. The safety and effectiveness of Articaine HCl and Epinephrine for local, infiltrative, or conductive anesthesia in both simple and complex dental procedures have been established in pediatric patients ages 4 to 16 years old. Safety and effectiveness was established in clinical trials with 61 pediatric patients between the ages of 4 and 16 years administered articaine hydrochloride 4% and epinephrine 1: 100, 000 injections. Fifty-one of these patients received doses from 0. 76 mg/kg to
5. 65 mg/kg for simple dental procedures and 10 patients received doses between 0. 37 mg/kg and
7. 48 mg/kg for complex dental procedures.

Approximately 13% of these pediatric patients required additional injections of anesthetic for complete anesthesia. Dosages in pediatric patients should be reduced, commensurate with age, body weight, and physical condition.

### LIDOCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE injection, solution… [^1147p4TX]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE Lidocaine hydrochloride injection contains lidocaine, an amide local anesthetic. Lidocaine hydrochloride injection is indicated in adult and pediatric patients for the production of local or regional anesthesia or analgesia for surgery, dental, and oral surgery procedures, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and for obstetrical procedures. For each type of block indicated to produce local or regional anesthesia or analgesia, specific concentrations and presentations are recommended.
- The toxic effects of local anesthetics are additive. Monitor for neurologic and cardiovascular effects related to local anesthetic systemic toxicity when additional local anesthetics are administered with lidocaine hydrochloride injection.

Confusion, convulsions, respiratory depression and/or respiratory arrest, and cardiovascular stimulation or depression have been reported. These reactions may be due to intra-arterial injection of the local anesthetic with retrograde flow to the cerebral circulation. They may also be due to puncture of the dural sheath of the optic nerve during retrobulbar block with diffusion of any local anesthetic along the subdural space to the midbrain. When used for dental injections, paresthesia of the lips, tongue, and oral tissues have been reported. Persistent paresthesia lasting weeks to months and, in some instances, lasting greater than one year, have also been reported.

Nervous System Disorders Adverse reactions were characterized by excitation and/or depression of the central nervous system and included lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest.
