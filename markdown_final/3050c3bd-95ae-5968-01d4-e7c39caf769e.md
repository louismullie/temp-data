## Question

What are the common symptoms of diverticulosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common symptoms of diverticulosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between diverticulosis and diverticular disease. Then, I should verify how often diverticulosis is truly asymptomatic. Next, I will examine the evidence for symptoms in uncomplicated diverticulosis versus symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease. After that, I need to consider confounding by irritable bowel syndrome and the impact of age. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion and note exceptions and red flags that warrant further evaluation.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. Diverticulosis is the presence of colonic diverticula without inflammation or complications, whereas diverticular disease encompasses symptomatic presentations, including symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and acute diverticulitis, which are different clinical states with different symptom profiles and management implications.

> Wait, let me verify the baseline: most people with diverticulosis are asymptomatic. High-quality reviews consistently state that roughly 80–85% of individuals with diverticulosis remain asymptomatic throughout life, and contemporary cohort data suggest that when diverticulosis is identified incidentally, it is not associated with increased abdominal pain or altered bowel habits compared with those without diverticulosis, reinforcing that uncomplicated diverticulosis itself is not a symptomatic disease state [^69922457] [^7c4c817b] [^9d52077e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Some older literature and reviews describe a subset with vague abdominal discomfort, bloating, or altered bowel habits attributed to diverticulosis, but these reports often blur the line with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and fail to exclude inflammation or IBS, so I should be cautious about attributing symptoms directly to diverticulosis per se [^8b92b173] [^51c0be64].

> I will now examine the evidence for symptoms in uncomplicated diverticulosis more closely. Prospective, population-based diary studies show no increase in overall abdominal pain, left lower quadrant pain, or abnormal bowel habits in individuals with diverticulosis compared with those without, and when pain occurs, its localization to the left lower quadrant may reflect chance or coexisting IBS rather than a direct effect of diverticula, which tempers the idea that diverticulosis itself causes symptoms [^7c4c817b] [^9d52077e] [^aa4fca78].

> But wait, what if symptoms emerge after an episode of diverticulitis or in a different phenotype? Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease is a recognized entity characterized by recurrent left lower quadrant pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits in the absence of macroscopic inflammation; importantly, SUDD can arise after an episode of acute diverticulitis or, less commonly, de novo, and it is distinct from uncomplicated diverticulosis, with pathophysiology that may include low-grade inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, and microbiota changes, which helps explain why symptoms can persist despite the absence of overt diverticulitis on imaging or endoscopy [^c97f9b66] [^91f099a5] [^5ba912b7].

> I need to check the IBS overlap because it complicates attribution. Population-based and clinical studies show substantial overlap between IBS and SUDD, with similar symptom profiles but some demographic and clinical clues that help differentiate them, such as older age and male predominance in SUDD versus younger age and female predominance in IBS; this overlap means that symptoms in a patient with diverticulosis may reflect IBS, SUDD, or both, and should prompt careful exclusion of inflammation before labeling symptoms as diverticula-related [^3a9357f2] [^23841734] [^c97f9b66].

> Let me consider age-related nuances. In older adults, diverticulosis is common and presentations of diverticulitis can be atypical, with less pain or fever and more nonspecific complaints; conversely, in younger patients, right-sided pain is not rare and misdiagnosis is common, so I should maintain diagnostic vigilance and avoid anchoring on age alone when symptoms arise in someone with known diverticulosis [^d215829e] [^93839b1c].

> I should double-check the bottom line before concluding. The most accurate statement is that uncomplicated diverticulosis is typically asymptomatic, and when symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, or altered bowel habits occur in someone with diverticulosis, they are more likely due to symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease, IBS, or another gastrointestinal condition rather than the mere presence of diverticula; thus, the common symptoms attributed to "diverticulosis" are not truly caused by uncomplicated diverticulosis itself in the absence of inflammation or functional overlay [^69922457] [^7c4c817b] [^c97f9b66].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical clinical guidance is clear. If a patient with known diverticulosis reports persistent or recurrent symptoms, I should confirm the absence of active inflammation with appropriate evaluation and consider SUDD or IBS mechanisms, including visceral hypersensitivity, before attributing symptoms to diverticulosis; red flags or atypical features should prompt imaging and endoscopic assessment to exclude complications or alternative diagnoses, aligning with contemporary guidelines and reviews [^d68aa8ff] [^5ba912b7] [^c97f9c66].

Diverticulosis is **usually asymptomatic** [^69922457] and often discovered incidentally. When symptoms occur, they are typically mild and nonspecific — such as **bloating, cramping, or altered bowel habits** (constipation or diarrhea) [^8b92b173] [^1e720287] — and are usually due to associated conditions like irritable bowel syndrome or low-grade inflammation rather than the diverticula themselves [^3a9357f2] [^7c4c817b]. Severe symptoms (e.g. acute left lower quadrant pain, fever, or rectal bleeding) indicate **complications such as diverticulitis or bleeding** and require prompt evaluation [^87409f0d] [^b10aebbb].

---

## Common symptoms of diverticulosis

Most patients with diverticulosis are asymptomatic; when symptoms occur, they are generally mild and nonspecific:

- **Bloating and abdominal discomfort**: Mild, intermittent bloating or vague abdominal discomfort, often related to altered colonic motility or dietary factors [^8b92b173] [^6e3de2d6].

- **Altered bowel habits**: Constipation or diarrhea may occur, but these symptoms are nonspecific and often overlap with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [^3a9357f2] [^1e720287].

- **Mild cramping**: Occasional cramping or pressure, typically diffuse and not localized, is sometimes reported [^notfound].

---

## Differentiating diverticulosis from diverticulitis

It is essential to distinguish diverticulosis (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic) from diverticulitis (inflammation or infection of diverticula), which presents with **more severe symptoms**:

| **Feature** | **Diverticulosis** | **Diverticulitis** |
|-|-|-|
| Pain | Mild, diffuse, intermittent | Severe, localized (LLQ), persistent |
| Fever | Absent | Common |
| Leukocytosis | Absent | Common |
| Bowel habits | Mild constipation or diarrhea | Significant alteration, often with nausea/vomiting |
| Complications | Rare | Common (abscess, perforation, fistula, obstruction) |

---

## Factors influencing symptom occurrence

Several factors may contribute to symptom development in patients with diverticulosis:

- **Dietary factors**: Low-fiber diets, high red meat consumption, and obesity have been associated with increased risk of symptomatic diverticular disease [^533ccba6] [^6e3de2d6].

- **Colonic motility disorders**: Abnormal colonic motility and visceral hypersensitivity may contribute to symptoms such as bloating and altered bowel habits [^40c771df] [^3a9357f2].

- **Low-grade inflammation**: Chronic low-grade inflammation may play a role in symptom generation, particularly in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) [^fcf1b3ea] [^91f099a5].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Given the typically asymptomatic nature of diverticulosis, **no specific treatment is required** for asymptomatic cases. Management focuses on dietary modifications (high-fiber diet), lifestyle changes (regular exercise, weight management), and patient education [^8b92b173] [^6e3de2d6]. Symptomatic patients may benefit from dietary adjustments, probiotics, and medications targeting motility or inflammation, although evidence for these interventions varies [^ee44381d] [^27879bf2].

---

## Conclusion

Diverticulosis is **usually asymptomatic**; when symptoms occur, they are mild and nonspecific — such as bloating, cramping, or altered bowel habits — and often reflect associated functional disorders or low-grade inflammation rather than the diverticula themselves. Severe symptoms indicate complications like diverticulitis or bleeding and require prompt medical evaluation [^69922457] [^87409f0d].

### Updates in the understanding and management of diverticular disease [^93f9f5ea]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diverticulosis leads to significant morbidity and mortality and is increasing in prevalence worldwide. In this paper, we review the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of diverticular disorders, followed by a discussion of recent updates and changes in the clinical approach to diverticular disease.

Recent Findings

Recent literature suggests that antibiotics are likely not necessary for low-risk patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, and not all patients with recurrent diverticulitis require colectomy. Dietary restrictions do not prevent recurrent diverticulitis. Visceral hypersensitivity is increasingly being recognized as a cause of persistent abdominal pain after acute diverticulitis and should be considered along with chronic smoldering diverticulitis, segmental colitis associated with diverticula, and symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease.

Summary

Clinicians should be aware that traditionally held assumptions regarding the prevention and management of diverticular disorders have recently been called into question and should adjust their clinical practice accordingly.

Colonic diverticulosis and diverticular disease are among the most common gastrointestinal disorders encountered in clinical practice. These Italian guidelines focus on the diagnosis and management of diverticulosis and diverticular disease in the adult population, providing practical and evidence-based recommendations for clinicians. Experts from five Italian scientific societies, constituting a multidisciplinary panel, conducted a comprehensive review of meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, and observational studies to formulate 14 PICO questions. The assessment of the quality of the evidence and the formulation of the recommendations were carried out using an adaptation of the GRADE methodology. The guidelines covered the following topics: i) Management of diverticulosis; ii) Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease: diagnosis and treatment; iii) Acute diverticulitis: diagnosis and treatment; iv) Management of diverticular disease complications; v) Prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis; vi) Interventional management of diverticular disease.

Diverticulosis and diverticulitis remain common diagnoses in western countries, and the incidence continues to rise. Diverticulitis accounts for roughly one-third of admissions to acute care hospitals annually, with even more patients being treated as outpatients due to improved understanding of risk stratification and the natural history of disease progression. Thus, having a thorough understanding of the etiology of the disease in conjunction with computed tomography findings and patient presentation can help dictate the appropriate treatment.

### Left lower-quadrant pain: guidelines from the American college of… [^cca04376]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Acute sigmoid diverticulitis, a complication of colonic diverticulosis, is the most common cause of acute left lower-quadrant pain in adults. Diverticulosis occurs in 5 to 10 percent of persons by 45 years of age, and in up to 80 percent by 80 years of age. 1 Although most persons with diverticulosis never have symptoms, diverticulitis occurs in 10 to 20 percent of persons with this condition, 2 and recurrent diverticulitis occurs in approximately 25 percent of these patients. 3 The severity ranges from mild to severe, which can result in perforation with peritonitis and abscess or fistula formation. The severity of the initial attack is an excellent predictor of the likelihood of recurrence. 4 Mild cases of diverticulitis can be treated medically. More severe cases may require emergent surgery as a result of complications.
5. Acute sigmoid diverticulitis should be suspected in patients with the clinical triad of left lower-quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis.

Additional diagnostic considerations include, but are not limited to, other gastrointestinal pathology, obstetric and gynecologic pathology, and renal or ureteric colic. This article reviews the most appropriate imaging studies in adults presenting with left lower-quadrant pain, according to the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria.
6. CASE 2 A 44-year-old man who was recently treated conservatively for diverticulitis presents with recurrent left lower-quadrant pain and fever. Contrast-enhanced CT shows a rim-enhancing gas and fluid collection adjacent to the sigmoid colon, which is consistent with a diverticular abscess. Multiple sigmoid diverticula, colonic wall thickening, and pericolonic fat stranding are also present. The abscess is drained percutaneously. The most common CT findings in patients with acute diverticulitis are pericolonic fat stranding, bowel wall thickening, and diverticula.

Additional findings may include free fluid, free air, fascial thickening, an inflamed diverticulum, or the arrowhead sign (i.e., an arrowhead-shaped configuration of contrast material found at the orifice of the inflamed diverticulum. ULTRASONOGRAPHY One review found limited evidence to support the use of ultrasonography as the preferred diagnostic test in patients with suspected diverticulitis.

What are the aims of treatment?

As mentioned above, the clinical spectrum of colonic diverticular disease is wide and ranges from asymptomatic diverticula to SUDD, uncomplicated diverticulitis and eventually, complicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the management, and the therapeutic approach are different, depending on the severity of the disease. Overall, prevention of progression, treatment of active disease and prevention of recurrence are the three key aims of treatment in any clinical manifestation of diverticular disease.

Asymptomatic diverticulosis does not need any pharmacologic treatment. However, healthy lifestyle (regular physical exercise, maintaining ideal body weight, abstention from smoking) and high-fiber diet are recommended to prevent its progression to SUDD and its complications. Most people with diverticulosis will not progress to symptomatic disease. The proportion of subjects with diverticulosis that eventually develop SUDD or acute diverticulitis is unknown. Consensus papers and reviews, state that 80–85% of subjects with diverticulosis will remain asymptomatic throughout their life, whereas 15–20% of symptomatic patients will suffer from diverticular disease without inflammation, while the remainder will have diverticulitis. However, estimates of progression need to be based on more reliable studies. One studyidentified 2222 patients with baseline diverticulosis. Over an 11-year follow-up period, 95 patients developed diverticulitis (4.3%; 6 per 1000 patient-years). The median time to event was 7.1 years.

Pharmacological treatment of SUDD should reduce intensity and frequency of symptoms and prevent the progression to diverticulitis, (Table 2). Most symptoms in SUDD are mild to moderate but they impair the patients' quality of life. Typical symptoms of SUDD include pain (in the lower or left lower quadrant of the abdomen), bloating and changes in bowel habits, symptoms also observed in patients with IBS; a differential diagnosis between these two clinical entities should therefore be attempted.

Table 2.
Aims of therapy in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease.

Progression to diverticulitis is uncommon and often benign. One prospective, long-term study, assessing the development of complications in patients with SUDD, pointed out that 97% of patients had mild or no symptoms after a median follow-up of 66 months. Acute diverticulitis appeared in only 2.5% of cases.

### Diverticulosis and acute diverticulitis [^5423a87c]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Colonic diverticulosis is a common, usually asymptomatic, entity of Western countries, with an incidence that increases with age. When these diverticula become infected and inflamed, patients can present with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Management of acute, uncomplicated diverticulitis can often be treated successfully with antibiotics alone and the decision to proceed with more aggressive measures such as surgical intervention is made on a case-by-case basis. The treatment algorithm for diverticular disease continues to evolve as the pathophysiology, etiology, and natural history of the disease becomes better understood.

### History, incidence, and epidemiology of diverticulosis [^b9048198]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Diverticulosis of the colon is a very common condition. Described as early as the 17th century, most of the information we now have is based on much of the work during the 20th century. Age, sex, race, and geography all play a specific role in the development of diverticula. It is the merging of these factors that changes the prevalence of diverticula and their manifestations. Symptomatic diverticula can lead to serious complications requiring both medical and surgical interventions to treat these complications when they occur. This review will focus on the history and epidemiology of diverticulosis in regard to age, sex, race, geography, and the epidemiology of complicated diverticular disease.

### Diverticular disease and IBS: overlapping or misunderstanding? [^5a9f4ced]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Although over half of patients over 65 years old will have diverticulosis, only a minority experience symptoms. These are often similar to those of irritable bowel syndrome with pain and disordered bowel habit, but differ in having an onset in the sixth to seventh decade. The underlying mechanisms include visceral hypersensitivity which maybe postinflammatory, but may also be due to altered central pain processing. Somatization is a useful clue to a predominantly central pathology, while its absence points to local causes including altered enteric nerves and mucosal immune activation. Treatments should be tailored to the individual patient who shows either predominantly peripheral or central abnormalities.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^1274f141]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diverticulitis accounts for over 300,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States and its incidence increases with age. Among older adults, diverticulitis is the fourth leading cause for emergency surgery. Older adults with multimorbidity and geriatric syndromes are often excluded from clinical studies, leaving a gap in the evidence needed to guide management. Here, we provide a clinically oriented review of the diagnosis and management of older adults with diverticulitis through the lens of age-friendly care.

Methods and Results

We reviewed the literature describing the epidemiology, diagnosis, management, and prevention of diverticulitis in older adults. Due to age-related physiologic changes, the presence of geriatric syndromes, and multimorbidity, older adults with diverticulitis often present with atypical symptoms, variable laboratory findings, and are at higher risk for complications than younger patients. Guidelines support a more aggressive approach to diagnosis in this population, with lower threshold for obtaining diagnostic imaging. Antibiotics remain a mainstay of treatment for uncomplicated disease, and surgical management should be focused on severity of disease and the balance between the likelihood of improving quality of life and risks and burden of treatment.

Conclusions

Diverticulitis is a common disease that has a unique presentation among older individuals with limited evidence to guide management. Diagnosis and treatment should focus on what matters most to the patient, providing the most meaningful outcome possible within the context of multimorbidity, patient goals, symptom burden, and anticipated treatment outcomes.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^64d8ddcf]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

11 Conclusion

The prevalence of diverticulitis increases with age. Diverticulitis in older adults poses unique challenges due to atypical presentation and differences in the risk benefit profile of treatment strategies. Further research in this population is required to help define optimal medical management strategies (safety of omitting antibiotics), quality of life outcomes with and without surgical intervention, and the impacts of age on recurrence. Based on available data, CT imaging should be considered in any patient over 65 suspected of having diverticulitis and presenting with systemic signs or atypical symptoms such as fatigue, syncope, and/or acute kidney injury. Antibiotics should be considered for older or frail patients who present with systemic symptoms, and patients with complicated, recurrent, or smoldering diverticulitis should be referred to a surgeon if surgery is within their goals of care. Overall, diverticulitis treatment should center on what matters most to the patient and provide the most meaningful outcome possible within the context of the patient's goals, symptoms, and likely treatment outcomes.

### Probiotics and diverticular disease: evidence-based? [^3f4f3d75]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease (DD) is a common gastrointestinal condition. Clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic diverticulosis to symptomatic uncomplicated or complicated DD. Symptoms related to uncomplicated DD are not specific and may be indistinguishable from those of irritable bowel syndrome. Low-grade inflammation, altered intestinal microbiota, visceral hypersensitivity, and abnormal colonic motility have been identified as factors potentially contributing to symptoms. Probiotics may modify the gut microbial balance leading to health benefits. Probiotics, due to their anti-inflammatory effects and ability to maintain an adequate bacterial colonization in the colon, are promising treatment options for DD. This review focuses on the available evidence on the efficacy of prebiotics in uncomplicated DD.

### Diverticular disease: update on pathophysiology, classification and management [^9acc6afb]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Colonic diverticulosis is prevalent, affecting approximately 70% of the western population by 80 years of age. Incidence is rapidly increasing in younger age groups. Between 10% and 25% of those with diverticular disease (DD) will experience acute diverticulitis. A further 15% will develop complications including abscess, bleeding and perforation. Such complications are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and constitute a worldwide health burden. Furthermore, chronic symptoms associated with DD are difficult to manage and present a further significant healthcare burden. The pathophysiology of DD is complex due to multifactorial contributing factors. These include diet, colonic wall structure, intestinal motility and genetic predispositions. Thus, targeted preventative measures have proved difficult to establish. Recently, commonly held conceptions on DD have been challenged. This review explores the latest understanding on pathophysiology, risk factors, classification and treatment options.

### Origin of symptoms in diverticular disease [^40c771df]. The British Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

A significant number of patients with colonic diverticula experience unexplained, recurrent, short-lived but often debilitating abdominal pain and alteration in bowel habit. Such patients account for many medical consultations every year but, as our understanding of the cause of their symptoms remains imperfect, treatment options are limited. This article reviews the possible mechanisms that may be responsible for the symptoms of diverticular disease.

Methods

Medline and Science Citation Index searches were performed to locate English language articles relating to colonic diverticula and symptoms published between January 1966 and July 2002. Manual cross-referencing was also performed and some historical articles were included.

Results and Conclusion

Several theories now exist about the mechanisms underlying the symptoms of diverticular disease. Initial studies suggested that they may be due to alterations in the intracolonic pressure, extrapolating earlier thoughts on the likely pathogenesis of diverticula. It seems more likely, however, that several inter-related processes, such as muscular dysfunction, visceral hypersensitivity and inflammation, are involved in symptom generation.

What is the clinical picture of diverticular disease?

Diverticular disease is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders in Western countries. The presence of diverticulosis, saccular protrusions in the colon, increases with age. Diverticulosis is uncommon before the age of 40 but is seen in approximately 60% of individuals aged over 70 years. Individuals with diverticulosis are at risk of developing diverticulitis (inflammation of one or a few diverticula and the surrounding colon) and diverticular bleeding (acute bleeding from a nutrient vessel in a diverticulum). They may also develop chronic gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating or changes in bowel habits) termed symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD). After an episode of diverticulitis, patients are at risk of developing a functional bowel syndrome. Rarely, patients with diverticulosis develop segmental colitis that closely resembles or even overlaps with inflammatory bowel disease, (Figure 3).

Figure 3.
Clinical spectrum of diverticular disease.

IBS, irritable bowel syndrome; SUDD, symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease.

The vast majority of individuals with diverticulosis will remain asymptomatic. In a large US study of predominantly male subjects, over an 11-year follow-up period, only 4% of individuals with diverticulosis were diagnosed with diverticulitis. Diverticular bleeding is less common than diverticulitis. In one US nationwide study, the prevalence of diverticular bleeding was approximately one third that of diverticulitis. The incidence of SUDD and other problems in patients with diverticulosis is not well studied, but these may occur in 15% of patients with diverticulosis.

The risk of diverticulitis in patients with diverticulosis is highest in young patients, although, because many more-older patients have diverticulosis, the majority of cases occur in older patients. Population-based studies indicate that about 20% of individuals with an incident episode of diverticulitis will experience a recurrence. The risk of recurrence increases with the number of episodes. Traditionally, recurrent attacks were felt to be more serious than incident events. However, recent data indicate that perforation and peritonitis are most likely to occur with the first or second episode. This finding has led to a less aggressive approach (with prophylactic segmental colectomy) for prevention of recurrence.

### Progress and challenges in the management of diverticular disease: which treatment? [^27879bf2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease of the colon (DDC) includes a spectrum of conditions from asymptomatic diverticulosis to symptomatic uncomplicated diverticulosis, segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis, and acute diverticulitis without or with complications that may have serious consequences. Clinical and scientific interest in DDC is increasing because of the rising incidence of all conditions within the DDC spectrum, a better, although still limited understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved; the increasing socioeconomic burden; and the new therapeutic options being tested. The goals of treatment in DDC are symptom and inflammation relief and preventing disease progression or recurrence. The basis for preventing disease progression remains a high-fiber diet and physical exercise, although evidence is poor. Other current strategies do not meet expectations or lack a solid mechanistic foundation; these strategies include modulation of gut microbiota or dysbiosis with rifaximin or probiotics, or using mesalazine for low-grade inflammation in uncomplicated symptomatic diverticulosis. Most acute diverticulitis is uncomplicated, and the trend is to avoid hospitalization and unnecessary antibiotic therapy, but patients with comorbidities, sepsis, or immunodeficiency should receive broad spectrum and appropriate antibiotics. Complicated acute diverticulitis may require interventional radiology or surgery, although the best surgical approach (open versus laparoscopic) remains a matter of discussion. Prevention of acute diverticulitis recurrence remains undefined, as do therapeutic strategies. Mesalazine with or without probiotics has failed to prevent diverticulitis recurrence, whereas new studies are needed to validate preliminary positive results with rifaximin. Surgery is another option, but the number of acute events cannot guide this indication. We need to identify risk factors and disease progression or recurrence mechanisms to implement appropriate preventive strategies.

### Diverticular disease as a chronic illness: evolving epidemiologic and clinical insights [^fcf1b3ea]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease imposes a significant burden on Western and industrialized societies. The traditional pathogenesis model posits that low dietary fiber predisposes to diverticulosis, and fecalith obstruction prompts acute diverticulitis that is managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics or surgery. However, a growing body of knowledge is shifting the paradigm of diverticular disease from an acute surgical illness to a chronic bowel disorder composed of recurrent abdominal symptoms and considerable psychosocial impact. New research implicates a role for low-grade inflammation, sensory-motor nerve damage, and dysbiosis in a clinical picture that mimics irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and even inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Far from being an isolated event, acute diverticulitis may be the catalyst for chronic symptoms including abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and "post-diverticulitis IBS". In addition, studies reveal lower health-related quality of life in patients with chronic diverticular disease vs. controls. Health-care providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for the multifaceted presentations of diverticular disease, and remain aware that it might contribute to long-term emotional distress beyond traditional diverticulitis attacks. These developments are prompting a shift in therapeutic approaches from widespread antimicrobials and supportive care to the use of probiotics, mesalamine, and gut-directed antibiotics. This review addresses the emerging literature regarding epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of chronic, symptomatic diverticular disease, and provides current answers to common clinical questions.

### New strategies for the management of diverticular disease: insights for the clinician [^359e500b]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Diverticulosis is one of the most common gastrointestinal conditions affecting the general population in the Western world. It is estimated that over 2.5 million people are affected by diverticular disease in the United States. The spectrum of clinical manifestations of diverticulosis ranges from asymptomatic diverticulosis to complicated diverticulitis. Treatment for symptomatic diverticular disease is largely based on symptoms. Traditional therapy includes fiber, bowel rest, antibiotics, pain control and surgery for selected cases. This review discusses recent advances in the medical treatment of diverticular disease such as the use of mesalamine, rifaximin and probiotics as our understanding of the disease evolves.

Diverticulosis is a common gastrointestinal condition defined by the presence of diverticula, small mucosal pouches that protrude from the colonic wall by sliding into the loci minorae resistentiae. While largely asymptomatic, approximately 25% of patients develop symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD), characterized by recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits. Overall, SUDD has a relevant negative impact on patients' quality of life.

Epidemiological studies reported an increasing incidence of diverticular disease, particularly in Western countries. The role of diet in diverticula formation has been widely suggested, as supported by the observation that the typical Western diet is characterized by low fiber content. The pathophysiology of SUDD is only partially defined, and apart from diet, genetic predisposition, low‐grade inflammation, and alterations in the gut microbiota have all been reported to be involved.

In this context, the role of dietary fiber remains a critical area of research, with evidence suggesting that increased fiber intake may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms and progression to diverticulitis. The present narrative review, therefore, aims to update the current evidence of the role of diet in the development and management of patients with SUDD with a focus on dietary fiber and emerging evidence about polyphenols.

### Diverticulosis today: unfashionable and still under-researched [^32ffd8bf]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Diverticulosis of the colon is a widespread disease, and its prevalence is increasing especially in the developing world. The underlying pathological mechanisms that cause the formation of colonic diverticula remain unclear but are likely to be the result of complex interactions among age, diet, genetic factors, colonic motility, and changes in colonic structure. The large majority of patients remain asymptomatic throughout their life, one fifth of them become symptomatic (developing the so-called 'diverticular disease') while only a minority of these will develop acute diverticulitis. The factors predicting the development of symptoms remain to be identified. Again, it is generally recognized that diverticular disease occurrence is probably related to complex interactions among colonic motility, diet, lifestyle, and genetic features. Changes in intestinal microflora due to low-fiber diet and consequent low-grade inflammation are thought to be one of the mechanisms responsible for symptoms occurrence of both diverticular disease and acute diverticulitis. Current therapeutic approaches with rifaximin and mesalazine to treat the symptoms seem to be promising. Antibiotic treatment is currently advised only in acute complicated diverticulitis, and no treatment has currently proven effective in preventing the recurrence of acute diverticulitis. Further studies are required in order to clarify the reasons why diverticulosis occurs and the factors triggering occurrence of symptoms. Moreover, the reasons why rifaximin and mesalazine work in symptomatic diverticular disease but not in acute diverticulitis are yet to be elucidated.

### Diverticular disease of the colon: news from imaging [^0e103698]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Different scenarios embrace computed tomography imaging and diverticula, including asymptomatic (diverticulosis) and symptomatic patients (acute diverticulitis, follow-up of acute diverticulitis, chronic diverticulitis). If the role of computed tomography is validated and widely supported by evidence in case of acute diverticulitis, this is not the case of patients in their follow-up for acute diverticulitis or with symptoms related to diverticula, but without acute inflammation. In these settings, computed tomography colonography is gaining consensus as the preferred radiologic test.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^861a6553]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Sigmoid or left‐sided diverticulosis (hereafter termed "diverticulosis") refers the presence of false diverticula of the colon. Diverticulosis affects 60% of the U.S. population by age 60. Most individuals with diverticulosis are asymptomatic, however, 10%–25% develop symptoms ranging from minor abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits to severe pain, sepsis, or diverticular bleeding. This review will focus specifically on diverticulitis, defined as inflammation centered on the diverticular orifices. The majority (85%) of individuals with diverticulitis develop uncomplicated disease while the remaining 15% experience disease complicated by abscess, fistula, obstruction, or perforation.

Among gastrointestinal diagnoses, diverticulitis is the sixth most common cause of hospital admissions and 11th most common cause of non‐malignant deaths in the United States. The overall incidence of diverticulitis is increasing, driven in part by the aging population in the United States. Diverticulitis increases with age, as does the number of diverticulitis related Emergency Department visits. Diverticulitis is the fourth most common cause for emergency surgery in older adults. Older adults with diverticulitis are at higher risk of in‐hospital mortality and complications of diverticulitis and resulting surgical treatments than younger patients.

Treatment strategies for diverticulitis include observation, medical management, elective surgery, and emergency surgery. Treatment decisions for older adults require weighing symptom severity, impact on quality of life, and risks associated with intervention and non‐intervention. The data supporting optimal management of older adults is sparse and the variable presentation and differing outcomes among older adults support a nuanced approach to diagnosis and management. Recent European multi‐society guidelines for the care of older adults with diverticulitis establish a foundation for unique considerations in this population. Relevant literature was identified via pub med and embase. Articles were selected based on review of their abstracts, which indicated that they were original articles or practice guidelines relevant to diagnosis or management of diverticulitis in older adults or age‐related outcomes related to diverticulitis. This review aims to provide clinically relevant context and recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of diverticulitis in older adults.

### Management of colonic diverticular disease in the third millennium: highlights from a symposium held during the United European Gastroenterology week 2017 [^e5ddcd8a]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

In gastroenterology, as in other medical specialties, new potential therapies, both pharmaceutical and invasive, continually appear on the horizon, often with great initial enthusiasm. Over time, these will either prove to be failures or will find their appropriate level of acceptance in our therapeutic armamentarium. When faced with promising new therapies, we should always wonder whether they are effective and safe and whether they are really better than the current ones. One is, therefore, justified to attempt, from time to time, a critical review of the recent developments in the field in order to provide a glimpse of what may lie ahead. This symposium has been specifically designed to critically evaluate the management of diverticular disease in the third millennium.

Diverticulosis is a common anatomical condition and, as our populations age, its prevalence is steadily increasing. Recent studieshave shown that the presence of diverticula represents the most common non-neoplastic finding during screening colonoscopy (Figure 1). Among patients with diverticulosis, 15–25% are expected to develop diverticulitis in their lifetime, although a recent study suggests that this proportion may be much lower (i.e. < 5%). Thus, diverticular disease is a challenge for both diagnosis and treatment in the daily clinical practice and represents a significant burden for healthcare systems.

Figure 1.
Most common non-neoplastic findings at screening colonoscopy (data from Bevan et al.).

IBD, inflammatory bowel disease.

The spectrum of diverticular disease is wide, covering different clinical scenarios, each characterized by different symptomatology, severity and outcomes. The pathogenesis of chronic symptoms as well as the link between uncomplicated diverticulosis and symptoms are complex and still not fully understood. However, low-grade inflammation, driven by bacteria-induced immune activation, could be involved in the pathophysiology of symptoms (Figure 2). The recent clear demonstration of gut microbiota alterations in this conditionhas expanded the therapeutic armamentarium to include gut-selective antibioticsand anti-inflammatory drugs, albeit more research is needed to establish the optimal regimen (daily dose and duration) of therapy. The use of probioticsfurther extends the so-called 'microbiota-directed therapies', despite evidence of their efficacy still being low.

The statements produced by the Chairmen of the 2nd International Symposium on Diverticular Disease, held in Rome on April 8th to 9th, 2016, are reported. Topics such as epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, medical and surgical treatment of diverticular disease in patients with uncomplicated and complicated diverticular disease were reviewed by the Chairmen who proposed 41 statements graded according to level of evidence and strength of recommendation. Each topic was explored focusing on the more relevant clinical questions. The vote was conducted on a 6-point scale and consensus was defined a priori as 67% agreement of the participants. The voting group consisted of 80 physicians from 6 countries, and agreement with all statements was provided. Comments were added explaining some controversial areas.

### Diverticulitis: when and how to operate? [^b66c83ab]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2004). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease, and particularly diverticulitis, has increasing incidence in industrialised countries. Diverticular disease can be classified as symptomatic uncomplicated disease, recurrent symptomatic disease, and complicated disease. Conservative or medical management is usually indicated for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Indications for surgery include recurrent attacks and complications of the disease. Surgical treatment options have changed considerably over the years along with the inventions of new diagnostic tools and new surgical therapeutic approaches. Indications and timing for surgery of diverticular disease are determined mainly by the stage of the disease. In addition to this major factor, the individual risk factors of the patient along with the course of the disease after conservative or operative therapy do play a big role in decision-making and treatment of this disease. In this context, the purpose of this article is to review the surgical treatment of diverticulitis with regard to indications, timeliness of operative intervention, operative options and techniques, and special circumstances.

### Editorial: new thoughts on the association between diverticulosis and irritable bowel syndrome [^791e6c0f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

As our population ages it is increasingly common to encounter patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms and diverticulosis, but the nature of the association is obscure. This Editorial discusses the paper from Japan showing an association between IBS-like symptoms and left-sided but not right-sided diverticulosis. The left colon with its higher motor activity is more likely to be associated with complications of diverticulosis, including perforation and abscess formation. The underlying pathophysiology of the syndrome of post-diverticulitis IBS is discussed and clinical markers of centrally driven symptoms suggested as a means to avoid ineffective colonic resections in those with IBS-like diverticular disease.

### Diverticular disease associated with inflammatory bowel disease-like colitis: a systematic review [^013b1b9d]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Diverticular-associated colitis significantly overlaps clinically with primary inflammatory bowel disease. However, the clinical and the pathologic features of diverticular-associated colitis suggest that it is a distinct clinical entity.

Methods

We performed a systematic review by use of multiple health care databases and gray literature, following predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine the clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic features of diverticular-associated colitis, and recurrence rates following medical and surgical treatment.

Results

Two hundred twenty-seven participants were selected from 18 eligible studies, including our own patients (n = 13). The average age of disease onset was 64 years. The typical symptoms included tenesmus, hematochezia, and diarrhea. One hundred sixty-three of the 227 patients in these studies were classified as having diverticular-associated colitis, of which 142 were managed medically. Twenty-eight patients eventually required an operation. One-quarter (37 of 163) of the patients had recurrence of symptoms with an average follow-up time of three years.

Conclusions

Diverticular-associated colitis is a distinct entity that presents with segmental colitis and a variety of clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic features. Diverticular-associated colitis should be considered in the presence of recurrent symptoms after resection for diverticulitis.

Concluding remarks

From honing in on specific dietary and genetic associations to refining surgical techniques, the complex landscape of diverticulitis is ever-changing. At a glance, there are more publications on quality of life and cost-effectiveness outcomes. These matters are particularly important as we attempt to become less aggressive in our care, so that we do not inadvertently promote chronic symptoms and recurrent disease in the name of "doing less". Patterns of treatment and societal guidelines remain significantly heterogeneous worldwide. We look forward to the longer-term results of trials from the last decade and ongoing innovation in the field.

### Uncomplicated diverticulosis is not associated with abdominal pain or abnormal bowel habit – A population-based Swedish cohort study [^cedcd675]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Whether individuals with diverticulosis without any complications have increased abdominal pain is unclear and real time diary‐based studies are lacking.
In our results individuals with diverticulosis do not have more abdominal pain than those without diverticulosis nor do they have different bowel habits.
Thus diverticulosis does not explain abdominal pain or changes in bowel habits.

### Development and validation of a diverticular clinical score for symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease after acute diverticulitis in a prospective patient cohort [^f35747d0]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diverticulosis of the colon is a common condition in western societies; by the age of 85 years two-thirds of the population in western countries will have developed colonic diverticula. While most patients remain asymptomatic, a minor portion will suffer from diverticular disease, most commonly acute diverticulitis (AD) occurring in 10–25% of the patients – or even less (up to 4% according to recent literature). In most patients, the disease course is mild, and does not recur.

However, a substantial group of patients that experienced AD continue to suffer from recurrent abdominal pain, change of bowel habits and bloating in the absence of overt inflammation. This specific patient subgroup is defined as suffering from symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) after AD. This entity was recently defined by the International Consensus on Diverticulosis and Diverticular Diseaseas chronic inflammatory disease with prolonged chronic symptoms, high levels of systemic serum inflammatory markers, high levels of tissue inflammatory cytokine and chronic inflammatory infiltrates in the affected colonic tissue. Recent data suggest a prolonged subclinical inflammatory process as the underlying mechanism for post-AD SUDD. Patients with SUDD were found to have increased levels of fecal calprotectin, elevated expression of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β, and increased numbers of lymphocytes and lymphocyte aggregates in the affected mucosa. Moreover, several clinical studies demonstrated clinical improvement using anti-inflammatory therapies, such as 5 aminosalicylic acid or treatments modulating bacterial–mucosal crosstalk, such as rifaximin and probiotics. –

However, despite its often-prolonged relapsing–remitting course, a major gap in the study of SUDD is the absence of a validated clinical symptom score. Recent guidance from regulatory bodies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) underscores the importance of patient reported outcomes (PROs) in assessment of disease status and response to therapy. The absence of validated standardized score of patient-reported clinical symptoms undermines the interpretation of different observational studies in the field of diverticular disease and hampers the conductance of clinical trials.

The present study aimed to develop a validated score for clinical symptoms associated with post-AD SUDD that will enable physicians to evaluate disease severity and its impact on patients' quality of life (QoL) and ultimately contribute to future clinical research in the field of diverticula-associated disease.

### Diverticular disease: reconsidering conventional wisdom [^51c0be64]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Colonic diverticula are common in developed countries and complications of colonic diverticulosis are responsible for a significant burden of disease. Several recent publications have called into question long-held beliefs about diverticular disease. Contrary to conventional wisdom, studies have not shown that a high-fiber diet protects against asymptomatic diverticulosis. The risk of developing diverticulitis among individuals with diverticulosis is lower than the 10% to 25% proportion that commonly is quoted, and may be as low as 1% over 11 years. Nuts and seeds do not increase the risk of diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding. It is unclear whether diverticulosis, absent diverticulitis, or overt colitis is responsible for chronic gastrointestinal symptoms or worse quality of life. The role of antibiotics in acute diverticulitis has been challenged by a large randomized trial that showed no benefit in selected patients. The decision to perform elective surgery should be made on a case-by-case basis and not routinely after a second episode of diverticulitis, when there has been a complication, or in young people. A colonoscopy should be performed to exclude colon cancer after an attack of acute diverticulitis but may not alter outcomes among individuals who have had a colonoscopy before the attack. Given these surprising findings, it is time to reconsider conventional wisdom about diverticular disease.

### Diverticular disease of the colon [^69922457]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Colonic diverticulosis refers to small outpouchings from the colonic lumen due to mucosal herniation through the colonic wall at sites of vascular perforation. Abnormal colonic motility and inadequate intake of dietary fibre have been implicated in its pathogenesis. This acquired abnormality is typically found in developed countries, and its prevalence rises with age. Most patients affected will remain entirely asymptomatic; however, 10–20% of those affected can manifest clinical syndromes, mainly diverticulitis and diverticular haemorrhage. As our elderly population grows, we can anticipate a concomitant rise in the number of patients with diverticular disease. Here, we review the incidence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of diverticular disease of the colon and its complications.

### Diverticular disease and colorectal cancer: incidental diagnosis or real association? Final answer [^f7c9da49]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Associations between diverticular disease of the colon and the colorectal cancer has been studied for > 60 years. Observational, cross-sectional, and case-control studies as well as large population-based studies gave conflicting results and association was not fully proven. Obtaining the proof was difficult because both diseases share similar clinical characteristics, both increase with age, and both involve similar dietary factors. Long-term observations are difficult as diagnostic methods changed over time from barium enema 50 to 60 years ago, through endoscopy, up to CT and MR in recent years. Cancer or adenomas may be missed within diverticular segment; diverticula may be underreported in patients with colon cancer diagnosis. Most recent 2 large cohort studies have solved the dilemma. These studies have clearly shown that diverticular disease does not increase the risk of colon cancer after the first year of diagnosis. Within the first year of diagnosis the association is strong, most probably due to difficulties with differential diagnosis and misclassifications and shared symptoms. Findings of these studies have led to the conclusion that colon cancer has to be excluded using modern techniques after the first episode of suspected diverticulitis.

### Diverticular disease in the primary care setting [^fd4b7261]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease is a chronic and common condition, and yet the impact of diverticular disease in primary care is largely unknown. The diagnosis of diverticular disease relies on the demonstration of diverticula in the colon, and the necessary investigations are often not available in primary care. The specificity and sensitivity of symptoms, clinical signs and laboratory tests alone are generally low and consequently the diagnostic process will be characterized by uncertainty. Also, the criteria for symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease in the absence of macroscopic inflammation are not clearly defined. Therefore both the prevalence of diverticular disease and the incidence of diverticulitis in primary care are unknown. Current recommendations for treatment and follow-up of patients with acute diverticulitis are based on studies where the diagnosis has been verified by computerized tomography. The results cannot be directly transferred to primary care where the diagnosis has to rely on the interpretation of symptoms and signs. Therefore, one must allow for greater diagnostic uncertainty, and safety netting in the event of unexpected development of the condition is an important aspect of the management of diverticulitis in primary care. The highest prevalence of diverticular disease is found among older patients, where multimorbidity and polypharmacy is common. The challenge is to remember the possible contribution of diverticular disease to the patient's overall condition and to foresee its implications in terms of advice and treatment in relation to other diseases.

### Diverticular disease in the elderly [^04106b03]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease is common among the elderly. Because of the advanced age and muted symptoms and signs of many of those affected, diagnosis can be difficult. Consequently, great demands are placed on the physician to diagnose and treat clinically evident diverticular disease. Endoscopic, radiologic, and surgical advances have increased the availability of more definitive therapies for patients with complicated diverticular disease and diverticular hemorrhage.

Clinical presentation of DDC and therapeutic management

Most patients with colonic diverticula have no symptoms; however, it has been estimated that 20% of patients with diverticulosis develop symptoms such as abdominal pain, malaise, swelling, and alteration of bowel habits, which are often difficult to differentiate from functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. A recent report outlines the main features that could help differentiate the conditions (Table 1).

Table 1.
Clinical and biochemical characteristics for the differential diagnosis between SUDD and IBS.

Symptomatic DDC includes a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and entities, ranging from symptomatic diverticular disease without complications to patients with diverticula who present with segmental colitis, colonic diverticular hemorrhage, and AD. Very often, symptoms are recurrent (in all their spectrum of clinical conditions) and alternate with periods of apparent clinical silence. Several studies have concluded that even mild symptomatic DDC has a negative impact and affects quality of life compared with control populations. This impact has recently been validated in a new test (DV-QoL) designed specifically to assess the quality of life in patients with diverticular disease, showing a broad spectrum of negative psychological, social, and physical effects in these patients. In a recent study, Carabotti and colleagues analyzed QoL scores in an Italian cohort of 1217 patients with diverticulosis. They found significantly higher physical and mental component scores in asymptomatic patients with diverticulosis in comparison to patients with SUDD or patients who had a previous episode of diverticulitis. No differences were found between these last two groups, which reinforces the negative impact of this entity on the quality of life of patients.

Overall, the goals of treatment of the different forms of diverticular disease are focused on alleviating symptoms and preventing progression, major complications, and recurrence.

### Health-related quality of life and functional disorders after diverticular surgery [^a9e5f93e]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colon diverticulosis and diverticulitis are common diseases affecting patients in developed countries and remain a frequent indication for colorectal surgery. Only 5% of the population younger than 40 years are affected by diverticular disease, whereas this number rises to up to 65% among individuals older than 65 years. The number of patients treated for diverticulitis has been increasing in the last decades in parallel with increasing age in Western populations.

Most patients with diverticulosis remain asymptomatic and only a subset of about 10–20% of patients will develop symptoms of diverticulitis, such as left-sided abdominal pain, fever, chills or altered stool frequency. Although diverticulitis has an increased risk of recurrence, complicated courses after recovery from an uncomplicated episode are rare and do not seem to be influenced by younger age or two or more previous episodes. However, chronic symptoms were found to persist in 5–22% of patients despite uneventful surgical resection. Thus, recommendations for elective surgical treatment of diverticulitis have been shifting from a strict scheme based on the number of previous attacks to a more personalized patient-based approach, considering multiple parameters, such as burden of disease, patient preference, ongoing symptoms and predicted health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after surgery.

When balancing the risks and benefits of elective diverticular surgery, considerations regarding long-term outcomes are crucial. Therefore, the aim of this literature review was to summarize available evidence on postoperative HRQoL, functional disorders and pain after diverticular surgery for diverticulitis or symptomatic diverticulosis.

### Progress and challenges in the management of diverticular disease: which treatment? [^a7c36809]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The role of colonoscopy

Based on expert opinion, all international guidelines recommend colonoscopy 4–8 weeks following an episode of AD for colorectal cancer exclusion. It is estimated that these recommendations would detect about 15 colorectal cancers per 1000 patients tested and 38 advanced adenomas after an episode of AD, with 0.8 colonic perforations per 1000 patients when the colonoscopy is performed within 7 days after the episode. Some retrospective studies – and a systematic reviewhave called into question this clinical practice. Recent data suggest that the most effective strategy would be to perform a colonoscopy on patients with suspicious malignancy on CT or persistent symptoms after an AD episode. Unfortunately, no quality data regarding this question are available, and more studies are necessary to make a definitive statement. In any case, the need for colonoscopy to rule out the presence of an underlying colorectal cancer raises the question on the potential association between diverticular disease and colorectal cancer based on common risk factors. Available data show no significant increase in colorectal cancer after the first year of follow up, with an increased risk within the first 12 months after diagnosis probably due to surveillance and misclassification in the first place.

### Emergency medicine updates: acute diverticulitis [^b10aebbb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute diverticulitis is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department (ED). Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this disease.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning acute diverticulitis for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Diverticulitis is a complication of diverticulosis and most commonly affects the sigmoid and descending colon in Western countries. History and examination can suggest the diagnosis, with abdominal pain and tenderness in the left lower quadrant being the most common symptom and sign, respectively. Change in bowel habits and fever may also occur. Laboratory testing may demonstrate leukocytosis or an elevated C-reactive protein. Imaging options can include computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound (US), though most classification systems for diverticulitis incorporate CT findings. While the majority of diverticulitis cases are uncomplicated, complications may affect up to 25% of patients. Treatment of complicated diverticulitis requires antibiotics and surgical consultation. Antibiotics are not required in select patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Appropriate patients for supportive care without antibiotics should be well-appearing, have pain adequately controlled, be able to tolerate oral intake, be able to follow up, have no complications, and have no immunocompromise or severe comorbidities.

Conclusions

An understanding of literature updates can improve the ED care of patients with acute diverticulitis.

### Management of colonic diverticular disease in the third millennium: highlights from a symposium held during the United European Gastroenterology week 2017 [^4238cd53]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Diverticulosis is a common anatomical condition, which appears to be age-dependent. Individuals who develop chronic gastrointestinal symptoms or complications are referred to as having diverticular disease. Although the diagnosis of this condition can be relatively straightforward, randomized controlled trials are scarce and management often follows tradition rather than principles of evidence-based medicine. This report deals with the topics discussed during a symposium held during the United European Gastroenterology Week (Barcelona, October 2017). During the meeting, the role of dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of diverticular disease and its treatment were thoroughly discussed, by examining the efficacy and mechanisms of action of the currently used drugs. Recent studies have shown the presence of dysbiosis in patients with diverticular disease and suggest an imbalance in favor of bacteria with pro-inflammatory and pathogenetic potential. These microbiota changes correlate with mucosal immune activation, mirrored by a marked increase of macrophages in colonic mucosa, both in the diverticular region and at distant sites. The low-grade inflammation, driven by bacteria-induced immune activation, could be involved in the pathophysiology of symptoms. As a consequence, pharmacological approaches targeting enteric bacteria (with poorly absorbed antibiotics, like rifaximin, or probiotics) or intestinal inflammation (with 5-ASA derivatives or rifaximin) have shown capability of controlling symptoms and also preventing complications, albeit more research is needed to establish the optimal regimen (daily dose and duration) of therapy. Well-designed randomized-controlled trials (RCTs), including homogeneous populations of patients, are therefore needed. The future of management of many GI diseases, including symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease, will rely on the so-called 'microbiota-directed therapies'.

### Case series: diverticulitis in the young [^93839b1c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Diverticulitis has long been regarded as a disease of the elderly, but its incidence has been increasing in those under age 40. Younger patients with diverticulitis are more likely to be male and obese. They often have atypical presentations, and 25% may have right lower quadrant pain. Not surprisingly, the condition is often misdiagnosed, resulting in unnecessary surgery. An abdominal CT scan is the modality of choice for diagnosis, but the most important diagnostic step is simply to include diverticulitis on the differential diagnosis of a young person with lower abdominal pain.

3 Diagnosis

Patients with diverticulitis typically present with abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, nausea, and low‐grade fevers. Diagnosis and management hinges upon distinguishing uncomplicated from complicated disease. Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is defined as isolated colonic inflammation in the setting of diverticulosis. Complicated diverticulitis encompasses a spectrum of disease from microperforation (localized specks of extraluminal air) to free perforation with stool throughout the abdomen (feculent peritonitis). Abscess, stricture, and fistula are also considered complicated disease. Patients with complicated diverticulitis may present with more severe systemic symptoms, peritonitis, obstruction (secondary to strictures), or symptomatic fistulae (pneumaturia, urosepsis, feculent vaginal discharge), although these findings may be more subtle in older adults as discussed below. Complicated diverticulitis is diagnosed based on symptoms and cross‐sectional CT imaging (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1
Example CT images of various presentations of complicated diverticulitis. (A) Diverticular abscess. (B) Colovesical fistula. (C) Free air secondary to perforation. (D) Sigmoid stricture.

Accurate and timely diagnosis of diverticulitis in older adults can be challenging due to age‐related physiologic changes, multimorbidity, and atypical clinical presentations. Symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, altered bowel habits, and signs of systemic inflammation may be less pronounced, leading to underdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Patients 80 years and older with acute diverticulitis are less likely to experience abdominal pain and fever, and more likely to present with atypical symptoms, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, chest pain, syncope, or fatigue. Older adults are also less likely to develop leukocytosis than their younger counterparts.

### The natural history of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease: a long-term follow-up study [^91f099a5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although colonic diverticulosis is the most frequent anatomical alteration detected during colonoscopy, only a minority of people who have diverticulosis may show symptoms linked to diverticula, developing the so-called "diverticular disease" (DD). Symptomatic uncomplicated DD (SUDD) of the colon is the main form of DD. It is characterized by moderate-to-severe left-lower quadrant pain, lasting more than 24 h, not fulfilling the criteria for a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and is associated with raised levels of fecal calprotectin, and fecal microbiota imbalance. It is estimated that about one fifth of people who have diverticulosis develop SUDD, and that patients with SUDD have a wide range of psychological, social, and physical complaints, which impair their quality of life (QoL).

However, while we know enough about the natural history of diverticulosis in terms of the risk of acute diverticulitis, our knowledge of the natural history of SUDD is limited. In particular, current follow-up studies, both retrospective and prospective, used a non-standardized definition of SUDD, with a follow up no longer than 5 years, while the long-term risk of acute diverticulitis occurrence or need for surgery remains unknown. Moreover, there are insufficient data concerning QoL in the long-term follow up in these patients. One possible explanation is that these symptoms are often confused with IBS. The aim of the present study was to assess the outcome of a cohort of SUDD patients during a long-term follow up.

### Myths and evidences in diverticular disease [^6dcb4d4d]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease is a very common entity affecting the elders, but also a few people in the young age group. Most patients are asymptomatic, but about 30% of them will have abdominal complaints. As the pathophysiology of diverticular disease has changed since its description, we address some important points about the disease. Recent knowledge has changed the way we treat the patients with diverticular disease: conservatively or surgically.

### Symptomatic diverticulosis is characterized by loose stools [^1e720287]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease is considered to be a discreet clinical entity distinct from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but population-based data are unavailable. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and location of diverticulosis in the general population, and its association with colonic symptoms and mental health. We propose that individuals with diverticulosis would report more constipation and IBS.

Methods

We performed a population-based study of randomly selected adults born in Sweden (age, 18–70 y; 57.2% women); 745 received a gastroenterology consultation, completed validated abdominal symptom and mental health questionnaires, and were examined by colonoscopy. Logistic regression was used to calculate the associations between diverticulosis and age, sex, gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety, depression, and self-rated health.

Results

Among the 742 participants (54.6% women), 130 (17.5%) had diverticulosis. Age was the strongest predictor of diverticulosis (P < .001), and diverticulosis was rare in participants younger than 40 years (0.7%). All participants with diverticulosis had sigmoid involvement. Participants with diverticulosis were more likely to report loose stools (odds ratio [OR], 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20–2.96), urgency (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.02–2.63), passing mucus (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.08–4.72), and a high stool frequency (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.11–3.65). Diverticulosis was associated with abdominal pain (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.01–4.36; P = 0.047) and diarrhea-predominant IBS (OR, 9.55; 95% CI, 1.08–84.08; P = 0.04) in participants older than 60 years. The presence of anxiety and depression and self-rated health were similar in participants with and without diverticulosis.

Conclusions

The prevalence of diverticulosis is age-dependent. Diverticulosis is associated with diarrhea in subjects across all age ranges. In subjects older than age 60, diverticulosis is associated with abdominal pain and diarrhea-predominant IBS.

### Irritable bowel syndrome and colonic diverticular disease: overlapping symptoms and overlapping therapeutic approaches [^3a9357f2]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common symptomatic disorder in the Western world and colonic diverticula are also prevalent; however, relationships between IBS-type symptoms and diverticula have been a source of much debate. Our goal was to reassess these relationships in the light of new data.

Recent Findings

On removing from consideration clinical scenarios which are directly related to diverticula (i.e., diverticulitis, diverticular hemorrhage, and complications of diverticulitis, such as stricture and fistula), relationships between IBS and diverticula can be seen to revolve around a number of questions. First, are IBS and symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) the same condition? Or, in other words is SUDD no more than IBS in an individual who just happens to have diverticula? Although coincident IBS and diverticula inevitably do occur there is some evidence to indicate that SUDD may be somewhat distinctive with SUDD being characterized by more frequent and severe pain. Second, and analogous to interactions between IBS and inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease, can an episode of acute diverticulitis lead to the de novo development of IBS? There is now epidemiological and pathophysiological evidence to support this occurrence.

Summary

Although relationships between uncomplicated diverticular disease and IBS have been reexamined their status remains unclear. As yet, however, none of the newer concepts related to this relationship have led to new therapeutic approaches in IBS or diverticular disease.

### Changing views on diverticular disease: impact of aging, obesity, diet, and microbiota [^533ccba6]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2015). Low credibility.

The development of colonic diverticulosis is a common aging change in industrialized nations. While most patients have asymptomatic diverticulosis, around one in five develops symptomatic diverticular disease. This is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and disturbed bowel habit. Some of the pain episodes are prolonged and are due to acute diverticulitis, which itself may be complicated by abscess, perforation, fistulation, or stricture formation. Risk factors favouring the development of symptomatic diverticular disease include obesity, smoking and diets low in fiber but high in red meat and animal fat. What determines the transition from asymptomatic diverticulosis to symptomatic diverticular disease is unclear but neuromuscular changes following acute diverticulitis may be responsible in some cases. The severity of symptoms generated depends on cerebral pain processing which is influenced by psychosocial factors. These are important considerations in deciding optimal patient management. Prior theories of the cause of diverticulosis suggested that constipation was an important cause, but new data challenge this and has provoked new ideas. Underlying mechanisms causing diverticulosis include weakening of the colonic wall and/or degenerative changes in the enteric nerves. Dietary induced changes in microbiota and the host inflammatory response may underlie the subsequent development of acute/chronic diverticulitis and its sequela.

### Uncomplicated diverticulosis is not associated with abdominal pain or abnormal bowel habit – A population-based Swedish cohort study [^7c4c817b]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Whether uncomplicated diverticulosis gives rise to symptoms is controversial. Diary‐based studies of abdominal pain and stool habits in general populations are scarce, and we therefore investigated symptom patterns in diverticulosis from prospectively collected symptom diaries in a random sample of the general population who completed a research colonoscopy.

Methods

In the Swedish population‐based colonoscopy (PopCol) study, 745 individuals from the general population underwent a colonoscopy of which 130 had diverticulosis, and none had diverticulitis. Seven‐day symptom diaries were completed by 258 participants (age 54, women 64%) of which 50 had diverticulosis. The frequency and location of abdominal pain, bowel habit and other gastrointestinal symptoms were compared between individuals with and without diverticulosis using logistic regression.

Key Results

Diverticulosis was not associated with abdominal pain (OR 1.24, CI 0.61–2.55) or left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain (OR 1.59, CI 0.73–3.49). Pain duration and severity were not associated with diverticulosis. When individuals with diverticulosis had pain, it was more often in the LLQ (OR 2.45, CI 1.02–5.86) compared with those without diverticulosis. Diverticulosis was not linked to altered bowel habits. Irritable bowel syndrome prevalence was 16% in the diverticulosis group and 19% in the non‐diverticulosis group.

Conclusions and Inferences

Participants with diverticulosis did not report more abdominal pain or more LLQ abdominal pain than participants without diverticulosis. Bowel habit was not abnormal in diverticulosis. Our results do not support that uncomplicated diverticulosis cause symptoms in individuals without a history of acute diverticulitis.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^81bf06c8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Diverticulitis is a common gastrointestinal disease that still garners significant attention and study because of its heterogeneity in presentation and outcome. We provide a review of the newest and most controversial topics in diverticulitis. Recent discoveries on the influence of diet and other environmental risk factors are discussed, showing how the epidemiology of the disease process is shifting away from what was previously felt to be a disorder primarily limited to older western populations. Interestingly, as has long been suspected, genetic mutations and variations associated with the development of diverticulitis are being discovered and are summarized here. The data for non-operative and outpatient management of diverticulitis are reviewed, as are pharmacologic agents studied for use in the secondary prevention of diverticulitis. Lastly, we present controversies in the surgical treatment of diverticulitis. This review will provide a synopsis of the last 5 years of literature relating to diverticulitis.

### Diverticular disease: diagnosis and treatment [^c33fdfba]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease refers to symptomatic and asymptomatic disease with an underlying pathology of colonic diverticula. Predisposing factors for the formation of diverticula include a low-fiber diet and physical inactivity. Approximately 85 percent of patients with diverticula are believed to remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic disease without inflammation is a diagnosis of exclusion requiring colonoscopy because imaging studies cannot discern the significance of diverticula. Fiber supplementation may prevent progression to symptomatic disease or improve symptoms in patients without inflammation. Computed tomography is recommended for diagnosis when inflammation is present. Antibiotic therapy aimed at anaerobes and gram-negative rods is first-line treatment for diverticulitis. Whether treatment is administered on an inpatient or outpatient basis is determined by the clinical status of the patient and his or her ability to tolerate oral intake. Surgical consultation is indicated for disease that does not respond to medical management or for repeated attacks that may be less likely to respond to medical therapy and have a higher mortality rate. Prompt surgical consultation also should be obtained when there is evidence of abscess formation, fistula formation, obstruction, or free perforation.

### Unmet needs in treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis: a scoping review [^aab82072]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colonic diverticulosis represents one of the most frequent findings during colonoscopyand diverticular disease (DD) represents a common gastrointestinal condition that poses a heavy burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Over 50% of people over the age of 60 and over 60% of people over age 80 have colonic diverticula.

DD encompasses several clinical scenarios, ranging from asymptomatic diverticulosis to symptomatic uncomplicated or complicated DD (i.e. acute diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding). Although most subjects with DD remain asymptomatic for life (diverticulosis), approximately 15% experience chronic, recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain and/or discomfort, alteration of bowel movements, and bloating in the absence of macroscopic signs of colonic inflammation), a condition termed as symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) that may be difficult to differentiate from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In fact, it is a matter of debate whether SUDD could be considered a disease of its own or whether it represents the coexistence of IBS in patients with colonic diverticula. However, the high prevalence of this condition and the significant impact on quality of life require therapies for the relief of chronic symptoms. About 1–4% of DD patients developed acute diverticulitis (e.g. acute symptoms/signs as fever, acute abdominal pain, and leukocytosis) in its uncomplicated or complicated form (with the presence of abscesses, perforation, fistulas, stenosis, or peritonitis), that can recur in approximately one-third of patients.–

Despite the clinical relevance, the high prevalence of DD, and its impact on quality of life, a high degree of uncertainty surrounds the therapeutic approaches for gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in patients with SUDD and primary and secondary prevention of diverticulitis and its consequences.

This scoping review of the literature aims to summarize the current knowledge and discuss the unmet needs regarding the management of SUDD and the prevention of acute diverticulitis.

### Management of colonic diverticular disease in the third millennium: highlights from a symposium held during the United European Gastroenterology week 2017 [^2173f354]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Diverticular bleeding is seen predominantly in older patients, with a peak prevalence in the ninth decade of life. Approximately 10% of patients will experience recurrence at 1 year, although the rate may be much higher in individuals in whom a definite source of bleeding is identified at the time of the initial bleed.

As noted above, a subset of patients with diverticulosis develops chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. After an episode of diverticulitis, the risk of developing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS, whose symptoms overlap those of SUDD) or any functional bowel syndrome is increased. Patients with diverticulosis may also experience SUDD without a prior episode of diverticulitis.

### Progress and challenges in the management of diverticular disease: which treatment? [^6db3dd66]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic DDC

Asymptomatic diverticulosis is usually an incidental finding in patients who undergo colonoscopy or image techniques for other indications. It should be noted that diverticulosis is the most common abnormality on colonoscopy. There is no clear indication for any specific therapy or special follow up in patients with asymptomatic diverticulosis, and no treatment is required. One study found no association between constipation, low-fiber diet, and the presence of colonic diverticulosis. However, prevention of progression of DDC to symptomatic DD is a therapeutic target, and several guidelines include specific recommendations. – Because only a minority of patients with DDC develop symptoms or progress to more severe forms of the disease, it would be of interest to detect the susceptible population. Today, no studies are available that could generate personalized recommendations for people with asymptomatic DDC, but genetic studies or better longitudinal analysis of the microbiome of people who eventually develop symptomatic DDC should be conducted. At present, only a few cross-sectional epidemiological studies have analyzed the microbiome of patients with DDC. As commented above, Barbara and colleaguesreported that the fecal microbiota of patients with colonic diverticulosis show differences in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients. Using mucosal biopsies from the sigmoid colon of 226 patients with and 309 without diverticula during first-time screening colonoscopy, Jones and colleaguesfound few differences among cases and controls and only very weak associations for comparisons of bacterial abundances in phylum Proteobacteria (p = 0.038) and family Comamonadaceae (p = 0.035). They concluded that the mucosal adherent microbiota community composition was unlikely to play a substantial role in the development of diverticulosis. Tursi and colleaguesassessed fecal microbiota from 15 patients with SUDD, 13 with asymptomatic diverticulosis, and 16 healthy controls. Their results also showed that the overall bacterial abundance of dominant species did not differ among the groups, and again only small differences (e.g. higher amount of Akkermansia muciniphila species in patients bearing diverticula compared with controls) of unclear significance were detected.

### Small bowel diverticulitis: an imaging review of an uncommon entity [^5c24752c]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

In this review, we discuss the clinical and radiologic findings of small bowel diverticulosis, which is infrequently encountered during practice and far less common than colonic diverticulosis. Small bowel diverticulosis can present with a range of emergent symptomatic complications including diverticulitis, perforation, or hemorrhage. Here, we focus on the clinical features, pathogenesis, radiologic findings, and treatment of small bowel diverticulitis. Although not routinely considered in the differential diagnosis of an acute abdomen, prospective radiologic diagnosis of small bowel diverticulitis is important and can lead to conservative treatment thus preventing unnecessary exploratory laparotomy.

Purpose Of Review

Symptoms associated with disorders of the motility of colon and rectum are common problems in clinical practice. Advances in this field continue to expand our understanding of these disorders and provide new and different treatments with promising results.

Recent Findings

This article reviews new advances in the past year on the measurement and diagnosis of colonic transit. Recently published data question the importance of dietary fiber in the prevention of colonic diverticulosis and diverticulitis, and support the efficacy of a number of different therapies aimed at improving colonic motility and visceral sensation in constipation and reversing the effects of opioid induced constipation with peripherally acting opioid antagonists.

Summary

The articles referenced in this review help inform the reader on new developments in the diagnosis and management of patients with colonic and rectal motility disorders.

Colonic diverticulitis — whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course; colonoscopy is advised after an episode of complicated diverticulitis and after a first episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis, but can be deferred if a recent (within 1 year) high-quality colonoscopy was performed, and after an acute episode of diverticulitis, colonoscopy should be delayed by 6–8 weeks or until complete resolution of the acute symptoms, whichever is longer, with colonoscopy considered sooner if alarm symptoms are present; patients with recurrent uncomplicated diverticulitis should follow routine colorectal cancer screening and surveillance intervals unless alarm symptoms are present; supporting data include a meta-analysis of 31 studies and 50,445 patients reporting a colon cancer prevalence of 1.9% among patients with diverticulitis, higher in complicated diverticulitis (7.9%) vs uncomplicated (1.3%), with advanced adenomas 4.4% and adenomas 14.2%, and a randomized trial in which 1.2% patients were diagnosed with colon cancer within 3 months of randomization.

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: expert review [^a3fa9f82]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis — conclusions state that colonic diverticulitis is a painful disease that occurs unpredictably; although most patients never experience a perforation or abscess, uncomplicated recurrences are a burden to patients and many worry about recurrence, perforation, and need for surgery. Gastroenterologists can alleviate many of these concerns by making an accurate diagnosis, addressing chronic sequelae, and educating patients on risk factors, prognosis, and indications for surgery. Although the advice in this document is based on low- to moderate-quality evidence, research is ongoing and has the potential to eventually identify better options for diverticulitis treatment and prevention.

### Diverticulitis: a comprehensive review with usual and unusual complications [^2c8aa582]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Besides the usual signs and symptoms, in the course of the diverticular disease, several unusual complications may be seen. Pylephlebitis, perforation, intestinal obstruction, abscess and fistula formation may be counted among the unusual complications. MDCT is a very robust imaging tool for the primary diagnosis of the acute diverticulitis and its usual and unusual complications. Although CT is the most commonly used modality, radiologists should be familiar with US findings as sonography is generally the first preferred imaging study in the emergency department. Radiologists should be cognizant of the complex unusual complications of acute diverticulitis as they may require a multi-disciplinary treatment approach.

### Uncomplicated diverticulosis is not associated with abdominal pain or abnormal bowel habit – A population-based Swedish cohort study [^aa4fca78]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Perry et al. had similar results to ours when they compared 182 individuals with diverticulosis versus 128 without diverticulosis and found no association between diverticulosis and abdominal pain lasting over 24 h. Larger population‐based studies are needed to shed more light on this subject, but such studies are challenging, as the diagnosis of diverticulosis is dependent on endoscopy which is why the current study is unique and important.

The prevalence of diverticulosis and IBS are both high, it is thus likely that these conditions coexist as suggested in a population‐based study by Jung et al. There are some similarities between the two diagnoses, and they may share common pathophysiologic mechanisms, such as visceral hypersensitivity. Our data shows a similar prevalence of IBS and similar odds of abdominal pain among individuals with and without diverticulosis, supporting the theory that pain in uncomplicated diverticulosis may indeed represent IBS. Although IBS status was determined by the gastroenterologist based on the current criteria at that time, there is little reason to think that the revised criteria would change the distribution of IBS between groups, as there was no difference in frequency of pain or stool habits in the diaries. Further, studies comparing Rome criteria (e.g. Rome II vs. Rome III) suggest only small differences in diagnostic accuracy.

Recall bias is a major limitation of retrospective questionnaire collected data. The novelty and strength in this study is the prospectively collected diary data with detailed location of the abdominal pain. This methodology avoids recall bias associated with registration of symptoms retrospectively. We have previously shown that the pattern of symptom reports in diaries show a high reliability over time suggesting 7‐day diaries are sufficient to capture the overall symptom pattern in an individual. It should be noted that the study design does not allow for any conclusions about causality in the association between presence of diverticulosis and pain in the LLQ in participants with pain. Even though it seems unlikely that the pain causes diverticula, the association may be explained by a third factor that is associated with both diverticular disease and LLQ pain in participants reporting pain.

The strength of the study is its population‐based prospective design, and that each individual underwent colonoscopy as well as registering prospectively abdominal symptoms for a whole week, which has not been done elsewhere. In addition, our data collection included registration of the location of the abdominal pain, is lacking in most previous studies. Lastly the present study was population‐based thus minimizing selection bias.

### Management of colonic diverticular disease with poorly absorbed antibiotics and other therapies [^ee44381d]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Colonic diverticular disease is common in Western countries and its prevalence increases with age. The large majority of patients (80–85%) will remain entirely asymptomatic throughout their life. In symptomatic cases, most patients will have diverticulosis without inflammation while the remainder will have diverticulitis with or without complications. About 1–2% will require hospitalization and 0.5% will require surgery. Factors predicting the development of symptoms remain to be identified. However, it is generally recognized that diverticular disease is probably related to complex interactions between colon structure, intestinal motility, diet, and genetic features. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an association between diverticulosis and diets that are low in fiber and high in refined carbohydrates. Although the causes of symptom development are still unclear, it is thought that previous episodes of intestinal inflammation may play a role. Changes in intestinal microflora could be one of the putative mechanisms responsible for low-grade inflammation. In patients with uncomplicated diverticulosis, a diet abundant in fruit and vegetables is recommended. The current therapeutic approaches in preventing recurrence of symptoms are based on nonabsorbable antibiotics, mesalazine, and/or probiotics. Cyclic rifaximin administration seems to be an adequate approach to relieving symptoms and preventing acute diverticulitis in patients with symptomatic diverticulosis.

To conclude, in this study, diverticulosis was not associated with more frequent abdominal pain or LLQ abdominal pain when compared with those without diverticulosis. Bowel habit was not abnormal in diverticulosis. Our results do not support that uncomplicated diverticulosis causes symptoms in individuals without a history of acute diverticulitis.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acute diverticulitis, more specifically with respect to endoscopic follow-up, complicated diverticulitis, AGA 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain a colonoscopy 6–8 weeks after an episode of complicated diverticulitis or once acute symptoms have fully resolved, whichever is longer. Consider deferring colonoscopy if a high-quality examination was performed within the past year, or performing it sooner if alarm symptoms are present.

### Giant colonic diverticulum: radiographic and MDCT characteristics [^1caab1d0]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Giant colonic diverticulum (GCD), defined as a diverticulum larger than 4 cm, is a rare entity that is generally a manifestation of colonic diverticular disease. Because of its rarity and its variable and non-specific presentation, the diagnosis of GCD depends mainly on imaging findings. Knowledge of the spectrum of radiographic and CT features of the GCD is important in making the correct diagnosis and potentially preventing complications. This review focuses on imaging findings characteristic of GCD as well as its complications and radiographic mimics. Teaching points
- Giant colonic diverticulum is a rare complication of diverticulosis.• The most common symptom is abdominal pain presenting in approximately 70% of patients.• Diagnosis is based on imaging findings with plain abdominal radiographs and MDCT.• Treatment consists of en bloc resection of the diverticulum and affected adjacent colon.

The limitations of the current study include its modest sample size, which may have led to type II error in identifying cases of abdominal pain as well as missing data as not all those that did colonoscopy filled out the abdominal symptom diaries. The findings from the present study should be replicated in other geographical areas and cultures to extend the generalizability. Future studies could use imaging to improve the feasibility of collecting data on a larger population sample.

### Management of diverticular disease [^6e3de2d6]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Diverticular disease is a common condition in Western countries and the incidence and prevalence of the disease is increasing. The pathogenetic factors involved include structural changes in the gut that increase with age, a diet low in fibre and rich in meat, changes in intestinal motility, the concept of enteric neuropathy and an underlying genetic background. Current treatment strategies are hampered by insufficient options to stratify patients according to individual risk. One of the main reasons is the lack of an all-encompassing classification system of diverticular disease. In response, the German Society for Gastroenterology and Digestive Diseases (DGVS) has proposed a classification system as part of its new guideline for the diagnosis and management of diverticular disease. The classification system includes five main types of disease: asymptomatic diverticulosis, acute uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis, as well as chronic diverticular disease and diverticular bleeding. Here, we review prevention and treatment strategies stratified by these five main types of disease, from prevention of the first attack of diverticulitis to the management of chronic complications and diverticular bleeding.

1 Introduction

Diverticulosis is one of the most frequent findings on colonoscopy with a higher prevalence in older individuals. The mucosa protrudes between the muscular layers at vascular entry sites forming a pouch like structure termed a diverticulum. Complications of diverticulosis include diverticular hemorrhage, acute diverticulitis, and segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis. Whether uncomplicated diverticulosis gives rise to symptoms is controversial. Some studies suggest that individuals with diverticulosis have more severe and more prolonged pain than those without it. However other studies indicate that there is no difference in pain frequency between the two groups. One theory is that pain associated with diverticulosis is a subset of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but there are indications that diverticulosis pain differs from pain in IBS and may therefore be a distinct clinical entity. We have previously studied symptoms and bowel habits in the Swedish population‐based colonoscopy study (PopCol) using questionnaires and found that individuals with diverticulosis did not report more abdominal pain on questionnaires than those without diverticulosis but had more loose stools. However, the questionnaires did not consider the localization of pain and were based on recall which has been shown to be unreliable.

The present study sought to investigate the frequency, intensity, and location of abdominal pain and bowel habits using prospective abdominal symptom diaries from the PopCol study comparing participants with and without diverticulosis. The hypothesis tested was that participants with diverticulosis would report more abdominal pain and that the pain more often would be in the LLQ compared with those without diverticulosis.

### Diverticulitis: a comprehensive review with usual and unusual complications [^3ef206d8]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diverticulitis is one of the most frequent bowel emergencies presenting with acute abdomen. Acute diverticulitis constitutes 3.8% of causes of abdominal pain in patients presented to the emergency departments. Approximately 10%–25% of patients with known colonic diverticulosis will have diverticulitis in their lifetime. The underlying pathophysiology of diverticulitis is the obstruction of the diverticular ostium by a stool fragment or food particles and subsequent inflammation.

Ultrasonography (US) is generally the first imaging modality used in the evaluation of acute abdomen. In diverticulitis, US demonstrates inflamed diverticulum as a noncompressible outpouching of a bowel wall with thickened and hypoechoic wall often containing an obstructive fecalith at the ostium. Adjacent bowel wall edema and thickening with edematous hyperechoic mesentery can be visualized on US. Gentle compression with US transducers generally induce tenderness and pain. Computed tomography is the mainstay imaging technique in the diagnosis of diverticulitis and its complications. Severity of inflammation, involvement of bowel segment and local and distant complications of diverticulitis can be assessed with CT.

Complications of diverticulitis may be highly variable, and it may be difficult to diagnose diverticulitis as an underlying cause of severe complications. Small sized, well-contained perforations are common in the course of the disease and most cases can be managed conservatively with antibiotics and supportive medical treatment. However, unusual and more severe complications such as non-contained perforation, phlegmon and abscess, phylephlebitis, intestinal obstruction, bleeding, and fistula necessitate intensive management. These conditions should be promptly diagnosed and treated in order to prevent increased morbidity and mortality.

Terminology

To aid in the discussion about DD, it is important to first define some key terms, including DD, diverticulosis and symptomatic uncomplicated DD (SUDD). According to currently accepted definitions, the following terminology is used in describing different scenarios in which diverticula may be detected.

'Diverticulosis' is merely the presence of colonic diverticula; these may, or may not, be symptomatic or complicated.

'DD' is defined as clinically significant and symptomatic diverticulosis; this may be due to true diverticulitis or to other less well-understood manifestations (e.g. visceral hypersensitivity in the absence of verifiable inflammation). The overarching term DD implies that the pathologic lesion (diverticulosis) rises to the level of an illness.

'SUDD' is a subtype of DD in which there are persistent abdominal symptoms attributed to diverticula in the absence of macroscopically overt colitis or diverticulitis.

'Diverticulitis' is the macroscopic inflammation of diverticula with related acute or chronic complications. Diverticulitis can be uncomplicated or complicated. It is uncomplicated when computed tomography (CT) shows colonic wall thickening with fat stranding, while it is complicated when CT demonstrates complicating features of abscess, peritonitis, obstruction, fistulas or hemorrhage.

'Segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis (SCAD)' is a unique form of inflammation that occurs in areas marked by diverticulosis. Endoscopic and histological characteristics describe it as a forerunner of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

5 Clinical Characteristics of Diverticular Disease

Currently, a standard definition and classification of diverticular disease is lacking. Indeed, different terminologies have been proposed. According to the most recent guidelines for the management of diverticular disease of the colon, it is possible to differentiate diverticulosis, which is usually an incidental finding and refers to the presence of diverticula without symptoms and signs of inflammation, from diverticular disease, which encompasses different stages of this condition. Diverticular disease encompasses SUDD, diverticulitis, further divided into acute and chronic, uncomplicated and complicated, and diverticular bleeding.

In accordance with the 2024 Italian guidelines, a possible diagnosis of SUDD is suggested in the presence of abdominal pain referred to the left lower quadrant associated with changes in bowel habits or bloating, with no evidence of inflammation. The clinical features of SUDD often overlap with IBS characteristics, thus complicating the differential diagnosis. However, the differences in terms of gender distribution, age at onset, and duration of symptoms may help to identify these two conditions. Indeed, SUDD is generally more frequent in older male patients, while pain is more often localized in the left lower quadrant, usually prolonged (> 24 h) with long remission periods. Differently, IBS is usually reported in young female patients with diffuse and recurrent abdominal pain lasting < 24 h. Furthermore, since fecal calprotectin seems to be increased in SUDD, it has been proposed as a biomarker to differentiate SUDD from IBS. However, due to a lack of evidence, the role of fecal calprotectin in SUDD diagnosis is still undefined. As reported in a cohort study conducted by Comparato et al. SUDD seems to impair both mental and physical quality of life. This finding may account for the current effort in researching new therapeutic strategies to prevent symptomatic uncomplicated disease.

### Paradigm shift: the copernican revolution in diverticular disease [^575f1e66]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

SUDD and IBS: an unsolved dilemma

The Italian consensus conference on colonic diverticulosis and DD defines SUDD as "a syndrome characterized by recurrent abdominal symptoms (i.e. abdominal pain and bloating resembling or overlapping IBS symptoms) attributed to diverticula in the absence of macroscopically evident alterations other than the presence of diverticula". This definition recognizes the difficulty of differentiating this entity from IBS. Indeed, IBS and DD are common conditions in Western Europe and North America. The diagnosis of IBS, according to Rome IV, is based on well-defined and precise criteria. In contrast, the term "diverticular disease" lacks a truly meaningful definition (in clinical terms) and has been loosely applied to a wide spectrum of diseases.

The epidemiology of SUDD is still largely unknown. One survey aimed to assess the clinical features associated with SUDD. It was found that SUDD had an unspecific clinical picture, mainly characterized by normal stools, short-lived abdominal pain, abdominal bloating and IBS-like symptoms, while functional dyspepsia-like symptoms were not commonly present. An ongoing Italian prospective, observational, multicenter, cohort study found that female sex was significantly associated with SUDD (OR 1.94, 95%CI 1.43–2.62) and with a lower quality of life compared to those with diverticulosis (physical component: P = 0.0001; mental component: P < 0.0001).

### Diverticulosis and diverticulitis [^7fff5a3b]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute diverticulitis:

- **Definition**: Acute diverticulitis is a disease resulting from acute inflammation and/or micro-perforation of colonic diverticula.
- **Pathophysiology**: The putative etiology of acute diverticulitis include alterations in colonic structure, colonic motility, microbiome, genetics, immune system, in addition to connective tissue disorders and environmental factors (obesity, smoking, NSAIDs).
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of acute diverticulitis has increased in the past several decades and is estimated at 188 cases per 100,000 person-years in the US.
- **Disease course**: Alterations in gut motility, intraluminal pressure, and the accumulation of inspissated fecal particles in diverticula leads to erosion of the diverticular wall, causing inflammation that can progress to perforation and diffuse peritonitis. The sequelae of diverticula covered by mesentery may cause phlegmons or abscesses, as well as fistulas.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute diverticulitis has a recurrence rate of 13–23% in patients with uncomplicated disease, and around 40% in patients with complicated disease.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acute diverticulitis, more specifically with respect to endoscopic follow-up, uncomplicated diverticulitis, AGA 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain a colonoscopy after a first episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis based on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and the severity and course of the disease. Consider deferring colonoscopy if a high-quality examination was performed within the past year, or performing it sooner if alarm symptoms are present.

Introduction

Despite the longtime prevalence of diverticulitis as one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, its etiology, prevention, and treatment remain hotly contested. Once viewed as a disorder of primarily older people in western populations, diverticulitis has rapidly increased its presence in all age groups worldwide, prompting researchers to reexamine the pathophysiology of the disease process. Clinicians continue to push the envelope with novel approaches to management, from avoiding antibiotics for uncomplicated cases to identifying subsets of patients with complicated diverticulitis who may not require an operation. Here, we review the most recent literature on a wide array of topics in diverticulitis, with an emphasis on publications within the last 5 years.

How to differentiate between symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and irritable bowel syndrome?

A meta-analysisof 81 studies found a global prevalence of IBS of 11.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 9.8–12.8%] and a recent Italian surveyreported that 59% of SUDD patients fulfilled the Rome III criteria for IBS. The question arises as to whether symptoms are attributable to the presence of diverticula or have to be attributed to the presence of a concomitant IBS. Although in most cases this question cannot be answered, some studies suggest that there may be some demographic and clinical features that help distinguish a subset of patients who may fit in one or the other clinical condition.

The wide overlap between IBS and SUDD is well depicted in older studies based on assessment of diverticulosis with barium enema. These studies showed that around one third of patients with colonic diverticula reported IBS-like symptoms, including recurrent abdominal pain and bloating, loose stools, hard stools, urgency, and straining, all frequently intermittent, with the exception of loose stools, which were present most of the time. These results have been confirmed in a recent multicenter survey in 598 SUDD patients in which 59% of patients fulfilled the Rome III criteria for IBS.

The overlap between IBS and SUDD has also been highlighted in a study from the Mayo clinic, which points out that age is a critical factor. Indeed, diverticula develop with age and are predominant in the elderly population. Conversely, the incidence of IBS is higher in younger adults. Thus, the overlap between IBS and SUDD affects mostly elderly people. Indeed, in those of 65 years of age or older, the presence of IBS was associated with a ninefold higher odds for diverticulosis [odds ratio (OR) = 9.4, 95% CI 5.8–15.1]. Conversely, the odds value for diverticulosis in the younger groups (< 65 years) was low (OR = 1.2, 95% CI 0.8–1.8). The role of sex as a discriminant factor in the identification of SUDD versus IBS patients has received little attention in ad hoc studies. Nonetheless, epidemiological studies have repeatedly shown that female sex predominates in IBS while older patients with SUDD could be predominantly male.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests for acute diverticulitis that are feasible in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b55514f4]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute diverticulitis, which is characterized by inflammation of colonic diverticula, is an increasingly common condition in elderly people, particularly among women and white ethnic groups. Around 20% of those with diverticula will eventually develop it. Most patients with acute diverticulitis have a favourable prognosis and can be managed in primary care. Diagnosing acute diverticulitis clinically can be challenging due to its similar symptoms to a wide range of conditions ranging from irritable bowel syndrome to colorectal cancer.

In the hospital, computed tomography (CT) is recommended alongside patients history, physical examination, and laboratory results to assist in diagnosing acute diverticulitis. CT scans can help reduce the chance of misdiagnosis and discrepancies between the clinical presentation and severity of the condition, by visualizing the location of an inflamed diverticula. However, in primary care, general practitioners (GP) usually rely on simple tests such as signs and symptoms evaluated by patient history and physical examination, laboratory tests, or ultrasound. Diagnostic tests in primary care for acute diverticulitis should have a high sensitivity to ensure that patients with the condition are not missed. This will enable accurate selection of patients for conservative treatment or referral for surgery in patients with high risk of complications while avoiding missing other serious diseases that may mimic diverticulitis.

Although previous studies have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of tests for acute diverticulitis, no meta-analysis has yet been performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy specifically of tests that are feasible in a primary care setting. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of individual signs, symptoms, blood tests, ultrasound, and test combinations for diagnosing acute diverticulitis in patients suspected of acute diverticulitis.

### The overlap of inflammatory bowel disease and diverticular disease [^5f79d51e]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

An overlap of inflammatory bowel disease and diverticular disease has long been recognized. Crohn's disease and diverticulitis share clinical and radiologic features but usually differ in histopathologic findings. There is a suggestion, however, that even the characteristic pathology of Crohn's disease can be a secondary reaction to diverticulitis. It is possible, moreover, that the presence of Crohn's disease in association with diverticulosis predisposes to the development of diverticulitis. Finally, an apparently distinct form of segmental colitis associated with sigmoid diverticula has been described further contributing to the overlap of inflammatory bowel disease and diverticular disease.

### Recent advances in the treatment of colonic diverticular disease and prevention of acute diverticulitis [^1690f936]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diverticular disease (DD) is characterized by the presence of sac-like protrusions (diverticula) which form when colonic mucosa and submucosa herniate through defects in the muscle layer of the colon wall. DD is commonly found in developed countries, slightly more frequently in the USA than in Europe, and is a rare condition in Africa. However, some indication is available that the prevalence of colonic diverticulosis is increasing throughout the world, probably because of changes in lifestyle. Although most people with colonic diverticulosis remain asymptomatic about 20% of patients will develop symptoms, developing so-called DD, of whom 15% will ultimately develop diverticulitis, with or without complications (Fig. 1).

### Acute diverticulitis: key features for guiding clinical management [^0e06f309]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Diverticular disease of the colon and small bowel is an important cause of pathology leading to emergency department visits and urgent gastrointestinal surgery. CT is a highly sensitive and specific modality for the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis and its complications as well as for the exclusion of alternate causes of pathology. Ultrasound, MRI and virtual CT colonoscopy have important adjunct roles for screening and workup of complications in specific patient populations. While diverticular disease most commonly involves the descending and sigmoid colon, it can also affect the proximal colon and small bowel. Acute diverticulitis may be categorized as uncomplicated or complicated according to the degree of inflammatory changes and related complications it induces, although some degree of overlap exists in clinical practice. Uncomplicated diverticulitis is classically characterized by localized inflammation surrounding a diverticulum ranging from wall thickening and phlegmonous change to the development of small, localized pericolic abscesses. Complicated forms of disease manifest with larger pericolic and distant abscesses, fistulae to adjacent organs, perforation, and peritonitis. Recurrent episodes of diverticulitis may lead to muscular hypertrophy of the bowel wall and luminal narrowing, potentially leading to bowel obstruction. Several imaging features may help to differentiate diverticulitis from colonic malignancy, however this remains a diagnostic imaging challenge that often requires further evaluation with colonoscopy. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology and key imaging features of acute diverticulitis and its complications. We explore both common and uncommon presentations of the disease involving the colon and small bowel, acute and chronic manifestations of disease, and pitfalls to recognize when imaging alone may be insufficient to distinguish benign from malignant.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update — clinical classification and frequency of complications: Uncomplicated diverticulitis involves thickening of the colon wall and peri-colonic inflammatory changes, whereas complicated diverticulitis additionally includes the presence of abscess, peritonitis, obstruction, stricture, and/or fistula. Only 12% of patients with diverticulitis present with complicated disease, with the most common complication being phlegmon or abscesses followed by peritonitis, obstruction, stricture, and fistula. Although most individuals recover from acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, approximately 5% of patients will experience smoldering diverticulitis characterized by abdominal pain and continued evidence of inflammation on computed tomography (CT) scan.

### Non-perforated duodenal diverticulitis [^087280bf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Diverticula rarely occur within the lumen of the duodenum and are diagnosed in 2–5% of patients. They usually arise near the papilla of Vater and extend distally. Duodenal diverticula are classified into two types: extraluminal or intraluminal. Although the patient with a diverticulum may be asymptomatic, a duodenal diverticulum usually presents with typical or atypical symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, but sometimes manifestations such as gastrointestinal bleeding, duodenal obstructions or pancreatitis may be severe. The diagnosis of duodenal diverticula can be made with hypotonic duodenography, CT tomography and endoscopy. Duodenal diverticulitis is a rare complication of duodenal diverticulosis. It is often clinically misdiagnosed because it has no typical signs or symptoms and its CT findings may mimic other intra-abdominal processes.

We report the case of a 68-year-old female patient who presented with acute upper quadrant abdominal pain and leukocytosis and was diagnosed with non-perforated duodenal diverticulitis (Fig. 1). Patient was treated conservatively with antibiotics. In symptomatic duodenal diverticulitis cases, extraluminal diverticula are amenable to surgery, whereas intraluminal diverticula may be either surgically or endoscopically resected. Imaging of the biliary tree should be performed prior to any intervention.

In conclusion, duodenal diverticulitis can be a difficult endoscopic or CT diagnosis and should always include the differential diagnosis of duodenal and pancreatic inflammatory processes and masses. Operative treatment of duodenal diverticula is safe but should be reserved for those with emergent presentations or intractable symptoms.

### Emergency presentations of diverticulitis [^9f7175c9]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Acute diverticulitis is a common condition that has been increasing in incidence in the United States. It is associated with increasing age, but the pathophysiology of acute diverticulitis is still being elucidated. It is now believed to have a significant contribution from inflammatory processes rather than being a strictly infectious process. There are still many questions to be answered regarding the optimal management of acute diverticulitis because recent studies have challenged traditional practices, such as the routine use of antibiotics, surgical technique, and dietary restrictions for prevention of recurrence.
