## Question

What do the terms temporal hemianopia or central scotoma mean?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the terms temporal hemianopia or central scotoma mean. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and core localization principles. Then, I should verify the anatomic fiber pathways and OCT structure–function correlations. Next, I will review common etiologies and characteristic visual field patterns. After that, I should check diagnostic strategies, pitfalls, and reliability concerns. Finally, I will consider prognosis and management, including guideline-driven testing and red flags that shift localization up or down the visual pathway.

> Let me start by defining terms, but I must be careful not to overgeneralize. Temporal hemianopia refers to loss of the temporal hemifield, classically bitemporal when the optic chiasm is affected, whereas central scotoma is a defect at or around fixation, often cecocentral when it bridges the physiologic blind spot and macular region. Initially, I almost said bitemporal hemianopia creates "tunnel vision", but wait, let me verify; concentric tunnel vision is more typical of widespread peripheral constriction (e.g., toxic retinopathy), not the sharply vertical midline–respecting temporal loss seen in chiasmal disease, so I should correct that and keep "tunnel vision" for bilateral concentric constriction patterns such as with vigabatrin toxicity rather than true bitemporal field loss [^114nijrh].

> I will now examine the anatomic basis for bitemporal hemianopia and make sure the fiber-crossing logic is sound. The nasal retinal fibers, which represent the temporal visual fields, decussate at the optic chiasm and are selectively vulnerable to compression from below by sellar and suprasellar masses; modeling and clinical series support higher intrachiasmal pressure centrally where these crossing fibers course, explaining preferential temporal field loss in both eyes with chiasmal compression [^114G9KCu]. On structure–function correlation, chiasmal lesions show thinning within the nasal macular ganglion cell complex on OCT, consistent with damage to the crossing nasal retinal fibers, and this can help localize a lesion to the chiasm when interpreted with fields and imaging together.

> For central scotoma, I need to check the papillomacular bundle vulnerability and macular involvement. The papillomacular bundle subserves central vision and is preferentially involved in entities like Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, which typically begins with a cecocentral scotoma and rapid decline in central acuity along with dyschromatopsia; OCT often reveals macular ganglion cell complex thinning that tracks the functional deficit, aligning with the anterior visual pathway localization when the macula or optic nerve is involved [^113KjzPG]. But wait, what if the macula itself is diseased? In age-related macular degeneration and related maculopathies, the central scotoma arises from photoreceptor/RPE-level pathology rather than optic nerve fiber loss, so the clinical context, fundus imaging, and OCT segmentation patterns will help separate macular from optic nerve etiologies of central scotoma [^115PzguW] [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the most common causes of temporal hemianopia and confirm the chiasmal predilection. The leading cause is pituitary adenoma, with roughly half of patients with VF defects demonstrating bitemporal patterns in surgical series, followed by other sellar/suprasellar masses such as planum sphenoidale meningiomas and craniopharyngiomas, as well as vascular compression around the chiasm; thresholds of suprasellar extension on MRI correlate with risk of chiasmal syndrome and visual loss severity, supporting early detection and decompression when indicated [^114BHqot] [^113AoB47] [^113FVR1L] [^1168CssU]. Hold on, I should also verify iatrogenic and treatment-related scenarios; chiasmal herniation after dopamine agonist therapy or postresection descent of the chiasm can cause delayed bitemporal field deterioration, so vigilance with serial fields and imaging remains necessary even after initial improvement [^1128mAtg] [^117Xt65u].

> Let me now consider central scotoma etiologies and ensure I include optic nerve and macular causes. Optic neuropathies include LHON with early cecocentral defects and profound acuity loss, optic neuritis in MS with typical central scotoma patterns, and toxic-metabolic causes such as vigabatrin, which is notorious for permanent field loss that can include central involvement; macular pathologies like AMD or torpedo maculopathy also produce central defects, emphasizing the need to localize with fundus exam and multimodal imaging [^113KjzPG] [^114MfjWJ] [^114nijrh] [^notfound]. I should double-check that vigabatrin classically causes concentric constriction more than pure central scotoma; yes, concentric loss is most characteristic, but central retinal damage and acuity reduction are explicitly recognized, so central involvement can occur, particularly with higher cumulative exposure [^114nijrh].

> Now, I need to contrast the visual field signatures and be precise about borders and symmetry. Chiasmal temporal hemianopia respects the vertical meridian, is often bitemporal but can be asymmetric, and in pituitary adenomas tends to progress from superior to inferior in the temporal hemifield; severity can be staged from peripheral to combined upper–lower defects, which helps track disease and recovery after intervention [^114G9KCu] [^11392voo]. Let me reconsider the central acuity point; postchiasmal hemianopias typically spare visual acuity, and when VA is reduced one must suspect combined anterior pathway involvement, a principle that also reminds me not to over-attribute reduced VA to a pure chiasmal field defect without looking for concurrent optic neuropathy or macular disease [^116HbLMW].

> For central scotoma, I should confirm the clinical co-features. Central and cecocentral defects impair fixation, reduce acuity early and substantially, and are commonly accompanied by dyschromatopsia and an RAPD when monocular or asymmetric; OCT typically shows macular GCC loss tracking the defect, and these patterns do not respect the vertical midline like chiasmal or retrochiasmal defects do, reinforcing anterior pathway localization unless the macula itself is the culprit [^113KjzPG]. Hmm, wait a minute, I need to ensure I don't conflate macular vs optic nerve central scotomas; careful correlation of color vision, RAPD, and optic disc/OCT findings usually separates optic neuropathy from maculopathy in central scotoma presentations [^113KjzPG].

> Differential diagnosis requires discipline, so hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. In chiasmal syndromes, bitemporal hemianopia points to compression at the chiasm, whereas inflammatory optic neuropathies tend to give central scotomas; among demyelinating disorders, MS typically shows central scotoma after optic neuritis, while NMOSD more often shows non-central patterns, which can be a useful clinical clue for etiology and prognosis in acute optic neuritis presentations [^114G9KCu] [^114MfjWJ]. I should double-check mimics too; optic tract lesions can masquerade with band atrophy and specific RAPD patterns, so integrating neuro-ophthalmic examination, OCT signatures, and imaging prevents mislocalization in atypical field maps [^116k52Qt].

> Next, I should review the testing strategy and make sure reliability is addressed. Formal perimetry with Humphrey or Goldmann is preferred for neurological field defects, whereas FDT can miss hemianopic losses; OCT of the macular GCC and RNFL complements fields by revealing characteristic topographies in chiasmal and optic neuropathies, and electrophysiology with mfPERG or mfVEP can provide objective corroboration when subjective perimetry is unreliable or discordant [^112tub8W] [^112Ue5zJ] [^1111YLbH]. But wait, I should verify patient reliability because healthy subjects can simulate central scotomas and hemianopias on automated perimetry with high apparent reliability, so fixation monitoring, test–retest consistency, and objective adjuncts are crucial before making high-stakes decisions.

> Management and prognosis differ materially, so I need to ensure appropriate localization drives treatment. For chiasmal compression causing bitemporal hemianopia, neurosurgical decompression or medical debulking can produce significant or complete visual recovery, and guideline-driven ophthalmic surveillance is recommended for any pituitary lesion abutting or compressing the chiasm, including incidentalomas and acromegaly-associated macroadenomas; preoperative MRI metrics of suprasellar extension help predict visual risk and urgency [^11392voo] [^112GNhmn] [^113iwuqn] [^116yVFnG] [^1168CssU]. Hold on, I should verify evolution after stabilization; with stable mid-chiasmal lesions post-treatment, aging-related change in the damaged hemifield mirrors the normal hemifield over long-term follow-up, which is reassuring for stability once decompression and surveillance are optimized [^1113GoBu].

> For central scotoma, I need to check reversibility and time course carefully. LHON often progresses to severe, permanent central vision loss despite supportive care, toxic optic neuropathies like vigabatrin induce irreversible injury warranting stringent risk–benefit review and scheduled monitoring, and inflammatory optic neuritis in MS can show substantial recovery, though not always complete; the broader principle that earlier assessment and intervention correlate with better visual outcomes is echoed by the time-limited window for spontaneous improvement seen in post-chiasmal hemianopia studies, even if the exact timelines differ by pathology and location [^113KjzPG] [^114nijrh] [^114MfjWJ] [^117SgE8M]. I should confirm follow-up testing; high-resolution central perimetry (e.g., 10–2), color vision, and macular OCT are indispensable to quantify central scotoma severity and track recovery or progression in optic neuropathy and macular disease.

> Finally, a few special considerations deserve emphasis as I sanity-check the full pathway. Congruity is a post-chiasmal concept and less applicable to true bitemporal hemianopia, but it remains helpful when homonymous patterns are in play; retrograde trans-synaptic degeneration after retrochiasmal lesions can produce homonymous macular GCC hemiatrophy on OCT and should not be confused with anterior pathway disease, reinforcing the value of correlating fields, OCT topography, and imaging in every case [^116BuoFi] [^116o4zZf] [^116vLKwo]. And one more nuance I should verify in meningioma-related cases: vascular compression of the chiasm by adjacent arterial complexes can drive visual field change even without clear tumor growth on imaging, so clinical fields may lead imaging in prompting timely intervention and should not be dismissed if symptoms evolve [^113FVR1L].

### Visual fields and optical coherence tomography (OCT) in neuro-ophthalmology: Structure-function correlation [^112kirUL]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Low credibility.

Visual field (VF) testing is an essential component of the neurological examination. The differential diagnosis of VF defects depends on relating this measure of afferent visual function to the structure of the visual pathway. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an invaluable tool for detailed structural evaluation of the optic nerve and retina. This review describes how the interpretation of VF and OCT can be combined to increase the accuracy of the localization of lesions along the visual pathway.

- **Anterior visual pathway lesions**: Originating in ganglion cells or the nerve fiber layer of the retina or optic nerve, these lesions typically produce defects that respect the horizontal midline, reflecting the arcuate path of the ganglion cell axons as they travel to the optic nerve. OCT of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell complex (GCC) will often demonstrate irreversible thinning in compressive and demyelinating lesions affecting anterior visual pathways.

- **Chiasmal lesions**: These produce highly localizable VF defects, such as junctional scotoma and bitemporal hemianopia, which correspond to the thinning of the nasal portion of the GCC.

- **Optic tract lesions**: Such lesions result in incongruous homonymous hemianopia on VF, with corresponding hemianopic thinning on GCC developing within months.

- **Optic radiation lesions**: These usually produce more congruous homonymous VF defects. They can also produce homonymous thinning on GCC; however, this takes much longer to develop as trans-synaptic degeneration at the lateral geniculate body must occur.

### Leber hereditary optic neuropathy: Current perspectives [^113KjzPG]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) usually presents as painless, subacute, central visual loss in one eye. Weeks to months later, the second eye becomes involved, with a median delay of 6–8 weeks. Within one year, 97% of those affected experience involvement of the second eye, making it highly unlikely for a patient presenting with unilateral optic neuropathy for longer than one year to suffer from LHON-related vision loss. Approximately 25% of individuals experience bilateral simultaneous vision loss. In some cases, vision loss in the first eye may go unnoticed before the second eye becomes involved.

The majority of individuals progress to a visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. Due to the preferential involvement of the papillomacular bundle, the earliest visual field abnormality is a cecocentral scotoma, which can enlarge to become a larger central defect. Dyschromatopsia is common and usually parallels the degree of visual acuity loss. Pupillary light reflexes usually remain intact due to relative sparing of melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). This subset of RGCs is thought to be more resistant to metabolic insults from mitochondrial dysfunction compared to all RGCs. However, in cases of asymmetric bilateral or monocular vision loss, a relative afferent pupillary defect can occur.

On fundus examination preceding or during the acute stage of vision loss, characteristic findings can include optic disc hyperemia, peripapillary telangiectatic blood vessels, vascular tortuosity, and swelling of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) around the optic disc.

### Visual acuity and its postoperative outcome after transsphenoidal adenoma resection [^114BHqot]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Low credibility.

In total, 110 out of 191 patients presented with specific visual field defects, such as complete or incomplete bitemporal hemianopsia (57.6%). Perimetric findings of bitemporal hemianopsia were diagnosed in 52 patients, accounting for 47.3% of all patients with visual field defects and 27.2% of all patients. A total of 54 patients exhibited specific visual field defects without bitemporal hemianopsia, representing 49.1% of all patients with preoperative field defects and 28.3% of all patients. Unspecific visual field defect changes were recorded in 33 patients, which accounts for 30% of all patients with visual field defects and 17.3% of all patients.

The mean preoperative visual acuity was 0.76 for both the right and left eyes. Visual acuity impairment was identified in 133 out of 191 patients (69.6%), all of whom suffered from pituitary macroadenoma. The mean visual acuity was 0.64 for the right eye and 0.65 for the left eye. The median Knosp classification score was grade 3, while the median Hardy classification grade was 2. Preoperative visual acuity showed a significant dependence on the Knosp classification (r = -0.192, p = 0.029) but not on the grading provided by Hardy et al. (p = 0.395).

In terms of surgical performance, 67% (128 out of 191) of the patients underwent microsurgical procedures, and 33% (63 out of 191) received an endoscopic approach. Intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow was observed in 27.2% of the cases (52 out of 191). The mean duration of surgery was 80 minutes, with a range of 24 to 320 minutes. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 50.8% (97 patients), while partial resection was accomplished in 64.2% of cases, defined as more than 90% tumor resection (122 out of 191 patients).

### Planum sphenoidale meningioma leading to visual disturbance [^113AoB47]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

A 60-year-old male presented with complaints of dizziness that worsened with fatigue and a sense that his balance was "off". The initial physical examination was negative, and laboratory testing was unremarkable. Within weeks, the patient developed bilateral visual field deficits. MRI revealed an extra-axial mass that extended into the pituitary fossa, causing compression of the pituitary gland. The pituitary stalk was displaced posteriorly, and the optic chiasm was compressed with displacement superiorly and posteriorly.

The patient underwent surgical resection. Postoperatively, he developed diabetes insipidus, necessitating a vasopressin drip. He also experienced hypopituitarism after the resection, with resultant hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, and hypogonadism. The patient now requires testosterone, levothyroxine, and hydrocortisone replacement therapy and has mild residual bitemporal hemianopsia.

### Left-right and upper-lower light sensitivity asymmetry in visual field defects caused by pituitary adenoma: A retrospective observational study [^114G9KCu]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Visual field defects observed in patients with pituitary adenoma are thought to result from compression of the optic chiasm. It has been demonstrated that chiasm compression from below generates significantly elevated tissue pressure in the central portion of the chiasm, where the nasal halves of the left and right optic nerve fibers cross to the contralateral optic tracts. The crossing nerve fibers corresponding to the temporal hemifield of vision in the left and right eyes are dominantly damaged.

While bitemporal visual field defects are characteristic in pituitary adenoma cases, it is rare to have complete bitemporal hemianopsia that is symmetrical in both eyes and has absolute scotoma throughout both temporal hemifields.

Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful diagnostic tool for pituitary adenomas, it is challenging to precisely assess and predict asymmetry in visual field defects based on MRI findings due to the complex anatomy and insufficient resolution of MRI.

Unequal visual field defects in the left and right eyes have also been described in the literature. Not only is inter-eye asymmetry present between left and right eyes, but intra-eye or upper-lower asymmetry may also be present. Visual field defects tend to show an upper-to-lower progression in the temporal hemifield and lower-to-upper progression in the nasal hemifield.

Although several kinds of research have investigated asymmetric visual field defects in patients with pituitary adenoma, no precise investigation with statistical analysis regarding the inter-eye and intra-eye asymmetry has been conducted.

Neuro-ophthalmologic disorders arise from all areas of the neuro-ophthalmologic tract. They may present simply as loss of vision or double vision, or as complex syndromes or systemic illnesses, depending on the location and type of lesion. Problems can occur anywhere along the visual pathway, including the brainstem, cavernous sinus, subarachnoid space, and orbital apex, and may also affect adjacent structures. A firm understanding of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the eye is essential for correct diagnosis.

### Homonymous hemianopia: challenges and solutions [^116HbLMW]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

In addition to congruity, the shape and location of an incomplete homonymous hemianopia (HH) can help localize the causative factor. Damage to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) will often result in one or more sectors of visual field loss, since the dorsal portion of the LGN contains fibers from the macular region, the lateral portion represents the superior visual field, and the medial portion represents the inferior visual field. Temporal lobe lesions tend to involve the superior visual field quadrant. In contrast, parietal lesions are more likely to cause inferior visual field defects with sloping borders superiorly. Lesions isolated to the upper cuneus gyrus or the lower lingual gyrus result in an inferior or superior quadrantanopia, respectively (Figure 1D).

Macular representation, found at the posterior pole of the occipital lobe, is disproportionately large. It is estimated that 50–60% of the visual cortex represents 10–30° of central vision. Because of the large macular representation, as well as the dual blood supply to the posterior occipital lobe, sparing of the central 2–10° of the visual field (Figure 1E) is commonly found with occipital lobe lesions. Macular sparing can also occur with lesions of the optic radiations or optic tracts. Even without macular sparing, an HH itself does not generally affect visual acuity. If visual acuity is reduced, an accompanying lesion involving the anterior visual pathway should be suspected.

### Pituitary hyperplasia causing complete bitemporal hemianopia with resolution following surgical decompression: case report [^112rFb3J]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2021). Low credibility.

In this report, the authors demonstrated that idiopathic pituitary hyperplasia (PH) can cause complete bitemporal hemianopia and amenorrhea, even in the setting of mild anatomical compression of the optic chiasm and normal pituitary function. Furthermore, complete resolution of symptoms can be achieved with surgical decompression. PH can occur in the setting of pregnancy or end-organ insufficiency, as well as with medications such as oral contraceptives and antipsychotics, or it can be idiopathic. It is often found incidentally, and surgical intervention is usually unnecessary, as the disorder rarely progresses and can be managed by treating the underlying etiology.

The authors present the case of a 24-year-old woman with no significant prior medical history, who presented with bitemporal hemianopia and amenorrhea. Imaging revealed an enlarged pituitary gland that was contacting but not compressing the optic chiasm, and pituitary hormone tests were all within normal limits. The patient underwent surgical decompression of the sella turcica and exploration of the gland through an endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach. Pathology results demonstrated PH. A postoperative visual field examination revealed complete resolution of the bitemporal hemianopia, and menstruation resumed 3 days later. The patient remains asymptomatic with no hormonal deficits.

### Effects of visual pathway lesions on the visual aura of migraine [^116BqDAY]. Cephalalgia (2009). Low credibility.

This study aimed to determine if the visual aura of migraine is altered by disease of the afferent visual pathways and if visual aura changes are associated with pre- or postgeniculate lesions. Functional neuroimaging during migraine demonstrates the primary visual/extrastriate cortex as an anatomical substrate of visual aura. Neuro-ophthalmological records, including kinetic and static perimetry of 25 patients with visual loss and typical aura with or without migraine headache, were reviewed.

Twenty-five patients (16 women, nine men) with a mean age of 59.8 years, had typical aura and visual loss from pregeniculate (72%) or postgeniculate lesions (28%). Eight patients, comprising four with postgeniculate cerebrovascular accidents or arteriovenous malformations, two with lifelong optic neuropathy/retinopathy, one with childhood ocular trauma, and one with anisometropic amblyopia, reported absence or alteration of visual aura. Postgeniculate lesions were significantly associated (P = 0.017) with visual aura changes.

The association of postgeniculate lesions with altered auras points to a postgeniculate effect on aura appearance, consistent with functional neuroimaging findings. Although statistically significant, this series' association of postgeniculate disease and aura changes is even more robust (P = 0.0002) when structural changes of ocular dominance columns are posited in three patients with optic neuropathy, retinopathy, and keratopathy of congenital or childhood origin.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112GNhmn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

We recommend that all patients presenting with a pituitary incidentaloma abutting or compressing the optic nerves or chiasm on MRI undergo a formal visual field (VF) examination.

- **Evidence**: Baseline VF testing is recommended for all patients with an incidentaloma abutting the optic nerves or chiasm, even without visual symptoms. In one prospective study of 11 macroincidentalomas, one patient had VF abnormalities, and two had compression of the optic chiasm. In other studies, 15% and 5% of patients had unrecognized VF abnormalities at presentation.

- **Flow diagram for the evaluation and treatment of pituitary incidentalomas**:
	- a. Baseline evaluation in all patients should include a history and physical exam evaluating for signs and symptoms of hyperfunction and hypopituitarism, and a laboratory evaluation for hypersecretion.
	- b. This group may also include large microlesions.
	- c. The recommendation for surgery includes the presence of abnormalities of VF or vision and signs of tumor compression; surgery is also suggested for other findings.
	- d. VF testing is recommended for patients with lesions abutting or compressing the optic nerves or chiasm at the initial evaluation and during follow-up.
	- e. Evaluation for hypopituitarism is recommended for the baseline evaluation and during follow-up evaluations. This is most strongly recommended for macrolesions and larger microlesions.
	- f. Repeat MRI in 1 year, yearly for 3 years, and then less frequently thereafter if no change is observed.

These guidelines underscore the importance of thorough assessment and monitoring of patients with pituitary incidentalomas.

### Homonymous hemianopias: Clinical-anatomic correlations in 904 cases [^111QRcRJ]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics and clinical-anatomic correlations of homonymous hemianopia (HH).

Homonymous hemianopia impairs visual function and frequently precludes driving. Most knowledge of HH is based on relatively few cases with clinical-anatomic correlations.

The authors reviewed medical records of all patients with HH seen in their service between 1989 and 2004. Demographic characteristics, characteristics of visual field defects, causes of visual field defects, neuroradiologic definition of lesion location, and associated neurologic deficits were recorded.

A total of 904 HH cases were found in 852 patients. Out of these, 340 HH (37.6%) were complete, and 564 HH (62.4%) were incomplete. Homonymous quadrantanopia (264 HH, 29%) was the most common type of incomplete HH, followed by homonymous scotomatous defects (116 HH, 13.5%), partial HH (114 HH, 13%), and HH with macular sparing (66 HH, 7%). A total of 407 HH (45.0%) were isolated. Causes of HH included stroke (629 HH, 69.6%), trauma (123, 13.6%), tumor (102, 11.3%), brain surgery (22, 2.4%), demyelination (13, 1.4%), other rare causes (13, 1.4%), and unknown etiology (2, 0.2%). The lesions were most commonly located in the occipital lobes (45%) and the optic radiations (32.2%). Every type of HH, except for unilateral loss of temporal crescent and homonymous sectoranopia, was found in all lesion locations along the retrochiasmal visual pathways.

Homonymous hemianopia is usually secondary to stroke, head trauma, and tumors.

- **Severity of pre-operative visual field defects, visual acuity impairment, and parameters of timing**: Data are shown as the percentage of affected patients reported per study.

- **Visual fields**:
	- *VFD classification, as described by Dekkers et al.: mild, if there were peripheral defects in only one quadrant; moderate, if the upper quadrants were affected; severe, if combined upper and lower quadrant field defects.
	- **Visual Field Index**, as described by Sheehan et al.: 0 for completely normal perimetry results or imaging studies showing no encroachment of the optic chiasma; 1 for any defect less than a quadrantanopia in either eye or both eyes (mild); 2 for a quadrantanopia in either eye or both eyes (moderate); 3 for any defect greater than a quadrantanopia in either eye or both eyes (severe).

- **Visual acuity**: VA classification, as described by Berkmann et al.: slight, 15–40% loss of central vision; moderate, 40–70% loss of central vision; severe, > 80% loss of central vision; absent, 100% loss of central vision. In cases involving asymmetrical visual acuity, the more impaired eye was referred to.

- **Timing of surgery**: Timing of surgery is defined as the time from diagnosis to surgery, i.e. treatment delay. Diagnostic delay is defined as the time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis.

### Influence of ageing on visual field defects due to stable lesions [^1113GoBu]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Knowledge about the effects of ageing on visual field defects is very sparse.

- **Methods**: Long-term follow-up records were examined from 28 patients with light-to-moderate visual field defects remaining after surgery for pituitary tumours. All were proven free from tumour recurrences and complicating disorders; hence, all had isolated, stable lesions of the chiasm. Follow-up periods ranged over 4–18 years (median 9). Using high-pass resolution perimetry, results were analysed from the central-most test locations in the upper temporal and upper nasal quadrants. The former typically bear the brunt of damage, whereas the latter are least affected. Each patient contributed results from one eye only. Fixation stability and reproducibility were uniformly good.

- **Results**: Measuring values from the nasal quadrants remained essentially constant throughout the follow-up periods. Results from the temporal (T) quadrants were contrasted with those from the nasal (N) quadrants by calculating the T/N ratios, which were then individually regressed over follow-up periods. Hence, each patient was his or her own control. The absolute majority of regression coefficients (25 out of 28) did not significantly differ from 0.

- **Conclusion**: The rate of age-related loss of neural channels appears to be identical in normal and abnormal visual field areas in subjects with stable mid-chiasmal lesions.

### Homonymous hemianopia: Challenges and solutions [^112tub8W]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical evaluation: Visual fields, particularly when correlated with other symptoms, provide valuable information regarding the location of brain lesions. Goldmann perimetry is useful in detecting neurologic visual field loss. Unfortunately, the equipment is not widely available, and testing requires a more skilled technician compared with automated perimetry. Humphrey automated perimetry is widely used for assessing visual field defects. The Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm (SITA) Fast is less sensitive than the SITA Standard method. SITA Fast testing can give reliable screening results; however, due to the larger test-retest variability, it may not be a good choice to monitor visual field loss over time. Additionally, quantitative comparison of different strategies should be avoided, as the mean deviation is higher with SITA Fast compared with SITA Standard.

Frequency doubling technology (FDT) perimetry can detect glaucomatous visual field damage earlier than standard perimetry by isolating specific types of ganglion cells. While these technologies are good at identifying patients with glaucoma, they have been shown to be inconsistent in finding neurologic visual field defects. Compared with Goldmann perimetry, the FDT C20 threshold protocol was found to detect hemianopic field loss less than half of the time. With the use of a smaller stimulus size, the second-generation Matrix FDT has better correlation with standard perimetry when measuring neurologic disorders. However, the Matrix may still be less sensitive than standard automated perimetry in detecting homonymous hemianopia.

### Optic tract shrinkage limits visual restoration after occipital stroke [^115mpAGF]. Stroke (2021). Low credibility.

One factor likely to affect the potential to recover vision after V1 damage is the state of the residual visual system. Without intervention, the perimetrically defined visual deficit of patients more than 6 months post-stroke slowly expands and worsens over time — a phenomenon attributed to retrograde degeneration of early visual pathways. Studies in humans and nonhuman primates have long shown the existence of trans-synaptic retrograde degeneration in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and retina after occipital lesions. This is thought to occur in sequence, with dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus relay cells dying first, followed by loss of retinal ganglion cells.

In macaque monkeys, the magnitude of trans-synaptic retrograde degeneration varies, appearing to correlate with the size of, as well as time since, the V1 lesion. In humans, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analyses have shown that the optic tract (OT) ipsilateral to occipital cortex damage is often reduced in size, as are the thicknesses of the retinal ganglion cells and nerve fiber layers over corresponding regions of the retina in each eye. Importantly, these human studies also showed considerable interindividual variability in the severity of degeneration.

We now posit that since early visual neurons are responsible for conveying the bulk of sensory input to the rest of the visual system, their loss could critically limit the ability of patients with V1 damage to recover visual functions. This was recently shown to be true with respect to spontaneous recovery, which occurs with marked individual variation.

### Multifocal pattern electroretinography for the detection of neural loss in eyes with permanent temporal hemianopia or quadrantanopia from chiasmal compression [^112Ue5zJ]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the ability of multifocal transient pattern electroretinography (mfPERG) in detecting neural loss and to assess the relationship between mfPERG and visual-field (VF) loss in eyes affected by chiasmal compression.

The methods involved 23 eyes from 23 patients with temporal VF defects and band atrophy of the optic nerve, along with 21 controls, undergoing standard automated perimetry and mfPERG. This was conducted using a stimulus pattern of 19 rectangles, each consisting of 12 squares. The response was analyzed for the central rectangle, nasal and temporal hemifields (eight rectangles each), and each quadrant (three rectangles) in both patients and controls. Variance analysis was employed for comparisons, and correlations between VF and mfPERG measurements were evaluated by linear regression analysis.

The results showed that the mean ± SD mfPERG amplitudes from the temporal hemifield (0.50 ± 0.17 and 0.62 ± 0.32) and temporal quadrants (superior 0.42 ± 0.21 and 0.52 ± 0.35, inferior 0.51 ± 0.23 and 0.74 ± 0.40) were significantly lower in eyes with band atrophy compared to controls (0.78 ± 0.24, 0.89 ± 0.28, 0.73 ± 0.26, 0.96 ± 0.36, 0.79 ± 0.26, and 0.91 ± 0.31, respectively). No significant difference was observed in nasal hemifield measurements. Significant correlations (0.36–0.73) were found between VF relative sensitivity and mfPERG amplitude in different VF sectors.

In conclusion, mfPERG amplitude measurements can distinctly differentiate eyes with temporal VF defect from controls. The strong correlation between mfPERG amplitudes and VF defect severity indicates that mfPERG may serve as an indicator of ganglion cell dysfunction.

### Predictors for visual dysfunction in nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas - Implications for neurosurgical management [^1168CssU]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Despite ample experience with surgical treatment of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, objective data defining the risk for visual compromise depending on the suprasellar extension in pituitary adenomas are sparse.

- **Design and patients**: We measured the suprasellar extension of 98 newly diagnosed suprasellar nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas on sagittal and coronal magnetic resonance images using reference lines for the skull base level. In addition, the position of the optic chiasm in relation to the suprasellar adenoma was assessed. The findings were correlated with the degree of visual dysfunction and with the type of visual field defects (VFD).

- **Results**: Seventy percent of the patients suffered from VFD. The most frequent perimetric findings were bilateral (81.2%) or unilateral (10.1%) temporal hemifield defects. For the coronal view, a suprasellar extension of 12 mm was a practicable cut-off value for the emergence of visual disturbances (87.0% sensitivity, 72.4% specificity). For the sagittal view, an 8-mm suprasellar extension was a suitable cut-off for the appearance of chiasma syndrome (87.0% sensitivity, 75.9% specificity). In five of seven cases without a chiasma syndrome despite a suprasellar extension > 12 mm (coronal) and 8 mm (sagittal), the optic chiasm was found in an anterior position. No correlation was found between the position of the chiasm (i.e. anterior, superior, or posterior) and the type of VFD (P = 0.647). A highly significant correlation was found between the decline of visual acuity and the suprasellar adenoma extension (P < 0.0001).

### Homonymous hemianopia: challenges and solutions [^116k52Qt]. Clinical ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Optic tract lesions can produce both complete and partial homonymous hemianopia (HH). The presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect and band-shaped atrophy of the optic disc can help distinguish an optic tract lesion from damage located posterior to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN).

When a complete HH is present, the relative afferent pupillary defect will be found in the eye with the temporal visual field loss, contralateral to the optic tract lesion. This may occur due to the increased number of decussating ganglion cell fibers compared with nondecussating fibers, or it may occur because the melanopsin-containing fibers found in the nasal retina have an increased sensitivity compared with those found in the temporal retina. Band-shaped atrophy, manifesting as pallor of the nasal and temporal optic nerve head, will also be seen in the eye contralateral to the optic tract lesion. Thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer (NFL) that corresponds with the area of pallor can be seen with optical coherence tomography analysis of the NFL or ganglion cell complex. Here, retinal tissue associated with the temporal visual field loss, the NFL nasal to the disc, and the NFL temporal to the disc but nasal to the macula is reduced. Additionally, the superior and inferior NFL may be thinned in the eye ipsilateral to the optic tract lesion.

- **Associated signs and symptoms**: Associated signs and symptoms may be present if the lesion affecting the optic tract extends to nearby structures. If the temporal lobe is involved, memory may be affected and seizures can occur. Damage to the adjacent cerebral peduncle can result in contralateral hemiparesis.

### Does the World Health Organization criterion adequately define glaucoma blindness [^116FSCRe]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Considering all this, we propose a revised version of the ordinal scale used in the study to make this scale more objective and comparable, and to include parameters important for assessing the impact of visual field loss. We recommend the following: implement the type of visual field defect (i.e. location of the defect) in the ordinal scale; for example, "blind" is temporal crescent, "most probably blind" includes central island of vision, "probably blind" contains defects in the lower hemifield, "probably not blind" includes arcuate scotoma and para-central scotoma, and "not blind" includes overall sensitivity loss and nasal step. Subsequently, each category and the corresponding type of defect should include a definition, for example, what constitutes blindness and central island of vision. Furthermore, it is also important to include the following parameters:

1. Parameters that indicate the quality of life (assessed through questionnaires)
2. Visual field indices like MD and VFI
3. Measurement of monocular and binocular visual field loss
4. Driver's license eligibility requirements

To conclude, the WHO criterion is strict and can be applied stringently, causing good interobserver agreement. However, they also lead to underregistration of blindness. A classification as chosen in the present study registers more blind patients but at the cost of a lower interobserver agreement. Although the WHO already extended the definition of blindness from complete lack of light perception toward its present definition, we need to move forward to further widen the definition.

### Retrograde degeneration of retinal ganglion cells in homonymous hemianopsia [^116o4zZf]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

In this study, analysis of both the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and the ganglion cell complex (GCC) were included to demonstrate retrograde transneuronal degeneration in patients with homonymous hemianopsia caused by cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Prior to the algorithm for GCC measurement, the best way to indirectly measure the nerve fiber layer was to use the RNFL function on optical coherence tomography (OCT).

The RNFL is primarily reported divided into four quadrants: temporal, nasal, superior, and inferior. This distinction is less than ideal for evaluating post-chiasmatic visual field defects since the temporal quadrant contains retinal fibers from the temporal retina as well as the maculopapillary bundle nasal to the fovea. This allows for both the nasal and temporal visual fields to be represented in the same measurement and could be a confounder when attempting to analyze visual field defects that respect the midline. To demonstrate retrograde trans-synaptic degeneration, a right occipital lesion would cause thinning of the nasal nerve fiber of the right eye and temporal nerve fiber of the left eye.

This becomes further challenging as the peripapillary nerve fiber layer is not symmetric at baseline in normal subjects. In general, the inferior quadrant is thickest, followed by the superior, nasal, and temporal. The fovea represents the physiologic division between crossed and uncrossed fibers to the visual cortex and at baseline is symmetric between the superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal quadrants. For these reasons, the GCC analysis is a more straightforward way to demonstrate thinning as it is projected to the visual cortex.

### Temporal sensitivity in a hemianopic visual field can be improved by long-term training using flicker stimulation [^112WZ8YU]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Blindness of a visual half-field (hemianopia) is a common symptom after postchiasmatic cerebral lesions. Although hemianopia severely limits activities of daily life, clinical practice comprises no training of visual functions in the blind hemifield.

- **Objective**: To find out whether flicker sensitivity in the blind hemifield can be improved with intensive training, and whether training with flicker stimulation can evoke changes in cortical responsiveness.

- **Methods**: Two men with homonymous hemianopia participated in the experiments. They trained with flicker stimuli at 30 degrees or with flickering letters at 10 degrees eccentricity twice a week for a year, and continued training with more peripheral stimuli thereafter. Neuromagnetic responses were registered at 1–2 month intervals, and the Goldmann perimetry was recorded before, during, and after training.

- **Results**: Flicker sensitivity in the blind hemifield improved to the level of the intact hemifield within 30 degrees eccentricity in one participant and 20 degrees eccentricity in the other. Flickering letters were recognized equally at 10 degrees eccentricity in the blind and intact hemifields. Improvement spread from the stimulated horizontal meridian to the whole hemianopic field within 30 degrees. Before training, neuromagnetic recordings showed no signal above the noise level in the hemianopic side. During training, evoked fields emerged in both participants. No changes were found in the Goldmann perimetry.

- **Discussion**: Results show that sensitivity to flicker could be fully restored in the stimulated areas.

### Low vision due to cerebral visual impairment: Differentiating between acquired and genetic causes [^112DEvsH]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

We were able to establish a diagnosis in the majority of CVI in our study population, consisting of genetic disorders and acquired causes. After exclusion of possible confounders, a 'purely' genetic and a 'purely' acquired subgroup remained.

- **Ophthalmological examination**: Revealed significant differences between these two etiologies. Strabismus, visual field defects, and (partial) pale optic disc were significantly less common in the genetic group compared to the acquired group. This might be explained by the localization of the defect, as in the acquired group, the most important cerebral damage was PVL and stroke, both mainly localized in the optic radiations. Damage to the optic radiations can cause visual field defects and retrograde optic disc pallor. In the genetic group, the optic radiations are probably less severely affected, and a more overall dysfunction of the brain and/or cortical anomalies might have resulted in the visual impairment. This theory is supported by the observation that normal optic discs are seen more often in individuals with cortical lesions compared to subcortical lesions.

A comparable mechanism might result in the higher frequency of strabismus in the acquired group. To guide the alignment of the visual axes, the binocular connections in the striate cortex play an important role. When the input to the striate cortex is disturbed by prism-glasses, strabismus develops in primates. Therefore, it can be expected that injury to the optic radiations by stroke or PVL, which also disrupts the input to the striate cortex, leads to strabismus.

### Left-right and upper-lower light sensitivity asymmetry in visual field defects caused by pituitary adenoma: A retrospective observational study [^115i5Ssg]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

In the present study, we demonstrated that visual field defects in patients with pituitary adenoma were asymmetric between the left and right eyes in about 80% of cases in the temporal or nasal hemifield, or both.

The visual field defect in patients with pituitary adenoma has been investigated mostly via a qualitative approach. Although some recent studies aimed to quantitatively evaluate the visual field defect, precise investigation with statistical analysis regarding the inter-eye and intra-eye symmetry of visual field defects had not been reported. Clinical studies using Humphrey 30–2 perimetry in patients with pituitary adenoma have been conducted by several researchers, including Lee et al. and Boland et al. The former analyzed the Humphrey results qualitatively, classifying them as normal, unreliable, bitemporal, mixed (bitemporal and additional defects), monocular, homonymous, nonspecific, or other. The latter did not analyze light sensitivity itself but rather the sum of the total or temporal scores of the neurologic hemifield test, which was assessed by the original ranking scales for the probability of pattern deviation obtained from Humphrey 30–2 perimetry.

In the study, we analyzed light sensitivity values instead of total deviation, the reduction in dB below the expected age-matched level, to directly and accurately compare the inter-eye light sensitivity. The use of total deviation would eliminate age and eccentricity effects, and therefore it is suitable to compare at different test points in the visual field in many subjects of different ages.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: A Pituitary Society international consensus guideline statement [^116TraYF]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, specifically concerning ophthalmologic evaluation, the PS 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining visual field testing in patients with incidentalomas that are ≥ 10 mm in diameter. This recommendation also applies to those with sellar lesions < 10 mm in diameter that are close to the optic chiasm (< 3–5 mm).

### Visual field deficit caused by vascular compression from a suprasellar meningioma: Case report [^113FVR1L]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Suprasellar meningiomas typically cause bitemporal hemianopsia by direct compression of the chiasm, its blood supply, or both. We report another mechanism for visual loss in suprasellar meningiomas, whereby compression by the suprajacent vascular complex is the offending agent.

- **Clinical presentation**: A 78-year-old woman with a suprasellar meningioma was diagnosed incidentally. During the follow-up period, she developed an inferior homonymous wedge defect consistent with superior compression, without any detectable radiological progression. It was decided to resect her tumor.

- **Intervention**: The patient underwent a fronto-orbital approach for tumoral excision. Intraoperatively, a groove by the anterior cerebral artery complex was found along the superior surface of the chiasm. Postoperatively, the patient's visual deficit resolved.

- **Conclusion**: This case illustrates an unusual visual field deficit associated with a suprasellar meningioma. It also emphasizes the importance of frequent and careful visual field monitoring, which can precede radiological and symptomatic progression.

### Homonymous hemianopia: Challenges and solutions [^115VrAgN]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Confrontation visual field testing is not sensitive at detecting visual field loss, but it may be the only method available. Kerr et al. evaluated 332 eyes prospectively to compare seven types of confrontation visual field tests. Finger counting was the least sensitive method, identifying 0% of mild defects and 49% of severe defects. Overall, the most sensitive individual method of confrontation visual field testing is kinetic testing using a 5 mm red bead. This method detects 43% of mild defects and 89% of severe defects. The overall sensitivity using the kinetic red bead is 74%, which improves to 78% when combined with static finger wiggle testing. Formal perimetry is necessary if there is a strong suspicion of visual field loss.

Unilateral damage to the retrochiasmal visual pathway results in bilateral vision loss affecting the contralateral visual field. The visual loss respects the vertical midline of the visual field. This condition should be differentiated from glaucomatous visual field loss, which does not respect the vertical midline but instead respects the horizontal midline. The most common location of lesions resulting in homonymous hemianopia (HH) is the occipital lobe (45%), followed by damage to the optic radiations (32%). The remainder is caused by lesions of the optic tract (10%), lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) (1.3%), or a combination of several areas (11%).

A complete HH affects the entire hemifield of both eyes. This can occur with a lesion anywhere posterior to the chiasm and cannot be further localized based on visual field appearance alone. An incomplete HH spares at least part of the hemifield.

### Optokinetic nystagmus in patients with central scotomas in age related macular degeneration [^116WcLJj]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Reports on the impact of a loss in the central field of vision on optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) are varied. A study was therefore undertaken to reassess the role of the central retina in the generation of OKN in a large group of patients with age-related macular degeneration.

- **Methods**: Four groups of 20 patients were examined: a control group without scotoma and three groups with absolute central scotomas measuring 1 degree–10 degrees, 11 degrees–20 degrees, and 21 degrees–30 degrees. OKN was elicited with black and white stripes moving nasally to temporally or temporally to nasally on a screen subtending 54 degrees x 41 degrees at four velocities (15, 30, 45, and 60 degrees/s). OKN gain was measured using infrared oculography.

- **Results**: There was no significant difference in OKN gain between the control group and those with scotomas of 1 degree–10 degrees and 11 degrees–20 degrees. A significant difference in OKN gain was found between the group with scotomas of 21 degrees–30 degrees and all other groups at stimulus velocities of 30, 45, and 60 degrees/s (p < 0.05). OKN gain significantly diminished with increasing stimulus velocity (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was found in OKN gain between stimuli moving temporally to nasally and nasally to temporally.

- **Conclusion**: Abnormalities of OKN gain were noted only in patients with large scotomas. An intact macula is therefore not necessary for the generation of OKN.

### Inferior temporal sulcus as a site of corticotomy: Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of individual sulcus patterns [^115U4Pyr]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Transcortical approaches to the inferior horn often result in quadrant hemianopsia due to injury to the optic radiation. The inferior temporal sulcus (ITS) has received little attention as an entrance point for the transsulcal approach. We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to detect the ITS and investigate its sulcus pattern, incidence rate, and availability for selective amygdalohippocampectomy.

The ITS sulcus patterns of 100 temporal lobes in 50 healthy individuals were classified according to the number of interruptions by gyral bridges. The localization of the ITS was characterized in relation to the outer surface using MRI surface anatomy scans. Most ITS were interrupted by one to three gyral bridges (0 bridges, 8%; one bridge, 27%; two bridges, 37%; three bridges, 20%; more than four bridges or no apparent ITS, 8%). When present, the ITS was located 15 mm above the orbitotragus line at a point 20 mm anterior to the tragus. The number of gyral bridges was significantly larger in the left temporal lobes than in the right, regardless of the subject's sex.

The ITS was clearly identified in 72% of the temporal lobes in MRI scans; in such cases, the ITS is considered a candidate for an entrance point for small temporal corticotomy. Preoperative MRI observation of the ITS in relation to the orbitotragus line may improve surgical planning.

### Sudden bilateral vision loss due to third ventricular cavernous angioma with intratumoral hemorrhage - case report [^117J5yEv]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

Chiasmal syndrome is associated with lesions of the optic chiasm and manifests as various impairments of the visual field such as central scotoma, bitemporal paracentral scotoma, junction scotoma, and bitemporal hemianopsia. Pituitary tumors are the most common cause, but the condition may also result from neurofibromatosis, angioma, and glioma, as well as from other inflammatory diseases such as hypophysitis, chiasmal neuritis, and multiple sclerosis.

We report a rare case of chiasmal syndrome with sudden bilateral vision loss due to third ventricular cavernous angioma presenting with intratumoral hemorrhage.

### Optic chiasmal herniation — an under recognized complication of dopamine agonist therapy for macroprolactinoma [^1128mAtg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2000). Low credibility.

The initial presentation of macroprolactinoma with visual field impairment, especially in males, is well recognized. Successful treatment with dopamine agonist therapy is characterized by a reduction in hyperprolactinemia and often rapid and progressive resolution of the visual impairment. A small proportion of patients may subsequently develop a secondary deterioration in both their visual fields and visual acuities despite normalization of prolactin levels and tumor shrinkage. When pituitary apoplexy can be excluded, this may result from traction on the optic chiasm, which is pulled down into the now partially empty sella.

We report a series of seven patients in whom chiasmal traction is believed to be the cause of their secondary deterioration in visual acuity after dopamine agonist therapy for macroprolactinoma. The clinical history of two patients, both of whom had a rapid resolution of field defect with bromocriptine therapy but subsequently developed a recurrence of their bitemporal hemianopia, is detailed. In both patients, MRI scanning showed not only tumor involution but also marked optic chiasm herniation into the pituitary fossa. Surgical treatment was considered too risky. However, upon reduction of bromocriptine dosage, the field defect improved in both cases; there was a modest elevation of prolactin and a degree of tumor re-expansion. The latter is believed to have released tethering of the optic chiasm and/or its vascular supply, thus obviating the need for surgery. Regular monitoring of visual fields in patients with macroprolactinoma receiving medical treatment is recommended.

### Defective angles of localized retinal nerve fiber layer reflect the severity of visual field defect- a cross-sectional analysis [^11117H4R]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

In regard to angle α, we did not find a significant correlation with the presence of central scotoma. Recall that angle α is the angular width between the reference line and the proximity of the RNFL defect. It makes sense that the smaller the angle α, the closer the RNFL defect is relative to the central vision, which could cause central visual defect. We proposed four possible explanations for the lack of correlation:

- **RNFL thickness loss**: Some studies suggested that RNFL thickness loss is significantly correlated with more circumferential visual field loss but is not correlated with central visual field loss.

- **Optic nerve damage**: Early glaucomatous optic nerve damages precede visual loss most of the time.

- **Central scotoma identification**: The presence of central scotoma was identified based on 30–2 visual fields using the criteria we proposed instead of using 10–2 visual fields, which we lack. This deficit in accurately defining central scotoma may have caused the lack of correlation.

- **Physiological standpoint**: From a physiological standpoint, central RNFL lesion is closer to the origin of retinal vessels and may thereby receive more nutritional support, stronger cellular reinforcements, and thus develop more visual field compensation as compared to peripheral RNFL.

Altogether, we believe that there may be a correlation between angle α and the presence of central scotoma, but the timing of ocular examination and the definition of central scotoma may have concealed the underlying correlation in this study.

We further evaluated whether our method is comparable to that of the OCT in reflecting the severity of visual field defect through Spe.

### Visual field loss associated with vigabatrin: Pathological correlations [^115XVGqS]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Pathological changes are reported in the anterior visual pathways of a 41-year-old man with complex partial seizures treated with vigabatrin, who developed bilateral visual field constriction. There was peripheral retinal atrophy with loss of ganglion cells and loss of nerve fibers in the optic nerves, chiasm, and tracts. No evidence of intramyelinic edema was seen. These findings suggest that the primary site of injury lies within the ganglion cells in the retina. The degree of atrophy observed suggests that the visual field loss is irreversible.

### Scattered depressions with temporal preponderance in visual field test coexisting with optic disc temporal atrophy in cerebral arteriovenous malformation [^116uCL2k]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Cerebral vascular abnormalities, including arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), are common incidental and asymptomatic findings on noninvasive imaging studies. AVMs are considered slow-growing congenital lesions that can cause a wide spectrum of visual field defects due to involvement of the visual paths. Since each AVM is associated with its own unique natural history, the association between the characteristics of an AVM and visual field defects remains unpredictable. There is no evidence indicating a correlation between the size and localization of an AVM and the pattern of visual field defects. However, closer localization to the posterior cerebral region can generally cause a more congruent visual field defect.

In this article, we present a case with nonchiasmatic cerebral AVM, which revealed optic disc temporal pallor associated with scattered depressions with temporal preponderance in a visual field test resembling bitemporal hemianopsia.

### Preferred retinal locus locations in age-related macular degeneration [^115PzguW]. Retina (2018). Low credibility.

An evaluation of the preferred retinal locus (PRL) in patients with age-related macular degeneration and a central scotoma is becoming a standard practice in low-vision rehabilitation. This study retrospectively examines PRL specifications to determine any correlation with the best-corrected visual acuities of patients with age-related macular degeneration.

- **Methods**: Seventy-two patients with macular degeneration (144 eyes) were included in the study. The PRLs were evaluated monocularly with a scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Each PRL's location, the fovea-PRL distance, the PRL edge of the lesion distance, and PRL stability were measured with the built-in caliper of the ophthalmoscope.

- **Results**: The most frequent PRL location was nasal (29.2%). The PRL was located in the left visual field of 34.0% of the patients. The best-corrected visual acuity values positively correlated with the lesion's vertical and horizontal dimensions, the surface area, the PRL-fovea distance, the PRL border of the lesion distance, and PRL stability.

- **Conclusion**: The clinical PRL evaluation methodology described can facilitate decisions on providing optimal visual rehabilitation to patients with a central scotoma.

### Left-right and upper-lower light sensitivity asymmetry in visual field defects caused by pituitary adenoma: A retrospective observational study [^114ukBQr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Different frequencies of severe scotoma were observed between the superior and inferior visual field quadrants in the temporal and nasal hemifields. Although upper-lower asymmetry was less prominent in the nasal hemifield, the upper-lower relationship in this hemifield was the inverse of the relationship in the temporal hemifield. Notably, the frequency of severe scotoma was higher in the inferonasal quadrant compared to the superonasal quadrant (P = 0.00268, Mann–Whitney U-test).

The maximum diameter of the pituitary adenoma in the patients of the present study measured on the preoperative MRI was 30.3 ± 8.8 mm (mean ± standard deviation; range, 12–50 mm). Representative Humphrey 30–2 perimetry results for asymmetric and symmetric visual field defects, coupled with the corresponding MRI images, are discussed below.

- **Figure 5**: Visual representation of the differences in severe scotoma frequencies in visual field quadrants.

- **Figure 6**: Preoperative MRI images and Humphrey 30–2 perimetry results:
	- (A) T1 image and (B) constructive interference in steady-state image of a 68-year-old man with pituitary adenoma show a right-sided deviation in the coronal section through the optic chiasm. The visual field defects in the preoperative greyscale display of Humphrey 30–2 results in the left eye are less severe compared with those of the right eye (C).
	- Similarly, another set of preoperative MRI of a 60-year-old man shows a symmetric pituitary adenoma located below the center of the optic chiasm in (D) T1 image and (E) T2 image. The Humphrey 30–2 results of the patient indicate symmetric visual field defects.

### Congruency in homonymous hemianopia [^116BuoFi]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

To evaluate the value of congruency in the localization of brain lesions in patients with homonymous hemianopia (HH), a retrospective observational study was conducted. Charts of all patients with HH seen over 15 years were reviewed. Only patients with incomplete HH documented on formal visual field testing and neuroimaging were included. HH was considered congruent when the fields of both eyes were identical in shape, depth, and size. Patients were divided into two groups based on the congruency of HH, and demographic, clinical, and radiological characteristics were compared.

A total of 530 patients with 548 incomplete HH were included, consisting of 373 cases of congruent HH and 175 cases of incongruent HH. Demographic variables were similar in both groups. Stroke was the cause of 75% of congruent HH and 55.8% of incongruent HH. Trauma and tumors caused 20.5% of congruent HH and 34.5% of incongruent HH (P < .001). The distribution of lesion locations in congruent HH versus incongruent HH included the occipital lobe in 47.9% vs. 21.3%, occipital lobe and optic radiations in 8.3% vs. 5.6%, optic radiations in 32.4% vs. 50.6%, optic tract in 7.2% vs. 16.3%, and other locations in 4.2% vs. 6.3% (P < .0001).

Although there was a trend toward more congruent HH for lesions of the posterior visual pathways (P < .001), 50% of optic tract lesions and 59% of optic radiation lesions produced congruent HH. It was concluded that, while lesions involving the occipital lobe characteristically produce congruent HH, at least 50% of lesions in other locations also produce congruent HH, especially if these lesions are stroke-related.

### Homonymous hemiatrophy of ganglion cell layer from retrochiasmal lesions in the visual pathway [^116vLKwo]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the temporal evolution, morphology, and frequency of macular ganglion cell atrophy in patients with retrochiasmal lesions of the visual pathway.

Methods: In a consecutive retrospective case series, we identified 47 patients with homonymous hemianopia and accessible macular optical coherence tomography scans. We estimated the time of lesion onset and the location of the lesion within the afferent visual pathway. Using semiautomatic layer segmentation, we determined ganglion cell layer thickness in areas projecting to the side of the retrochiasmal lesion and compared it with ganglion cell layer thickness on the healthy side.

Results: We found that retrochiasmal lesions at any level may be associated with an atrophy of ganglion cells. This atrophy respects the vertical midline through the fovea, and thus the anatomic separation of the nasal and temporal visual field. The vertical line separating the affected from the unaffected side has significantly less tilt compared with the disc-fovea angle. Lesions of the optic tract are associated with earlier macular ganglion cell atrophy than retrogeniculate lesions. Macular ganglion cell atrophy may be present in cases with normal peripapillary nerve fiber layer analysis and vice versa.

Conclusions: Macular ganglion cell layer thickness shows a topographic hemiatrophy in retrochiasmal lesions, which manifests earlier for tract lesions than for retrogeniculate lesions. This additional examination of ganglion cell homonymous hemiatrophy has a higher sensitivity in detecting retrograde transsynaptic degeneration.

### Highly accurate retinotopic maps of the physiological blind spot in human visual cortex [^111Qt3NK]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). High credibility.

The visual cortex in the occipital lobe contains precise topographic maps, with neighboring locations of the observer's visual field encoded by adjacent populations of neurons. Damage at various stages of the primary visual pathway results in localized vision loss, such as retinal damage in age‐related macular degeneration and glaucoma, as well as stroke or brain trauma that can impact structures at later stages of the human visual hierarchy. These regions of localized loss of visual sensitivity from damage, known as scotomas, are not entirely irreversible. There is evidence for plasticity by which the brain reorganizes mappings between inputs and neural responses in regions surrounding the region of acquired blindness — either through prolonged experience or active perceptual learning [Barbot et al; Gilbert; Miller et al; Saionz et al.]. Such plasticity may enable the visual system to compensate for some vision loss by making better use of intact neural circuitry.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) theoretically enables researchers to study neural processing and map reorganization around the scotomas of human participants in a non‐invasive fashion. Advances in neuroimaging technology and data analysis methods have greatly enhanced our understanding of neural functioning in the visual cortex. For over a decade, population receptive field (pRF) analysis has become an important method in the toolkit of visual neuroscientists [Dumoulin & Wandell; Wandell & Winawer].

### Sabril [^114nijrh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

WARNING: PERMANENT VISION LOSS

Sabril can cause permanent bilateral concentric visual field constriction, including tunnel vision, that can result in disability. In some cases, Sabril can also damage the central retina and may decrease visual acuity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The onset of vision loss from Sabril is unpredictable, occurring anywhere from within weeks of starting treatment to even months or years afterward.

Symptoms of vision loss from Sabril are unlikely to be recognized by patients or caregivers before the loss becomes severe. Even milder vision loss, often unrecognized, can adversely affect function. The risk of vision loss increases with higher doses and greater cumulative exposure; however, no dose or exposure level is known to be free of risk.

Vision assessment is recommended at baseline (no later than four weeks after starting Sabril), at least every three months during therapy, and roughly 3 to 6 months after discontinuation of therapy. Once detected, vision loss due to Sabril is irreversible. Despite frequent monitoring, some patients will develop severe vision loss. If visual loss is documented, consider drug discontinuation, balancing the benefits and risks.

The risk of new or worsening vision loss continues as long as Sabril is used, and it is possible that the vision loss can worsen even after discontinuation of Sabril. Due to the risk of visual loss, Sabril should be withdrawn from patients with refractory complex partial seizures who fail to show significant improvement.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113iwuqn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, specifically in relation to watchful waiting, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend obtaining visual field testing in patients with a pituitary incidentaloma that enlarges to abut or compress the optic nerves or chiasm on follow-up imaging. It is advised to avoid obtaining visual field testing in patients with incidentalomas that are not situated close to the chiasm, exhibit no new symptoms, and are being closely monitored by MRI.

### MRI of optic tract lesions: Review and correlation with visual field defects [^115H3CfM]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Visual field defects represent a complex array of visual impairments that originate from diseases impacting the optic nerve, extending from the globe to the visual cortex. These defects require perimetry or visual confrontation for accurate delineation and can arise from various causes. This review focuses on chiasmatic and post-chiasmatic origins of visual disturbances, with particular attention to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. New advancements in MRI, such as diffusion-tensor imaging, are explored. The study correlates MRI images with perimetric findings to demonstrate lesion localization within the visual pathway. This serves as a valuable reference tool for clinicians and radiologists during the early diagnostic phase, assisting in differentiating the causes of various visual field defects encountered in daily practice.

### Scattered depressions with temporal preponderance in visual field test coexisting with optic disc temporal atrophy in cerebral arteriovenous malformation [^111YjuzK]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) produce circulatory and functional disturbances. Regarding the pathophysiology of these effects, the hemodynamic results of cerebral AVMs are not clearly understood. To our knowledge, the anatomy of visual field defects generated by lesions located between the retina and primary visual cortex has been clearly identified. Bitemporal hemianopsia associated with optic disc nasal atrophy due to chronic papilledema was described more than 20 years ago in association with intracranial AVMs. On the contrary, a bitemporal hemianopsia-like visual field defect associated with bilateral optic disc temporal atrophy has not been reported so far in cerebral AVM.

Vascular steal syndrome with blood shunting resulting in partial ischemia may theoretically cause different types of visual field defects in AVMs. Decreased blood flow and local compression were demonstrated in cerebral regions next to AVMs. Partial infarction of nerve fiber bundles following vascular steal syndrome was described as a possible reason for unusual visual field defects. It may also be possible that the AVM caused some compression, with or without vascular steal, over the optic chiasm at an earlier date due to its close proximity to the chiasma, and it may have regressed in size at presentation.

Some anatomical variants of the optic nerve might be responsible for temporal pallor. In healthy eyes, the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) is thicker superiorly and inferiorly and thinner nasally and temporally. Split bundle patterns, appearing either superiorly (most frequent), inferiorly, or both, have been described as real anatomic phenomena.

### Objective perimetry using the multifocal visual evoked potential in central visual pathway lesions [^1111YLbH]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

To examine the ability of the multifocal pattern visual evoked potential (mVEP) to detect field loss in neurological lesions affecting the visual pathway from the chiasm to the cortex, mVEPs recorded in the clinic were retrospectively reviewed for any cases involving central neurological lesions. Recordings had been performed with the AccuMap V1.3 objective perimeter, which used an array of four bipolar occipital electrodes to provide four differently oriented channels for simultaneous recording. Nineteen patients with hemianopias were identified. Of these, there were 10 homonymous hemianopias with hemifield type loss, two bitemporal hemianopias, and seven homonymous hemianopias with quadrantanopic distribution. A comparison with subjective field results and CT/MRI findings was conducted to determine the relation between the two methods of visual field mapping and any relation with the anatomical location of the lesion and the mVEP results.

In all hemianopic type cases (12), the defect was demonstrated on the mVEP and showed good correspondence in the location of the scotoma (nine homonymous and two bitemporal). The topographic distribution was similar, but not identical, to subjective testing. Of the seven quadrantanopic type hemianopias, only four were found to have corresponding mVEP losses in the same areas. In the three cases where the mVEP was normal, the type of quadrantanopia had features consistent with an extra-striate lesion being very congruous, complete, and respecting the horizontal meridian.

The mVEP can detect field loss from cortical lesions effectively.

### Update on the diagnosis and treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) - Revised recommendations of the neuromyelitis optica study group (NEMOS). Part I: Diagnosis and differential diagnosis [^114MfjWJ]. Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Visual field testing is recommended as it provides supportive differential diagnostic information, helps assess attack severity, and may be important for monitoring the efficacy and extent of treatment-driven or spontaneous attack resolution in patients with acute NMOSD-ON. Perimetric studies have demonstrated non-central scotomas (altitudinal, quadrant, three-quadrant, hemianopsia, and bitemporal hemianopsia) in around 25% of patients with AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD-ON, whereas MS patients typically exhibit central scotoma. Altitudinal hemianopia is the most common type of non-central scotoma in NMOSD and is rare in MOG-EM/MOGAD but may also occur in double-seronegative ON. Complete visual field loss during acute attacks is more frequent in NMOSD and MOG-EM/MOGAD than in MS.

### Natural history of homonymous hemianopia [^117SgE8M]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

To describe the characteristics of spontaneous recovery of homonymous hemianopia (HH), the authors conducted a study.

The authors reviewed medical records of all patients with HH confirmed by formal visual field testing and seen in follow-up in their service between 1989 and 2004. Clinical characteristics, causes, neuroradiologic definition of lesion location, final outcome, and evolution of the visual field defects were recorded. The associations among final visual field defect outcome, time from injury, and clinical features were analyzed.

A total of 254 patients with 263 HH were included in this study. Spontaneous visual field defect recovery was observed in 101 HH (38.4%). The likelihood of spontaneous recovery decreased with increasing time from injury to initial visual field testing (p = 0.0003). The probability of improvement was related to the time since injury (p = 0.0003), with a 50 to 60% chance of improvement for cases tested within 1 month after injury. This probability decreased to about 20% for cases tested at 6 months after surgery. No other factor was found to correlate with the final outcome of the visual field defects. Improvement after 6 months from injury was mild and usually related to improvement of the underlying disease.

In conclusion, spontaneous improvement of homonymous hemianopia is seen in at least 50% of patients first seen within 1 month of injury. In most cases, the improvement occurs within the first 3 months from injury. Spontaneous improvement after 6 months post-injury should be interpreted with caution as it is most likely related to the improvement of the underlying disease.

### Sub-acute blindness in a patient with a temporal lobe astrocytoma [^116FyUKQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

This report describes an unusual case of a middle-aged man who suffered sub-acute visual loss, rendering him blind over a period of 4 weeks. This was associated with the diagnosis of a right temporal lobe World Health Organization grade 4 astrocytoma (glioblastoma multiforme). Chronic papilloedema had been diagnosed at presentation and persisted after his debulking surgery, although there was no radiological evidence of direct involvement (by compression or infiltration) of the visual pathways. This case report describes the sub-acute on chronic nature of his visual loss and suggests possible causes and preventative measures for visual loss in these patients.

### Chiasmal herniation following treatment of pituitary macroadenoma [^117Xt65u]. Pituitary (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with pituitary macroadenomas typically present with bitemporal hemianopsia, a partial blindness where vision is missing in the outer half of the visual field (VF), as a result of an elevated and compressed optic chiasm. Based on the type of tumor, decompression by resection or size reduction by pharmacological treatment results in immediate and significant improvement of VF in the vast majority of patients. However, in some patients, delayed deterioration of the VF and visual acuity (VA) is observed following initial post-treatment improvement. In the clinical work-up of this deterioration, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is performed to exclude new chiasmal compression caused by a recurrent tumor or growth of a remnant. Strikingly, several of these patients showed a radiological herniation, i.e. a (new) downward displacement of the optic chiasm into a secondary enlarged sella, raising the question of whether this is (one of) the reasons for deterioration of VF.

The most accepted hypotheses regarding the pathophysiological mechanism of the secondary downward displacement of the optic chiasm and its relation with deteriorating VF and VA are based on tethering of scar tissue, enlargement of the sella turcica, and a deficient sellar diaphragm, the roof of the sella turcica, or a combination. This results in the downward displacement of the optic chiasm, stretching the optic nerves and causing deterioration of the VF.

A PubMed search resulted in a total of 23 studies, and most studies focused on downward displacement of the optic chiasm and VF deterioration.

### Discordance between subjective perimetric visual fields and objective multifocal visual evoked potential-determined visual fields in patients with hemianopsia [^116LmGps]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the concordance between subjectively and objectively acquired visual fields in patients with subjectively determined hemianopsia.

This was a retrospective observational study involving ten patients, six men and four women, ranging in age from 28 to 68 years. The subjectively determined visual fields were obtained using Goldmann or Humphrey perimeters for up to 25 degrees of eccentricity. The VERIS Scientific System (Electro-Diagnostic Imaging, San Francisco, California, USA) was used to record multifocal visual evoked potentials (mfVEPs) to obtain the objective visual fields. Each of the 60 black-and-white segments of the checkerboard stimulus was alternated according to a binary m sequence. The first slices of the second-order kernels were extracted and analyzed.

In five cases, the visual field loci where the mfVEPs were within normal limits corresponded to the scotomatous areas obtained by conventional perimetry. In these discordant cases, the lesions (e.g. arteriovenous malformation) were located in the occipital lobe. Two of these cases had a complete recovery of the subjective visual field. The lesions of the concordant cases were located outside the occipital lobe (e.g. pituitary adenoma). In these cases, no visual field improvement was seen. The temporal crescent syndrome was ruled out in patients with posterior lesions by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings.

In conclusion, in some patients with occipital lesions, the subjective and objective visual field results are discordant.

### Long-term follow-up of torpedo maculopathy: A case series and mini-review [^115SpaRx]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Case 2**: A color fundus photography demonstrates a horizontally oval, hyperpigmented, torpedo-shaped lesion containing a central pseudolacuna in the right eye. A small satellite lesion is noted adjacent to the temporal margin of the lesion. Serial photography documents apparent stability of the lesion over the 10-year observation period.

- **Fundus autofluorescence**: This demonstrates typical features of torpedo maculopathy (TM), including hypoautofluorescence of the lesion interior and hyperautofluorescence of the lesion margins. The lesion is interrupted near the temporal margin by a tongue of tissue with a normal autofluorescence signal that splits the lesion into two parts. This corresponds to the observed satellite lesion at the temporal edge of the torpedo lesion. There is no apparent change in the signal pattern over the observation period.

- **Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy**: Images with the location of the corresponding B-scan are highlighted in the baseline and 10-year follow-up exam.

- **Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT)**: Each image represents a horizontal B-scan through approximately the same location in the middle of the torpedo lesion. Because the examinations were performed on different instruments at each time period, the scans are not of the identical fundus location. Nonetheless, they are as close to the same fundus location as possible. At the 10-year follow-up visit, some progression of the inner retinal degeneration is seen. A few small cystic spaces are seen under the inner limiting membrane at baseline, and they appear larger and more numerous at the 10-year visit.

### Paracentral and cecocentral scotomas after pars plana vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment [^114BGYN8]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to describe novel paracentral and cecocentral visual scotomas after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) repair over a 5-year period.

- **Design**: Retrospective case series.

- **Methods**: This retrospective review encompassed all patients who reported visual scotomas following 23- or 25-gauge PPV (Constellation Vision System, Alcon, Fort Worth, Texas, USA) for RRD repair by a single surgeon (RNK) from January 2013 through December 2018. All patients underwent multimodal imaging, including fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, autofluorescence, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), along with standardized central Humphrey visual field (HVF) testing to further characterize the visual scotomas.

- **Results**: Nine patients reported visual scotomas after PPV for RRD from January 2013 to December 2018, reflecting an incidence rate of 6.4% (9 out of 140). The average age was 61 years (range 53–71 years), with three of nine patients being female. The preceding RRD was macula-sparing in six out of nine patients, all involving the right eye. Seven out of nine patients reported the central scotoma within the first week post-surgery. All nine patients noted paracentral or cecocentral location of scotomas involving the inferior temporal visual field. Multimodal imaging was only significant for a corresponding focal superior nasal ganglion cell loss identifiable on spectral-domain OCT. Two out of nine patients experienced symptomatic visual loss from the scotoma as it affected the center of fixation.

- **Conclusions**: We report a novel central/paracentral visual field defect occurring after PPV for RRD repair. The paracentral scotoma was located…

### EANO guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diffuse gliomas of adulthood [^112c2NfR]. Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma can be associated with a variety of symptoms, including memory impairment, nausea, aphasia, alexia, contralateral neglect, apraxia, and papilledema. Patients may also experience bitemporal hemianopia, fatigue, sensory deficits, increased intracranial pressure, focal neurologic deficits, vomiting, headache, and ataxia.

Additional symptoms can include incoordination, limb weakness, motor impairment, altered level of consciousness, nystagmus, diplopia, homonymous hemianopia, dizziness, and behavioral or personality changes. Some patients report menstrual irregularity, cognitive difficulties, gait disturbance, seizures, hair loss, and anosognosia.

### Photophobia in a blind patient: An alternate visual pathway. Case report [^113FcqQz]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Photophobia is a common neurological and ophthalmological symptom that has been associated with a growing number of neurosurgical conditions, especially compressive lesions. Although the exact signaling pathways and neurophysiological features of the disorder are not well understood, data from multiple studies have highlighted the significance of the trigeminal system and the pretectal nuclei in its pathophysiology. The authors report on a rare case of a blind patient who presented with photophobia without evidence of light perception. They also review the literature and early experimental data to better understand the possible neuronal pathways and structures involved in photophobia.

### The ability of healthy volunteers to simulate a neurologic field defect on automated perimetry [^111sXSfo]. Ophthalmology (2014). High credibility.

To determine if volunteers can simulate and reproduce three types of neurologic field defects — hemianopia, quadrantanopia, and central scotoma — a cross-sectional study was conducted with thirty healthy volunteers new to perimetry, including automated perimetry. After informed consent, volunteers were randomized to one of the three visual field defects listed. All visual field testing was performed on the right eye using the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) SITA Fast 24–2 protocol. Each volunteer was provided with standard new patient instructions and shown a diagram of the defect to be simulated. Two sets of visual fields were performed on the right eye with a 10-minute interval between tests. Three experts, using the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study reading center criteria, determined if the simulation was successful.

- **Main outcome measures**: Proportion of volunteers able to simulate the assigned visual field.

- **Results**: All ten volunteers (100%) successfully simulated a hemianopia on the first and second fields. All ten volunteers (100%) simulated a quadrantanopia on the first field, and nine (90%) did so on the second field. Eight volunteers (80%) successfully simulated a central scotoma in the first field, and all ten (100%) did so on the second field. Reliability criteria were excellent. Forty-seven fields (78%) had 0 fixation losses, 48 (80%) had 0 false-positive results, and 44 (73%) had 0 false-negative results.

- **Conclusions**: It is easy to simulate reproducible and reliable neurologic field defects on automated perimetry using this method.

### Nonuniform pressure generation in the optic chiasm may explain bitemporal hemianopsia [^115oJzJg]. Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

To measure the pressure in the temporal and central aspects of the chiasm simultaneously during compression of the optic chiasm from below with an expanding simulated tumor, an experimental study was conducted. Craniotomies were performed on 5 unfixed cadaveric specimens ranging in age from 49 to 89 years, and the optic chiasm was exposed. After a pediatric gauge Foley catheter was inserted into the sellar region, the temporal side of the chiasm (temporal aspect uncrossed fibers) was impaled with a 30-gauge needle connected to a pressure transducer. Similarly, the central portion of the chiasm (crossed fibers) was impaled with another 30-gauge needle connected to a pressure transducer on a separate channel. The Foley catheter was inflated for a period of 30 seconds to 1 minute, and the pressure in each channel was continuously monitored. Multiple trials were performed on each of the 5 specimens.

The main outcome measure was the pressure change between the temporal and nasal aspects of the optic chiasm. In all cases in which intrachiasmal pressure could be measured, higher pressures were always generated in the central aspect of the chiasm than in the temporal aspect of the chiasm. In cadaver 1, the mean central pressure was 19.75 mmHg, whereas the mean temporal pressure was 6 mmHg. In cadaver 5, the mean central pressure was 4 mmHg, whereas the mean temporal pressure was zero. Donors 70 and older demonstrated abnormally thin and frail chiasms that were unable to support a sustained pressure increase during simulated tumor expansion.

### Primary visual cortical thickness in correlation with visual field defects in patients with pituitary macroadenomas: A structural 7-Tesla retinotopic analysis [^1169Yiqo]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2020). Low credibility.

Vision loss remains a debilitating complication of pituitary adenomas, although there is considerable variability in visual impairment before and after decompression surgery. Growing evidence suggests that secondary damage to remote visual structures may contribute to vision loss in patients with chiasmatic compression. This study leverages ultrahigh-field 7-T MRI to examine the retinotopic organization of the primary visual cortex (V1) and correlates visual defects with cortical thinning in V1 to characterize the consequences of pituitary adenomas on the posterior visual system.

- **Methods**: Eight patients (4 males and 4 females, mean age 44.3 years) with pituitary adenomas exhibiting chiasmatic compression and visual field defects, as well as 8 matched healthy controls (4 males and 4 females, mean age 43.3 years), were scanned using 7-T MRI for this prospective study. Whole-brain cortical thickness was calculated using an automated algorithm. A previously published surface-based algorithm was employed to associate the eccentricity and polar angle with each position in V1. Cortical thickness was measured at each point in the retinotopic organization, and a cortical thickness ratio was generated against matched controls for each point in the visual fields. Patients with adenoma also underwent neuro-ophthalmological examination, including 24–2 Humphrey automated visual field perimetry. Pattern deviation (PD) of each point in the visual field, i.e. the deviation in point detection compared with neurologically healthy controls, was correlated with cortical thickness.

### Traumatic homonymous hemianopia [^111F8APZ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of patients with homonymous hemianopia resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) observed in our unit between 1989 and 2004.

Methods: Only patients with a history of TBI, who had detailed clinical information and results of neuroimaging, were included in our study. Demographic characteristics, clinical features, types of visual field defects, location of lesions, and the evolution of visual field defects were recorded.

Results: Of the 880 patients with homonymous hemianopia seen in our unit, 103 patients (112 with homonymous hemianopia) had TBI. This group consisted of 74 men and 29 women, with a mean age of 30.7 years (SD 15.3). The median time from injury to initial visual field testing was 5 months, with a range of 0.5 to 360 months. Among the patients, 64 (57.1%) sustained motor vehicle-related injuries, 19 (17%) were violence-related, 17 (15.2%) were due to falls, and 12 (10.7%) resulted from other blunt head traumas. Visual field defects included complete homonymous hemianopia in 44 (39.3%) patients and incomplete homonymous hemianopia in 68 (60.7%) patients. Lesions were occipital in 14 (12.5%) patients, associated with optic radiation in 26 (23.2%), and with the optic tract in 12 (10.7%). Multiple lesions were present in 60 (53.6%) of the cases.

Conclusion: Most cases of homonymous hemianopia from TBI were motor vehicle-related. Patients were younger, more often male, and had multiple brain lesions more frequently than patients with homonymous hemianopia from causes other than TBI. A median delay of 5 months was observed before the documentation of the homonymous hemianopia, which may have a major effect on the success of rehabilitation.
