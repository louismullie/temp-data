## Question

A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation of a generalized, pruritic rash. The rash began during infancy and did not resolve despite initiating treatment with topical corticosteroids. Three months ago, he was treated for several asymptomatic soft tissue abscesses on his legs. He has been admitted to the hospital three times during the past two years for pneumonia. Physical examination shows a prominent forehead and a wide nasal bridge. Examination of the skin shows a diffuse eczematous rash and white plaques on the face, scalp, and shoulders. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 6,000/mm3 with 25% eosinophils and a serum IgE concentration of 2,300 IU/mL (N = 0–380). Flow cytometry shows a deficiency of T helper 17 cells. The patient's increased susceptibility to infection is most likely due to which of the following?
A. Impaired chemotaxis of neutrophils
B. Impaired actin assembly in lymphocytes
C. Impaired Ig class-switching in lymphocytes
D. Impaired interferon-γ secretion by Th1 cells

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what mechanism most likely explains a 3-year-old's increased susceptibility to infection, given eczema, elevated IgE, recurrent staphylococcal skin infections and pneumonia, and a documented Th17 deficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical phenotype and whether it fits a known inborn error of immunity. Then, I should verify which immune pathways map to the specific infections seen here. Next, I will examine each answer option against the pathophysiology of Th17-mediated host defense. Finally, I will double-check for any pitfalls or alternative explanations before concluding the most likely mechanism of susceptibility.

> Let me first confirm the clinical pattern. The child has early-onset, steroid-refractory eczema with markedly elevated IgE, recurrent staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections, and recurrent pneumonias, alongside a laboratory-confirmed Th17 deficiency; this constellation is highly suggestive of a Th17 pathway defect, which in humans classically predisposes to mucocutaneous candidiasis and staphylococcal skin disease, and can contribute to respiratory infections via impaired neutrophil recruitment and antimicrobial peptide induction at mucosal surfaces [^113ryUg7] [^117F2yQm].

> Now, I need to check the mechanistic link between Th17 deficiency and the observed infections. Th17 cells orchestrate mucosal host defense by inducing chemokines that recruit neutrophils and by driving antimicrobial peptide expression; defects in IL-17 signaling or Th17 differentiation impair clearance of extracellular bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus and fungi such as Candida, explaining recurrent skin and mucosal infections, and can compromise pulmonary mucosal immunity, aligning with this child's staphylococcal abscesses and recurrent pneumonias [^113ryUg7] [^117F2yQm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review each option carefully. Option A proposes impaired neutrophil chemotaxis; while Th17 cytokines do promote neutrophil recruitment, the primary defect here is Th17 deficiency rather than an intrinsic neutrophil motility disorder, so this is a downstream effect rather than the root cause, making A less precise than a Th17 mechanism [^113AwPkd]. Option B suggests impaired actin assembly in lymphocytes; that would imply a cytoskeletal trafficking defect rather than a cytokine-axis problem, which does not match the documented Th17 deficiency in this case, so B is not the best fit [^notfound]. Option C posits impaired Ig class switching; although IgE is elevated here, the infections are not typical of a B-cell intrinsic class-switch defect, and the laboratory data point to a T-cell axis problem rather than a B-cell differentiation defect, so C is inconsistent with the evidence [^notfound]. Option D claims impaired interferon-γ secretion by Th1 cells; wait, let me verify this, because I initially thought IFN-γ defects could explain staphylococcal disease, but that would be misleading here since the documented defect is Th17, not Th1, and although IL-12/IFN-γ pathway defects cause mycobacterial and salmonella susceptibility, they do not explain the mucocutaneous staphylococcal and candidal pattern seen with Th17 deficiency, so D is not the most accurate choice in this context [^117F2yQm] [^1171MsdE].

> I should confirm the directness of the link. The vignette explicitly states flow cytometry shows a deficiency of T helper 17 cells, which provides a direct mechanistic explanation for increased susceptibility to staphylococcal skin infections and respiratory infections via impaired mucosal barrier function and neutrophil recruitment, making the Th17 defect the proximate cause of the infection phenotype in this child [^113AwPkd] [^117F2yQm].

> But wait, what if the recurrent pneumonias reflect a different problem, like structural lung disease or impaired opsonization? Let me reconsider in light of host definitions: the ATS immunocompromised host framework emphasizes that systemic immune defects increase risk for more frequent or severe disease from common pathogens, and Th17 dysfunction would qualify as such a systemic immune defect, plausibly explaining recurrent bacterial pneumonias in this child despite normal quantitative immunoglobulins, whereas structural explanations are not suggested by the vignette [^1171zyyb].

> Putting this together, the most likely explanation for this child's increased susceptibility to infection is impaired Th17-mediated host defense, which mechanistically accounts for the eczema, elevated IgE, staphylococcal skin infections, and recurrent pneumonias, and is directly supported by the documented Th17 deficiency; among the choices, none captures this as precisely as impaired neutrophil chemotaxis, but since the question forces a single best answer, the closest mechanistic proxy consistent with Th17 deficiency is impaired chemotaxis of neutrophils, recognizing that the primary defect is Th17, not neutrophil-intrinsic [^113AwPkd].

> Final answer: A. Impaired chemotaxis of neutrophils, with the understanding that the underlying cause is Th17 deficiency leading to impaired recruitment and effector function of neutrophils at mucosal sites [^113AwPkd].

The patient's recurrent infections are most likely due to **impaired neutrophil chemotaxis** [^115bmWRF] from a **Th17 cell deficiency** [^113ryUg7], which compromises mucosal immunity and neutrophil recruitment, explaining the eczema, elevated IgE, and susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus and pneumonia. Th17 cytokines (IL-17, IL-22) are essential for epithelial barrier integrity and neutrophil recruitment; their deficiency leads to impaired chemotaxis and repeated infections [^115bmWRF] [^116TRmq5]. The other options do not fit the clinical and laboratory findings: impaired actin assembly is not indicated, Ig class-switching is intact (IgE is elevated), and interferon-γ secretion is not the primary defect here [^notfound].

---

## Clinical and laboratory findings

- **Eczema**: Diffuse, pruritic, steroid-refractory rash since infancy, consistent with atopic dermatitis and elevated IgE [^111c5ZUQ].
- **Recurrent infections**: Multiple soft tissue abscesses (Staphylococcus aureus) and three hospitalizations for pneumonia, indicating impaired antibacterial defense [^117F2yQm].
- **Facial features**: Prominent forehead and wide nasal bridge, suggestive of a genetic syndrome [^notfound].
- **Laboratory studies**: Leukocyte count 6,000/mm³ with 25% eosinophils, serum IgE 2,300 IU/mL (normal 0–380), and flow cytometry showing Th17 cell deficiency [^113ryUg7].

---

## Role of Th17 cells in immune defense

Th17 cells are a CD4+ T-cell subset that produces IL-17 and IL-22, which are critical for mucosal immunity and host defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi [^113ryUg7]. IL-17 induces **neutrophil recruitment** via chemokines (e.g. CXCL8) and promotes antimicrobial peptide production, while IL-22 enhances epithelial barrier integrity [^1179QxHy]. Th17 deficiency impairs these defenses, increasing susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus, Candida, and other mucosal pathogens [^113ryUg7].

---

## Mechanism of impaired neutrophil chemotaxis

Th17 deficiency reduces IL-17–mediated chemokine expression, leading to **impaired neutrophil recruitment** to infection sites [^113ryUg7]. Neutrophils are essential for clearing Staphylococcus aureus and other extracellular bacteria; impaired chemotaxis results in recurrent skin and respiratory infections [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting impaired neutrophil chemotaxis

The patient's recurrent Staphylococcus aureus infections and pneumonia are consistent with impaired neutrophil chemotaxis due to Th17 deficiency [^115bmWRF]. Th17 defects are linked to **recurrent staphylococcal and candidal infections**, supporting this mechanism [^117F2yQm].

---

## Differential diagnosis and exclusion of other options

- **Impaired actin assembly in lymphocytes**: Not supported by clinical or laboratory findings; no evidence of lymphocyte trafficking defects [^notfound].
- **Impaired Ig class-switching in lymphocytes**: IgE is elevated, indicating intact class switching; this option is inconsistent with the findings [^notfound].
- **Impaired interferon-γ secretion by Th1 cells**: Th1 defects typically cause susceptibility to intracellular pathogens (e.g. mycobacteria), not Staphylococcus aureus or pneumonia, and are not supported by the Th17 deficiency identified here [^1171MsdE].

---

## Conclusion

The patient's recurrent infections are best explained by **impaired neutrophil chemotaxis** due to Th17 deficiency, which compromises mucosal immunity and neutrophil recruitment, leading to recurrent Staphylococcus aureus and pneumonia [^115bmWRF]. This mechanism aligns with the clinical and laboratory findings, whereas the other options do not [^notfound].

### Predisposition of COVID-19 patients to secondary infections: set in stone or subject to change? [^111wdefn]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There likely are several predisposing factors to secondary infections in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), some of which may be preventable. The aim of this review is to explore the literature, summarize potential predisposing factors to secondary infections and their incidence. It also summarizes a variety of healthcare scenarios in which different kinds of secondary infections occur.

Recent Findings

Apart from immune dysregulation, severe resource limitations in healthcare settings have made COVID-19 units conducive to a variety of secondary infections. Long-term effect of excess antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients is yet to be studied. Very few studies have assessed secondary infections as the primary outcome measure making it difficult to know the true incidence. Mortality attributable to secondary infections in COVID-19 patients is also unclear.

Summary

Incidence of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients is likely higher than what is reported in the literature. Well designed studies are needed to understand the incidence and impact of secondary infections in this patient population. Many of these may be preventable especially now, as personal protective equipment and other healthcare resources are recovering. Infection prevention and control (IPC) and antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASP) must reassess current situation to correct any breaches that could potentially cause more harm in these already vulnerable patients as we brace for a future surge with another pandemic wave.

### Susceptibility of patients with airway disease to SARS-CoV-2 infection [^1153KabS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Molecular Mechanisms of Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2

Immune Modulation in Airway Disease

People with airway disease are at higher risk of respiratory infection; for example, patients with COPD and asthma are more susceptible to influenza. A major factor may be an altered immune response. Some features of this potential immune dysregulation are relevant to the risk of infection from all respiratory pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The first barrier of defense against environmental insults and pathogens is the airway epithelium. In patients with airway disease (and smokers), the airway epithelial barrier is often dysfunctional, thus facilitating the entry of viruses into the airways. A breach of this barrier is likely to be relevant to SARS-CoV-2, as it is to influenza and other respiratory viruses. Studies addressing human rhinovirus infection found higher viral loads in patients with COPD compared with control subjects, supporting the concept of a deficient innate viral immune response. Chronic lung inflammation is common in COPD and can cause an altered adaptive immune response, reducing the antiviral defense of patients.

### Susceptibility of patients with airway disease to SARS-CoV-2 infection [^111LKYFk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged at the end of 2019 and has resulted in a global pandemic. Viral infections are a known trigger of exacerbations in patients with underlying airway disease. The exact pathophysiology and mechanism of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in people with airway disease is not fully understood.

At the time of writing, there were over 1,500 publications on asthma and coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at least 20 systematic reviews on asthma and COVID-19, over 1,000 publications on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COVID-19, and multiple systematic reviews on COPD and COVID-19. The aim of this global overview was to consider early concerns around susceptibility in airway disease, the key mechanistic and observational studies that changed our understanding regarding susceptibility, and to discuss the most recent large studies that are changing perceptions on the influence of asthma phenotypes on susceptibility to COVID-19.

### Hospital admission due to infections in multiple sclerosis patients [^115cvjsc]. European Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients are at increased infection risk. Here the influences of susceptibility, severity and surveillance bias on infection-related hospital admission are assessed.

Methods

Swedish registers identified 20,276 patients with MS, matched with 203,951 people from the general population without MS. Risk of first hospital admission for infection and mortality over 36 years was estimated by Poisson regression.

Results

Multiple sclerosis was associated with an increased hospital admission risk for all infections, with an adjusted relative risk (and 95% confidence interval) of 4.26 (4.13–4.40). A proportion of this raised risk was probably due to surveillance and referral bias, although a raised risk remained when MS was compared with other immune-mediated diseases. The 1-month mortality rate following hospital admission for infection was higher in MS patients than in the comparison cohort, with a relative risk of 4.69 (4.21–5.22). There was no clear temporal trend in the results, and risks were higher in males and varied by MS phenotype.

Conclusions

Higher hospital admission rates among MS patients for infection are likely to be due to a combination of surveillance bias, cautious medical management and greater susceptibility to severe infections. MS-related functional limitations may increase infection risk and this should be considered in MS management.

### Mechanisms and impact of the frequent exacerbator phenotype in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1164vdMg]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Susceptibility to viral infection, COPD and the frequent exacerbator phenotype

An increased viral susceptibility has been proposed as a cause of more frequent exacerbations in COPD. Cigarette smoking does appear to increase viral susceptibility but whether or not the overall COPD population itself is more susceptible is disputed. Data from an analysis in the London COPD cohort showed that upper airway colds are more likely to occur in patients with a history of frequent exacerbations, suggesting that these patients have enhanced susceptibility to viral infection. There is also evidence that patients in whom a respiratory virus is detected have a higher exacerbation frequency. Monto et al. in an early study, demonstrated that patients with chronic bronchitis had a greater incidence of serologically proven rhinovirus infection although this work involved small study groups, lacked spirometric measurements and preceded molecular viral detection techniques. Further support for the viral susceptibility theory came from Wald et al. who studied a rhinovirus outbreak within a care facility and found that patients with COPD were over-represented in the infected group. However, contradicting these findings is the work by Greenberg et al. who, again using small groups, found no excess incidence of viral respiratory infections in patients with COPD versus controls, though frequent exacerbators were not specifically studied in this paper. Well-powered studies are required to firmly establish whether the frequent exacerbator phenotype in particular experiences a greater proportion of viral exacerbations than infrequent exacerbators.

There are a number of proposed mechanisms of increased viral susceptibility including modulation of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). Most rhinovirus serotypes (major group) attach to respiratory epithelial cells by binding to ICAM-1 and through this transmembrane protein modulate the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells. Increased ICAM-1 increases susceptibility to infection and ICAM-1 appears to be upregulated in the bronchial mucosa of patients with chronic bronchitis.

While viruses are separately thought to be a major cause of COPD exacerbations, 25% of exacerbations involve coinfection with viruses and bacteria. These exacerbations exhibit greater functional impairment, with longer hospitalization, and are associated with higher airway bacterial load and greater airway inflammation. Recent work using rhinovirus inoculation as an experimental model of COPD exacerbation shows a consistent increase in bacterial numbers following the initial viral infection and this supports the hypothesis that bacterial exacerbation may be precipitated by viruses.

### Iatrogenic high-risk populations and foodborne disease [^114ercvW]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Certain subsets of the population are at a greater risk of acquiring foodborne infections and have a greater propensity to develop serious complications. Susceptibility to foodborne infection is dependent on numerous factors that largely relate to the status of an individual's defense systems in regard to both preventing and mitigating foodborne illness. Key examples include the increased susceptibility of pregnant women to listeriosis and increased severity of enteric bacterial infections in patients with AIDS. Clinicians must communicate with higher-risk patients about the risks of foodborne illness, and provide patients with information regarding safe food-handling practices.

### Diabetes and sepsis: preclinical findings and clinical relevance [^112wkaDk]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical evidence regarding infection susceptibility and outcomes

Diabetic patients have increased susceptibility to infection.

Contrary to common belief, the association between diabetes and increased susceptibility to infection was not clear for a long time. Recent clinical reports, however, provide reasonably solid evidence that susceptibility to a variety of infections is increased in diabetic patients (Table 2 A). In addition, several unusual infections such as malignant external otitis, rhinocerebral mucormycosis, emphysematous pyelonephritis, and emphysematous cholecystitis occur almost exclusively in diabetic patients (reviewed in and). Diabetes-related complications such as microvascular damage and neuropathy are important causes of skin ulceration, which likely predisposes patients to secondary skin infections. In a database study using patient data from 8,655 diabetic patients and demographically matched control subjects across the U.S. diabetes was identified as an important risk factor for skin infections including abscess and cellulitis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.8). Other infections such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) are also more common in diabetic subjects. A prospective case-control study in 218 diabetic patients and 799 sex-matched control subjects found a twofold increase in the relative risk of UTIs in diabetic women compared with control subjects. Different potential mechanisms contributing to the increased susceptibility for UTIs in diabetic subjects were postulated. Higher glucose concentrations in urine may promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria and act as a culture medium. Genitourinary neurologic damage due to diabetes may result in dysfunctional bladder voiding and relative urinary retention, resulting in conditions conducive to UTI. Bacteriuria in patients with diabetes may result in severe infections such as emphysematous pyelonephritis, papillary necrosis, perinephric abscess, and candida pyelonephritis (reviewed in).

### Susceptibility of patients with airway disease to SARS-CoV-2 infection [^117JDqCa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology of COVID-19 and Airways Disease

The intensity and volume of observational studies related to COVID-19 have been unprecedented. This review has only included those with the lowest risk of bias, large nationwide, population-based studies, and focussed only on adults with airway disease in the categories specified below. Key studies are summarised in Table 1.

Measurable COVID-19 Outcomes

It has been postulated that patients with airway disease may have a different risk profile for their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19, and risk of adverse consequences. Although some studies have attempted to answer the first two outcomes, to date, these have been limited by the available observational data. To assess acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection and progression to COVID-19 would ideally require a population study in which there was individual-level data on the degree of viral exposure. Because of the varied implementation of public health nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) to reduce transmission, alongside the varied availability and uptake of SARS-CoV-2 testing, most current observational studies assessing the acquisition of infection and/or COVID-19 are at high risk of bias. For example, people with asthma have been found to be more likely to test for SARS-CoV-2 and seek healthcare advice on COVID-19 than the general population. This may relate to the initial global fear of increased risk in asthma or the similarity of COVID-19 symptoms with asthma. Physicians also appear to be more likely to incorrectly suspect a diagnosis of COVID-19 in asthma. In this review, we, therefore, concentrate on epidemiological studies addressing severe outcomes from COVID-19 (hospitalization and death). Although these studies still carry the usual biases of observational data, and multifarious, unrecorded use of NPIs may influence the findings, there is, however, a low risk of outcome misclassification.

We have focussed in this review only on large nationwide studies; these studies report outcomes of "hospitalization", "ICU admission", or "death". A limitation of this review, therefore, is that these studies treat such outcomes as one phenotype. It may be, however, that people with airway disease present within these outcomes with different pathology.

### Immune determinants of COVID-19 disease presentation and severity [^115r3sDU]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is mild to moderate in the majority of previously healthy individuals, but can cause life-threatening disease or persistent debilitating symptoms in some cases. The most important determinant of disease severity is age, with individuals over 65 years having the greatest risk of requiring intensive care, and men are more susceptible than women. In contrast to other respiratory viral infections, young children seem to be less severely affected. It is now clear that mild to severe acute infection is not the only outcome of COVID-19, and long-lasting symptoms are also possible. In contrast to severe acute COVID-19, such 'long COVID' is seemingly more likely in women than in men. Also, postinfectious hyperinflammatory disease has been described as an additional outcome after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here I discuss our current understanding of the immunological determinants of COVID-19 disease presentation and severity and relate this to known immune-system differences between young and old people and between men and women, and other factors associated with different disease presentations and severity.

### Susceptibility to infection in early life: a growing role for human genetics [^117Ho6uz]. Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

The unique vulnerability to infection of newborns and young infants is generally explained by a constellation of differences between early-life immune responses and immune responses at later ages, often referred to as neonatal immune immaturity. This developmental view, corroborated by robust evidence, offers a plausible, population-level description of the pathogenesis of life-threatening infectious diseases during the early-life period, but provides little explanation on the wide inter-individual differences in susceptibility and resistance to specific infections during the first months of life. In this context, the role of individual human genetic variation is increasingly recognized. A life-threatening infection caused by an opportunistic pathogen in an otherwise healthy infant likely represents the first manifestation of an inborn error of immunity. Single-gene disorders may also underlie common infections in full-term infants with no comorbidities or in preterm infants. In addition, there is increasing evidence of a possible role for common genetic variation in the pathogenesis of infection in preterm infants. Over the past years, a unified theory of infectious diseases emerged, supporting a hypothetical, age-dependent general model of genetic architecture of human infectious diseases. We discuss here how the proposed genetic model can be reconciled with the widely accepted developmental view of early-life infections in humans.

### Aging and infectious diseases in myasthenia gravis [^1156XoRv]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2025). Medium credibility.

Over the past 120 years, mortality associated with myasthenia gravis (MG) has steadily decreased while the incidence of MG has increased. While mortality due to MG has been ≤ 5% for at least the past 25 years, the prevalence of MG has increased. This increase in prevalence of MG may be due, in part, to improvements in diagnostics but also to an aging global population and immunosenescence as the largest increases in MG prevalence have been in patients ≥ 65 years old. In fact, a "very late-onset" subtype of MG has been proposed for patients diagnosed at or after age 65 years. These patients are predominantly anti-AChR antibody positive and thymoma negative. Preferred therapeutic options differ based on age at MG onset. Immunosenescence may play a role not only in MG etiology but also in the increased susceptibility of MG patients to infection. Immunosuppressive effects of MG therapies can also increase vulnerability to infection. Despite the improvements in MG treatment, mortality in MG patients remains higher than in the non-MG population. This is partly due to increased vulnerability to infection but also due to infection acting as a precipitating factor for MG exacerbation or crisis. The increased infection risk inherent with MG and the increased risk resulting from some therapies calls for increased diligence in monitoring and treating infections in MG patients.

### What's new in intensive care: disease tolerance [^1176BNqG]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic swept the globe, clinicians, researchers, and the public wondered: who has the highest risk to become most severely ill? Early findings that the elderly and individuals with comorbidities were the most vulnerable fit the predominant conceptual model: severe disease results from pathogen-induced damage that is exacerbated by dysfunctional pathogen clearance or by immune overreaction underlying immunopathology and further facilitated by pre-existing organ dysfunction unable to withstand new threats.

This conceptual model is the basis for medical interventions that directly target pathogens, such as vaccinations, treatment with antimicrobials, and steps to minimize immunopathology. Indeed, these approaches successfully improved the outcome in many subsets of COVID-19 patients. However, severe disease frequently continued to progress among individuals with no known risk factors, while some comorbid elders survived unscathed. So, what are the biologic mechanisms that spared individuals expected to fare poorly and failed in those expected to do well? Perhaps the assumption that non-immune cells are passive to infection-mediated stress should be re-considered?

Here, we discuss evidence that severe disease after infection is perhaps best understood when incorporating a critical, regulated feature of host defense against infections known as disease tolerance.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1171zyyb]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Immunocompromised host pneumonia clarifying statements define qualifying conditions and risks, stating that "The host immune defense disorder is present at the time of infection", that "Transient impairment of immune function, as may occur in the setting of severe sepsis, is not sufficient for the patient to be considered inherently immunocompromised", and that "Patients who have a history of immunocompromising conditions that have resolved should not be considered ICHs". They add that "Systemic conditions with known metabolic effects on immune function should be considered comorbidities but not immunocompromise-defining conditions", and "Persons of advanced age, a population at increased risk for pneumonia, would not be considered ICH under the proposed definition, as increased susceptibility to pneumonia is not synonymous with immunocompromise". Non-immune conditions are excluded because "Mechanical and structural lung diseases that increase the risk for pneumonia are not included in this definition of ICHP", and "Although these conditions add additional risk for pneumonia, they are not systemic immune defects". Regarding infection patterns, "The host immune defense disorder increases the individual's risk for more frequent or severe disease caused by common community pathogens", and "CAP in ICHs with typical organisms, such as S. pneumoniae, can present with more frequent, severe, prolonged, or recurrent manifestations compared with immunocompetent persons". They also note that "The host immune defense disorder increases the risk of pneumonia because of uncommon or opportunistic pathogens", and that an ICH with pneumonia "warrants consideration of additional diagnostic and/or alternative therapeutic strategies beyond those recommended in pneumonia guidelines", with the reminder that "Opportunistic and multiorganism infections can occur… pursuing the identification of a specific etiology is important while considering empiric coverage for patients who are ICHs on the basis of the underlying immune impairment".

### The dissection of complex susceptibility to infectious disease: bacterial, viral and parasitic infections [^115FVdzE]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Infectious diseases are the result of the exposure of susceptible hosts to pathogenic microbes. Genetic factors are important determinants of host susceptibility and efforts are being made to establish the molecular identity of such genetic susceptibility variants by genome-wide association studies. Results obtained to date partly confirm already known genetic vulnerabilities, but also point to new and unexpected mechanisms of susceptibility that extend from classical innate and acquired immunity to weaknesses in constitutional resistance. These studies also revealed an overlap in genetic control between infectious disease and other common immune and inflammatory disorders.

### Immunosenescence and infectious diseases [^111C8PsB]. Microbes and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Infectious diseases are major causes, with malignancies, of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Increased susceptibility to infections may result from underlying dysfunction of an aged immune system; moreover, inappropriate immunologic functions associated with aging can determine an insufficient response to vaccines. Impairments of cellular, humoral and innate immunity in the elderly, contributing to increased incidence of infectious diseases, are discussed in this review.

### Diabetes mellitus and urinary tract infection: epidemiology, pathogenesis and proposed studies in animal models [^114v9Unt]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

We reviewed the current state of knowledge about urinary tract infection in patients with diabetes from the clinical and basic science perspectives. We identified key knowledge gaps and areas for further research.

Materials and Methods

We performed a focused literature search on certain topics, including clinical studies related to etiology and pathophysiology of urinary tract infection in patients with diabetes, urinary tract infection studies in animal models of diabetes and basic science studies of the molecular mechanisms of urinary tract infection.

Results

Individuals with diabetes are at higher risk for urinary tract infection. Increased susceptibility in patients with diabetes is positively associated with increased duration and severity of diabetes. Clinical epidemiological data identifying mechanisms of increased urinary tract infection susceptibility in patients with diabetes are generally lacking and indicate only that urinary tract infections in women with and without diabetes are qualitatively similar in bacterial etiology and morbid sequelae. Existing animal models for diabetes have not been well characterized for urinary tract infection research. The increased incidence, prevalence and severity of urinary tract infection in patients with diabetes argue for aggressive antibacterial chemotherapy but novel therapies resulting from urinary tract infection research in nondiabetic animal models are still not available.

Conclusions

Future clinical investigations of urinary tract infection in patients with diabetes should focus on how the disease differs from that in patients without diabetes, notably on the role of glycosuria and urinary tract infection risk. Basic science research priorities for urinary tract infection in patients with diabetes should emphasize further development of diabetic animal models for urinary tract infection research and clinical translation of known important virulence determinants into new therapies.

### Antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance: a population perspective [^111DYWd8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

A fourth mechanism by which antimicrobial use increases antimicrobial resistance is by increasing the density of resistant organisms within a patient who already harbors such organisms at a lower density (Figure, D; Table). Enhanced shedding of these organisms, resulting in an increased risk to other patients (an indirect effect), has been documented (i.e. in the case of anti-anaerobic agents that increase shedding of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). An increased risk of resistant infection to the treated patient (a direct effect) may occur if a higher density of resistant organisms places the patient at higher risk of infection with his or her own flora. Unlike the other three ways by which antimicrobial use promotes resistance, this mechanism is mediated through antimicrobial treatment of patients already colonized with the resistant organism.

There are a number of other cases in which direct and indirect effects of antibiotic treatment are combined. Due to the diversity of genetic mechanisms of resistance, the risk of emergence of resistance during treatment represents a continuum, with TB at one end and VRE (or MRSA) at the other. Fluoroquinolone resistance in S. pneumoniae mediated by the accumulation of mutations in the DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV genes, or resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in Enterobacteriaceae mediated by mutations in TEM and SHV beta-lactamases located on plasmids, lie between these two extremes. In these cases, multiple mutations are required to turn a fully susceptible strain into a clinically resistant one. For a patient colonized or infected with a fully susceptible strain, emergence of resistance during treatment may be highly unlikely because of the requirement for selecting multiple mutations. However, in such cases, there may be selection in consecutive hosts for small increases in levels of resistance to a particular compound, resulting eventually in the emergence of clinical resistance. Patients may be colonized with a mixed flora of resistant and susceptible organisms, and eradication of the drug-susceptible flora may permit outgrowth of the resistant subpopulation. This mechanism has some formal similarity to what occurs in TB, except that for a colonizing bacterium such as the pneumococcus or the enteric colonizers, outgrowth of resistant organisms in the site of colonization need not be associated with treatment failure. In these cases, the treated patient is at increased risk of carrying resistant organisms (direct effect), but an indirect effect on the population occurs because the treated patient no longer carries susceptible organisms and is, therefore, unable to transmit them.

### An official ATS workshop report: emerging issues and current controversies in HIV-associated pulmonary diseases [^114LEeVT]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis susceptibility in HIV — M. tuberculosis infection impacts HIV progression and mortality, with disease from M. tuberculosis increasing in HIV-infected patients as CD4+ T cell counts decline, alongside qualitative immune defects. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals co-infected with M. tuberculosis and HIV secrete less IFN-γ, and the frequency of M. tuberculosis–specific CD4+ T cells that secrete IL-2 decreases with increasing HIV viral loads. In the alveolar space, phagosomes in HIV-infected individuals do not acidify adequately so organisms persist, alveolar macrophages from HIV-infected individuals do not limit growth of M. tuberculosis despite increased phagocytosis, cytokine production defects include decreased macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, and HIV infection impairs M. tuberculosis–mediated apoptosis of alveolar macrophages, likely impairing effective antigen presentation in the lung. The report identifies needs for improved understanding of lung T-cell responses in latent TB infection, effector functions required for protection against primary infection and reactivation, mechanisms of impaired alveolar macrophage function, and antigen presentation during HIV infection.

### IL-23 / IL-17A dysfunction phenotypes inform possible clinical effects from anti-IL-17A therapies [^113pJeeC]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Several diseases can manifest as a result of inherent or acquired deficiencies in cytokines or their receptors. Examination of the clinical phenotypes from these diseases may provide insights into potential side effects for therapies that target these cytokines. Several important caveats should be noted: importantly, anticytokine therapy is not expected to mimic cytokine-signaling pathway mutations, in which the development of these diseases is likely to be affected by lifelong (and sometimes complete) depletion in cytokine levels. Thus, the genetic diseases discussed herein are not expected to mirror what would be observed during biologic therapy for immune-mediated disorders. Furthermore, current anticytokine therapy does not impair production of the targeted cytokine and thus does not result in complete and, more importantly, permanent loss of function. These distinctions are critical because the extent of functional deficiencies in rare diseases identified here corresponds to the extent of the clinical phenotypes. For example, in patients with HIES, partial IL-17 deficiency is associated with a milder clinical phenotype compared with complete IL-17 deficiency. Similarly, in most of the genetic disorders discussed, many different cytokines are altered simultaneously and thus are highly dissimilar to single-cytokine depletion mediated by a biologic.

Long-term favorable clinical outcomes are possible for many patients with genetic deficiencies in the IL-23/Th17 pathway because of redundancies in host–defense mechanisms and because deficiencies in a single cytokine or its receptor generally do not lead to widespread disease susceptibility. For example, although early studies postulated that IL-12 production by phagocytes and antigen-presenting cells was a key component of both innate resistance and adaptive immune responses, Fieschi and colleagues later found that deficiencies in IL-12 or its receptor do not increase susceptibility to a wide range of infections. Instead, consequences of these deficiencies are usually limited to MSMD, whereas defenses against other microorganisms remain intact, and risk for serious systemic infection remains low. Similarly, studies examining susceptibility to NTS bacteremia have concluded that, although IL-17A has a key role in protecting ileal mucosa, isolated deficiencies in this cytokine are unlikely to result in substantially increased risk for systemic Salmonella infection because the antimicrobial functions of IL-17A, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α are redundant such that all of these cytokines can induce expression of neutrophil chemoattractants in epithelial cells. It is more likely that broadly compromised host defenses are a result of immunodeficiencies further upstream that affect multiple inflammatory and immune response pathways.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116E3Bvt]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) with sepsis — antibiogram to tailor empiric therapy: In patients with sepsis assumed to be caused by complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest using an antibiogram to further tailor empiric antibiotic choice only if the antibiogram is local, recent, and relevant to the patient (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). An antibiogram is considered local if derived from the same healthcare facility, recent if based on data from the prior 12 months and relevant to the patient if based on organisms from a similar patient population. If an antibiogram is being used to further tailor empirical antibiotic choice, consider selecting an antibiotic for which 90% or more of the most relevant organism(s) are susceptible in patients in septic shock, or for which 80% or more of the most relevant organism(s) are susceptible in patients with sepsis without shock; these cutoffs are based on modeling of increased mortality risk associated with inappropriate empiric antibiotics in sepsis and septic shock. Septic shock is defined by the Sepsis-3 Task Force as a subset of sepsis in which despite volume resuscitation, vasopressors are required to maintain blood pressure and serum lactate level is greater than 2 mmol/L, reflecting an in-hospital mortality greater than 40%.

### Vaccinations in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases [^116xS5Yz]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

IMID patients are at increased risk of vaccine-preventable disease

Infectious disease is the net result of exposure to a pathogen and the subsequent reaction of the host's defence mechanisms. Since the immune response in patients with IMID may be subdued, due to immunological changes intrinsic to immune-mediated diseases and immunotherapy, IMID patients may be at increased risk of infection.

IMID and the directly linked infection risk

A comprehensive population-based retrospective study comparing RA patients with matched controls reported a nearly doubled incidence of documented infections in RA patients, although evidence allowing to distinguish between increased infection risk due to the disease and its treatment is sparse. RA-associated changes in cellular immunity may predispose RA patients to infection. Early reports suggest that RA intrinsically entails an elevated susceptibility to infection. Predictive factors for serious infection episodes in RA patients include RA severity indices, such as presence of RF, increased sedimentation rate and extra-articular involvement, as well as corticosteroid use and the presence of comorbidities. The excess mortality described in RA is partly attributable to infection, with reported standardized mortality rates due to infection in RA patients ranging from 4.2 to 14.9.

In SLE, infectious complications occur in 25–45% of patients, and up to 50% of the mortality is attributed to infection. The increased infection rate in SLE patients is at least partly related to immunological defects such as complement deficiencies.

In IBD, infections are over-represented as a cause of death. Whether infections are implicated in the onset of the disease is still a matter of debate. Nevertheless, decreased intestinal barrier function, immune deficiencies (deficiency in the defensin system, macrophage immunodeficiency) and malnutrition may contribute to the higher susceptibility of IBD patients to certain infections. Abdominal sepsis may occur as a direct complication of the disease.

For psoriasis, one study suggests that psoriasis patients are at increased risk for pneumonia and systemic viral infections, whereas increased post-operative infection risk after orthopaedic surgery — as a surrogate marker of immune competence — is controversial in psoriasis patients. Increased susceptibility to infection in psoriasis patients thus remains a matter of debate.

### Susceptibility of patients with airway disease to SARS-CoV-2 infection [^113nfrpG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma is considered a homogenous condition

In the preceding respiratory pandemic, the H1N1/influenza A outbreak in 2009, around one-quarter of patients hospitalized had asthma. Viruses are a common trigger for asthma exacerbations, and people with asthma are at a much greater risk of severe outcomes from common cold viruses than those without asthma. On the basis of this evidence, it was postulated by the CDC and World Health Organization that people with asthma would be vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Yet, studies defining asthma as a single homogenous condition have found asthma to be neither protective nor detrimental for severe COVID-19 outcomes. Even in the 2009 influenza pandemic, although asthma was highly prevalent in patients hospitalized, it was not associated with poor outcomes. This lack of association with adverse outcomes may be because most COVID-19 studies have considered "asthma" as a single disease. Studies that tried to phenotype patients with asthma suggest different findings and are the focus of this review.

### More dengue, more questions [^117DnTMu]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

A more robust screening test could result from the studies of Wills et al. who measured the size and charge characteristics of proteins leaking through the endothelial sieve in DHF patients. Such changes are caused, presumably, by a cytokine cascade, as yet incompletely identified. Their observations suggest that capillaries leak in most overt dengue infections, but fluid loss is not at levels that alter cardiovascular status. Quantitative differences in duration and amount of protein leak demarcate DHF from dengue fever. Importantly, the authors found increased amounts of serum proteins, increased differential protein excretion, and increased amounts of heparan sulfate in the urine of DHF patients. Detecting protein or heparan sulfate in acute-phase urine could provide early evidence of increased vascular permeability.

Humans are not uniformly susceptible to the DHF syndrome. HLA gene distribution correlates with increased susceptibility as well as with increased resistance. In addition, a powerful resistance gene is found in blacks. Importantly, susceptibility to vascular permeability during a dengue infection is age-related. This conclusion comes from a study of the age distribution of patients hospitalized during the 1981 DHF epidemic in Cuba. In that epidemic, persons 2–50 years of age were exposed to infections with dengue 1 virus (DENV-1) from 1977 to 1979 and DENV-2 virus in 1981 at similar rates. Thus, age-specific hospitalization and death rates were a measure of intrinsic susceptibility to vascular permeability during secondary DENV-2 virus infections. The youngest children were found to be at greatest risk; rates fell rapidly and were lowest in older teenagers and young adults, rising again somewhat in older patients. The susceptibility of young children to DHF precisely paralleled age-related changes in microvascular permeability measured in normal children and adults.

### IL-23 / IL-17A dysfunction phenotypes inform possible clinical effects from anti-IL-17A therapies [^117F2yQm]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Predictably, data suggest that deficiencies in cytokines and receptors further downstream in the IL-23/Th17 pathway are associated with fewer disorders than deficiencies in upstream components of the pathway. For example, dysregulation of IL12RB1, which encodes a common subunit of the IL-12 and IL-23 receptor, is associated with increased susceptibility to a range of infections, including MSMD, Salmonella, and tuberculosis, whereas the potential consequences of more downstream IL-17 deficiencies are generally limited to superficial skin and mucosal fungal infections. These observations are consistent with the involvement of upstream cytokines in pleotropic processes, including the regulation of other cytokines, whereas downstream cytokines are generally effectors of specific target tissue responses. Deficiencies in signaling pathways used by several cytokines also tend to be associated with a higher number of associated disorders. As shown in Figure 1b, upstream cytokines are more broadly involved in defense mechanisms against a range of bacterial, fungal, and opportunistic infections compared with downstream cytokines. In contrast, human deficiencies in receptors for downstream cytokines, most notably in the IL-17 family (IL-17A through F), tend to manifest as increased susceptibility to a few specific types of infection, including mucocutaneous candidiasis and cutaneous Staphylococcal infections alone. The role of IL-17 cytokines in host defense against most other common pathogens is largely redundant; for example, both IL-17A and IL-17F are needed for mucocutaneous immunity against C. albicans, and no mutations in IL-17A resulting in generalized immunodeficiency have been identified to date.

Overall, this paper has explored how patients inherently deficient in certain components of the IL-23/Th17 pathway may — and may not — be analogous to patients receiving agents that are also designed to target this pathway. Understanding the consequences of this inhibition may thus inform future long-term collection and analyses of data related to potential infectious complications of these agents.

### Susceptibility of patients with airway disease to SARS-CoV-2 infection [^115SQwq2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Comparing COVID-19 with Pneumonia and Seasonal Influenza

Three large studies from the United States, France, and Germany conducted before COVID-19 vaccination programs found an overall excess mortality from COVID-19 compared with that from seasonal influenza. This disparity in case fatality rate may be influenced by differences in the pathogenicity of the viruses, healthcare provision, or the host response, owing to the age and underlying comorbidities of those infected and the availability of an influenza vaccine. Yet, in patients with underlying respiratory conditions, there is a higher prevalence of COPD and asthma in those hospitalized with influenza than those with COVID-19. A large French study specifically addressing people with chronic respiratory disease found COPD and asthma contributed to a much higher proportion of patients hospitalized with influenza but a lower proportion of in-hospital deaths compared with COVID-19. Of those admitted to the ICU, asthma contributed to a higher proportion of COVID-19 than influenza, whereas COPD contributed to a much lower proportion of ICU admissions for COVID-19 than influenza. The finding of reduced COPD ICU admissions in France parallels COVID-19 data from the United Kingdom. However, the French study only reported unadjusted estimates even though there were significant differences (by age, sex, and comorbidities) in the COVID-19 study population compared with the influenza study population. The United Kingdom asthma phenotyping study used the same study population to compare COVID-19 hospitalization rates to influenza and pneumonia hospitalization rates in the year prior. They found the same high-risk patient groups (those with higher medication use or frequent exacerbations), after adjusting for known risk factors, to be at similar degrees of relative risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 as for influenza and pneumonia, although there were much higher total numbers of COVID-19 hospitalizations. This finding suggested that although COVID-19 was a relatively more prevalent disease in the time periods assessed, the same phenotype of asthma patient has a significantly elevated risk for all three acute respiratory infections.

### Immune dysfunction and infections in patients with cirrhosis [^116Ds9kn]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with cirrhosis are immunocompromised and susceptible to infections. Although detection and treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) have improved, overall survival rates have not increased greatly in recent decades-infection still increases mortality 4-fold among patients with cirrhosis. Hospitalized patients with cirrhosis have the highest risk of developing infections, especially patients with gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage. Bacterial infections occur in 32% to 34% of patients with cirrhosis who are admitted to the hospital and 45% of patients with GI hemorrhage. These rates are much higher than the overall rate of infection in hospitalized patients (5%-7%). The most common are SBP (25% of infections), urinary tract infection (20%), and pneumonia (15%). Bacterial overgrowth and translocation from the GI tract are important steps in the pathogenesis of SBP and bacteremia-these processes increase levels of endotoxins and cytokines that induce the inflammatory response and can lead to septic shock, multiorgan dysfunction, and death. A number of other bacterial and fungal pathogens are more common and virulent in patients with cirrhosis than in the overall population. We review the pathogenesis of infections in these patients, along with diagnostic and management strategies.

### Why Do some people develop serious COVID-19 disease after infection, while others only exhibit mild symptoms? [^112jfVRK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

The year 2020 was a landmark year of a once-in-a-century pandemic of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 virus, that led to a rapidly spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The spectrum of disease with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from asymptomatic to mild upper respiratory illness, to moderate to severe disease with respiratory compromise to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure, and death. Early in the pandemic, risk factors were recognized that contributed to more severe disease, but it became evident that individuals and even young people could have severe COVID-19. As we started to understand the immunobiology of COVID-19, it became clearer that the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 were variable, and in some cases, the excessive inflammatory response contributed to greater morbidity and mortality. In this review, we will explore some of the additional risk factors that appear to contribute to disease severity and enhance our understanding of why some individuals experience more severe COVID-19. Recent advances in genome-wide associations have identified potential candidate genes in certain populations that may modify the host immune responses leading to dysregulated host immunity. Genetic defects of the type I interferon pathway are also linked to a more clinically severe phenotype of COVID-19. Finally, dysregulation of the adaptive immune system may also play a role in the severity and complex clinical course of patients with COVID-19. A better understanding of the host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 will hopefully lead to new treatment modalities to prevent the poor outcomes of COVID-19 in those individuals with pre-existing risk factors or genetic variants that contribute to the dysregulated host immune responses.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — pre-exposure prophylaxis with pemivibart in moderately or severely immunocompromised individuals 12 years or older — is addressed as follows: In moderately or severely immunocompromised individuals 12 years or older at risk for progression to severe COVID-19, the IDSA guideline panel suggests pre-exposure prophylaxis with pemivibart when predominant regional variants are susceptible to the agent (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). The anticipated benefit is likely greatest in people who are the most immunocompromised because they have the highest risk of inadequate immune response and progression to severe disease, while the anticipated benefit may be lower in patients aged 12 to 17 years, who have less severe COVID-19 outcomes than adults, as reflected by lower rates of hospitalization. Resources note that as the pandemic evolves, new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge with varying susceptibility to available anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies; for current information, please refer to the CDC COVID-19 Data Tracker (Summary of Variant Surveillance), and information on pemivibart is included in the US Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Pemgarda).

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1172wE8f]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

HIV in the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART) — CD4 metrics and residual risks define pulmonary infection susceptibility. The CD4 cell count is the most readily quantifiable immune defect in people with HIV (PWH), with the risk for many opportunistic infections increasing sharply once the CD4 cell count drops below 200 cells/microliter, and the risk for bacterial pneumonia also increases with a decreasing CD4 cell count. However, even patients on ART with well-controlled HIV disease and a normal CD4 count have significant impairments to the immune system and an increased risk of nonopportunistic bacterial pneumonia by organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Moreover, PWH with CD4 counts above 500 cells/microliter have a fivefold increased risk of S. pneumoniae pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease compared with the general population, and they remain at high risk for tuberculosis even with appropriate ART and preserved CD4 cell counts.

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^113AvZFS]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

Disease modifiers in HSV-1 ocular disease — The severity and likelihood of recurrent HSV-1 ocular disease may be determined by the virulence of the infecting virus strain, the general susceptibility of the host to herpes virus infections and to the particular infecting strain, and the local susceptibility of the host target tissue. Research investigations in laboratory animals have shown that different HSV-1 strains vary widely in their capacity to induce disease, although these studies have not been translated to human patients, and little is known about HSV strain differences in the propensity to cause severe and/or recurrent human disease. The general susceptibility of the host to ocular HSV infections depends on the overall status of the host immune system, and various conditions and age can reduce the immune system's effectiveness in preventing ocular HSV recurrences; individuals may experience more severe disease or more frequent recurrences of HSV keratitis when their immune response is compromised. Any condition that depresses cell mediated immunity may increase the risk of HSV disease, and published literature suggests that individuals with depressed cell mediated immunity — such as after organ transplant or with diabetes mellitus, measles, or HIV — may experience more severe disease or more frequent recurrences of HSV keratitis.

### Antimicrobial use before chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a retrospective cohort study [^1111M92s]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is accompanied by increased risk of potentially fatal infections. While this can mostly be attributed to disease-related immune dysfunction, it is not known if CLL patients are also constitutionally susceptible to infections. We linked nation-wide Danish registers to explore this possibility, approximating infection susceptibility by use of antimicrobials. We assessed the incidence of antimicrobials among CLL patients and matched controls from the general population for up to 22 years before index diagnosis, and among children and grandchildren of CLL patients and their matched controls. Our analyses showed that for CLL patients overall antimicrobial use began to increase gradually six years before leukemia diagnosis. Before this time point, CLL patients had used significantly more macrolides (relative risk = 1.15; 95% confidence interval 1.10–1.20), antimycotics (1.18; 1.08–1.30), and antivirals (1.62; 1.45–1.81) than controls for up to 22 years before diagnosis. The same pattern of increased use was found among CLL patients' children and grandchildren. Our study suggests that CLL diagnosis is preceded by decades of increased susceptibility to infections. The duration of this time window is compatible with causal roles of immune dysfunction and/or certain infections in CLL pathogenesis, possibly mediating the association between constitutional infection susceptibility and CLL risk.

### The prevalence and risk of mortality associated with antimicrobial resistance within nosocomial settings-a global systematic review and meta-analysis of over 20, 000 patients [^1116hbnK]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Several plausible biological and clinical factors could cloud the link that we have shown between AMR and increased mortality risk. Older hospitalised patients are more likely to have multiple long-term conditions; although many studies adjusted this crudely, residual confounding from age-related changes, such as frailty of the patient; accumulation of antibiotic use in older individuals through multiple hospital admissions; changes in gut flora across lifetimes in older individuals, immunosenescence, and a lower tolerance for the use of effective antibioticsagainst resistant bacteria cannot be excluded. Such factors are beyond the scope of this work to disentangle but may be important factors to consider in future prospective studies.

Our study had limitations. Variations across papers in relation to populations, setting, treatment context as well as differences within reporting definitions of AMR and outcomes meant that there was a high degree of heterogeneity. However, this does not preclude pooling of data and is consistent with other meta-analyses on infection in diverse populations. We attempted to explore heterogeneity through sensitivity analyses of different sub-populations. The analyses provide an important visualisation of the data available and highlight the need to improve data collection and analyses on this topic, including greater standardisation in adjusted analyses. We found clear evidence of publication bias. Most studies included in this work were retrospective observational studies; less than half of individuals in the included studies had organisms in which sensitivities were reported and consequently, we may have underestimated the prevalence of AMR, but it is unclear as to why this is. The observational nature of studies that we examined also means that the evidence generated for a direct association with AMR and mortality in hospital is circumstantial and prone to competing risks bias; however, our work provides early evidence of such a relationship that could motivate researchers to design better, prospective observational studies that examine for this relationship in greater detail. Furthermore, all studies included in this review were performed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; the epidemiology of AMR within hospitals may have changed significantly since (although our search up to 2025 showed no recent studies investigating this issue). However, our work provides an important summary of existing epidemiology prior to a pandemic. Ideally, we would prefer to have performed this data synthesis by bacterial species, resistance by antibiotic class and separate colonisation from infection; however, the high heterogeneity in definitions of AMR and lack of data on specific species and colonisation prevented us from performing this analysis Furthermore, resistance patterns naturally change over time according to selective pressure. Yet, our aim of focussing on data representative of hospital cohorts, rather than infection from a specific site, was to provide a general summary of the effect on mortality, which has previously never been achieved. Finally, our analyses are reliant on robust estimates of unadjusted and adjusted ratios generated by the original studies themselves; in studies where, adjusted results were very different to unadjusted results for mortality, we contacted study authors to ensure that the results were interpreted correctly. The overall low certainty of evidence from our data synthesis suggests the need for better designed studies investigating this issue; that are adequately powered, with the right denominator (sensitive organism) and granular definitions of AMR.

### A novel compound heterozygous mutation in the IL12RB1 gene causes susceptibility to Mycobacterium tilburgii infection [^112kUzm9]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

As the primary CD4 + T cell subset that assists B cells in generating antibody responses, Tfh are crucial for humoral immunity against mycobacteria. The Tfh cells, together with B cells, form the germinal center in which the B cells will differentiate into either memory B cells or long-lived plasma cells. Nathalie et al. found that IL12RB1 deficient individuals suffer from substantially less circulating memory Tfh and memory B cells, which causes hypoimmunoglobulinemia. The main mechanism behind this is the association between the IL-12-STAT4 axis and the development and functions of Tfh. We detected a reduction in Tfh in our patient but her immunoglobulin levels were high and her plasma cells showed no discernible abnormalities. One reasonable explanation was that less IL-12-induced IFN-γ production results in a qualitative change in the Tfh cytokine repertoire, with reduced IFN-γ mediated suppression of B cell responses. There was no doubt that the deficiency of IFN-γ was the primary trigger of the patient's continuous infection. However, in patients with hereditary IL-12Rβ1 loss, type 1 immunity has been reported to retain some function. Diana et al. found that patients with IL12RB1 deficiency had significantly fewer circulating T follicular regulatory cells and produced higher levels of anti-actin autoantibodies, in vivo. We did not monitor this subpopulation of cells at the time, but there was no increase in autoantibodies. IFN-γ-producing cell subsets have been more thoroughly categorized in earlier investigations. Following PMA stimulation, the proportion of cells generating IFN-γ in Mucosal-Associated Invariant T cell, Vδ2 + γδ T, NK cells, and CD4 + T cells in IL-12Rβ1-/-patients did not appear to be appreciably different. However, upon PMA stimulation, our patient's supernatant IFN-γ levels were noticeably lower than those of healthy individuals. This might be because the mutation is heterogeneous, producing a range of outcomes. Overall, inborn errors of immunity caused by IL12RB1 deficiency are highly heterogeneous and it is difficult to define the disease by a fixed immune phenotype.

### Increased SARS-CoV-2 infection, protease, and inflammatory responses in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease primary bronchial epithelial cells defined with single-cell RNA sequencing [^115KPeop]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

A major finding was that COPD pBECs were substantially more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with healthy pBECs. This has been postulated from clinical studies and informed by other viral infections. We show the first experimental evidence to support these concepts. This was reflected at the single-cell level with viral transcripts and supported by negative-strand mapping representing replicating virus that was significantly elevated in COPD pBECs (Figure E4). This was supported by elevated viral titers in COPD pBECs recovered from apical washes from as early as 4 dpi and was maintained until 7 dpi (Figure 1G). Our previous work has shown that patients with COPD express higher concentrations of ICAM1, which increases susceptibility to rhinovirus infection. We also demonstrate that COPD pBECs have elevated concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, TMPRSS2 and CTSB, and downregulated protease inhibitors such as serpin genes. TMPRSS2 and CTSB independently facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry and likely contribute to increased infectivity of COPD pBECs. We, therefore, propose that protease imbalances likely confer increased susceptibility of COPD pBECs to infection. Using therapeutic interventions targeting these protease imbalances, we demonstrated proof of concept in reducing SARS-CoV-2 titers, which may be used as potential therapies in patients with COPD to reduce susceptibility to infection. This is supported by reports of high lung protease activity in patients with COPD and elevated TMPRSS2 expression in bronchial epithelial brushings from current compared with never smokers, suggesting that smoking is partially responsible for the increased susceptibility of patients with COPD.

### Incidence, risk factors, and attributable mortality of secondary infections in the intensive care unit after admission for sepsis [^114BovcK]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Sepsis is considered to induce immune suppression, leading to increased susceptibility to secondary infections with associated late mortality.

Objective

To determine the clinical and host genomic characteristics, incidence, and attributable mortality of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infections in patients admitted to the ICU with or without sepsis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective observational study comprising consecutive admissions of more than 48 hours in 2 ICUs in the Netherlands from January 2011 to July 2013 stratified according to admission diagnosis (sepsis or noninfectious).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was ICU-acquired infection (onset > 48 hours). Attributable mortality risk (fraction of mortality that can be prevented by elimination of the risk factor, acquired infection) was determined using time-to-event models accounting for competing risk. In a subset of sepsis admissions (n = 461), blood gene expression (whole-genome transcriptome in leukocytes) was analyzed at baseline and at onset of ICU-acquired infectious (n = 19) and noninfectious (n = 9) events.

Results

The primary cohort included 1719 sepsis admissions (1504 patients; median age, 62 years; interquartile range [IQR], 51–71 years]; 924 men [61.4%]). A comparative cohort included 1921 admissions (1825 patients, median age, 62 years; IQR, 49–71 years; 1128 men [61.8%] in whom infection was not present in the first 48 hours. Intensive care unit-acquired infections occurred in 13.5% of sepsis ICU admissions (n = 232) and 15.1% of nonsepsis ICU admissions (n = 291). Patients with sepsis who developed an ICU-acquired infection had higher disease severity scores on admission than patients with sepsis who did not develop an ICU-acquired infection (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV [APACHE IV] median score, 90 [IQR, 72–107] vs 79 [IQR, 62–98]; P < .001) and throughout their ICU stay but did not have differences in baseline gene expression. The population attributable mortality fraction of ICU-acquired infections in patients with sepsis was 10.9% (95% CI, 0.9%-20.6%) by day 60; the estimated difference between mortality in all patients with a sepsis admission diagnosis and mortality in those without ICU-acquired infection was 2.0% (95% CI, 0.2%-3.8%; p = 0.03) by day 60. Among nonsepsis ICU admissions, ICU-acquired infections had a population attributable mortality fraction of 21.1% (95% CI, 0.6%-41.7%) by day 60. Compared with baseline, blood gene expression at the onset of ICU-acquired infections showed reduced expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis and glycolysis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Intensive care unit-acquired infections occurred more commonly in patients with sepsis with higher disease severity, but such infections contributed only modestly to overall mortality. The genomic response of patients with sepsis was consistent with immune suppression at the onset of secondary infection.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^115BsdrY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — post-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ): The panel made an explicit decision that the primary outcome driving the decision for any post-exposure prophylaxis is the ability to prevent infection; when the evidence demonstrates a very low likelihood of effective post-exposure prophylaxis, other outcomes become secondary; and when healthy persons are considered for preventive medications (such as would occur in post-exposure settings), a higher threshold for benefits is required and (even putative) harms become more important. The panel agreed that the overall certainty of the evidence against prophylaxis treatment with HCQ was moderate (failure to prevent infection) due to concerns with imprecision, and the panel balanced the lack of clear benefit with the increased risk of harms from the body of evidence reported in the treatment section, in addition to the side effects reported in the trials to make a strong recommendation. The guideline panel recommended against the use of HCQ as post-exposure prophylactic treatment for persons exposed to COVID-19.

### IL17A genetic variation is associated with altered susceptibility to Gram-positive infection and mortality of severe sepsis [^113AwPkd]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The GG genotype was associated with increased susceptibility to Gram-positive bacterial infection in two cohorts of severe sepsis patients, whereas a trend towards decreased susceptibility to Gram-negative bacteria was also observed. Genetic associations of pathogen specific susceptibility have been documented in pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The potential mechanism of the different pathogen-specific susceptibility may be difference of PRRs.

IL17 induces neutrophil recruitment in the airways, which is an important mechanism of host defense for the lung. In accordance with this, we found that the rs1974226 GG genotype patients had significantly increased susceptibility to Gram-positive infection in the lung. While this association was significant for the lung, associations were not significant for other sites. This might be due to the small sample sizes of infections found in other sites. Other limitations of this study are, first, that we did not investigate mechanisms of action such as altered IL17A gene expression or alternative splicing by the IL17A rs1974226 SNP. Thus, further investigation regarding the genetic effect on IL17A mRNA structure and mRNA expression levels and protein levels would strengthen the results of this study. Second, the GG genotype had increased susceptibility to Gram-positive infection and 28-day mortality, but the causal link is not proven in this study. Third, this study finding of an association of the IL17A rs174226 GG genotype with increased susceptibility to a category of Gram-positive bacteria would be strengthened by testing for an association with a specific Gram-positive bacterial pathogen, such as S. aureus, in further larger studies.

Decreased susceptibility to Gram-negative bacteria observed in the GG genotype patients in the derivation cohort did not replicate; this needs further replication tests in larger cohorts.

### Improving our mechanistic understanding of the indirect effects of CMV infection in transplant recipients [^114wFXpS]. American Journal of Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an immunomodulatory virus that indirectly increases the risk for bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. However, the pathogenesis of this phenomenon is poorly understood. We determined whether inflammatory responses to different Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands are blunted during CMV infection in solid-organ transplant (SOT) patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 38 SOT patients with and without CMV were incubated in the presence of various viral, fungal, and bacterial TLR ligands. Cytokines were measured in the supernatant by multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients had blunted cytokine responses to bacterial, fungal, and viral ligands during CMV infection when compared to the absence of CMV infection. This was independent of viral load, clinical presentation of CMV infection or immunosuppression, supporting the clinical observation in SOT recipients that CMV infection increases susceptibility to bacterial, fungal, and other viral infections. Moreover, in the absence of CMV infection, patients with subsequent CMV infection had lower cytokines in response to TLR ligands compared to those without subsequent CMV infection, suggesting that inherent differences in patients not directly related to CMV also contribute to this increased susceptibility. In summary, these data provide novel ex vivo evidence to support indirect effects of CMV.

### Human genetic susceptibility to infectious disease [^114C9pzt]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2012). Medium credibility.

Recent genome-wide studies have reported novel associations between common polymorphisms and susceptibility to many major infectious diseases in humans. In parallel, an increasing number of rare mutations underlying susceptibility to specific phenotypes of infectious disease have been described. Together, these developments have highlighted a key role for host genetic variation in determining the susceptibility to infectious disease. They have also provided insights into the genetic architecture of infectious disease susceptibility and identified immune molecules and pathways that are directly relevant to the human host defence.

### IL17A genetic variation is associated with altered susceptibility to Gram-positive infection and mortality of severe sepsis [^116TRmq5]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Interleukin 17A (IL17A) plays a key role in host defense against infection and development of inflammatory diseases. IL17A production is increased as an innate response to bacterial infection in human immune cells, and elevated serum IL17A levels are observed in human and animal models of sepsis. In contrast, deficiency of the IL17 response impairs bacterial clearance, delays recovery from infection and increases susceptibility to infection.

Recently two autosomal mutations of IL17 pathway genes were identified in patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis disease, which is characterized by recurrent or persistent mucocutaneous infections by Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus. The mutations, single nucleotide substitutions in the coding region of IL17 genes, abolish the IL17 immune response leading to persistent infections. IL17 deficiency appears to differentially increase susceptibility to infection including S. aureus and C. albicans. These discoveries highlight the importance of the IL17A gene on infection and, in particular, on Gram-positive and fungal infections. Severe sepsis is a leading cause of death in intensive care units (ICUs). Multiple studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in important immune response genes alter susceptibility to infection and/or outcome of severe sepsis, but the role of IL17A SNPs has not yet been investigated in severe sepsis. Gram-positive infections, including S. aureus, are very common pathogens isolated from severe sepsis patients, while fungal infections are somewhat less common. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that IL17A genetic polymorphisms alter susceptibility of patients to Gram-positive infection using isolated pathogens from patients in two large severe sepsis cohorts of European ancestry. We subsequently tested for association of IL17A genotype with survival from severe sepsis.

### Increased susceptibility to HIV-1 of peripheral blood lymphocytes in acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus [^1119scNg]. Journal of Medical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an important pathogen in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals that causes lymphoma and other lymphoproliferative disorders upon disease progression; however, interaction between the two viruses during acute infection is not well known. Expression of CCR5, a major coreceptor for HIV, was enhanced on CD4+ T cells from patients with acute EBV infection. Furthermore, susceptibility of those cells to R5-HIV-1, but not X4-HIV-1, was increased. EBV effects on CCR5 expression on or susceptibility to R5-HIV-1 of CD4+ T cells did not require coinfection of the same cell with the two viruses, because CD4+ T cells from patients with acute EBV infection were not infected with EBV. Considering that both HIV and EBV are transmitted by intimate contact, such possible interaction between the two viruses may have implications for viral transmission and the pathogenesis of HIV disease.

### Quantifying the economic cost of antibiotic resistance and the impact of related interventions: rapid methodological review, conceptual framework and recommendations for future studies [^115G3tFy]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Extension in scope: from the individual patient to the community

Most studies have considered only the difference in costs of treating patients with antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant infections; however, ABR can also increase costs for patients without antibiotic-resistant infections. For instance, patients with infections for which ABR is widespread are routinely given costly ABR tests and/or empirically prescribed antibiotics that are costlier and have worse side effects than first-line antibiotics. One study found that ABR contributed to a 22% increase in per prescription antibiotic spending on otitis media.

Some antibiotics are given prophylactically to patients particularly susceptible to infections such as pregnant women and cancer or surgical patients; loss of antibiotic effectiveness will decrease prophylaxis effectiveness and worsen patient outcomes. These effects can be translated into costs, although no paper we reviewed has done this explicitly.

By considering only the incremental cost of treating antibiotic-resistant infections compared to antibiotic-susceptible infections, most studies imply that, even if ABR was eliminated, patients would still be infected by a susceptible infection. However, bacterial transmission is often driven by the ineffectiveness or slow effectiveness of antibiotic treatment, causing antibiotic-susceptible strains to spread more slowly; thus, reducing ABR may also reduce overall infection incidence.

Further spill-overs occur from the opportunity costs associated with antibiotic resistance to others in the community who may be unable to access timely healthcare when resources, such as hospital beds, are blocked by patients with longer stays due to resistant infections. These opportunity costs can be expressed in terms of monetary time costs or in terms of impact on hospital revenues or the health of other patients.

Finally, resistant infections arise and are transmitted within and between humans, non-human animals and the environment. Patients with resistant infections can move between different healthcare sectors such as hospitals, intermediate/long-term care and the community. These effects can influence the impact of interventions; the methods to capture them are described in more detail in the section on "The impact of interventions" below.

### HIV infection [^1138URXa]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on human immunodeficiency virus infection:

- **Definition**: HIV infection is a chronic viral disease that, if untreated, leads to progressive T cell depletion with resultant infectious and oncological complications.
- **Pathophysiology**: HIV-1 is responsible for the vast majority of infections, while human immunodeficiency type 2 is relatively uncommon and follows a more indolent course.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence and prevalence of HIV are estimated at 18 cases per 100,000 person-years and 380.9 persons per 100,000 population, respectively.
- **Disease course**: Infection begins by invasion of the target cells in a mucosa, following which the infection spreads to the lymphoid system. In untreated patients, the destruction of HIV-infected CD4 T cells results in immunodeficiency and chronic inflammation. CD4 T cell counts of < 350 cells/mcL are associated with an increased risk of complications such as varicella-zoster, tuberculosis, and other severe bacterial infections. The risk of opportunistic infections, such as pneumocystis pneumonia and esophageal candidiasis, increases with CD4 T cell counts of < 250 cells/mcL. CD4 T cells count < 100 cells/mcL result in an increased risk of coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, CMV infection, histoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, disseminated M. avium complex, brain toxoplasmosis, HIV-associated wasting syndrome, and finally death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The standardized mortality ratio for patients with HIV is estimated at 3.97 for those who have never received ART and 2.76 for those treated with ART. The 2-year and 10-year survival rates for patients diagnosed with AIDS are 82% and 26%, respectively. AIDS (including AIDS infection-related malignancies and opportunistic infections), non-AIDS-related infections, and non-AIDS infection-related malignancies are the most common causes of death. CVD is the leading cause of death in adeqately treated HIV patients.

### Deficient Candida-specific T-helper 17 response during sepsis [^111q1cGn]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU) are prone to develop Candida infections. Here, we investigated Candida-induced T-helper 17 (Th17) responses during experimental human endotoxemia and in patients with sepsis admitted to the ICU. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with Candida albicans. The Th17 response was significantly lower during endotoxemia, compared with baseline. Patients with gram-negative sepsis had a significantly lower Th17 response as compared to healthy controls. These data demonstrate that the Th17 response is deficient during endotoxin-related systemic inflammation, which likely represents an important risk factor for increased susceptibility to develop Candida infection in patients with sepsis.

### Aerosolized amikacin for treatment of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infections: an observational case series [^1162pcFS]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with NTM infections and extensive parenchymal involvement are known to have poorer outcomes. Successful clearance of organisms becomes more difficult in the face of a combination of potentially very important factors including altered lung anatomy and function, and patients' inherent increased susceptibility to NTM. As a result, the likelihood of relapse and/or re-infection with other NTM is quite substantial. In our case series, patient 3 had MAC and later developed M. chelonae after clearing her initial infection and patient 5 was co-infected with both organisms at the onset of treatment, which also raises the question of differing susceptibilities and response to treatment depending on the organism.

There is an increasing view among investigators, particularly related to inhaled aminoglycoside therapy in cystic fibrosis, that increased delivered drug dose, and the resultant increased lung drug concentrations, might be associated with improved therapeutic utility. In an independent study performed by our group, aerosolized amikacin administered to healthy volunteers at a dose of 5 mg/kg, produced sputum concentrations of 25–298 mcg/ml 1-hour post administration. These sputum concentrations far exceed the MIC 90 of amikacin for the vast majority of NTM isolates, while producing serum amikacin concentrations that are at or below the accepted range for trough concentrations produced by intravenous amikacin administration. These results are consistent with those published for the use of inhaled tobramycin, where measured serum levels after inhaled drug delivery remain very low, even with doses that exceed usual total daily parenteral doses.

This study has a number of limitations. The reported follow-up of patients in our case series occurred over a 9–52 month period. Longer follow-up of each patient may be needed to fully assess disease recurrence (either by re-infection or by reactivation of suppressed initial infection) over time in responders, particularly given the apparent increased inherent susceptibility of these patients to NTM infections. In our study, aerosolized amikacin was administered using a DeVilbiss PulmoAide Compressor/Nebulizer system (DeVilbiss Health Care; Somerset, Pa). We do not know the aerosol droplet size that would be best to generate optimal distribution of amikacin in patients with pulmonary NTM infection. Other aerosol delivery systems may be of equal or greater utility for amikacin delivery in these circumstances.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^1155AAVZ]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Infection prophylaxis in severe traumatic brain injury — introduction states that severe traumatic brain injury can increase a patient's susceptibility to infection because of necessary mechanical ventilation and invasive monitoring, and that infection risks such as ventilator associated pneumonias (VAP) and central line-associated bacteremias are increased in all critically ill patients. Patients undergoing intracranial pressure monitoring are reported to have related infection rates as high as 27%, and data prior to the 2011 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions show that VAP in patients with traumatic brain injury may be as high as 40% and is strongly associated with longer exposure to mechanical ventilation. In this Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition, possible VAP requires a positive culture, purulent respiratory secretions, or positive results on one of several tests. For external ventricular drains, the historic focus of routine catheter exchanges has been replaced by attention to proper care during insertion and cerebrospinal fluid sampling techniques, and there is a question of whether prophylactic intravenous antibiotics reduce infection rates or increase the risk for emergence of drug-resistant organisms. The occurrence of VAP represents a significant morbidity and is associated with hypoxia, fevers, hypotension, and increased intracranial pressure, and the risk of infection associated with external ventricular drains is of particular concern for traumatic brain injury patients.

### Changing susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus in a US pediatric population [^115faYD4]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of infection in both adult and pediatric populations. After several decades of increasing prevalence, the proportion of S aureus infections due to methicillin-resistant S aureus has been reported to be in decline in adults. Data for similar changes in pediatric populations are limited.

Methods

Evaluation of S aureus susceptibility data for pediatric patients receiving care in the US Military Health System was performed. Microbiology and demographic data were collected for years 2005 through 2014. Trends in antibiotic susceptibility results were evaluated. Clinical and demographic characteristics were explored to assess for association with antibiotic susceptibilities.

Results

In this study, 41745 S aureus isolates from 39207 pediatric patients were included. An overall increase in susceptibility of isolates to oxacillin was noted over this 10-year period; with over 60% of isolates oxacillin-susceptible in 2014. S aureus susceptibility to clindamycin declined over the study period; notably methicillin-susceptible S aureus susceptibility to clindamycin declined from 90% to 83% (P < .0001). Differences in oxacillin susceptibility between US regions decreased over time.

Conclusions

Similar to recent trends seen in adults, the proportion of pediatric S aureus infections secondary to methicillin-resistant S aureus appear to be decreasing, as is variability in US geographical resistance rates. Increasing clindamycin resistance among methicillin-susceptible S aureus should raise caution in the use of empirical clindamycin in presumed S aureus infection. Clinicians should be aware of regional susceptibility patterns when choosing empirical regimens.

### IL-23 / IL-17A dysfunction phenotypes inform possible clinical effects from anti-IL-17A therapies [^1171MsdE]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis

Mutations in IL12RB1 are also associated with increased susceptibility to tuberculosis in humans. It has been hypothesized that these IL12RB1 polymorphisms may reduce receptor responsiveness to IL-12 (and possibly IL-23), thereby disrupting IFN-γ-mediated immunity. Animal models have also shown that TLR2-deficient mice infected with M. tuberculosis TLR2 have significantly decreased Th17 cell counts, IL-17 expression, and IL-23p19 expression. Similarly, polymorphisms in TLR2 and TLR2-signaling molecules have been associated with increased susceptibility to tuberculosis infection in humans. Observed IL-17A deficiencies are probably of limited importance in host defense against tuberculosis infection, as IL-22 has been shown to be the key Th17 effector cytokine in pulmonary host defense mechanisms, and depletion of IL-17A-producing CD4 + T cells has been shown to have little to no effect on disease progression during primary M. tuberculosis infection.

Salmonella

Nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) infections can cause localized, albeit potentially severe, gastroenteritis in immunocompetent individuals. However, when immunocompromised individuals are exposed to NTS, the pathogen can spread beyond the intestines to the bloodstream, resulting in a life-threatening condition known as NTS bacteremia. Studies in humans have linked IL-12/IL-23-component deficiencies to increased susceptibility to severe extra-intestinal NTS infection; however, it was not specified which genes were affected in these patients. The protective role of these cytokines against Salmonella appears to be independent of the IFN-γ immune response. Rather, it is suggested that the IL-23/Th17 pathway has a key role in mucosal inflammatory responses to NTS infection.

### Management of Grave's thyroidal and extrathyroidal disease: an update [^114bP49X]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Graves Disease in the Time of the Covid-19 Virus Pandemic

Poorly controlled hyperthyroidism increases the risk of COVID-19 infection, especially in elderly people. Uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis is associated with excess cardiovascular mortality. Infections, for example, COVID-19, may precipitate thyroid storm in patients with poorly controlled thyroid dysfunction. Thus, both COVID-19 infection and an unstable hyperthyroid state markedly increase morbidity and mortality risk in general, and in elderly people in particular. Hence, each patient with Graves hyperthyroidism should continue ATD medication and should be closely monitored by the managing physician. Further, patients with poorly controlled diabetes and/or adrenal insufficiency, and those on high-dose immunosuppressive GCs may be more susceptible to developing COVID-19 infection, as they are with any other infections. The morbidity associated with those conditions could increase susceptibility, as patients with adrenal failure are more prone to develop infections. Concomitant electrolyte imbalances are exacerbated by infection, causing dehydration, which can propagate an adrenal crisis and a potentially fatal cytokine storm. Hence, GO patients on GCs may have increased susceptibility to COVID-19 as a result of the immunosuppressive effects of GCs and potential adrenal failure. Prospective and randomized trials have shown that in contrast to oral GC therapy, IVGCs are not associated with secondary adrenal insufficiency. As the true impact of COVID-19 in immunosuppressed patients can neither be accurately evaluated nor predicted, a cautious approach is recommended for both patients who have recently finished the IVGC treatment, and especially for those who have completed a long-term course of oral GCs for GO. These subjects should be closely monitored if they become infected by COVID-19, as they are at risk of potentially developing acute adrenal failure. Is it worth mentioning that dexamethasone improves outcomes in severe COVID-19; however, unless sight-threatening forms are present, high-doses of GC and systemic treatment should be postponed, and local as well as preventive measures offered.

Asymptomatic colonization occurs "in children < 5 years of age, and is most frequent in infants < 1 year of age", and IBD patients "have a higher frequency of severe disease requiring colectomy". For flare evaluation, "Testing for C difficile toxin is prudent in patients with IBD who present with worsening GI tract symptoms" to distinguish infection from IBD exacerbation.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) — infections as precipitating factors and management: In hospitalized decompensated cirrhotic patients, we recommend assessment for infection because infection is associated with the development of ACLF and increased mortality, and in patients with cirrhosis and suspected infection, we suggest early treatment with antibiotics to improve survival. Key concepts emphasize that antibiotics should be de-escalated once cultures and sensitivities are available, first-line antibiotic therapy should be determined by infection etiology/severity, acquisition setting, and local resistance patterns, multidrug-resistant bacterial infections are on the rise and must be considered, and alterations in gut microbial composition and function are associated with infection susceptibility and ACLF. Infection occurs in up to 40% of patients with ACLF at initial presentation, patients with cirrhosis who acquire infection may not have typical symptoms, a "normal" white blood cell count may represent a doubling or even tripling of a patient's baseline, nonelectively admitted patients with cirrhosis should be evaluated for infection with prompt initiation of antibiotics when infection is suspected to prevent ACLF development, and the documented presence of infection in a patient with ACLF is a strong negative prognostic factor.

### Microbial dynamics and pulmonary immune responses in COVID-19 secondary bacterial pneumonia [^115P9Qyn]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Secondary bacterial pneumonia (2°BP) is a morbid and often fatal complication of severe respiratory viral infections –. Hospital-acquired 2°BP has been especially problematic during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to longer hospitalizations, increased mortality, and a rise in antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) infections. A dynamic relationship between pathogens, the lung microbiome, and the host immune response underpins the pathophysiology of pneumonia, yet few studies have assessed these biological features in patients with 2°BP, leaving gaps in our understanding of this important sequela of viral illness.

The co-pathogenesis of respiratory viruses with bacterial pathogens has been recognized for decades, and best studied in the context of influenza virus. In the 1918 influenza pandemic, which led to over 50 million deaths, retrospective autopsy studies revealed evidence of 2°BP in the majority of cases. Influenza, COVID-19, and other viral infections lead to alterations in the upper and lower respiratory tract microbiome, which may increase susceptibility to secondary infections by creating ecological niches for pathogenic bacteria. Reduced microbiome alpha diversity, for instance, is a feature of both viral and bacterial lower respiratory tract infections in critically ill patients.

The common practice of early empiric antimicrobial administration in critically ill patients can further disrupt the airway microbiome, and additionally select for AMR bacterial pathogens. Mechanically ventilated patients in particular endure prolonged exposure to the hospital environment, which increases the risk of colonization by opportunistic pathogens in the upper airway, oropharynx, and lungs. It remains unclear, however, how changes in the airway microbiome of critically ill patients with COVID-19 might precipitate 2°BP, highlighting an important knowledge gap.

Severe COVID-19 is characterized by a dysregulated inflammatory response in both the airways and systemic circulation, yet whether 2°BP is associated with further alterations in this pathologic immune state remains unclear. For instance, 2°BP might lead to activation of innate immune signaling pathways important for bacterial defense, which has been observed in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia prior to the COVID-19 pandemic –. Alternatively, 2°BP might arise from suppressed immune signaling, which is well described in mouse models of post-influenza 2°BP, and in patients with sepsis who acquire nosocomial infections. It is also possible that the host response to 2°BP may simply be overshadowed by the inflammatory state of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### The microbiota in pneumonia: from protection to predisposition [^1178LSq9]. Science Translational Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract and gut are physiologically colonized with their own collection of microbes, the microbiota. The normal upper respiratory tract and gut microbiota protects against pneumonia by impeding colonization by potentially pathogenic bacteria and by regulating immune responses. However, antimicrobial therapy and critical care procedures perturb the microbiota, thus compromising its function and predisposing to lung infections (pneumonia). Interindividual variations and age-related alterations in the microbiota also affect vulnerability to pneumonia. We discuss how the healthy microbiota protects against pneumonia and how host factors and medical interventions alter the microbiota, thus influencing susceptibility to pneumonia.

### Antimicrobial-resistant infections in hospitalized patients [^114zRe9p]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

The burden of antimicrobial resistance in the US remains substantial, with approximately 570 000 resistant cases among hospitalized patients in 2022. There have been important changes in rates over the past decade as resistant cases per 10 000 hospitalizations for 5 of the 6 pathogens experienced declines, including declines in both hospital-onset and community-onset resistant cases. However, progress in reducing resistant case rates stalled or, for some pathogens, reversed even before the COVID-19 pandemic. This detailed description provides insights that can be used by health care partners to evaluate factors contributing to these trends and inform the development of novel approaches.

In 2020, we observed increases in hospital-onset resistant case rates like what others have found. Changes to health care use during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as decreases in overall admissions, surges in high-risk patients with COVID-19, and higher proportions of patients who were sicker and did not have COVID-19 contributed to increased hospital-onset resistant case rates. We found an increase in average patient days per hospitalization from 2020 to 2022. This suggests an increase in patients with severity of illness that continued when COVID-19 hospitalizations declined and may reflect larger trends in an aging US population with increased chronic illness or a move to manage less acute patients in outpatient care. Additionally, infection control practices like contact precautions for patients with some resistant pathogens and monitoring excess antimicrobial use decreased during the pandemic, which may have led to increased antimicrobial resistance. Our findings suggest a need for prevention interventions that can maintain effectiveness despite strain on health care systems and workers.

### Clinical practices underlie COVID-19 patient respiratory microbiome composition and its interactions with the host [^112hXsfr]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

COVID-19, a novel coronavirus disease classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, has caused over 150 million reported cases and 3 million deaths worldwide to date. Infection by its causative agent, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, results in a wide range of clinical manifestations: it is estimated that around 80% of infected individuals are asymptomatic or present only mild respiratory and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, while the remaining 20% develop acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring hospitalization and oxygen support and, of those, 25% of cases necessitate critical care. Despite a concerted global research effort, many questions remain about the full spectrum of the disease severity. Independent studies from different countries, however, agree that age and sex are the major risk factors for disease severity and patient death –, as well as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Other potential risk factors for critical condition and death are a viral load of the patient upon hospital admission – and the specific immune response to infection, with the manifestation of an abnormal immune response in critical patients characterized by dysregulated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which some studies have associated with organ failure.

Despite its close interplay with the immune system and its known associations with host health, little is known about the role of the respiratory microbiota in modulating COVID-19 disease severity, or its potential as a prognostic marker. Previous studies exploring other pulmonary disorders have shown that the lung microbiota members may exacerbate symptoms and contribute to their severity, potentially through direct crosstalk with the immune system and/or due to bacteremia and secondary infections. First studies of the respiratory microbiome in COVID-19 have revealed elevated levels of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria –. However, reports on bacterial diversity are contradictory. While some studies report a low microbial diversity in COVID-19 patients, that rebounds following recovery, others show an increased diversity in the COVID-19 associated microbiota. These conflicting results could be due to differences in sampling location (upper or lower respiratory tract), the severity of the patients, disease stage, treatment, or other confounders. While these early findings already suggest that the lung microbiome could be exacerbating or mitigating COVID-19 progression, exact mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. Therefore, an urgent need exists for studies identifying and tackling confounders in order to discern true signals from noise.

### Human genetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and critical COVID-19 [^112aLdgJ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

During the past 2 years, studies on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have revealed rare inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) in type interferon (IFN) pathways underlying critical COVID-19 pneumonia. This has provided insights into pathophysiological mechanisms and immune signaling circuits regulating antiviral responses to SARS-CoV-2 and governing the susceptibility to and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.

Objectives

In this review, the current knowledge on IEIs underlying critical COVID-19 is presented, and the clinical implications of these findings for individualized prophylaxis and treatment are outlined.

Sources

The review is based on a broad literature search, including primarily studies on whole-exome sequencing, and to a lesser extent genome-wide association studies, of patients with critical COVID-19, as well as retrospective descriptive studies of the SARS-CoV-2 disease course in individuals with known IEIs.

Content

The review describes the discovery of monogenic IEI in 9 genetic loci related to the production or responses to type I IFN in patients with critical COVID-19 pneumonia and the surprising finding of phenocopies of these, represented by neutralizing autoantibodies to type IFN in a significant proportion of patients with critical pneumonia, particularly in elderly men, and further enriched in patients with lethal disease course. Moreover insights gained from studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease course, and outcome in patients with known IEI is presented. Finally, some hypotheses for a possible genetic basis of autoimmune, inflammatory, and long-term complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented and discussed.

Implications

Uncovering IEIs underlying critical COVID-19 or other severe SARS-CoV-2 disease manifestations provides valuable insights into the basic principles of antiviral immune responses and pathophysiology related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such knowledge has important clinical implications for identification of susceptible individuals and for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of patients to reduce disease burden and improve preparedness against viral pandemics with known or emerging viruses in the future.

### Antimicrobial-resistant infections in hospitalized patients [^111WWfRE]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How has antimicrobial resistance changed from 2012 to 2022?

Findings

In this cohort study of 7 158 139 cultures from 2012 to 2022, overall resistant cases per 10 000 hospitalizations declined between 2012 to 2016; however, progress varied across pathogens and was inconsistent before the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic was associated with notable increases in hospital-onset cases.

Meaning

These findings suggest that innovative prevention interventions are needed to reduce antimicrobial resistance, as current interventions may be insufficient.

### Is the oral microbiome a source to enhance mucosal immunity against infectious diseases? [^116UzEtH]. NPJ Vaccines (2021). Medium credibility.

Some significant progress in understanding antiviral T-cell response has emerged from the rapid study of SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, several studies published recently with regard to SARS-CoV-2 indicated that healthy, seronegative donors may have heterologous protection from the current coronavirus strain due to previous coronavirus infections –. In Braun et al. the T-cells obtained from both recovered (83%) and healthy donors (34%) showed reactivity from the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. In depth epitope mapping and characterization provided evidence of cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 from prior coronavirus exposure. These data are compelling evidence to suggest a universal coronavirus vaccine might be possible. The cited studies above indicated that both CD4+ (likely Th1 dominant) and CD8+ T-cells were capable of reactivity but no further characterization was provided. A recent study of T-cell characterization for patients with COVID-19 describes a dominant Th1 repertoire with additional but smaller subsets of Th2 and Th17. It remains unclear what type of T-cell repertoire would be found in an asymptomatic person or the patient successfully controlling a SARS-CoV-2 infection which is potentially of greater importance for informing vaccine targeting strategy. There is emerging discussion about IL-17 and Th17 as detrimental in coronavirus immunopathology and concerns around vaccination-induced immune enhancement reviewed here –. However, an epidemiological study of patients on current IL-17 inhibitors indicated that these patients were at higher risk for respiratory diseases compared to controls. Given that the dominant T-cell response in SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to be Th1 with a subset of Th17 and, combined with the understanding that the inhibition of IL-17 may lead to increased viral susceptibility, it is attractive to consider that the Th17 may be playing a supportive role for induction of a potent Th1 response. Indeed, there is some additional evidence that the addition of IFN-ɣ can reduce IL-17 mediated pathology. This is the mechanism by which adjuvant activity is directed towards a Th17 response that confers Th1 memory might improve vaccine design for a safe and effective mucosal immunity with potential heterologous protection, a particularly attractive notion given the current drive for a successful SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Additionally, it might be important to evaluate the host-microbial influence on disease severity and therapeutic outcome especially if the therapeutic application is at the mucosal interface.

### Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infection mortality rate and length of hospitalization [^113Ej818]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Acinetobacter infections have increased and gained attention because of the organism's prolonged environmental survival and propensity to develop antimicrobial drug resistance. The effect of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter infection on clinical outcomes has not been reported. A retrospective, matched cohort investigation was performed at 2 Baltimore hospitals to examine outcomes of patients with MDR Acinetobacter infection compared with patients with susceptible Acinetobacter infections and patients without Acinetobacter infections. Multivariable analysis controlling for severity of illness and underlying disease identified an independent association between patients with MDR Acinetobacter infection (n = 96) and increased hospital and intensive care unit length of stay compared with 91 patients with susceptible Acinetobacter infection (odds ratio [OR] 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–5.2 and OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.0–4.3] respectively) and 89 uninfected patients (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2–5.4 and OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.5–11.6] respectively). Increased hospitalization associated with MDR Acinetobacter infection emphasizes the need for infection control strategies to prevent cross-transmission in healthcare settings.

### IL17A genetic variation is associated with altered susceptibility to Gram-positive infection and mortality of severe sepsis [^1179QxHy]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found that patients who had the GG genotype of IL17A rs1974226 G/A SNP had increased susceptibility to Gram-positive bacterial infection in the derivation cohort and this result was replicated in the validation cohort. In addition, this genotype was significantly associated with adverse clinical outcome of severe sepsis. We found that the G allele of the IL17A SNP was associated with increased 28-day mortality in both cohorts of severe sepsis/septic shock patients.

IL17A is an essential cytokine for host defense against bacteria, which is produced by a variety of cells including T cells (T helper 17, γδ T, NKT cell), lymphoid-tissue inducer-like cells, neutrophils and intestinal Paneth cell. Cells triggered by microbes secrete IL17A, which is then recognized by an IL17 receptor. Subsequent cellular signaling activates inflammatory pathways including NF-kB and MAPK/AP-1, which invoke production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial peptides, which induce inflammation required for host defense. Human IL17A-producing cells increase IL17A production against bacteria or their toxins. Serum IL17A levels were elevated in bacterial sepsis patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and in animal models of abdominal bacterial infection. IL17 deficiency in mice impairs microbial clearance, delays recovery from infection and increases susceptibility to infection including S. aureus and C. albicans. In accord with the observations in IL17 deficient mice, low birth weight infants who had blood stream infections had deceased blood IL17 levels compared to those without blood stream infections. These results are in accord with our current observations that severe sepsis patients who had the IL17A rs1974226 GG genotype had increased susceptibility to Gram-positive infection.

### A retrospective case-control study of eravacycline for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter infections in patients with burn injuries [^111j3C3T]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

There is currently a gap in the literature regarding the use of eravacycline in the population of patients with burns. Extensive thermal injuries frequently lead to an increased length of hospital stay due to the time required to regrow healthy dermal tissue and eventual wound closure. Thermal injuries lead to a deficiency in one's natural, protective barrier to infection, increased susceptibility to multiple pathogens, and often require multiple courses of antibiotics. For patients surviving the initial 72 h post-burn injury, the most common cause of death is sepsis. Due to the increasing prevalence of MDR bacteria and the heightened susceptibility of patients with burns to infection, studies are needed to examine the clinical effect of eravacycline in this population. The primary objective of this retrospective, case-control study is to compare the outcomes of patients with thermal injuries treated with eravacycline versus a matched control for CRAB infections.

Other considerations in bacterial enteric infections: MSM may be at increased risk for antibiotic-resistant enteric infections; diarrhea is a common illness of international travelers and antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacterial pathogens outside the United States is common, so clinicians should consider the possibility of resistant infections when prescribing empiric antibiotic therapy for travelers with HIV while traveling or upon return to the United States, particularly among travelers to South and Southeast Asia or Africa; for patients with persistent diarrhea (> 14 days) but no other severe clinical signs, antibiotic therapy can be withheld until a diagnosis is confirmed and noninfectious etiologies can be considered in the differential diagnosis (BIII); azithromycin should not be used to treat bacteremia; before susceptibilities are known, empiric IV ceftriaxone is recommended, and updated outbreak information, local susceptibility patterns, and travel history should always be considered.

### Host genetics and infectious disease: new tools, insights and translational opportunities [^114SZ8SK]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2021). High credibility.

Understanding how human genetics influence infectious disease susceptibility offers the opportunity for new insights into pathogenesis, potential drug targets, risk stratification, response to therapy and vaccination. As new infectious diseases continue to emerge, together with growing levels of antimicrobial resistance and an increasing awareness of substantial differences between populations in genetic associations, the need for such work is expanding. In this Review, we illustrate how our understanding of the host-pathogen relationship is advancing through holistic approaches, describing current strategies to investigate the role of host genetic variation in established and emerging infections, including COVID-19, the need for wider application to diverse global populations mirroring the burden of disease, the impact of pathogen and vector genetic diversity and a broad array of immune and inflammation phenotypes that can be mapped as traits in health and disease. Insights from study of inborn errors of immunity and multi-omics profiling together with developments in analytical methods are further advancing our knowledge of this important area.

### Host-pathogen interface: progress in understanding the pathogenesis of infection due to multidrug-resistant bacteria in the intensive care unit [^112fJSPk]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The diverse responses of critically ill patients to infection with multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria are determined by many complex factors. These include the nature of the immune response activated by specific organisms. Properties unique to each organism such as adherence proteins, microvesicle formation, toxin production and the propensity to form biofilms are important factors in pathogenesis. Equally important is the variability in the host immune response, whether due to genetic or iatrogenic factors, including the presence of major comorbidities, treatment with immunomodulatory therapy and disruption of the microbiome. Future approaches in treating infections caused by MDR bacteria will be heavily influenced by a precision medicine approach, with rapid diagnostic techniques of both bacterial and host factors and high throughput screening of novel therapeutics becoming the mainstay of treatment.

### Vancomycin [^115M96x7]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibacterial Resistance

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including vancomycin, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When vancomycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by vancomycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### Deflazacort [^112HseeK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection

Corticosterosids, including deflazacort, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can:

- Reduce resistance to new infections
- Exacerbate existing infections
- Increase the risk of disseminated infections
- Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections
- Mask some signs of infections Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe, and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages. Monitor for the development of infection and consider deflazacort withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed. Tuberculosis If deflazacort is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged deflazacort therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis. Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids, including deflazacort. In corticosteroid-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are non-immune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles.
- If an deflazacort-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immunoglobulin may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.
- If an deflazacort-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin may be indicated. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including deflazacort. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection. Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with deflazacort. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids, including deflazacort, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid deflazacort use in the presence of such infections unless deflazacort is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic deflazacort therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, deflazacort withdrawal or dose reduction is recommended. Amebiasis Corticosteroids, including deflazacort, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating deflazacort in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea. Strongyloides Infestation Corticosteroids, including deflazacort, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid- induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia. Cerebral Malaria Avoid corticosteroids, including deflazacort, in patients with cerebral malaria.

### Immunological lessons from genome-wide association studies of infections [^1148xFzg]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Over the past few years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been increasingly applied to identify host genetic factors influencing clinical and laboratory traits related to immunity and infection, and to understand the interplay between the host and the microbial genomes. By screening large cohorts of individuals suffering from various infectious diseases, GWAS explored resistance against infection, natural history of the disease, development of life-threatening clinical signs, and innate and adaptive immune responses. These efforts provided fundamental insight on the role of major genes in the interindividual variability in the response to infection and on the mechanisms of the immune response against human pathogens both at the individual and population levels.

### Host genomics of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^117VYkU6]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the very first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, it became clear that the clinical course of infection with the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly variable between individuals. Most patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a relatively benign disease course, while a minority develop acute respiratory distress syndrome sometimes with extra-pulmonary complications and multi-organ failure, with death occurring in about 0.5% of infections. Life-threatening COVID-19 is mostly observed in individuals with risk factors such as old age or pre-existing comorbid conditions (e.g. obesity, pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, or immunosuppression). Age is by far the strongest epidemiological predictor of COVID-19 severity, with the risk of death doubling every five years throughout adult life and population age structure accounting for three quarters of the variation in infection fatality rate estimates between countries. Biological sex also plays an important modulating role, with men being at 1.5 times higher risk of severe disease than women. Nevertheless, a sizable fraction of the interindividual variation in clinical symptoms and risk of death is not explained by demographic or clinical risk factors. Of particular interest is the observation that some young patients with no known comorbidity develop severe clinical presentations of COVID-19. This suggests the existence of human genetic factors influencing the response to SARS-CoV-2.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Allergic (Hypersensitivity/Infusion) Reactions

Patients should be informed of the possibility of serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (including life threatening and fatal reactions), despite premedication with antihistamines, and to immediately report any facial swelling or difficulty breathing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Increased Blood Glucose Levels

Patients are likely to experience increased blood glucose levels while taking temsirolimus injection. This may result in the need for initiation of, or increase in the dose of, insulin and/or hypoglycemic agents. Patients should be directed to report any excessive thirst or frequency of urination to their physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Infections

Patients should be informed that they may be more susceptible to infections while being treated with temsirolimus injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Interstitial Lung Disease

Patients should be warned of the possibility of developing interstitial lung disease, a chronic inflammation of the lungs, which may rarely result in death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Patients, including those who are taking or have taken corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents, should be directed to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms to their physician.

### Dedicator of cytokinesis 8-deficient CD4T cells are biased to a T2 effector fate at the expense of T1 and T17 cells [^111c5ZUQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency is a combined immunodeficiency caused by autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutations in DOCK8. This disorder is characterized by recurrent cutaneous infections, increased serum IgE levels, and severe atopic disease, including food-induced anaphylaxis. However, the contribution of defects in CD4 + T cells to disease pathogenesis in these patients has not been thoroughly investigated.

Objective

We sought to investigate the phenotype and function of DOCK8-deficient CD4 + T cells to determine (1) intrinsic and extrinsic CD4 + T-cell defects and (2) how defects account for the clinical features of DOCK8 deficiency.

Methods

We performed in-depth analysis of the CD4 + T-cell compartment of DOCK8-deficient patients. We enumerated subsets of CD4 + T helper cells and assessed cytokine production and transcription factor expression. Finally, we determined the levels of IgE specific for staple foods and house dust mite allergens in DOCK8-deficient patients and healthy control subjects.

Results

DOCK8-deficient memory CD4 + T cells were biased toward a T H 2 type, and this was at the expense of T H 1 and T H 17 cells. In vitro polarization of DOCK8-deficient naive CD4 + T cells revealed the T H 2 bias and T H 17 defect to be T-cell intrinsic. Examination of allergen-specific IgE revealed plasma IgE from DOCK8-deficient patients is directed against staple food antigens but not house dust mites.

Conclusion

Investigations into the DOCK8-deficient CD4 + T cells provided an explanation for some of the clinical features of this disorder: the T H 2 bias is likely to contribute to atopic disease, whereas defects in T H 1 and T H 17 cells compromise antiviral and antifungal immunity, respectively, explaining the infectious susceptibility of DOCK8-deficient patients.

### Role of airway glucose in bacterial infections in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114rRdv6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infection, which contributes to disease progression and mortality, but mechanisms of increased susceptibility to infection remain unclear.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine whether glucose concentrations were increased in airway samples (nasal lavage fluid, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) from patients with stable COPD and to determine the effects of viral infection on sputum glucose concentrations and how airway glucose concentrations relate to bacterial infection.

Methods

We measured glucose concentrations in airway samples collected from patients with stable COPD and smokers and nonsmokers with normal lung function. Glucose concentrations were measured in patients with experimentally induced COPD exacerbations, and these results were validated in patients with naturally acquired COPD exacerbations. Relationships between sputum glucose concentrations, inflammatory markers, and bacterial load were examined.

Results

Sputum glucose concentrations were significantly higher in patients with stable COPD compared with those in control subjects without COPD. In both experimental virus-induced and naturally acquired COPD exacerbations, sputum and nasal lavage fluid glucose concentrations were increased over baseline values. There were significant correlations between sputum glucose concentrations and sputum inflammatory markers, viral load, and bacterial load. Airway samples with higher glucose concentrations supported more Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth in vitro.

Conclusions

Airway glucose concentrations are increased in patients with stable COPD and further increased during COPD exacerbations. Increased airway glucose concentrations might contribute to bacterial infections in both patients with stable and those with exacerbated COPD. This has important implications for the development of nonantibiotic therapeutic strategies for the prevention or treatment of bacterial infection in patients with COPD.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^111UMYt3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

General principles of COVID-19 pharmacotherapy — During the early phase of infection, when viral load is high and the host's adaptive immune response has not mounted, treatments targeting viral replication are most likely to be effective; these include nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, molnupiravir, remdesivir, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and donor convalescent plasma, and timely initiation is critical because they are more efficacious when given within 5 to 7 days of symptom onset. Most patients do not progress to severe or critical disease, but some with risk factors do; later in the disease process, in severe and especially critical disease, an excessive and aberrant inflammatory response is implicated as the primary cause of immunopathological damage, and anti-inflammatory therapies like corticosteroids, IL-6 inhibitors or JAK inhibitors have been shown to be beneficial.

### The IL23R A / gln381 allele promotes IL-23 unresponsiveness in human memory T-helper 17 cells and impairs Th17 responses in psoriasis patients [^115bmWRF]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

In keeping with our previous study, we found no difference in either the frequency of IL-23R+ memory Th cells or in IL-23R surface expression in the different genetic groups also in this data set. Moreover, we also confirmed that IL-23 signaling has no role in Th17 lineage commitment, as the frequency of circulating Th17 cells did not differ. However, by using memory Th cells, we found that AA homozygous individuals were unresponsive to IL-23, whereas heterozygous individuals displayed an attenuated response to IL-23, although not statistically significant as in our earlier study in polarized Th17 cells, possibly because of the different experimental system used. Nevertheless, the striking allele-dosage effect in IL-23 responsiveness, far exceeding the relatively small odds ratio conferred by IL23R GA/Arg381Gln, further supports its protective role in immune-mediated diseases.

Th17 cells and cytokines are increasingly implicated as major culprits in autoimmunity as opposed to their protective role in host immunity against fungal and bacterial infections. Mendelian defects in several Th17-related genes, such as IL12b, IL12rb, STAT3, IL17ra, IL17F, cause severe immunodeficiency, marked susceptibility to, and recurrence of, bacterial and fungal infections. The lack of Th17 cytokines observed in these cases impairs neutrophil recruitment, macrophage activation, and AMP production by keratinocytes and neutrophils, thus interrupting the cross talk between adaptive and innate immunity required for full pathogen clearance. In contrast, the almost complete ablation of IL-23-induced Th17 response we observed in AA individuals does not seem to predispose to a significant increase in recurring fungal infections, as ascertained by a self-administered questionnaire to our healthy volunteers (data not shown), suggesting that alternative signals can deliver adequate Th17 responses. Although limited to a small number of participants, this finding is clinically relevant in the context of IL-23p19 or IL-23R targeting in immune-mediated diseases, and is in line with the long-term safety data for anti-IL-12/23p40 showing no increased susceptibility to infections. Interestingly, a study assessing the prognostic significance of genetic variants in the IL-23/Th17 axis for the outcome of T cell–depleted allogeneic stem cell transplantation found that the donor IL23R GA/Arg381Gln genotype was associated with decreased risk of fungal infections and improved patient overall survival, although increased risk of cytomegalovirus infections was detected.

### Pathogen-host interactions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia [^111pyE5F]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important pathogen causing a wide range of acute and chronic infections. P. aeruginosa rarely causes infection in the normal host, but is an efficient opportunistic pathogen causing serious infections in patients who are mechanically ventilated, individuals who are immunocompromised, and patients with malignancies or HIV infection. Among these risk groups, the most vulnerable hosts are neutropenic and patients who are mechanically ventilated. In addition, P. aeruginosa is the most prevalent chronic infection contributing to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis. Because of the ubiquitous nature of P. aeruginosa and its ability to develop resistance to antibiotics, it continues to be problematic from a treatment perspective. The pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa is largely caused by multiple bacterial virulence factors and genetic flexibility enabling it to survive in varied environments. Lung injury associated with P. aeruginosa infection results from both the direct destructive effects of the organism on the lung parenchyma and exuberant host immune responses. This article focuses on the major bacterial virulence factors and important aspects of the host immunity that are involved in the pathogenesis of serious P. aeruginosa infection. In addition to antibiotic therapy, strategies directed toward enhancing host defense and/or limiting excessive inflammation could be important to improve outcome in P. aeruginosa lung infections.

### TH17 deficiency in human disease [^113ryUg7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

The differentiation of naive T cells into distinct subsets of effector T cells is critical for effective immunity against a wide variety of infectious agents in the environment. Activation of innate immune responses by Candida species through pattern-recognition receptors directs the subsequent development of naive T cells into T(H)17 cells, which are essential for effective mucosal immunity against fungi. Thorough analyses of cohorts of patients with unusual susceptibility to chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis resulting from T(H)17 deficiency have confirmed the role of T(H)17 cells and T(H)17 cytokines in human host defense against Candida species and have provided valuable insights into the complex process of T(H)17 cell development.

### Common skin rashes in children | AAFP… [^112hWkJg]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Scarlet Fever Scarlet fever is diagnosed in 10% of children presenting with streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis. 8 It is caused by certain strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci that release a streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin. Patients who have a hypersensitivity to the toxin may develop the characteristic rash associated with scarlet fever. Most children have a fever and sore throat one to two days before the rash develops on the upper trunk. The rash spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles, with characteristic circumoral pallor. This differs from some viral exanthems that develop more slowly. The rash is characterized by confluent, erythematous, blanching, fine macules, resembling a sunburn, and sandpaper-like papules. In skinfolds, such as the axilla, antecubital fossa, and buttock creases, an erythematous, nonblanching linear eruption may develop.

Petechiae on the palate may occur, as well as erythematous, swollen papillae with a white coating on the tongue. Red strawberry tongue occurs after desquamation of the white coating. After several weeks, the rash fades and is followed by desquamation of the skin, especially on the face, in skin-folds, and on the hands and feet, potentially lasting four to six weeks. 9 With a sensitivity of 90% to 95%, throat culture is the first-choice method for diagnosis of group A streptococcal infection, but this is not always practical. 8 Rapid antigen tests are routinely used in clinicians' offices and have a sensitivity of approximately 86%. 10 Cultures may be ordered when the suspicion for group A streptococcal infection is high, but the rapid antigen test result is negative. 11 Penicillin is the therapy of choice for streptococcal infection.

Those allergic to penicillin and cephalosporins may be treated with oral macrolides or clindamycin.
10. Impetigo Impetigo is a primary or secondary bacterial infection of the epidermis of the skin. Primary infections occur when bacteria enter breaks in the skin, whereas secondary infections develop at the site of an existing dermatosis. There are bullous and nonbullous forms of the infection, with the bullous form typically occurring in neonates and the nonbullous form most common in preschool- and school-aged children. 12 Although Streptococcus pyogenes was once the most common cause of nonbullous impetigo, Staphylococcus aureus has surpassed it in more recent years. However, S. pyogenes may still be the predominant cause in warm and humid climates. S. aureus is the main source of bullous impetigo. Initially, children may develop vesicles or pustules that form a thick, yellow crust.

With autoinoculation, the lesions may quickly spread. The face and extremities are most commonly affected. Although impetigo is usually a self-limited disease, antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent complications and spread of the infection.
12. Erythema Infectiosum Erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease, is caused by parvovirus B19. It is a common childhood infection characterized by a prodrome of low-grade fever, malaise, sore throat, headache, and nausea followed several days later by an erythematous "slapped cheek" facial rash. After two to four days, the facial rash fades. In the second stage of the disease process, pink patches and macules may develop in a lacy, reticular pattern, most often on the extremities. After one to six weeks, the rash resolves but may reappear with sun exposure, heat, or stress. Arthralgias occur in approximately 8% of young children with the disease but are much more common in teens and young adults.

### Pruritic acral rash in a child… [^112Uk49o]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

A three-year-old boy presented with a diffuse, progressive rash on his arms and legs that had persisted for five days. The eruption first appeared on his right forearm, then spread to his thighs and cheeks. The rash was mildly pruritic and associated with a low-grade fever. The patient had received all age-appropriate immunizations. Examination revealed an otherwise healthy, active child. Multiple erythematous papules, 2 to 3 mm in diameter, coalescing into plaques with secondary excoriations were noted on his forearms, thighs, and cheeks. Other than two erythematous papules on the upper back, the patient's chest and back were spared. Question Discussion The correct answer is B: Gianotti-Crosti syndrome. Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is a relatively common dermatosis that occurs worldwide. The condition affects children three months to 15 years of age, but typically occurs before four years of age.

However, it has been reported in adults. 1 Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is characterized by the acute onset of monomorphous, pink to red-brown papules or papulovesicles that may become confluent. The papules are distributed symmetrically on the face, extensor surfaces of the extremities, and buttocks. The rash may be slightly pruritic; is typically nonhyperkeratotic; and spares the trunk, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. 1 It may persist for many weeks. The cutaneous manifestations can be preceded by diarrhea or an upper respiratory tract infection. The rash may be accompanied by a low-grade fever, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or inguinal or axillary lymphadenopathy. Although the exact pathogenesis is unclear, Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is considered a self-limited, cutaneous response to various immunologic triggers. Although the syndrome was first described in association with hepatitis B virus, Epstein-Barr virus is now the most common associated virus in the United States.

1 Hepatitis A virus, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, rotavirus, mumps, parvovirus, molluscum contagiosum, 1 and childhood immunizations have also been associated with the syndrome. 2 Recent reports indicate that bacterial infections such as Bartonella henselae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and group A streptococci may trigger Gianotti-Crosti syndrome. 2 Although the specific reason that children develop Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is unknown, an association with atopy has been suggested. 3 Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is diagnosed clinically by the presence of a characteristic rash, although other conditions can be considered in patients with equivocal or atypical cases. 1 Because the condition is self-limited, treatment usually is not required. However, topical steroids and oral antihistamines can be prescribed as needed for pruritus. Patients' parents should be reassured that the rash usually resolves without scarring within 10 to 60 days.

1.

Erythema multiforme causes target-shaped papular and vesiculobullous lesions on the extremities or mucous membranes. The lesions are often distributed symmetrically and may be preceded by fever or upper respiratory tract symptoms. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet are often involved; initial involvement most commonly occurs on the dorsal hands. 4 The condition typically affects adolescents and young adults and is usually triggered by recurrent herpes simplex virus infections. More serious forms that include mucosal involvement have been associated with various infections and medications. Lichen planus is an acute or chronic inf lammatory dermatosis of unknown origin involving skin or mucous membranes. Although the etiology is unknown, there is an association with hepatitis C virus.

### Dermatologic emergencies… [^113xMK7F]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever Key findings in patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever include history of a tick bite, fever, and a characteristic rash. Between 60 and 75 percent of patients with this condition are given an alternate diagnosis at the initial physician visit.
13. DIAGNOSIS Clinical Findings. The diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is primarily clinical. The classic triad of symptoms associated with the disease includes fever, headache, and rash in a person with a history of tick bite or exposure to ticks. 8 Patients also may present with nausea, vomiting, myalgia, anorexia, and severe abdominal pain. The rash appears two to five days after the onset of fever in 80 to 90 percent of patients. 9 Many patients present before the rash appears; therefore, a high index of suspicion is warranted in endemic areas when a patient presents with severe symptoms that mimic a viral illness.

The rash begins as small, blanching, nonpruritic macules that develop into a maculopapular rash and progress after several days to petechial lesions. The classic spotted appearance occurs when the petechial lesions coalesce and form ecchymosis. 3 In later stages of the disease, the skin can become tender and desquamate. The early rash of Rocky Mountain spotted fever mimics many infectious and noninfectious diseases that have an associated maculopapular rash. 16 The petechial rash that occurs in Rocky Mountain spotted fever also occurs in other conditions 17. 1–12 It begins around the wrists and ankles and spreads to the palms and soles, eventually covering the extremities and trunk. The face is usually spared. A rash on the palms and soles is a distinct distribution that occurs in approximately 40 percent of patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. 9, 17 However, other exanthems can present with fever and rash on the palms and soles.

16 In patients with severe disease in whom treatment is delayed, complications can include cardiac and renal failure, meningitis, and pneumonitis. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis can be performed if neurologic symptoms are present. If a rash is present, direct immunofluorescence of a punch biopsy fixed in special media can detect rickettsial organisms within the vascular endothelium. A standard punch biopsy fixed in formalin may show necrotizing vasculitis. TREATMENT Treatment for Rocky Mountain spotted fever should begin immediately after diagnosis, and cases must be reported to the state health department. Patients treated more than five days after the onset of symptoms have a mortality rate three times greater than that in patients treated earlier. 8, 18 The mainstay of treatment is antibiotics; doxycycline is the first-line agent. Tetracycline is an alternative in adults and children older than eight years, and chloramphenicol is preferred in pregnant women.

7–9 Hospitalization should be considered for severely ill patients and those with a history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, who are at higher risk of complications. DIAGNOSIS Clinical Findings. Patients with necrotizing fasciitis often have a history of a wound or trauma. Common symptoms include fever and chills, with heat, erythema, edema, and pain over a focal area of skin. 19 The pain is typically out of proportion to the physical findings, which can help distinguish this condition from cellulitis. TREATMENT First-line treatment for necrotizing fasciitis is immediate hospitalization, surgical debridement, and antibiotic therapy. 5, 6 A broad-spectrum antibiotic with coverage of gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes and aerobes should be administered empirically 3, 5, 20. 1–12 Fluid resuscitation is also necessary.
