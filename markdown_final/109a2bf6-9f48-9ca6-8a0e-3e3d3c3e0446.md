## Question

what does existing data suggest about the use aromatherapy to improve cognition?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether aromatherapy improves cognition and how strong the evidence is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the scope and definitions, including what counts as aromatherapy and which cognitive outcomes are relevant. Then, I should appraise the highest-quality evidence, especially Cochrane reviews and recent meta-analyses. Next, I will examine individual randomized trials and consider mechanistic plausibility. After that, I should review guideline positions and weigh benefits versus risks. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically oriented conclusion with clear caveats and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the scope and definitions so I don't conflate interventions. Aromatherapy here refers to the therapeutic use of essential oils via inhalation or topical application, and cognition should be assessed with standardized measures such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), or domain-specific neuropsychological batteries. I need to ensure I distinguish aromatherapy from olfactory training, which uses repeated odor exposure to rehabilitate smell and may have different cognitive effects, and I should also separate aromatherapy from simple environmental odor exposure used for agitation or sleep, which may not target cognition per se.

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence. The 2020 Cochrane review of aromatherapy for dementia included 13 randomized trials with 708 participants and explicitly concluded there was no convincing evidence of benefit on cognition, with only two small trials even attempting to measure cognitive outcomes and neither showing a significant effect. Wait, let me verify the exact wording: yes, "we did not find evidence of benefit on these outcomes" and "our confidence in the results of these studies was low", which is a key negative signal for cognition [^112SfMdc]. Earlier Cochrane iterations similarly found equivocal or limited results and emphasized methodological limitations rather than cognitive gains, reinforcing the lack of efficacy signal for cognition [^116BJ3gJ] [^112QcEHd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check for newer syntheses that might contradict this. A 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis of inhaled aromatherapy in patients with cognitive impairment reported significant improvements in MMSE and MoCA with large mean differences, but I need to scrutinize the quality and heterogeneity. The authors included 14 studies with 888 patients, yet many trials were small, short-term, and at risk of bias, and the pooled estimates showed substantial heterogeneity, which tempers confidence in a true effect. Moreover, this conflicts with the Cochrane conclusion, so I should weigh the Cochrane's methodological rigor and broader inclusion against this newer, potentially overoptimistic meta-analysis [^115pjYRW].

> I will now examine individual randomized trials to see if any high-quality studies show cognitive benefit. The Ballard 2002 trial suggested improvements in agitation with Melissa aromatherapy but did not demonstrate cognitive improvements, and subsequent trials have largely failed to show consistent cognitive gains. Burns 2011 found no benefit on agitation or other outcomes, and other controlled studies have been small, heterogeneous, and often not powered for cognition. Let me double-check: yes, the consistent theme is lack of cognitive benefit across adequately controlled trials, with any positive signals confined to behavioral endpoints rather than cognition [^115NTirr] [^116BJ3gJ] [^112SfMdc].

> But wait, what if there is a plausible mechanism that could still justify benefit despite negative trials? Essential oils like rosemary and sage contain terpenoids with in vitro cholinesterase inhibition, and acute rosemary exposure has shown small, transient cognitive effects in healthy adults, while oral sage oil improved secondary memory and attention in a crossover study. However, I should confirm whether these mechanistic or acute findings translate into clinically meaningful, sustained cognitive benefits in people with dementia or MCI; the answer appears to be no, as chronic, real-world interventions have not reproduced these effects reliably, and the Cochrane review's negative stance remains the most conservative and applicable for clinical decision-making [^113cDy5H] [^114PsFBs] [^112SfMdc].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. The Italian guideline for dementia and MCI explicitly recommends against offering aromatherapy to treat cognitive symptoms in MCI, reflecting insufficient evidence, and the Canadian Coalition for Seniors' Mental Health recommends aromatherapy only as a consideration for agitation, not for cognition. The American Psychiatric Association guideline notes mixed findings for aromatherapy with no clear cognitive benefit, and the AAFP dementia guideline does not list aromatherapy as a recommended cognitive intervention. This convergence supports the conclusion that aromatherapy should not be recommended to improve cognition [^114j9yP6] [^114TQPf3] [^113tbGQu] [^117AtJxp].

> I need to ensure the risk–benefit discussion is balanced. Aromatherapy is generally low risk when used appropriately, though respiratory irritation can occur in susceptible individuals and essential oil quality varies widely, complicating replication and safety assessment. Given the absence of proven cognitive benefit, any use should be framed as optional, adjunctive, and symptom-targeted (for example, for agitation or sleep) rather than as a disease-modifying or cognition-enhancing therapy, with shared decision-making and monitoring for tolerability [^111wbgmW] [^115Ce1no].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. The weight of evidence indicates that aromatherapy does not improve cognition in dementia or MCI, with the most rigorous Cochrane review showing no cognitive benefit and contemporary guidelines recommending against its use for cognitive symptoms. A recent meta-analysis suggesting large cognitive improvements is likely biased by small, heterogeneous, and methodologically limited studies, and should not overturn the negative conclusion from higher-quality evidence. Therefore, aromatherapy should not be recommended to improve cognition, though it may be considered for other symptoms like agitation or sleep disturbance with appropriate precautions [^112SfMdc] [^114j9yP6] [^115pjYRW].

> Finally, I should translate this into practical clinical guidance. For patients with dementia or MCI, prioritize evidence-based nonpharmacologic cognitive interventions such as cognitive stimulation, cognitive training in mild AD, music therapy for behavioral and modest cognitive gains, physical activity, and occupational therapy, while reserving aromatherapy, if at all, for targeted symptom relief rather than cognition. If aromatherapy is tried, use standardized, high-quality oils, monitor for respiratory or skin reactions, and set expectations that any cognitive benefit is unlikely based on current evidence. I should confirm that this aligns with guidelines emphasizing these alternatives, which it does [^114j9yP6] [^117AtJxp] [^114j9yP6].

Aromatherapy shows **no consistent benefit for cognition** in dementia or MCI, with Cochrane reviews finding no convincing evidence of cognitive improvement [^112SfMdc] [^116BJ3gJ]. A 2025 meta-analysis reported improved MMSE/MoCA scores with inhaled essential oils [^115pjYRW], but the evidence is low quality, heterogeneous, and not validated by high-quality trials; thus, it should be interpreted cautiously. Aromatherapy may help **agitation and mood** [^114TQPf3] [^115NTirr], but it is not recommended to improve cognition. If used, it should be adjunctive and with careful monitoring for adverse effects.

## Evidence for aromatherapy in cognitive impairment

### Dementia

- **Cochrane review (2020)**: 13 RCTs (708 participants) found no convincing evidence that aromatherapy improves cognition in dementia; only 3 trials assessed cognition, with 2 showing no significant effect and 1 not reporting data [^112SfMdc].

- **Cochrane review (2014)**: 7 RCTs (428 participants) found equivocal benefits, with only 2 trials providing usable results; no consistent cognitive benefit was observed [^116BJ3gJ].

- **Italian guideline (2024)**: Recommends against aromatherapy for cognitive symptoms in MCI due to insufficient evidence [^114j9yP6].

---

### Mild cognitive impairment (MCI)

Evidence in MCI is **limited and inconclusive**; a 2022 RCT in MCI found no significant cognitive benefit from olfactory training, a related intervention, although it increased frontal activation on fMRI [^116yt9bn]. A 2025 meta-analysis of inhaled aromatherapy reported improved MMSE/MoCA scores, but the evidence is low quality and heterogeneous; further high-quality trials are needed [^115pjYRW].

---

## Mechanisms of action

Proposed mechanisms include **limbic system modulation** — where olfactory pathways project to the limbic system, potentially influencing memory and emotion — and **cholinergic effects**, given that some essential oils (e.g. sage) inhibit acetylcholinesterase, though clinical relevance remains uncertain [^114PsFBs] [^115DbWTp].

---

## Safety considerations

Aromatherapy is **generally safe**, but adverse effects can occur, particularly with topical use or in vulnerable populations:

- **Skin irritation**: Allergic reactions or dermatitis, especially with undiluted oils.

- **Respiratory irritation**: Cough, bronchospasm, or asthma exacerbation, particularly in those with respiratory conditions.

- **Drug interactions**: Potential interactions with sedatives or antidepressants.

- **Pregnancy**: Use caution; some oils may be contraindicated.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend aromatherapy** for cognitive enhancement:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Italian guideline (2024) | Recommends against aromatherapy for cognitive symptoms in MCI [^114j9yP6] |
| Canadian Coalition for Seniors' Mental Health (2025) | Recommends aromatherapy for agitation, not cognition [^114TQPf3] |
| American Psychiatric Association (2007) | Mixed findings; no clear cognitive benefit identified [^113tbGQu] |

---

## Limitations of current research

- **Small sample sizes**: Most studies are underpowered.

- **Heterogeneity**: Variability in oils, delivery, duration, and outcomes limits comparability.

- **Short-term interventions**: Many studies are ≤ 12 weeks, limiting inference on durability.

- **Lack of standardized protocols**: Differences in oil quality, concentration, and administration confound results [^115VUNgT].

---

## Future research directions

- **Larger, longer RCTs**: Adequately powered, ≥ 6 months, with standardized protocols.

- **Standardized oils and delivery**: Consistent quality, concentration, and administration methods.

- **Objective outcomes**: Biomarkers or neuroimaging to complement cognitive testing.

- **Subgroup analyses**: Identify responders by age, sex, or cognitive stage.

---

## Practical clinical implications

Given the current evidence, aromatherapy **should not be used as a primary intervention** for cognitive impairment. It may be considered adjunctively for agitation or mood, with careful monitoring for adverse effects and drug interactions. Clinicians should discuss the limited and inconsistent evidence with patients and caregivers and set realistic expectations.

---

Aromatherapy does not have **consistent evidence** for improving cognition in dementia or MCI; any observed benefits are small, heterogeneous, and of low quality. It may be used adjunctively for behavioral symptoms, but clinicians should prioritize evidence-based cognitive interventions and monitor for adverse effects.

### Aromatherapy for dementia [^112SfMdc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Medications licensed for the treatment of dementia have limited efficacy against cognitive impairment or against the distressed behaviours (behavioural and psychological symptoms, or behaviour that challenges) which are also often the most distressing aspect of the disorder for caregivers. Complementary therapies, including aromatherapy, are attractive to patients, practitioners and families, because they are perceived as being unlikely to cause adverse effects. Therefore there is interest in whether aromatherapy might offer a safe means of alleviating distressed behaviours in dementia.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of aromatherapy for people with dementia.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, on 5 May 2020 using the terms: aromatherapy, lemon, lavender, rose, aroma, alternative therapies, complementary therapies, essential oils. In addition, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO (all via Ovid SP), Web of Science Core Collection (via Thompson Web of Science), LILACS (via BIREME), CENTRAL (via the Cochrane Library), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) on 5 May 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials which compared fragrance from plants in an intervention defined as aromatherapy for people with dementia with placebo aromatherapy or with treatment as usual. All doses, frequencies and fragrances of aromatherapy were considered. Participants in the included studies had a diagnosis of dementia of any subtype and severity.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in included studies, involving other authors to reach consensus decisions where necessary. We did not perform any meta-analyses because of heterogeneity between studies, but presented a narrative synthesis of results from the included trials. Because of the heterogeneity of analysis methods and inadequate or absent reporting of data from some trials, we used statistical significance (P ≤ or > 0.5) as a summary metric when synthesising results across studies. As far as possible, we used GRADE methods to assess our confidence in the results of the trials, downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision.

Main Results

We included 13 studies with 708 participants. All participants had dementia and in the 12 trials which described the setting, all were resident in institutional care facilities. Nine trials recruited participants because they had significant agitation or other behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD) at baseline. The fragrances used were lavender (eight studies); lemon balm (four studies); lavender and lemon balm, lavender and orange, and cedar extracts (one study each). For six trials, assessment of risk of bias and extraction of results was hampered by poor reporting. Four of the other seven trials were at low risk of bias in all domains, but all were small (range 18 to 186 participants; median 66), reducing our confidence in the results. Our primary outcomes were agitation, overall behavioural and psychological symptoms, and adverse effects. Ten trials assessed agitation using various scales. Among the five trials for which our confidence in the results was moderate or low, four trials reported no significant effect on agitation and one trial reported a significant benefit of aromatherapy. The other five trials either reported no useable data or our confidence in the results was very low. Eight trials assessed overall BPSD using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and we had moderate or low confidence in the results of five of them. Of these, four reported significant benefit from aromatherapy and one reported no significant effect. Adverse events were poorly reported or not reported at all in most trials. No more than two trials assessed each of our secondary outcomes of quality of life, mood, sleep, activities of daily living, caregiver burden. We did not find evidence of benefit on these outcomes. Three trials assessed cognition: one did not report any data and the other two trials reported no significant effect of aromatherapy on cognition. Our confidence in the results of these studies was low.

Authors' Conclusions

We have not found any convincing evidence that aromatherapy (or exposure to fragrant plant oils) is beneficial for people with dementia although there are many limitations to the data. Conduct or reporting problems in half of the included studies meant that they could not contribute to the conclusions. Results from the other studies were inconsistent. Harms were very poorly reported in the included studies. In order for clear conclusions to be drawn, better design and reporting and consistency of outcome measurement in future trials would be needed.

### Aromatherapy for dementia [^116BJ3gJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Complementary therapy has received great interest within the field of dementia treatment and the use of aromatherapy and essential oils is increasing. In a growing population where the majority of patients are treated by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, the efficacy of treatment is short term and accompanied by negative side effects. Utilisation of complimentary therapies in dementia care settings presents as one of few options that are attractive to practitioners and families as patients often have reduced insight and ability to verbally communicate adverse reactions. Amongst the most distressing features of dementia are the behavioural and psychological symptoms. Addressing this facet has received particular interest in aromatherapy trials, with a shift in focus from reducing cognitive dysfunction to the reduction of behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of aromatherapy as an intervention for people with dementia.

Search Methods

ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, was searched on 26 November 2012 and 20 January 2013 using the terms: aromatherapy, lemon, lavender, rose, aroma, alternative therapies, complementary therapies, essential oils.

Selection Criteria

All relevant randomised controlled trials were considered. A minimum length of a trial and requirements for follow-up were not included, and participants in included studies had a diagnosis of dementia of any type and severity. The review considered all trials using fragrance from plants defined as aromatherapy as an intervention with people with dementia and all relevant outcomes were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Titles and abstracts extracted by the searches were screened for their eligibility for potential inclusion in the review. For Burns 2011, continuous outcomes were estimated as the mean difference between groups and its 95% confidence interval using a fixed-effect model. For Ballard 2002, analysis of co-variance was used for all outcomes, with the nursing home being treated as a random effect.

Main Results

Seven studies with 428 participants were included in this review; only two of these had published usable results. Individual patient data were obtained from one trial (Ballard 2002) and additional analyses performed. The additional analyses conducted using individual patient data from Ballard 2002 revealed a statistically significant treatment effect in favour of the aromatherapy intervention on measures of agitation (n = 71, MD -11.1, 95% CI -19.9 to -2.2) and behavioural symptoms (n = 71, MD -15.8, 95% CI -24.4 to -7.2). Burns 2011, however, found no difference in agitation (n = 63, MD 0.00, 95% CI -1.36 to 1.36), behavioural symptoms (n = 63, MD 2.80, 95% CI -5.84 to 11.44), activities of daily living (n = 63, MD -0.50, 95% CI -1.79 to 0.79) and quality of life (n = 63, MD 19.00, 95% CI -23.12 to 61.12). Burns 2011 and Fu 2013 found no difference in adverse effects (n = 124, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.15 to 6.46) when aromatherapy was compared to placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

The benefits of aromatherapy for people with dementia are equivocal from the seven trials included in this review. It is important to note there were several methodological difficulties with the included studies. More well-designed, large-scale randomised controlled trials are needed before clear conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of aromatherapy for dementia. Additionally, several issues need to be addressed, such as whether different aromatherapy interventions are comparable and the possibility that outcomes may vary for different types of dementia.

### The effect of inhaled aromatherapy on cognitive function in patients with cognitive impairment: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115pjYRW]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Cognitive function is the basis of human thinking and behavior. Cognitive impairment has a serious impact on each individual and imposes a financial burden to families and healthcare systems. Inhalation aromatherapy has advantages, due to its safety, convenience, lack of toxicity, and wide use in the treatment of cognitive impairment. This systematic review was conducted to provide evidence for the use of inhaled aromatherapy in patients with cognitive impairment.

Methods

We searched nine databases for pertinent Chinese and English studies published through November 2024 studies using inhaled aromatherapy in patients with cognitive impairment. Literature screening and data extraction were performed independently by two researchers and evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration's quality criteria and were then cross-checked. A meta-analysis was carried out using Cochrane's Review Manager (RevMan, version 5.4), and we followed the PRISMA guidelines.

Results

We included fourteen studies involving 888 patients with cognitive impairment in our study. Meta-analyses indicated that inhaled aromatherapy increased Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE, mean difference MD = 3.89 95% CI [3.19, 4.58], P < 0.00001) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA, MD = 4.11, 95% CI [3.54, 4.68], P < 0.00001) scores and decreased Homocysteine levels (Hcy, MD = -2.27 95% CI [-2.80, -1.74], P < 0.00001) in patients with cognitive impairment compared with controls.

Conclusion

Inhaled aromatherapy could improve global cognition and lower Hcy in patients with cognitive impairment.

### Aroma therapy for dementia [^112QcEHd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Complementary therapies have become more commonly used over the last decade and have been applied to a range of health problems, including dementia. Of these, aroma therapy is reported to be the most widely used in the British National Health Service (Lundie 1994) and might be of use for people with dementia for whom verbal interaction may be difficult and conventional medicine of only marginal benefit. Aroma therapy has been used for people with dementia to reduce disturbed behaviour (e.g. Brooker 1997), promote sleep (e.g. Wolfe 1996), and stimulate motivational behaviour (e.g. MacMahon 1998).

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of aroma therapy as an intervention for people with dementia.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register was searched on 29 October 2002 to find all relevant trials using the terms: aroma therap*, "aroma therap", "complementary therap", "alternative therap" and "essential oil". The CDCIG Register contains records from all major health care databases and is updated regularly. Additionally, relevant journals were hand searched, and 'experts' in the field of complementary therapies and dementia contacted.

Selection Criteria

All relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered. A minimum length of trial and requirements for a follow-up were not included, and participants in included studies had a diagnosis of dementia of any type and severity. The review considered all trials using fragrance from plants defined as aroma therapy as an intervention with people with dementia. Several outcomes were considered in this review, including cognitive function, quality of life, and relaxation.

Data Collection and Analysis

The titles and abstracts extracted by the searches were screened for their eligibility for potential inclusion in the review, which revealed 2 RCTs of aroma therapy for dementia. Neither of these had published results in a form that we could use. However, individual patient data from one trial were obtained (Ballard 2002) and additional analyses performed. Analysis of co-variance was used for all outcomes, using a random effects model.

Main Results

The additional analyses conducted revealed a statistically significant treatment effect in favour of the aroma therapy intervention on measures of agitation and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Aroma therapy showed benefit for people with dementia in the only trial that contributed data to this review, but there were several methodological difficulties with this study. More well designed large-scale RCTs are needed before conclusions can be drawn on the effectiveness of aroma therapy. Additionally, several issues need to be addressed, such as whether different aroma therapy interventions are comparable and the possibility that outcomes may vary for different types of dementia.

### The Canadian Coalition for Seniors' Mental Health Canadian clinical practice guidelines for assessing and managing behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) [^114TQPf3]. Canadian Geriatrics Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, more specifically with respect to alternative and complementary medicine, CCSMH 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering aromatherapy for the management of agitation in patients with dementia.

### The study protocol of a blinded randomised-controlled cross-over trial of lavender oil as a treatment of behavioural symptoms in dementia [^115VUNgT]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

A recent review concluded that while aromatherapy, amongst other non-pharmacological treatments, was identified as a potential treatment of behavioural problems in dementia, studies were often weakened by small sample sizes, lack of controls and imprecise measures. Furthermore, previous studies generally failed to specify source, purity, concentration and reliability of delivery.

Therefore, the aim of the proposed study is to test the effectiveness of topically applied 30% lavender oil of proven purity as a treatment of behavioural symptoms in dementia. To this end, we will conduct a randomised-controlled trial (RCT) by way of a cross over design with an appropriate control condition and blinding. We hypothesise that lavender oil will lead to a greater reduction in the frequency of behavioural symptoms of dementia than a placebo oil.

### Toward a theory-based specification of non-pharmacological treatments in aging and dementia: focused reviews and methodological recommendations [^114yLnLt]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Medium credibility.

In 2015, the Non-Pharmacological Interventions Professional Interest Area (NPI-PIA) group was formed as a successor to the "psychosocial understanding and intervention" PIA within the Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART). The NPI-PIA aims to address issues related to the design, methodology, and reporting of studies of NPT in the context of aging and dementia and to stimulate research in this area. In 2017, at the NPI-PIA Annual Meeting at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC) in London, the Executive Committee and members agreed that there are several issues that affect progress in this broad field of research and deemed a position paper necessary. The main issues discussed included the need to (1) identify and comment on key conceptual issues and challenges in response to rapid changes in thinking about dementia and underlying neurodegenerative diseases and their treatment, and (2) advance a more coherent and theoretically driven approach to the classification and description of NPI treatments, which would lead to (3) improved methodological and reporting standards in this area of research.

In this paper, we offer a conceptual framework that may be useful for organizing and classifying research in NPT. We briefly summarize the body of work available in relation to key types of NPT in the context of people with dementia or at risk of dementia due to MCI, subjective cognitive decline, or biomarker profiling, and identify key challenges. Finally, we provide methodological guidelines for the design of trials of NPTs, and conclude with several directions for future research. An overview of the project timeline and main milestones is shown in Figure 1.

1.1 | Key conceptual issues

Here we briefly highlight some of the conceptual issues that were identified when considering and choosing the appropriate treatments and target groups for the current article.

1.1.1 | Literature review

We performed a search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (September 2019), which yielded 122 systematic reviews on a variety of NPT categories, ranging from aromatherapy to vitamin D3 supplements. The majority of NPTs focused on persons with dementia. Figure 2 depicts the number of studies included in these Cochrane studies, with most studies performed for cognitive training and Chinese herbal medicine. – The quality grading for the level of evidence was modest at best.

### Clinical practice with anti-dementia drugs: a consensus statement from British Association for Psychopharmacology [^115yDnL9]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) coordinated a meeting of experts to review the evidence on the drug treatment for dementia. The level of evidence (types) was rated using a standard system: Types 1a and 1b (evidence from meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials or at least one controlled trial respectively); types 2a and 2b (one well-designed study or one other type of quasi experimental study respectively); type 3 (non-experimental descriptive studies); and type 4 (expert opinion). There is type 1a evidence for cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease; memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease; and for the use of bright light therapy and aromatherapy. There is type 1a evidence of no effect of anti inflammatory drugs or statins. There is conflicting evidence regarding oestrogens, with type 2a evidence of a protective effect of oestrogens but 1b evidence of a harmful effect. Type 1a evidence for any effect of B12 and folate will be forthcoming when current trials report. There is type 1b evidence for gingko biloba in producing a modest benefit of cognitive function; cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of people with Lewy body disease (particularly neuropsychiatric symptoms); cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine in treatment cognitive impairment associated with vascular dementia; and the effect of metal collating agents (although these should not be prescribed until more data on safety and efficacy are available). There is type 1b evidence to show that neither cholinesterase inhibitors nor vitamin E reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in people with mild cognitive impairment; and there is no evidence that there is any intervention that can prevent the onset of dementia. There is type 1b evidence for the beneficial effects of adding memantine to cholinesterase inhibitors, and type 2b evidence of positive switching outcomes from one cholinesterase inhibitor to another. There is type 2a evidence for a positive effect of reminiscence therapy, and type 2a evidence that cognitive training does not work. There is type 3 evidence to support the use of psychological interventions in dementia. There is type 2 evidence that a clinical diagnosis of dementia can be made accurately and that brain imaging increases that accuracy. Although the consensus statement dealt largely with medication, the role of dementia care in secondary services (geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry) and primary care, along with health economics, was discussed. There is ample evidence that there are effective treatments for people with dementia, and Alzheimer's disease in particular. Patients, their carers, and clinicians deserve to be optimistic in a field which often attracts therapeutic nihilism.

### Dementia [^111stBHJ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2012). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dementia is characterised by chronic, global, non-reversible deterioration in memory, executive function, and personality. Speech and motor function may also be impaired.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments on cognitive symptoms of dementia (Alzheimer's, Lewy body, or vascular)? What are the effects of treatments on behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (Alzheimer's, Lewy body, or vascular)? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 49 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine), antidepressants (clomipramine, fluoxetine, imipramine, sertraline), antipsychotics (haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone), aromatherapy, benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), cognitive stimulation, exercise, ginkgo biloba, memantine, mood stabilisers (carbamazepine, sodium valproate/valproic acid), music therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), omega 3 (fish oil), reminiscence therapy, and statins.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^113tbGQu]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Stimulation-oriented approaches in dementia — activities, art therapies, exercise, multisensory stimulation, simulated presence, and aromatherapy are intended to mobilize available cognitive resources by providing stimulation and enrichment, with outcomes varying by modality. Benefits of music therapy may include improving mood, decreasing behavior problems, enhancing socialization and quality of life, and encouraging emotional expression. An intervention combining activities, guidelines for psychotropic drug use, and educational rounds reduced behavior disorders in 89 nursing home patients with moderate to severe dementia, and after 6 months significantly lowered behavior disorders and psychotropic drug and restraint use versus usual care. Simulated presence in 54 nursing home residents with severe dementia significantly reduced rates of agitation compared with usual care or placebo. Multisensory stimulation in 50 patients yielded short-lived improvements in mood, attention, and behavior, whereas a second trial involving 136 patients found no differences; sensory integration in 40 residents similarly showed no improvements. Aromatherapy findings were mixed, with one study reporting reduced agitation and improved quality of life and another finding no benefit. Exercise studies reported improved mobility, physical endurance, strength, and mood in four studies, whereas one study found no change in mobility and function, and a behavioral protocol includes stimulation-oriented interventions.

When looking at the mechanism of action of aromatherapy on humans, it is stated that it triggers the release of substances such as dopamine, serotonin, endorphin and noradrenaline in the cerebellum and causes changes in the person's mental and physical state. When the use of aromatherapy oils throughout history is examined, it is seen that it was first used in the ancient Egyptian civilization in the making of mummies and in the ancient Chinese civilization as an expression of gratitude to God. This study is planned to be conducted due to the limited number of studies on inhalation aromatherapy as an intervention in the context of neurocognitive anxiety, stress, memory and attention, intelligence, academic performance, etc. in the context of school health within the scope of a holistic approach in the child population and the need for nursing studies in this area.

The preadolescent period selected in this study is stated to be the period between the ages of 9–12, known as the period when many physical and psychological changes occur. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effects of aromatherapy on exam anxiety, attention deficit and academic success of 9–12 year old children in the school age group. It is thought that the results will contribute to the literature. Other: Before Application Other: Before the 1st Written Exam Other: End of Term

### The Italian guideline on diagnosis and treatment of dementia and mild cognitive impairment [^114j9yP6]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Non-pharmacological treatments for cognitive symptoms in dementia or MCI

Non-pharmacological interventions are an essential therapeutic approach for PwD or MCI, helping maintain cognitive functions and independence, and manage behavioural symptoms. A wide variety of non-pharmacological interventions are available, and treatment options can vary based on the specific needs due to disease severity or to personal preferences or expectations. With the progression of the disease, tailored interventions can help in maintaining independence and managing everyday functions. Group activities can also offer the opportunity for social interaction and peer support, as well as facilitate engagement. Creative and leisure activities can help maintain well-being in PwD at every stage of the disease.

Four RQs focused on the effectiveness of these interventions for cognitive functions, functional abilities, well-being and independence — three in PwD and one in MCI.

The review included 168 studies on PwD (58 from the literature update) and 68 on people with MCI (see Supplementary Table S5). Based on available evidence, the WG recommended offering cognitive stimulation to treat cognitive symptoms in people with mild to moderate dementia and considering reminiscence therapy to treat cognitive symptoms in people with moderate dementia. Cognitive training was recommended only in mild AD dementia due to the lack of evidence in other dementia subtypes. Therefore, further research was recommended on its potential effectiveness in people with moderate AD dementia or other dementia subtypes. Cognitive rehabilitation was effective in improving daily activities but not cognitive functions or quality of life in people with mild to moderate dementia.

The WG agreed considering physical activity to improve cognitive symptoms in PwD, and occupational therapy and cognitive rehabilitation to support functional activities in people with mild to moderate dementia. Evidence did not support the use of supplements or nutritional interventions, psychotherapy, acupuncture, light therapy or therapeutic robots to treat cognitive symptoms. Available evidence on art therapy, dance and pet therapy was inconclusive but suggestive of a potential benefit, thus further research was recommended. The WG agreed considering music therapy to treat cognitive symptoms in PwD.

The WG agreed to offer cognitive training and consider art therapy, physical exercise, dance, games, cognitive rehabilitation and music therapy in managing cognitive symptoms for the same outcome in people with MCI. Based on available evidence, the WG agreed not offering supplements, nutritional interventions, acupuncture, aromatherapy or transcranial stimulation to treat cognitive symptoms in people with MCI. Further research was recommended on the effect of serious games, virtual reality, and interventions for cognitive and linguistic abilities.

### Complementary and integrative medicine for neurocognitive disorders and caregiver health [^111wbgmW]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Body-Based Practices

Body-based practices may include spinal manipulation (e.g. chiropractic, osteopathic medicine), aromatherapy, and massage therapy. Evidence for these interventions in neurocognitive disorders have been explored but remain more limited. Aromatherapy, a therapy related to massage, relies on the use of essential oils extracted from plants for health purposes. At times, aromatherapy combines the scent of essential oils with calming effects (e.g. lavender). Aromatherapy has been examined for its effects on agitation in patients with dementia and demonstrated significant reduction of agitated behaviors and depressive mood overall. Additionally, one study showed that the combination of aromatherapy and massage tended to alleviate agitated behaviors and depressive symptoms in dementia as compared to either cognitive stimulation therapy or reminiscence therapy alone. One randomized controlled trial studied the effectiveness of lavender and lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) essential oils on agitated behaviors of older adults with and without dementia residing in a residential facility. They found that lemon balm was more effective in reducing agitated behaviors in residence without dementia while lavender was more effective in reducing agitated behaviors in those with dementia. Another double-blind, placebo-controlled trial used lemon balm oil (Melissa officinalis) for managing agitation in severe dementia and found overall improvement in agitation. Although some risks of respiratory pathways' irritation exist in individuals with underlying lung conditions, aromatherapy can be a safe and effective intervention to alleviate clinically significant agitation in older adults with severe dementia.

### Aromatherapy as a safe and effective treatment for the management of agitation in severe dementia: the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with melissa [^115NTirr]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia are frequent and are a major management problem, especially for patients with severe cognitive impairment. Preliminary reports have indicated positive effects of aromatherapy using select essential oils, but there are no adequately powered placebo-controlled trials. We conducted a placebo-controlled trial to determine the value of aromatherapy with essential oil of Melissa officinalis (lemon balm) for agitation in people with severe dementia.

Method

Seventy-two people residing in National Health Service (U.K.) care facilities who had clinically significant agitation in the context of severe dementia were randomly assigned to aromatherapy with Melissa essential oil (N = 36) or placebo (sunflower oil) (N = 36). The active treatment or placebo oil was combined with a base lotion and applied to patients' faces and arms twice a day by caregiving staff. Changes in clinically significant agitation (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory [CMAI]) and quality of life indices (percentage of time spent socially withdrawn and percentage of time engaged in constructive activities, measured with Dementia Care Mapping) were compared between the 2 groups over a 4-week period of treatment.

Results

Seventy-one patients completed the trial. No significant side effects were observed. Sixty percent (21/35) of the active treatment group and 14% (5/36) of the placebo-treated group experienced a 30% reduction of CMAI score, with an overall improvement in agitation (mean reduction in CMAI score) of 35% in patients receiving Melissa balm essential oil and 11% in those treated with placebo (Mann-Whitney U test; Z = 4.1, p < .0001). Quality of life indices also improved significantly more in people receiving essential balm oil (Mann-Whitney U test; percentage of time spent socially withdrawn: Z = 2.6, p = .005; percentage of time engaged in constructive activities: Z = 3.5, p = .001).

Conclusion

The finding that aromatherapy with essential balm oil is a safe and effective treatment for clinically significant agitation in people with severe dementia, with additional benefits for key quality of life parameters, indicates the need for further controlled trials.

### Effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for post-stroke depression in stroke survivors: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^113aunyj]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

ObjectivesTo evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for managing post-stroke depression and identify the characteristics of optimal interventions. Data SourcesEight English databases and two Chinese databases were searched from inception to February 2025, alongside grey literature. MethodsTwo reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or pilot/feasibility RCTs. Study quality was evaluated with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. Meta-analyses used Review Manager 5.3 when feasible; otherwise, narrative syntheses were conducted. Certainty of evidence was assessed via the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. ResultsSeventeen studies (1297 stroke survivors) were included. Two had a low risk of bias, two had a high risk, and 13 had some concerns. Meta-analyses showed cognitive-behavioural intervention had significant short-term effects (< one month) on depressive symptoms versus control (standardised mean difference SMD: -0.63, 95% CI: -1.00 to -0.26, p < 0.001, I2 = 81%; 7 studies; 693 participants). Cognitive-behavioural interventions without cognitive restructuring showed significant short-term (effect size ES = 0.52–1.08) and medium-term (1–6 months) effects (ES = 0.73–1.71). Preliminary evidence suggested that exercise with music, acceptance and commitment therapy, mindfulness meditation, and aromatherapy also improve depressive symptoms versus control. ConclusionNon-pharmacological interventions, including cognitive-behavioural intervention, exercise, acceptance and commitment therapy, mindfulness meditation, and aromatherapy, could improve post-stroke depressive symptoms. However, with very low evidence certainty, further rigorous RCTs are needed.

### "Like one part of a puzzle"-individualized aromatherapy for women with gynecological cancers in aftercare: results from a qualitative-focused mixed-methods study [^115Ce1no]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Women with gynecological cancers, including breast cancer, must often contend with cancer- and therapy-related side effects such as pain, fatigue, stress, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, neuropathy, psychological distress, changes in sexuality, or clusters of several symptoms. Symptomatic side effects usually do not vanish directly post chemotherapy but continue into aftercare — often into the survivor phase. Side effects of cancer can have strong negative impacts on women's daily lives and general well-being. Tools and care given by health care professionals for women's persisting symptomatic burdens have high relevance for those affected — for instance, as a part of individualized survivorship care plans (SCPs). However, enduring symptoms after cancer treatment often remain undertreated. The desire for symptom relief in daily life might explain the draw of complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) 1 approaches for women with gynecological cancers and breast cancer. The relevance of our research results from these points and can be summarized as follows: The increasing trend toward CIM in women's cancer care coupled with the need for evidence-based, individually adaptable strategies to cope with such symptomatic burdens necessitates empirical research of aromatherapy as one CIM method. Aromatherapy has gained growing public interest as a supportive therapeutic treatment for various health-related reasons and as a wellness application, as is evident from its media presence. Accordingly, interest in aromatherapy as a supportive therapy for symptomatic burdens due to cancer (treatment) is increasing. Empirical research results reinforce the potential to manage symptoms and improve general well-being of cancer patients by aromatherapy. However, there is still a lack of target group-specific research to consider user perspectives and experiences.

Additionally, clarity about what aromatherapy actually means is needed.

Understanding of aromatherapy

Aromatherapy is not always well-defined in health-related research. For this work, we use the definition of the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NIH) which explains aromatherapy as "the use of essential oils from plants (flowers, herbs, or trees) as a complementary health approach" (. 04.04.2022).

Essential oils are multi-substance mixtures of plant components, such as bark, resin, flowers, leaves, and fruit peels. They are obtained through various pressing and distillation processes. Each essential oil is distinct, as the chemical compositions depend on the conditions under which the corresponding plants were grown. This presents a challenge to aromatherapy research, as exact replications of interventions are quite impossible.

### The study protocol of a blinded randomised-controlled cross-over trial of lavender oil as a treatment of behavioural symptoms in dementia [^111NDmPy]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Interventions

Consented, willing participants will be assigned in random order to one block of 30% lavender oil and one block of neutral control oil. Each block will last for three days (i.e. 3 observation/treatment periods) over a week to capture possible cumulative benefits, with at least a two-day washout period between each block. Thus, in total there will be 6 observations/treatment periods over a 2 week period. Interventions will be delivered at times when nursing staff report that the target behaviour/s are of high frequency (excluding times of personal nursing care).

A nurse will massage 1.0 mL of the 30% lavender or control oil into the resident's forearms for one minute. Based on an earlier study, we expect that lavender plasma levels will peak 20 minutes later and have faded by 90 minutes. Observations will commence 30 minutes pre-exposure and finish 60 minutes post treatment, giving a total observation period of 90 minutes per session. A longer period is not feasible due to interruptions for nursing care, meals, visitors etc.

Materials

Aromatherapy will fail if the quantities of essential oil are too small to be effective. When applied by massage, lavender is typically prescribed as a 2.5% oil or lotion but there is no evidence to support this choice. We will apply 1 mL of 30% preparation to reduce the risk of missing a true effect through under-dosing. Pure lavender oil will be supplied by Essential Therapeutics, Melbourne, whose chemist will verify its purity using gas chromatography and supply a report to this effect. The characteristic profile of pure lavender's constituents is readily available.

Many varieties of pure lavender are held in stock. To select the one with greatest biological activity, up to 6 varieties will be assayed by Prof. George Lees (Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Otago University) who will measure the changes induced by 1:1000 dilutions of oils on the synaptic currents and action potentials of cultured networks of rat embryo pyramidal cortical neurones. The assays measure the capacity of samples to exert depressant effects on neurones, thus providing an animal model of sedation. The same assays have been used to demonstrate the mode of action of licensed antidepressants and sedatives.

The selected pure lavender oil will then be diluted with jojoba oil. The control oil will comprise just the base ingredients and will be tested to ensure that it is biologically inert. The supplied products will be stored in opaque containers at the recommended temperature.

### Effects of therapeutic interventions on long COVID: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113A8PgH]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

After infection with the novel coronavirus, patients may experience not only acute symptoms in the short term but also a significant likelihood of long-term complications affecting multiple organs and systems, potentially leading to a substantial decline in quality of life. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines long COVID, or post-COVID-19 condition (PCC), as the persistence or emergence of new symptoms three months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Common manifestations include extreme fatigue, dyspnea, anxiety, depression, anosmia, and cognitive impairment. A systematic review reported that the incidence of long COVID ranges from 50.9% to 87.4%, with fatigue being the most prevalent symptom (44%–63%) after 6–12 months of follow-up, followed by sleep disturbances (24%–46%).

To address long COVID, clinical strategies such as exercise, respiratory training, pharmacotherapy, olfactory rehabilitation, aromatherapy, tele-rehabilitation, dietary adjustments, transcranial stimulation, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy have been explored. Among these, exercise training and respiratory training fall under the category of physical therapy, and personalized physical therapy rehabilitation programs are particularly emphasized as the cornerstone for managing both physical and psychological symptoms. While previous meta-analyses have primarily focused on exercise training and pulmonary rehabilitation, emerging interventions such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), respiratory muscle training, and therapy for olfactory dysfunction have not been systematically evaluated. Existing studies are limited by small sample sizes, methodological heterogeneity (e.g. varying rehabilitation protocols), and insufficient exploration of non-physical symptoms such as olfactory dysfunction and fatigue. Moreover, no prior comprehensive meta-analysis has directly compared the efficacy of diverse interventions, leaving clinicians uncertain about optimal treatment hierarchies for long COVID.

We conducted a meta-analysis of RCTs to comprehensively evaluate the effects of several therapeutic interventions on Long COVID. Prior to the formal analysis, we performed a preliminary search and screening to identify interventions with sufficient data for meta-analysis. Consequently, we focused on exercise training, respiratory muscle training, tele-rehabilitation, steroid nasal spray, Palmitoylethanolamide and Luteolin (PEA-LUT), olfactory training, and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Our goal is to offer evidence-based guidance for personalized treatment of long COVID by clarifying the relative efficacy and symptom-specific benefits of these therapeutic options to support clinical decision-making.

### Acute ingestion of rosemary water: evidence of cognitive and cerebrovascular effects in healthy adults [^113cDy5H]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The use of herbal extracts and supplements to enhance health and wellbeing is increasing in western society.

Aims

This study investigated the impact of the acute ingestion of a commercially available water containing an extract and hydrolat of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L. syn. Salvia rosmarinus Schleid.). Aspects of cognitive functioning, mood and cerebrovascular response measured by near-infrared spectroscopy provided the dependent variables.

Methods

Eighty healthy adults were randomly allocated to consume either 250 mL of rosemary water or plain mineral water. They then completed a series of computerised cognitive tasks, followed by subjective measures of alertness and fatigue. Near-infrared spectroscopy monitored levels of total, oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin at baseline and throughout the cognitive testing procedure.

Results

Analysis of the data revealed a number of statistically significant, small, beneficial effects of rosemary water on cognition, consistent with those found previously for the inhalation of the aroma of rosemary essential oil. Of particular interest here are the cerebrovascular effects noted for deoxygenated haemoglobin levels during cognitive task performance that were significantly higher in the rosemary water condition. This represents a novel finding in this area, and may indicate a facilitation of oxygen extraction at times of cognitive demand.

Conclusion

Taken together the data suggest potential beneficial properties of acute consumption of rosemary water. The findings are discussed in terms of putative metabolic and cholinergic mechanisms.

### Debate position: cognition and mood are not improved in men administered exogenous testosterone therapy [^111GHLyx]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the increasing evidence suggesting that exogenous testosterone therapy is not associated with improvements in cognition or mood. This article is part of a series, in this issue, in which authors are assigned opinion pieces on controversial topics pertaining to testosterone replacement.

Recent Findings

Testosterone is increasingly being prescribed. Particularly in the setting of recent data suggestive of possible cardiovascular risk associated with its use; a clear understanding of the domains of health that improve with exogenous testosterone use is important. Data on endogenous and exogenous testosterone with cognition and mood are mixed, likely partly related to methodological differences of type of testosterone, patient population, and dosing.

Summary

Overall, available data are not suggestive of a clear benefit of testosterone supplementation in multiple domains of cognition and in mood. Supraphysiologic testosterone has been associated with adverse psychological outcomes, albeit not uniformly in studies.

### Effect of aromatherapy massage with lavender essential oil on sleep quality, pain, and mental and psychiatric disorders among breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy: a randomized controlled trial [^111WizAr]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the effects of aromatherapy massage on sleep quality and mental and psychological disorders in breast cancer survivors (BCS) undergoing chemotherapy.

Methods

The study was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Eligible breast cancer patients were enrolled in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (received lavender aromatherapy) or the placebo group (received sweet almond oil massage). Aromatherapists focused their massage on specific areas of the body (from the lumbosacral area to the soles of the feet, and then from the shoulders to the palms of the hands). From baseline to four weeks after the intervention, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess sleep quality, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to assess pain response, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was used to assess cognitive function, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was used to assess anxiety, and the Beck Depression Inventory Second Version (BDI-II) was used to assess depression in patients. All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA software (version 16.0), with a P-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant.

Results

Ultimately, a total of 96 participants were divided into the intervention group (n = 47) and the placebo group (n = 51). The baseline characteristics were statistically comparable between the two groups. Statistically significant differences were observed in sleep quality scores (7.51 ± 2.90 vs 9.71 ± 2.67, P < 0.001), anxiety scores (20.26 ± 6.73 vs 24.10 ± 6.46, P = 0.005), and pain response (6.66 ± 1.45 vs 7.41 ± 1.19, P = 0.006) of the intervention group compared to the control group at the 4th week post-intervention. However, there was no significant difference in depression scores (29.43 ± 7.17 vs 30.88 ± 6.26, P = 0.286) and cognitive function scores (28.06 ± 1.55 vs 27.51 ± 1.97, P = 0.128) between the two groups.

Conclusion

Aroma massage with lavender essential oil may have a positive effect for BCS undergoing chemotherapy and warrants further promotion.

### Dementia-related agitation: a review of non-pharmacological interventions and analysis of risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy [^115t8iZa]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Conventionally, it is long believed that lavender has some of therapeutic and curative properties. Neurophysiological and animal studies according to Koulivand et al. report that lavender oil may have some effectiveness in the treating several neurological disorders due to its anxiolytic, sedative and neuroprotective properties. During that interval, O'Connor et al. undertook a randomized single-blind cross-over trial of dermally-applied, physiologically active, high purity 30% lavender oil versus an inactive control oil on 64 nursing home residents with frequent physically agitated behaviors. They found that despite its sedative and anxiolytic properties, lavender oil showed no significant advantage over control oil and demonstrated no evidence in reducing the agitation behavior in dementia patients.

Further, in 2014, Livingston et al. conducted systematic review of 160 studies that investigated non-pharmacological interventions for agitation in dementia people over 50 years of age in care facility settings. They reported that engaging agitated dementia patients on various activities including music therapy and sensory interventions (massage, therapeutic touch and multisensory stimulation) may help to reduce mild-to-moderate agitation in the immediate term, but, lacked significant long term benefits, and no beneficial effects on severe agitation symptoms. However, caregivers trained and supervised in communication or person-centered skills demonstrated immediate improvement on severe agitation with effects lasting up to 6 months. In contrary, light therapy (of 30–60 min daily bright-light exposure) and aromatherapy interventions reported no evidence of benefit in reducing agitation.

### The efficacy of aromatherapy on pain and anxiety during needle-related procedures in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1147pf96]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Quality Appraisal

Two researchers used the Cochrane Manual for Systematic Assessment to independently assess potential bias in the literature they included. They are assessing bias in several key areas: generation of randomized sequences of studies, concealment of allocation, blinding procedures for participants and assessors, thoroughness of outcome data, potential for selective reporting, and other sources of bias. Both researchers will assess the literature simultaneously, discussing disagreements as they arise in order to reach consensus. Researchers assessed the quality of evidence for outcomes using the Recommended Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (Levels) framework. Quality will be assessed at three levels: low, medium, and high. Disagreements during the quality assessment process were resolved through discussion.

Extraction of Data

The following data were extracted from the included literature: (1) Firstly, the basic information of the included literature was extracted, including the name of the literature, the authors of the literature, and the year of publication. (2) Characteristics of study participants such as gender and age; patients' knowledge level, country, and ethnicity; and the number of study dropouts and treatment for missing data were recorded. (3) Characteristics of the clinical trial: including sample size, nadir criteria, participant recruitment methods, trial flow, interventions, outcome metrics, assessment time points, and duration of interventions. Data extraction will be done independently by two researchers, and any disagreement during the extraction process will be resolved through discussion, and if not resolved after discussion, it will be decided by a third person. The data to be extracted will be extracted by two researchers and filled in an Excel sheet and compared.

### The study protocol of a blinded randomised-controlled cross-over trial of lavender oil as a treatment of behavioural symptoms in dementia [^111nAMmi]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

The proposed study will help meet the need for better controlled trials of alternative treatments for agitated behaviours associated with dementia. Our findings may guide family and professional carers in their selection of available evidence-based ways to reduce stressful behavioural symptoms that respond only partially to psychotropic medications. If our results show that use of Lavender oil is effective in reducing challenging behaviours in individuals with dementia, it will potentially provide a safer intervention rather than reliance on pharmacology alone. The study's findings will translate easily to other countries and cultures.

### Dementia-related agitation: a review of non-pharmacological interventions and analysis of risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy [^116EdRJV]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Non-pharmacological interventions

The growing concerns over the efficacy and side effects of pharmacotherapy have resulted in the emphasis of non-pharmacological interventions as the first line treatment approach.

NICE UK in agreement with the American and the Canadian Association for Geriatric Psychiatry, as well as the European Association of Geriatric Psychiatry (EAGP) recommends the initial treatment approach for people who have agitation in all types and severities of dementia to be the non-pharmacological interventions.

This approach includes simple and complex interventions which are most often combined and provided to patients in a person-centered care approach. Examples of these interventions include multisensory stimulation, aromatherapy, music therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, animal-assisted therapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and physical exercises. These non-pharmacological interventions are increasingly being recognized globally as the crucial parts of the comprehensive dementia care due to its fewer risks compare to the drugs treatment. Unenthusiastically however, available evidence still shows that effective non-pharmacological interventions have not been widely embraced by the real-world clinical practice and standard of care. Kales et al. recommend a non-pharmacologic strategy called DICE approach to be used as a basis for integrating non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions in the real-world clinical settings. The DICE approach which comprises Describe, Investigate, Create and Evaluate, is essentially patient/caregiver-centered approach that describes sequential steps for thorough assessments to help manage neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. Kales et al. claim DICE model will provide clinicians with well-planned efficient treatment approach when integrated into clinical practice. Another model called Targeted Interdisciplinary Model for Evaluation and treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms (TIME) was described by Lichtwarck et al. as a multicomponent intervention program frequently employed by physicians and nursing home staff (in Norway) for assessing and treating behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia or other complex disorders. The TIME model consists of three interconnected phases of registration and assessment phase; a guided reflection phase; and an action and evaluation phase. These phases were extracted from the concepts of cognitive behavioral therapy and are to be tailored to individual patient. In 2016, Lichtwarck et al. published a study protocol on the proposed 3-month TIME trial to take place in 30 nursing homes (in Norway) involving 168 residents with high degree of dementia-related agitation, so as to evaluate the effectiveness-implementation of TIME model and its implementation process by staffs and at organization levels. The authors believe the result of TIME intervention model could become an evidence-based model that will improve assessment and treatment of agitation and other neuropsychiatry symptoms in dementia patients.

### Preoperative virtual reality for pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial [^116rpCz9]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Pediatric patients undergo general anesthesia (GA) for procedures ranging from routine day surgeries to complex operations. Despite significant advancements in anesthetic techniques improving surgical safety, perioperative challenges remain common. These challenges are particularly pronounced in children, who have distinct physiological and psychological vulnerabilities, highlighting the need for tailored interventions to enhance perioperative care.

Psychological factors, notably preoperative anxiety and fear, can provoke stress responses, reduce the compliance of children, complicate anesthesia induction by increasing resistance or agitation, and delay recovery. Inadequate management of perioperative pain and fear can heighten postoperative pain by increasing psychological stress and pain sensitivity, and may also elevate the risk of delirium, particularly in children with severe anxiety or following complex surgeries. Prolonged pain and delirium not only hinder short‐term recovery but may also pose long‐term cognitive risks such as memory deficits, attention problems, and reduced executive functioning.

Non‐pharmacological approaches, such as music therapy, play therapy, cognitive‐behavioral techniques, aromatherapy, and preoperative education, have been widely employed to reduce preoperative anxiety and fear, enhance compliance during anesthesia induction, and potentially decrease postoperative pain and delirium in pediatric patients. Among these, virtual reality (VR) has gained prominence due to its immersive and interactive capabilities. By creating an engaging virtual environment, VR helps divert attention from the surgical process to more pleasant experiences. Research indicates that VR effectively reduces preoperative anxiety, minimizes postoperative pain, and decreases analgesic use. Compared to traditional interventions, its interactive nature enhances appeal and compliance among children, maximizing therapeutic impact.

Recent reviews on VR in pediatric perioperative care reported inconsistent findings, with some concluding clear benefits for preoperative anxiety and fear, postoperative pain, and delirium, while others presented more limited effects or were unable to draw reliable conclusions on specific outcomes. Furthermore, the scope and conclusions of these prior syntheses were often constrained by several common limitations. These included small sample sizes (typically comprising only 4 to 7 included studies), a narrow focus on specific outcomes, and less strictly defined control groups, thereby hindering clear comparisons. The emergence of new randomized controlled trials (RCTs) underscores the need for an updated meta‐analysis to clarify VR's effectiveness. This study addresses this gap by synthesizing the latest evidence from a larger body of RCTs. It employs a rigorous analytical approach, focusing on intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis, strictly defining control groups, and comprehensively assessing clinical significance, with the overall certainty of evidence for each outcome, to provide a comprehensive evaluation and establish evidence‐based recommendations.

All studies included details regarding OT methodology, and all but two reported the specific odorants used for OT. Cognitive variables were measured in seven studies, and at least one well-being factor was assessed in eight studies.

OT Methodology

Odorants used for OT

A majority (n = 13) of the studies used the four COT odorants (citronellal, eugenol, eucalyptol, and PEA). Some (n = 5) compared groups using different types of odorants within the same OT procedure. Comparisons included use of the four standard COT odorants with multi-molecule fragrance mixtures (e.g. mandarin, sea odor, burnt rubber) or odors from household products (e.g. vanilla essence, natural toothpaste), or comparison between low-molecular-weight odors (e.g. cis-3-hexanol [cut grass]) and high-molecular-weight odors (e.g. gardocylene [woody/herbaceous]). Three studies changed the odors over the course of the OT intervention. For example, compared the OT outcomes from a group of adults with postinfectious olfactory dysfunction (PIOD) who used the four classic single-molecule COT odorants for the entire 36-week intervention, whereas the modified OT group changed their four training odorants every 12 weeks and included odors from single molecule and mixtures of odorants. The aim of the modified OT was to stimulate a greater number and variety of olfactory receptors via changing the odorants used for training over the course of the intervention to measure potential differences in training outcomes. The participants in the modified OT group had better olfactory discrimination and identification scores than the COT group, but these differences did not reach clinical significance in changes of TDI scores.

### Effects of olfactory training on olfactory and cognitive function: a systematic review [^114guhgq]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Olfactory training (OT) interventions exhibit dual therapeutic potential, enhancing both chemosensory function and multiple cognitive domains through neuroplastic mechanisms.

Objective

To systematically review the efficacy of OT on olfaction, cognition, and neuroimaging changes across a range of populations, from healthy adults to patients with olfactory and cognitive impairments.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases performed to identify studies that evaluate the effect of OT on olfaction and cognition in different populations, focusing on its potential to enhance cognition and mitigate the progression of cognitive decline.

Results

Of the initial 412 abstracts reviewed, 24 full-text articles were included. Risk-of-bias assessment revealed 7/12 randomized controlled studies (RCTs) had high risk and 11/12 non-RCTs had serious bias. The duration of OT interventions mostly ranged from 3 to 6months. In healthy adults (6 studies) and adults with olfactory dysfunction (13 studies), OT improved olfactory function in a population-dependent manner and exerted domain-specific cognitive benefits. Meta-analysis revealed that the pooled proportion of individuals achieving a clinically-significant olfactory improvement was 27.01% (95% confidence interval, 0.16–0.40). Improvements were observed in global cognition, verbal fluency, and working memory. In adults with cognitive impairment (5 studies), classical OT showed limited olfactory and cognitive improvements; however, intensive OT with enriched odors, longer sessions, and greater adherence demonstrated potential for enhanced cognitive and emotional outcomes in patients with dementia. Furthermore, the reviewed neuroimaging studies consistently demonstrate that OT can increase volumes in several brain regions and promote neuronal reorganization, providing a potential mechanism of OT in olfactory recovery and cognitive improvement.

Conclusions

OT effectively improves olfaction, cognition, and brain health, particularly in cognitively-normal populations.

### Massage with or without aromatherapy for symptom relief in people with cancer [^112ptFtK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Massage and aromatherapy massage are used to relieve cancer-related symptoms. A number of claims have been made for these treatments including reduction of pain, anxiety, depression, and stress. Other studies have not shown these benefits.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of massage with or without aromatherapy on pain and other symptoms associated with cancer.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases and trials registries up to August 2015: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2015, Issue 7), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), PubMed Cancer Subset, SADCCT, and the World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP. We also searched clinical trial registries for ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled studies (RCTs) reporting the effects of aromatherapy or massage therapy, or both, in people with cancer of any age. We applied no language restrictions. Comparators were massage (using carrier oil only) versus no massage, massage with aromatherapy (using carrier oil plus essential oils) versus no massage, and massage with aromatherapy (using carrier oil plus essential oils) versus massage without aromatherapy (using carrier oil only).

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors selected studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data relating to pain and other symptoms associated with cancer, using standardised forms. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created two 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 19 studies (21 reports) of very low quality evidence with a total of 1274 participants. We included 14 studies (16 reports) in a qualitative synthesis and five studies in a quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis). Thirteen studies (14 reports, 596 participants) compared massage with no massage. Six studies (seven reports, 561 participants) compared aromatherapy massage with no massage. Two studies (117 participants) compared massage with aromatherapy and massage without aromatherapy. Fourteen studies had a high risk of bias related to sample size and 15 studies had a low risk of bias for blinding the outcome assessment. We judged the studies to be at unclear risk of bias overall. Our primary outcomes were pain and psychological symptoms. Two studies reported physical distress, rash, and general malaise as adverse events. The remaining 17 studies did not report adverse events. We downgraded the GRADE quality of evidence for all outcomes to very low because of observed imprecision, indirectness, imbalance between groups in many studies, and limitations of study design. Massage versus no-massage groupsWe analysed results for pain and anxiety but the quality of evidence was very low as most studies were small and considered at an unclear or high risk of bias due to poor reporting. Short-term pain (Present Pain Intensity-Visual Analogue Scale) was greater for the massage group compared with the no-massage group (one RCT, n = 72, mean difference (MD) -1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.67 to -0.53). Data for anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-state) relief showed no significant difference in anxiety between the groups (three RCTs, n = 98, combined MD -5.36, 95% CI -16.06 to 5.34). The subgroup analysis for anxiety revealed that the anxiety relief for children was greater for the massage group compared with the no-massage group (one RCT, n = 30, MD -14.70, 95% CI -19.33 to -10.07), but the size of this effect was considered not clinically significant. Furthermore, this review demonstrated no differences in effects of massage on depression, mood disturbance, psychological distress, nausea, fatigue, physical symptom distress, or quality of life when compared with no massage. Massage with aromatherapy versus no-massage groupsWe analysed results for pain, anxiety, symptoms relating to the breast, and quality of life but the quality of evidence was very low as studies were generally at a high risk of bias. There was some indication of benefit in the aromatherapy-massage group but this benefit is unlikely to translate into clinical benefit. The relief of medium- and long-term pain (medium-term: one RCT, n = 86, MD 5.30, 95% CI 1.52 to 9.08; long-term: one RCT, n = 86, MD 3.80, 95% CI 0.19 to 7.41), anxiety (two RCTs, n = 253, combined MD -4.50, 95% CI -7.70 to -1.30), and long-term symptoms relating to the breast in people with breast cancer (one RCT, n = 86, MD -9.80, 95% CI -19.13 to -0.47) was greater for the aromatherapy-massage group, but the results were considered not clinically significant. The medium-term quality of life score was lower (better) for the aromatherapy-massage group compared with the no-massage group (one RCT, n = 30, MD -2.00, 95% CI -3.46 to -0.54). Massage with aromatherapy versus massage without aromatherapy groupsFrom the limited evidence available, we were unable to assess the effect of adding aromatherapy to massage on the relief of pain, psychological symptoms including anxiety and depression, physical symptom distress, or quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

There was a lack of evidence on the clinical effectiveness of massage for symptom relief in people with cancer. Most studies were too small to be reliable and key outcomes were not reported. Any further studies of aromatherapy and massage will need to address these concerns.

### Integrative oncology care of symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults with cancer: Society for Integrative Oncology-ASCO guideline [^114aebTe]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Lavender essential oil aromatherapy inhalation for procedural and treatment-related anxiety — Recommendation 1.7 — may be offered to people with cancer to improve anxiety symptoms during cancer-related procedures and treatment procedures (Type: Evidence based; Quality of evidence: Low; benefits outweigh harms; Strength of recommendation: Weak). Six RCTs with sample sizes ranging from 70 to 313 examined lavender essential oil inhalation; four of the six trials evaluated people during clinical procedures such as biopsy and the other two during active treatment such as receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy, with three trials in multiple cancers (unspecified) and three in breast cancer. Reduction in anxiety was reported in five trials, with only three reporting statistically significant differences versus control.

### Aging and olfactory training: a scoping review [^116vLMSj]. Innovation in Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

Olfactory Training

The impact of olfactory decline is multifaceted and consequential especially for older people. This decline may not be inevitable nor irreversible. The extent to which the olfactory and associated cognitive regions remain plastic is uncertain among older adults. It is widely agreed that the olfactory epithelium and other components of the olfactory pathway have regeneration capabilities, but the extent to which these extend into advanced adulthood is less clear. Research findings demonstrate that OT can produce benefits to patients experiencing olfactory loss from varying etiologies (e.g. postinfectious, post-traumatic, idiopathic loss, or age-related loss;).

The classical olfactory training (COT) approach was first described byin the treatment of patients with severe olfactory loss. COT involves smelling a set of four odorants representative of different odor categories (rose [phenyl ethyl alcohol {PEA}], eucalyptus [eucalyptol], lemon [citronellal], and cloves [eugenol]), twice a day (morning and evening) for a period of 12 weeks. During the training period, patients were asked to smell the odors for 10 s each, focusing their attention on the training, and to keep a smell diary where they self-rated their olfactory function once a week.reported that COT resulted in improved olfactory function, and for nearly 30% of participants, the improvement was clinically significant. Other studies have replicated the olfactory improvements of COT, with some reporting benefit from OT with varying treatment periods, and odor characteristics.

The benefits of OT are promising, especially given the potential for this to extend beyond olfaction, into cognition and well-being. The extent to which OT has an impact on olfactory function, cognition, and well-being among the older population has yet to be fully characterized. Many questions persist not only in the methodology of OT itself, but the potential benefits it may have for not only normally aging adults but those experiencing olfactory dysfunction and cognitive impairment.

This scoping review addresses the following research questions: (1) what assessment and methodologies are used for OT among adults aged 55 and older? (2) what outcomes are associated with OT, in terms of olfaction, cognition, and well-being? (3) what are the implications for future research involving OT among older people?

### Aromatherapy for treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^1179eKUV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative nausea and vomiting is a common and unpleasant phenomenon and current therapies are not always effective for all patients. Aromatherapy has been suggested as a possible addition to the available treatment strategies.

Objectives

This review sought to establish what effect the use of aromatherapy has on the severity and duration of established postoperative nausea and vomiting and whether aromatherapy can be used with safety and clinical effectiveness comparable to standard pharmacological treatments.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 3); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; CAM on PubMed; Meditext; LILACS; and ISI Web of Science as well as grey literature sources and the reference lists of retrieved articles. We conducted database searches up to August 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) where aromatherapy was used to treat postoperative nausea and vomiting. Interventions were all types of aromatherapy. Aromatherapy was defined as the inhalation of the vapours of any substance for the purposes of a therapeutic benefit. Primary outcomes were the severity and duration of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Secondary outcomes were adverse reactions, use of rescue anti-emetics and patient satisfaction with treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed risk of bias in the included studies and extracted data. As all outcomes analysed were dichotomous, we used a fixed-effect model and calculated relative risk (RR) with associated 95% confidence interval (95% CI).

Main Results

The nine included studies comprised six RCTs and three CCTs with a total of 402 participants. The mean age and range data for all participants were not reported for all studies. The method of randomization in four of the six included RCTs was explicitly stated and was adequate. Incomplete reporting of data affected the completeness of the analysis. Compared with placebo, isopropyl alcohol vapour inhalation was effective in reducing the proportion of participants requiring rescue anti-emetics (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.00, P = 0.05). However, compared with standard anti-emetic treatment, isopropyl alcohol was not effective in reducing the proportion of participants requiring rescue anti-emetics (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.13, P = 0.13) except when the data from a possibly confounded study were included (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.98, P = 0.04). Where studies reported data on patient satisfaction with aromatherapy, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.03, P = 0.71).

Authors' Conclusions

Isopropyl alcohol was more effective than saline placebo for reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting but less effective than standard anti-emetic drugs. There is currently no reliable evidence for the use of peppermint oil.

### Aging and olfactory training: a scoping review [^1143ZKGU]. Innovation in Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

Control groups and adherence

An issue in evaluating the effectiveness of the OT interventions was a lack of detail concerning adherence to the training regimen. A smell diary kept by the participants was the most common form of adherence measure. Typically, participants were instructed to evaluate their olfactory function in a weekly diary. Additionally, experimenters would call participants roughly every 4 weeks to ask about olfactory function and adherence with the OT procedure. Alternatively, some studies asked participants to provide ratings in their smell diaries after every training session, while many of the studies reported no adherence measures. Although adherence was measured among some studies, rarely was any adherence level reported and only a few of the studies reported dropout rates due to lack of adherence to the training protocol (e.g.reported dropout after a failure to participate in at least 20% of the sessions, which was easily measurable as the researchers administered the OT intervention).measured adherence rates and OT efficacy among adults with varying types of olfactory loss. Researchers evaluated OT adherence at 3 and 6 months' visits. Participants were asked about their training adherence, and they defined a lack of adherence as a participant not following the protocol or stopping training during the study. OT adherence was highest for the first 3 months at 88% of participants, and then significantly dropped off by 6 months where only 56% of participants were still adhering to the protocol. All of the participants who discontinued OT said they did so because they did not experience a noticeable improvement in their olfactory functioning.

Healthy older adults

Three studies investigated OT with healthy older adults. A summary of key findings from these studies can be found in Supplementary Table 1. All three of these studies reported improvements in multiple areas of olfactory function following the OT intervention. Whereas the olfactory outcomes fromandarose from the classic form of OT (varying between 13 and 20 weeks in duration), investigated olfactory, emotional, and cognitive well-being among older adults utilizing either single-molecule odors or odor mixtures in their OT intervention (see Supplementary Table 1 for odor and OT summary). The researchers reported that odor threshold improved for the adults who used single-molecule odor stimuli in their OT intervention. Those adults in the single-molecule OT group and odor mixtures group experienced reduced cognitive decline compared to the control group. Additionally, the single-molecule group demonstrated significant improvements in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA;) scores. While potentially limited, these findings suggest that single-molecule OT stimuli were more effective for both olfactory and cognitive outcomes than odor-mixture OT stimuli among cognitively healthy older adults.

### Music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia [^1122YR5R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Dementia is a clinical syndrome with a number of different causes. It is characterised by deterioration in cognitive, behavioural, social and emotional functioning. Pharmacological interventions are available but have limited effect on many of the syndrome's features. However, receptivity to music may remain until the late phases of dementia, and music-based therapeutic interventions (which include, but are not limited to, music therapy) are suitable for people with advanced dementia. As there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of music-based therapeutic interventions, trials are being conducted to evaluate this. This review updates one last published in 2018 and examines the current evidence for the effects of music-based interventions for people with dementia.

Objectives

To assess the effects of music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia on emotional well-being (including quality of life), mood disturbance or negative affect (i.e. depressive symptoms and anxiety), behavioural problems (i.e. overall behavioural problems or neuropsychiatric symptoms, and more specifically agitation or aggression), social behaviour and cognition, at the end of therapy and four or more weeks after the end of treatment, and to assess any adverse effects.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organisation's meta-register-the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 30 November 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of music-based therapeutic interventions (of at least five sessions) for people with dementia that measured any of our outcomes of interest. Control groups either received usual care or other activities with or without music.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors worked independently to screen the retrieved studies against the inclusion criteria and then to extract data from included studies and assess their risk of bias. If necessary, we contacted trial authors to ask for additional data, such as relevant subscales. We pooled data using the random-effects model. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for our two comparisons and our main outcomes of interest using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 30 studies with 1720 randomised participants that were conducted in 15 countries. Twenty-eight studies with 1366 participants contributed data to meta-analyses. Ten studies contributed data to long-term outcomes. Participants had dementia of varying degrees of severity and resided in institutions in most of the studies. Seven studies delivered an individual intervention; the other studies delivered the intervention to groups. Most interventions involved both active and receptive elements of musical experience. The studies were at high risk of performance bias and some were at high risk of detection or other bias. For music-based therapeutic interventions compared to usual care, we found moderate-certainty evidence that, at the end of treatment, music-based therapeutic interventions probably improved depressive symptoms slightly (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.42 to -0.04; 9 studies, 441 participants), and we found low-certainty evidence that it may have improved overall behavioural problems (SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.02; 10 studies, 385 participants). We found moderate-certainty evidence that music-based therapeutic interventions likely did not improve agitation or aggression (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.17; 11 studies, 503 participants). Low to very low certainty evidence showed that they did not improve emotional well-being (SMD 0.14, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.56; 4 studies, 154 participants), anxiety (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.09; 7 studies, 282 participants), social behaviour (SMD 0.22, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.57; 2 studies; 121 participants) or cognition (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.41; 7 studies, 353 participants). Low or very-low -certainty evidence showed that music-based therapeutic interventions may not have been more effective than usual care in the long term (four weeks or more after the end of treatment) for any of the outcomes. For music-based therapeutic interventions compared to other interventions, we found low-certainty evidence that, at the end of treatment, music-based therapeutic interventions may have been more effective than the other activities for social behaviour (SMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.96; 4 studies, 84 participants). We found very low-certainty evidence of a positive effect on anxiety (SMD -0.75, 95% CI -1.27 to -0.24; 10 studies, 291 participants). For all other outcomes, low-certainty evidence showed no evidence of an effect: emotional well-being (SMD 0.20, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.49; 9 studies, 298 participants); depressive symptoms (SMD -0.14, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.08; 10 studies, 359 participants); agitation or aggression (SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.32; 6 studies, 168 participants); overall behavioural problems (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.17; 8 studies, 292 participants) and cognition (SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.45; 5 studies; 147 participants). We found low or very-low certainty evidence that music-based therapeutic interventions may not have been more effective than other interventions in the long term (four weeks or more after the end of treatment) for any of the outcomes. Adverse effects were inconsistently measured or recorded, but no serious adverse events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

When compared to usual care, providing people with dementia with at least five sessions of a music-based therapeutic intervention probably improves depressive symptoms and may improve overall behavioural problems at the end of treatment. When compared to other activities, music-based therapeutic interventions may improve social behaviour at the end of treatment. No conclusions can be reached about the outcome of anxiety as the certainty of the evidence is very low. There may be no effects on other outcomes at the end of treatment. There was no evidence of long-term effects from music-based therapeutic interventions. Adverse effects may be rare, but the studies were inconsistent in their reporting of adverse effects. Future studies should examine the duration of effects in relation to the overall duration of treatment and the number of sessions.

### The role of cannabidiol oil in schizophrenia treatment. a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117YSwJE]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The purpose of the present meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy of cannabidiol (CBD) oil in patients with schizophrenia. A search was conducted in EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to April 24th, 2020. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs), which used CBD oil treatment versus placebo or any other antipsychotic in schizophrenia patients either as monotherapy or add-on therapy, were included. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. The primary outcomes were efficacy as measured by total symptoms of schizophrenia and improvement in cognition. The meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO [number: CRD42020157146]. Three double-blind RCTs were included. In one study, CBD oil was compared with amisulpride as monotherapy treatment, but no statistically significant difference in overall efficacy was detected between them. No data were available for cognition. The other two studies estimated the effects of CBD oil as add-on treatment compared to placebo; no significant difference was found either in overall efficacy or in cognition. Altogether, insufficient evidence exists on the efficacy and safety of CBD oil in schizophrenia patients. More RCTs, comparing CBD oil with placebo and other antipsychotics are warranted.

### The study protocol of a blinded randomised-controlled cross-over trial of lavender oil as a treatment of behavioural symptoms in dementia [^114HMSue]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

In humans, plasma levels of linalool and linalyl acetate rose quickly when 2% lavender oil was massaged into abdominal skin over a 10 minute period. Diego et al. exposed 40 university staff and students to lavender and rosemary oils for periods of three minutes while monitoring their EEG, mood state, attention and mathematical accuracy. Lavender, but not rosemary, was associated with improved mood and accuracy and with increased frontal alpha power, consistent with drowsiness. In a single case evaluation, Brooker et al. observed variable effects after treating four psychogeriatric patients for 10-minute periods on ten occasions each with lavender oil by vapour, massage with a neutral oil and vaporised lavender oil combined with massage. When compared with 'no treatment' control sessions, only one participant benefited to a statistically significant degree and two became more agitated. Two other case series suggested that lavender promotes sleep in elderly people with dementia.

Three trials found no significant changes in behavioural symptoms following exposure to lavender, however two trials showed positive effects. Holmes et al. sprayed the communal area of a dementia ward with either 2% Lavender oil or water for two hours daily on alternating days. All 15 participants had severe dementia and daily agitation. An observer wearing a nose clip rated behaviours using the Pittsburgh Agitation Scale in the final hour of 10 sessions. Median behaviour scores were 20% lower while exposed to lavender compared to water (p = 0.016). More recently, Lin et al. administered lavender or sunflower oils by vapour for an hour each night while nursing home residents were asleep. All 70 participants had marked dementia with clinically significant agitation. In a repeated measures study with randomised cross-over, both oils were administered for three week periods, with a two-week washout between. Agitation scores fell by 7% with lavender compared with less than 1% with sunflower oil (p < 0.001).

### Effects of chronic consumption of specific fruit (berries, cherries and citrus) on cognitive health: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116WYqAm]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The cognitive-protective effects related to the consumption of a variety of fruits are supported by several intervention studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the magnitude of effects following chronic (≥ 1 week) consumption of frozen, freeze-dried powder including extracts and juices of fruits, covering berries, cherries and citrus, on cognition and mood in adults.

Methods

PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and psycARTICLES were searched from inception until February, 2021. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials assessing memory, executive function, psychomotor speed, mood and mini mental state examination in adult participants ≥ 18 years of age. Cognition was tested by global or domain specific tasks.

Results

Out of 13,861 articles identified, 16 papers were included; 11 studies provided suitable data for meta-analysis. Fourteen studies reported improvement or trend for improvement in cognition, five studies assessed mood and one study supplementing grape juice found trend for mood improvement. From the meta-analysis, cherry juice supplementation was suggested to improve psychomotor speed by −0.37 of standardised mean difference (95% CI [−0.74, 0.01]) in reaction time (P = 0.05).

Conclusions

The meta-analysis did not sufficiently support a role for fruits or fruit forms to improve cognition and mood.

### Chronic and postprandial effect of blueberries on cognitive function, alertness, and mood in participants with metabolic syndrome-results from a six-month, double-blind, randomized controlled trial [^1158UAoj]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, to our knowledge, we present the first evidence in those with MetS but without cognitive dysfunction that neither chronic nor postprandial blueberry intake was effective in improving cognition, mood, or sleep quality – with the exception of postprandial calmness. We suggest that our data reinforce the increasing evidence that the benefits of blueberries are more likely to be realized in those experiencing higher cognitive loads – such as those functioning under stressful situations or performing tasks with high cognitive demands, older seniors, or those with pre-existing cognitive dysfunction, and are an ineffective strategy for cognitive function improvement in those with MetS, but without cognitive dysfunction.

### "Like one part of a puzzle"-individualized aromatherapy for women with gynecological cancers in aftercare: results from a qualitative-focused mixed-methods study [^115LEoam]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Aromatherapy: a toolbox for symptom management

The qualitative results allow insights into the potential of aromatherapy regarding symptom management. They showed mostly moderate improvements of symptom burdens such as sleeping disorders, fatigue, moderate pain, nausea, and peripheral neuropathy. This corresponds to our quantitative findings about the change of symptom burden after aromatherapy (Fig. 3) and confirms the existing evidence on general symptom improvement with aromatherapy in cancer care.

The results can be distinguished between direct and indirect impacts on symptomatic burdens:

Direct impacts

Due to the participant's individual approach and use of essential oil products, their perception of direct effects can only be partially attributed to specific products and their applications. Direct effects of aromatherapy were found with (1) lavender-based products (Pillow Spray and Relaxing Oil) for improving sleep disorders; (2) Relaxing Oil in combination with massages against painful cramps and for activation of numb limbs in peripheral neuropathy; (3) Peppermint against nausea, in line with recent research about use of peppermint essential oil in oncology settings. Regarding the effectiveness of lavender for therapeutic purposes, research is inconclusive. However, recent reviews summarize promising evidence for lavender use against sleeping disorders. Empirical research on the efficacy of lavender against neuropathic pain is limited; however, basic research on mice and in patients with diabetes has been demonstrated. More empirical research is needed to further explore the potential of lavender (and massage) for peripheral neuropathy.

Indirect impacts

Moreover, our findings show the great potential of aromatherapy to help cope with symptomatic burdens by promoting well-being, encouraging mindfulness, and developing individual strategies. This is in line with research about use of aromatherapy as an adjuvant treatment. Individually tailored aromatherapy, autonomously adapted to needs and circumstances of the participants, has the potential to initiate and support a process of empowerment by offering an opportunity to act autonomously within the context of illness-related symptomatic burdens. Playing an active role and making free and creative decisions about health issues may enhance the sense of control. Particularly in the follow-up period of aftercare, after a phase of greater dependency on medical professionals' opinions and decisions, a sense of empowerment might gain importance. The empowering character of aromatherapy is consistent with the call for greater involvement of cancer patients in health care issues.

Indications for future concept development

Based on our findings, the following points should be considered for further development of aromatherapy interventions:

### Do nonpharmacological interventions prevent cognitive decline? a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111tRp7Q]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Adverse events

There were no severe adverse events adjudicated to be related to the interventions in either group during the study period in 9 trials and 11 trials had not reported the adverse events. Only two reports had obvious adverse events. In the study of dietary intake about Ginkgo biloba, the adverse event profiles for Ginkgo biloba and placebo were similar and there were no statistically significant differences in the rate of serious adverse events. Although another about physical activity reported ten events occurred during the study and intervention staff judged that it was unlikely any of these events were directly caused by the intervention.

### Aromatherapy for treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^116UaVm6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common, unpleasant phenomenon and current therapies are not always effective for all patients. Aromatherapy has been suggested as an addition to the available treatment strategies. This review was originally published in 2012 and updated in 2017.

Objectives

The main objective was to establish the efficacy and safety of aromatherapy comparable to standard pharmacological treatments for PONV in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CAM on PubMed; Informit; LILACS; and ISI Web of Science as well as grey literature sources and the reference lists of retrieved articles up to March 2017. The original search was performed in August 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) where aromatherapy was used to treat PONV. Interventions were all types of aromatherapy compared to placebo or with standard antiemetics. Primary outcomes were severity and duration of PONV. Secondary outcomes were adverse reactions, use of rescue antiemetics and patient satisfaction.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias in the included studies and extracted data. For dichotomous outcome variables, we used a random-effects model and calculated risk ratio (RR) with associated 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For continuous outcome variables, we used a random-effects model and calculated standardized mean difference (SMD) with associated 95% CI. We used the GRADE software to compile 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included seven new studies with 663 participants in the 2017 update; five RCTs and two CCTs. These were added to the nine previously included studies (six RCTs and three CCTs with a total of 373 participants) for a total of 16 included studies and 1036 participants in this updated review. The mean age and range data for all participants were not reported for all studies. We identified two registered trials that met the inclusion criteria for this review; however there are no results for these studies yet. Overall, the GRADE assessment of evidence quality ranged from moderate to very low. The method of randomization in 11 of the 12 included RCTs was explicitly stated and adequate. Incomplete or methodologically diverse reporting of data affected the completeness of the analysis. Data on additional aromatherapies were added in the 2017 update (blended aromatherapy products, and peppermint products). Heterogeneity of outcome measures and time points between studies affected the completeness of the analysis. In the summary of the findings of six studies, we did not find aromatherapy to be effective in reducing nausea severity in comparison to placebo (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.18, P value = 0.28, 241 participants, level of evidence: low). Those participants receiving aromatherapy were no more likely to be free of nausea at the end of the treatment period than those receiving placebo (RR 3.25, 95% CI 0.31 to 34.33, P value = 0.33, 4 trials, 193 participants, evidence level: very low), however they were less likely to require rescue antiemetics (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.97, P value = 0.04, 7 trials, 609 participants, evidence level: low). There were no data reported on adverse events or patient satisfaction for this comparison. A specific comparison of peppermint aromatherapy to placebo did not show evidence of an effect on nausea severity at five minutes post-treatment in the pooled results (SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.86 to 0.49, P value = 0.59, 4 trials, 115 participants, evidence level: low). There were no data reported on nausea duration, use of rescue antiemetics, adverse events or patient satisfaction for this comparison. When we pooled studies comparing isopropyl alcohol to standard antiemetic treatment in a GRADE summary of findings, in terms of nausea duration, there was a significant effect on the time in minutes to a 50% reduction in nausea scores (SMD -1.10, 95% CI -1.43 to -0.78, P value < 0.00001, 3 trials, 176 participants, evidence level: moderate). Fewer participants who received isopropyl alcohol required rescue antiemetics (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.98, P value = 0.04, 215 participants, 4 trials, evidence level: moderate). Two studies with 172 participants measured patient satisfaction; there were high levels of satisfaction across both aromatherapy and standard treatment groups and no differences found (evidence level: low). There were no data reported on nausea severity or adverse events for this comparison. There was no difference in effectiveness between isopropyl alcohol vapour inhalation and placebo for reducing the proportion of participants requiring rescue antiemetics (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.24, P value = 0.11, 291 participants, 4 trials, evidence level: very low). There were no data reported on nausea severity, nausea duration, adverse events or patient satisfaction for this comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, for nausea severity at the end of treatment, aromatherapy may have similar effectiveness to placebo and similar numbers of participants were nausea-free. However, this finding is based on low-quality evidence and therefore very uncertain. Low-quality evidence also suggests that participants who received aromatherapy may need fewer antiemetic medications, but again, this is uncertain. Participants receiving either aromatherapy or antiemetic medications may report similar levels of satisfaction with their treatment, according to low-quality evidence.

### Designing novel "Smell-aids" to improve olfactory function in post COVID-19 era [^114QaPnG]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Other limitations of this pilot study include the lack of long-term comfort and side effects data, and the lack of sample size to perform subgroup analysis of other causes of olfactory losses, beyond COVID-19. Furthermore, it would be interesting to test whether olfactory training could be more effective in conjunction with one of the "olfactory aids" — if more odors are delivered during the training, would that translate to more effective training? — an idea for future study.

### Aging and olfactory training: a scoping review [^1178Sjxd]. Innovation in Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

Future Research

Further research is needed across specific participant groups as it remains unclear whether a generic approach to OT is the best way forward. There may be manipulations and alterations needed in the OT protocol, related to the duration of the intervention, and more nuanced consideration for the composition of the specific odors used for training (e.g. single-molecule odors, multi-molecule odor mixtures, low vs high concentration, etc.). This may lead to differentiated outcomes across olfaction and cognition more relevant for specific populations (e.g. young adults recovering from coronavirus disease-related anosmia vs persons with dementia with olfactory dysfunction).

There is potential to adapt an OT protocol to maximize benefit to a variety of populations. These findings establish a relationship between OT and semantic verbal fluency. Therefore, an OT intervention may benefit someone experiencing frontotemporal dementia or primary progressive aphasia, where issues in language, specifically verbal fluency, present early and significantly. Future research should consider differentiated types of dementia in investigating the outcomes from OT so that protocols could be developed to maximally align the benefits to individual patients.

Future research might also create multimodal, multisensory, cognitively engaging OT protocols to potentially enhance overall outcomes.recently called for the evolution of standard or COT methodology to include a cognitive training element, such as a training game using odors, or utilization of computerized OT. These advances could facilitate elicitation of more precise data on how participants engage with odors, their adherence to the training protocol, as well as opportunities to manipulate the intensity of the cognitive component of training through adjusted difficulty levels based on performance feedback. A reliable measure of adherence to the training protocol was a persistent issue across the OT protocols.reported strong adherence data as the researchers facilitated the smell training protocol with the participants, whereas other protocols relied on self-reported adherence data, which may be subject to overestimated adherence behavior. More advanced and reliable adherence data may help to establish the accurate impact the OT protocol has on treatment outcomes and their effect sizes.

Given the association between olfactory impairment and long-term mortality, more research is needed to better understand this relationship as this elevated risk is only partly explained by neurodegenerative disease and weight loss, and remains independent of other common confounds. What remains less clear is the potential for OT to mitigate any of this risk. Longitudinal follow-ups in studies with OT may provide an opportunity to gain insight into the relationship between OT and improved outcomes and variables such as mortality, as well as evaluating any potential training necessary for maintenance of the outcomes.

### Monoterpenoid extract of sage (salvia lavandulaefolia) with cholinesterase inhibiting properties improves cognitive performance and mood in healthy adults [^114PsFBs]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2011). Low credibility.

Extracts of sage (Salvia officinalis/lavandulaefolia) with terpenoid constituents have previously been shown to inhibit cholinesterase and improve cognitive function. The current study combined an in vitro investigation of the cholinesterase inhibitory properties and phytochemical constituents of a S. lavandulaefolia essential oil, with a double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced crossover study assessing the effects of a single dose on cognitive performance and mood. In this latter investigation 36 healthy participants received capsules containing either 50 µL of the essential oil or placebo on separate occasions, 7 days apart. Cognitive function was assessed using a selection of computerized memory and attention tasks and the Cognitive Demand Battery before the treatment and 1-h and 4-h post-dose. The essential oil was a potent inhibitor of human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and consisted almost exclusively of monoterpenoids. Oral consumption lead to improved performance of secondary memory and attention tasks, most notably at the 1-h post-dose testing session, and reduced mental fatigue and increased alertness which were more pronounced 4-h post-dose. These results extend previous observations of improved cognitive performance and mood following AChE inhibitory sage extracts and suggest that the ability of well-tolerated terpenoid-containing extracts to beneficially modulate cholinergic function and cognitive performance deserves further attention.

### Summary of evidence-based guideline: complementary and alternative medicine in multiple sclerosis: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^114yXsvr]. Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Cannabinoids in multiple sclerosis — study limitations and cognitive/psychiatric concerns include short trial durations and measurement/blinding issues, with inconsistent but concerning signals for cognition and psychiatric outcomes; most studies were of short duration (6–15 weeks), central side effects could unmask treatment assignment, and the Ashworth scale may be insensitive to spasticity changes; evidence is available, albeit inconsistent, for impairments in memory, concentration, and executive functions in chronic cannabis users, with 1 study showing cognitive impairment in patients with MS and prolonged use of "street" cannabis versus nonusers and another reporting that patients who smoked cannabis regularly had more extensive cognitive abnormalities and were more likely to meet criteria for a lifetime DSM-IV psychiatric diagnosis; a substudy reported a significant reduction in verbal learning and memory with cannabis extracts versus placebo, but several reviewed studies assessing psychopathology and cognition were short-term and inadequately powered to exclude an effect; data are inadequate to determine the abuse potential or effect on psychopathologic symptoms of Sativex cannabinoid spray (Level U).

### Aging and olfactory training: a scoping review [^112Yj7y9]. Innovation in Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Decreased olfactory function commonly occurs alongside the aging process. Research suggests olfactory training (OT) has the potential to improve olfactory and cognitive function in individuals with and without olfactory dysfunction. The degree to which these benefits extend into older age and among those with cognitive impairment (i.e., people with dementia and mild cognitive impairment) is less clear. The purpose of the current review was to investigate the extent to which OT affects olfactory function, cognition, and well-being among older people.

Research Design and Methods

A scoping review of the literature was conducted in PubMed, Embase, EbscoHost, and SCOPUS. Articles were considered eligible for original research studies with human populations, included adults aged 55 and older, performed any type of OT, and included a form of olfactory testing. The data from the included studies were synthesized and presented narratively.

Results

A total of 23 studies were included. The results suggest that OT provides multiple benefits to older adults, including those with cognitive impairment. Particularly, OT was associated with measurable changes in olfactory function, improved cognitive function, specifically semantic verbal fluency and working memory, reduced depressive symptoms, and protection from cognitive decline.

Discussion and Implications

The findings suggest that benefits from OT extend beyond changes in olfactory function and include improved cognitive function, amelioration of depressive symptoms, and protection from cognitive decline. Future research is needed across specific participant groups, including those with differentiated types of dementia, to investigate the olfactory and cognitive benefits of OT.

### Effect of music therapy on cognitive function among older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115gRP31]. The Gerontologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

As individuals age, their cognitive function gradually declines. However, maintaining good cognitive function is essential for successful aging. Music therapy may improve cognitive function or delay cognitive decline among older adults. However, the efficacy of music therapy for improving cognition remains unclear. This review aimed to evaluate the effects of music therapy on cognitive function (global cognition, memory, or executive function) among older adults.

Research Design and Methods

9 electronic databases were comprehensively searched from inception to November 3, 2023 to identify randomized controlled trials examining the effects of music therapy on cognitive function among older adults. The revised Cochrane Risk of Bias in Randomized Trials tool (ROB 2) was used to assess the risk of bias, and Stata 17.0 software was used to conduct the meta-analysis. Standard mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the effects of music therapy on cognitive function.

Results

33 eligible articles involving 3,058 participants were included. The results revealed that music therapy significantly improved global cognition (SMD = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28–0.52, p < .05, I2 = 38%), memory (SMD = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.13–0.37, p < .05, I2 = 16%), and executive function (SMD = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.25–0.48, p < .05, I2 = 26%) among older adults.

Discussion and Implications

This systematic review and meta-analysis verified the positive effects of music therapy on cognitive function in older adults. More research is needed to determine the best form and timing of interventions for different populations.

### Feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the adapted namaste care program delivered by caregivers of community-dwelling older persons with moderate to advanced dementia: a mixed methods feasibility study [^114mComJ]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

As part of this study, caregivers each received a Namaste Care Toolbox by mail at no cost. MY had conversations with caregivers about items to include prior to sending the Namaste Care Toolbox. Items were tailored to the preferences and abilities of each person with dementia. Items were also tailored to caregivers based on discussions regarding their comfort level in delivering activities and interests of care recipients and what items can be used as shared activities such as completing puzzles together or applying lotions for each other. Tailoring of items and activities was achieved through individual meetings with each caregiver scheduled one to two weeks prior to training to discuss the favorite activities and current abilities of persons with dementia, life stories of persons with dementia and caregivers, and what activities caregivers feel comfortable in delivering. The tailoring process was an important component of the adapted Namaste Care program to match activities to stages of dementia as persons with advanced dementia have been found to most often be provided with simple physical and sensory-based activities. Ensuring that persons with dementia are provided with meaningful, favorite activities can increase the potential for positive benefits such as a decrease in depression and behavioural symptoms and an improvement in functional health. Standard items included a training guide, Namaste Care activities checklist forms, a plastic storage container, an aromatherapy diffuser with lavender essential oil, hand and/or body lotion, a squeeze ball, a lip balm, and a microwavable magic bean hot and cold compress. In addition to standard items caregivers received items based on the personal interests of each person with dementia such as dolls, face cream, hairbrushes, fleece blankets, manicure sets, jigsaw puzzles, wordsearch puzzles, light-up balls, blankets, arts and crafts kits, painting supplies, granola bars, and/or pudding. Some caregivers also used items that they already had in their possession to deliver the adapted Namaste Care program sessions such as trivia games or gardening supplies. Participants received a 30 to 60-min virtual training session by phone or by Zoom on implementing the adapted Namaste Care program at home. Initial training content included: (1) examples of Namaste Care sessions; (2) key considerations and strategies for delivering and selecting Namaste Care activities (e.g. music, aromatherapy, massages, snacks and beverages, range of motion/exercises, reminiscence activities); (3) how to perform observational assessments of mood, alertness, and pain for persons with dementia before, during, and after Namaste Care; (4) examples of responses of persons with dementia to activities; and (5) strategies to optimize the delivery of Namaste Care (e.g. modifying complexity of activities, timing of activities, and making activities more engaging). MY provided bi-weekly check-ins over 3 months of program implementation with caregivers to assess their needs regarding additional training or material resources, address their questions, and provide information such as links to reputable video clips and websites. Additional information and training provided to caregivers following the initial training session included communication strategies, changes related to the progression of dementia, and finding activities that can be enjoyed by both persons with dementia and caregivers. Caregivers were provided with hands-on demonstrative video clips on how to perform a hand or foot massage and deliver gentle exercises or range of motion activities. Caregivers also communicated by email if they had any questions or concerns between check-ins.

### Aromatherapy, botanicals, and essential oils in acne [^115gBHws]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Complementary and alternative medicine approaches are popular among some patient segments due to the perception that they are "natural" and thus are believed to be less likely to be dangerous, to be less toxic, or to cause fewer side effects. In dermatology, these can include aromatherapy, botanicals, and essential oils (plant extracts). Preliminary evidence, biological activity studies, and small pilot clinical trials conducted outside of North America, mostly in young adults, suggest that some may have value in acne treatment. When additional research and larger clinical trials are conducted, both clinicians and patients will be able to understand the risks and benefits compared with allopathic remedies.

### Aging and olfactory training: a scoping review [^113xqiCf]. Innovation in Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

Memory

Five studies included some form of memory evaluation, and benefits from OT were seen most frequently in working memory; however, gains were also reported in short-term memory and verbal learning (see Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). The three studies that measured working memory all reported significant improvements and included participants who were cognitively healthy, persons with dementia, and adults with MCI. Among the adults with MCI, improved working memory was only recorded in the control group, where adults with MCI performed a placebo OT protocol, utilizing odorless stimuli jars. No significant improvements were reported for visual memory.

Well-Being Assessment and Outcomes

Well-being measures such as depression scales (most commonly the Beck Depression Inventory-1;) and QoL questionnaires were included in eight of the studies (see Table 1). Of the six studies that measured depression, two reported significant reductions in depressive symptoms among both cognitively healthy and persons with dementia following OT. It is worth noting the difference in the OT protocol between the two studies that produced significant reduction in depressive symptoms.employed a traditional COT approach among cognitively healthy older adults, whereasused an intensive OT intervention for persons with dementia that lasted 15 days and involved participants smelling 40 odorants twice a day.

### Snoezelen for dementia [^112VJ17R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Snoezelen, multi-sensory stimulation, provides sensory stimuli to stimulate the primary senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell, through the use of lighting effects, tactile surfaces, meditative music and the odour of relaxing essential oils (Pinkney 1997). The clinical application of snoezelen has been extended from the field of learning disability to dementia care over the past decade. The rationale for its use lies in providing a sensory environment that places fewer demands on intellectual abilities but capitalizes on the residual sensorimotor abilities of people with dementia (e.g. Buettner 1999, Hope 1998). Practitioners are keen to use snoezelen in dementia care, and some encouraging results have been documented in the area of promoting adaptive behaviours (e.g. Baker, Long 1992, Spaull 1998). However, the clinical application of snoezelen often varies in form, nature, principles and procedures. Such variations not only make examination of the therapeutic values of Snoezelen difficult, but also impede the clinical development of snoezelen in dementia care. A systematic review of evidence for the efficacy of snoezelen in the care of people with dementia is therefore needed to inform future clinical applications and research directions.

Objectives

This review aims to examine the clinical efficacy of snoezelen for older people with dementia.

Search Strategy

"Snoezelen", "multi-sensory", "dement", "Alzheimer", "randomized control/single control/double control" were used as keywords to search seven electronic databases (e.g. MEDLINE, PsyLIT). The list of trials was compared with those identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group.

Selection Criteria

All RCTs in which Snoezelen or multi-sensory programmes were used as an intervention for people with dementia were included in the review. Trial data included in the review were restricted to those involving people aged over 60 years suffering from any type of dementia, except one subject of Baker's study was aged below 60 years.

Data Collection and Analysis

Only two RCTs fulfill the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Two reviewers independently extracted the data from these two inclusion studies. Quantitative synthesis of the comparable data from the two trials was performed.

Main Results

Two trials were included. Both Baker (and Kragt examined the short-term values of snoezelen on the behaviours of people with dementia. Although the pooled results were insignificant, the trend was in the direction of favouring treatment (hence a negative value of the SMD). The standardized mean difference (SMD) was -1.22, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) (-4.08, 1.64). Kragt's result, weighted 47%, was significant in favour of treatment, with a SMD of -2.77 and a 95% CI (-4.24, -1.29). During the snoezelen session, Kragt's subjects presented significantly fewer apathetic behaviours (t = -8.22, p < 0.01), fewer restless behaviours (t = -3.00, p = 0.01), fewer repetitive behaviours (t = -.822, p < 0.01), and fewer disturbances (t = -4.91, p < 0.01). Baker's result was slightly not in favour of the treatment, with a SMD of 0.16 and a 95% CI (-0.41, 0.73). The control subjects touched objects/equipment more appropriately within the activity sessions than the subjects who participated in snoezelen sessions (F(1,47) = 5.96, p = .001). Kragt did not examine the carryover and long-term effects of snoezelen, so only Baker's results were analysed. Baker used the Behavioural and Mood Disturbance scale (BMD), the REHAB, the CAPE and MMSE to assess patients mood, behaviour and cognition after (but not immediately after) four treatment sessions and eight treatment sessions. Some assessments were carried at home, some at day hospital. There were many subscores and mostly there were no differences between treatment and control. The following significant differences were found with benefit in favour of snoezelen compared with control after four sessions: apathy ezelen compared with control after four sessions: apathy score of the BRS (CAPE) (MD -3.00, 95%CIs -5.87 to -0.13, P = 0.04), after eight sessions: mood score of the BRS (CAPE) (MD -2.60, 95%CIs -4.92 to -0.28, P = 0.03), total score of the BRS (CAPE) (MD -6.92, 95%CIs -13.13 to -0.7, P = 0.03), speech skills of the REHAB (MD 1.46, 95%CIs 0.01 to 2.82, P = 0.03), psychomotor subscore of the cognitive assessment scale of CAPE (MD -3.12, 95%CIs -5.31 to -0.93, P < 0.01).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Two trials were reviewed. Although both studies examined the short-term values of snoezelen on people with dementia, it is not feasible to draw a firm conclusion at this stage, for two main reasons. Firstly, very limited data were available for analysis, thus limiting data inference and generalization. Secondly, different methodology and control conditions were adopted in the two trials. Such variations not only require a careful interpretation of results but also make the comparison of results across studies less valid. Hence, there is an urgent need for more systematic and scientific research studies to examine the clinical value of snoezelen for people with dementia. To our knowledge, there are four RCTs currently in progress. It is hoped that the data and results of these trials will enrich the systematic review of snoezelen for dementia in the next update.

### Aromatherapy for pain management in labour [^112izxEo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Many women would like to avoid pharmacological or invasive methods of pain management in labour and this may contribute towards the popularity of complementary methods of pain management. This review examined currently available evidence supporting the use of aromatherapy for pain management in labour.

Objectives

To examine the effects of aromatherapy for pain management in labour on maternal and perinatal morbidity.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 October 2010), The Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field's Trials Register (October 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 31 October 2010), CINAHL (1980 to 31 October 2010), the Australian and New Zealand Trials Registry (31 October 2010), Chinese Clinical Trial Register (31 October 2010), Current Controlled Trials (31 October 2010), ClinicalTrials.gov (31 October 2010), ISRCTN Register (31 October 2010), National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) (31 October 2010) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (31 October 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing aromatherapy with placebo, no treatment or other non-pharmacological forms of pain management in labour.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

We included two trials (535 women) in the review. The trials found no difference between groups for the primary outcomes of pain intensity, assisted vaginal birth (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 2.28, one trial, 513 women; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.06 to 11.70, one trial, 22 women), and caesarean section (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.94, one trial, 513 women; RR 2.54, 95% CI 0.11 to 56.25, one trial, 22 women); there were more babies admitted to neonatal intensive care in the control group of one trial (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.42, one trial, 513 women) but this difference did not reach statistical significance. The trials found no differences between groups for the secondary outcomes of use of pharmacological pain relief (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.32, one trial, 513 women; RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 20.45, one trial, 22 women), spontaneous vaginal delivery (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.06, one trial, 513 women; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.28, one trial, 22 women) or length of labour and augmentation (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.45, one trial, 513 women). The risk of bias was low in the trials.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a lack of studies evaluating the role of aromatherapy for pain management in labour. Further research is needed before recommendations can be made for clinical practice.

### Do nonpharmacological interventions prevent cognitive decline? a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116UA6kA]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and quality assessment

After initially browsing the titles and abstracts from the electronic databases, the full-text content of all potentially eligible studies was downloaded and analyzed. Relevant data such as the title, first author, publication year, study design, intervention for each group, outcomes and dropouts were independently extracted by two reviewers (Yao SQ and Liu Y) using inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between the two reviewers and by seeking the opinion of the third author (Lu LM) if necessary.

The quality of all studies included in this review was independently evaluated by two reviewers (Yao SQ and Liu Y) using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. This instrument consisted of 6 domains: Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? Was the allocation adequately concealed? Blinding:Was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented? Was loss to follow-up(missing outcome data) infrequent? Are reports of the study free of selective outcome reporting? Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a risk of bias (ROB)? The tool ranks the evidence from research studies as having "high (definitely yes)", "low (definitely no)", "probably yes" or "probably no" levels of bias. Every study was assessed by two reviewers independently. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion with the third author (Lu LM). Certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations were evaluated using the GRADE criteria to rate confidence in summary estimates. The GRADE approach considers evidence of very low, low, moderate, and high for outcomes.

### More than pills: alternative adjunct therapies to improve comfort in hospitalised patients [^11165tob]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Conclusion

The multi-cycle QI project was successful in relieving patient discomfort by providing alternative therapies to inpatient, progressive care patients who reported little to no relief in discomfort from prescribed analgesics and adjuvant agents. Bridging off the success of the first cycle, a Comfort Menu with a greater variety of pain relief options was created, successfully implemented and well received by patients. The pain relief options were offered at no cost to the patient as most of the tools and supplies used were donated or covered in the hospital unit budget. Patients demonstrated tolerance of their discomfort when using alternative modalities and were highly likely to use these alternative comfort therapies again. This project has already gone through two PDSA cycles and has proven sustainability. Ten months post cycle 2, aromatherapy was implemented across all units of the hospital with support via development of a procedure. After the completion of cycle 2, external grant funding was awarded to support both the continuation of unit-based comfort offerings and the maintenance of the project. Future efforts will be focused on decreasing pharmacological therapies for the relief of pain and evaluating the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions in the relief of patient discomfort. Additionally, efforts will be aimed at implementing the use of all Comfort Menu interventions throughout the health system. Processes will be developed to partner with prescribing providers to integrate these alternative treatment modalities into standard practice.

In summary, this project is timely as supported by a highly publicised opioid epidemic in this country. In a period where federal government officials are providing stepwise approaches to pain control, continued evaluation and more projects like this one are pivotal in having impact on this epidemic. This project demonstrates successful implementation of alternative therapies and suggests non-pharmacological treatments for pain and discomfort can be an integral part of a comprehensive treatment approach. Future studies should further evaluate alternative therapies as an adjuvant to pharmaceutical, physical and exercise therapy, and cognitive behavioural therapy, especially in response to the Surgeon General's call to end the opioid epidemic.

Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplements

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are a family of lipids that include eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and doxosahexaenoic acid (DHA), both derived from oily fish, as well as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), derived from plant sources. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for brain development and are a significant component of neuronal membranes in the brain. Maintaining sufficient levels of omega-3 fatty acids may support the integrity of the brain's neurons and enhance synaptic neuroplasticity. Additionally, omega-3 fatty acids improve brain function through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, ultimately slowing down the progression of dementia.

The evidence regarding omega-3 fatty acids supplementation is difficult to ascertain due to the heterogeneity among studies, particularly regarding the omega-3 doses, preparations, and overall study design. Several meta-analyses examined their efficacy for the treatment of dementia. The most recent study was a Cochrane review that looked at the effects of omega-3 fatty acids to treat cognitive dysfunction. Six hundred thirty-two participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease were examined over 6, 12, and 18 months. Their results showed that there was no evidence of an increased benefit from omega-3 fatty acids supplementation on cognitive function when measured at six months with the Mini-Mental State Examination (mean different (MD) 0.18, 95% CI − 1.05 to 1.41; 202 participants; 2 studies; high-quality evidence) or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (SMD − 0.02, 95% confidence interval (DI) − 0.19 to 0.15; 566 participants; 3 studies; high-quality evidence). There was also no evidence of a benefit from omega-3 fatty acids on activities of daily living (SMD − 0.02, 95% CI − 0.19 to 0.16; 544 participants; 2 studies; high-quality evidence). Another Cochrane Database systematic review assessed the effects of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation on the prevention of dementia and cognitive decline in cognitively healthy older people. Information was available from 3 RCTs, including 3536 participants in total. This meta-analysis found no evidence to support a preventative effect following 24 or 40 months of intervention. Longer-term studies may be needed to detect the possible effects and consequences of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in preventing cognitive decline. Other RCTs suggest that selected patients with an MMSE score > 27 were more likely to identify a positive effect of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation.

### Efficacy of musical interventions in dementia: evidence from a randomized controlled trial [^116WPXsz]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Although musical interventions have recently gained popularity as a non-pharmacological treatment in dementia, there is still insufficient evidence of their effectiveness. To investigate this issue, a single-center randomized controlled trial was conducted with forty-eight patients with Alzheimer's disease or mixed dementia to compare the effects of music versus cooking interventions in the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral domain, as well as on professional caregiver distress. Each intervention lasted four weeks (two one-hour sessions a week). Multi-component evaluations (with blind assessors) were conducted before, during, and after the interventions to assess their short and long-term effects (up to four weeks post interventions). Analyses revealed that both music and cooking interventions led to positive changes in the patients' emotional state and decreased the severity of their behavioral disorders, as well as reduced caregiver distress. However, no benefit on the cognitive status of the patients was seen. While results did not demonstrate a specific benefit of music on any of the considered measures, the present study suggests the efficacy of two pleasant non-pharmacological treatments in patients with moderate to severe dementia. Our findings highlight the potential of such interventions in improving the well-being of patients living in residential care, as well as reducing caregiver distress.

Cognitive measures employed in the trials are presented in Additional file 1: Table S2. The most frequently employed measurement was the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for global cognition, the delayed recall test from Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) for episodic memory, verbal fluency test for executive function, digit symbol substitution test for processing speed, trail making test A (TMT-A) for attention and block design test for visuospatial function.

Methodological quality

In terms of blindness and/or allocation concealment, two studies were at high risk of bias. Sala-Vila et al. acknowledged that the participants were not blinded because the intervention group was given a whole food while the placebo group was told to abstain from walnuts. Hashimoto et al. also pointed out that the participants might be able to distinguish the type of intervention by odor or taste. Other studies did not have a high risk of bias regarding key domains (Table 1). Supporting evidence for judging the RoB of individual trials is presented in Additional file 1: Table S3.

### Aging and olfactory training: a scoping review [^117THhxX]. Innovation in Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and Implications

The results of the scoping review suggest that OT provides multiple benefits to some older adults, including those with cognitive impairment. However, the extent of the literature examining OT with older adults is limited and should be cautiously interpreted, as OT is not a cure or treatment capable of restoring complete olfactory function. Olfactory perception declines with increasing age, and is exacerbated by age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. The findings provide preliminary evidence to suggest that benefits from OT may extend beyond measurable changes in olfactory function to include improved cognitive function and amelioration of depressive symptoms. There is potential to adopt a simple, nonpharmacological, home-based intervention that can be self-administered with relatively minimal risk. The potential benefit from promoting the adoption of such an intervention is substantial, to support well-being as part of normal aging to help sharpen olfactory acuity and to provide protection from cognitive decline.

The findings demonstrate that simple COT produces some significant outcomes for older adults (e.g.;). Continued research and refinement of the OT protocols may serve to maximize the potential benefit, especially in differentiating training length, intensity, and stimuli to maximally benefit the needs of the individual, whether that be olfactory outcomes for someone experiencing hyposmia, olfactory loss due to upper respiratory tract infections, or a person with dementia who would benefit not only from improved olfactory outcomes but the associated cognitive and well-being benefits.

Within verbal fluency, semantic fluency was sensitive to change over the course of OT, while phonemic fluency was not. More compelling was that improved semantic verbal fluency was reported among not only healthy adults but also adults with OD and persons with dementia. Interestingly, verbal fluency is believed to remain intact in the normal aging process, whereas both semantic and phonemic fluency are impaired in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and MCI. Furthermore, semantic verbal fluency performance is more sensitive to AD and can serve as a screening tool for detecting early-stage dementia and MCI. Verbal fluency draws from both executive function and language processing and the cortical areas activated by odor identification overlap with established cognitive correlates associated with semantic verbal fluency. Therefore, it is possible that sensory stimulation provided through a period of OT could provide adequate activation in these shared regions not only for measurable change in odor identification but semantic verbal fluency as well; however, this interpretation requires further exploration.

### More than pills: alternative adjunct therapies to improve comfort in hospitalised patients [^115Doprx]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Background

During the 1990s, pain was accepted as a 'fifth vital sign' that highlighted the need for improved pain management and supported the notion that pain was undertreated. During that period, a push to enact policies to control and manage patients' pain levels was initiated on a national level. Organisations such as the Veteran's Health Association and the Joint Commission quickly accepted the policy standards for the management of pain and introduced a national strategy to improve pain treatment. Prescriptions for pain medication by healthcare providers increased substantially. Inadvertently, providers began prescribing analgesic medications that have addictive properties to patients who complained of pain, which many believe has led to the overtreatment and overuse of opioids. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 115 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose, and prescription opioids have been confirmed to be a large contributor to the opioid epidemic.

In response to public outcry of opioid-related deaths, hospitals have implemented action alerts and educational sessions to reduce the number of opioid prescriptions while managing patients' chronic discomfort. However, the inpatient setting continues to have patients who suffer from acute and chronic pain, stress, anxiety, nausea and other discomforting symptoms. Managing these symptoms, while reducing the risk for future potential addictions, has become a priority for healthcare providers. Alternative therapies to relieve pain and enhance comfort such as aromatherapy, visual relaxation DVDs and ice or heat have the capacity to provide a way for discomfort to be addressed in a safe manner. Aromatherapy has proven to decrease stress, depression and anxiety. Further, findings reported in a systematic review support the use of music as an adjuvant approach to pain control in adult hospitalised patients. Moreover, using non-pharmacological interventions to address comfort without the adverse effects associated with opioid use can improve patient safety and satisfaction with their perception of comfort and pain relief.

### Integrative oncology care of symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults with cancer: Society for Integrative Oncology-ASCO guideline [^115yZJmV]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide evidence-based recommendations to health care providers on integrative approaches to managing anxiety and depression symptoms in adults living with cancer.

Methods

The Society for Integrative Oncology and ASCO convened an expert panel of integrative oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, surgical oncology, palliative oncology, social sciences, mind-body medicine, nursing, methodology, and patient advocacy representatives. The literature search included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials published from 1990 through 2023. Outcomes of interest included anxiety or depression symptoms as measured by validated psychometric tools, and adverse events. Expert panel members used this evidence and informal consensus with the Guidelines into Decision Support methodology to develop evidence-based guideline recommendations.

Results

The literature search identified 110 relevant studies (30 systematic reviews and 80 randomized controlled trials) to inform the evidence base for this guideline.

Recommendations

Recommendations were made for mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), yoga, relaxation, music therapy, reflexology, and aromatherapy (using inhalation) for treating symptoms of anxiety during active treatment; and MBIs, yoga, acupuncture, tai chi and/or qigong, and reflexology for treating anxiety symptoms after cancer treatment. For depression symptoms, MBIs, yoga, music therapy, relaxation, and reflexology were recommended during treatment, and MBIs, yoga, and tai chi and/or qigong were recommended post-treatment.

Discussion

Issues of patient-health care provider communication, health disparities, comorbid medical conditions, cost implications, guideline implementation, provider training and credentialing, and quality assurance of natural health products are discussed. While several approaches such as MBIs and yoga appear effective, limitations of the evidence base including assessment of risk of bias, nonstandardization of therapies, lack of diversity in study samples, and lack of active control conditions as well as future research directions are discussed.

### The study protocol of a blinded randomised-controlled cross-over trial of lavender oil as a treatment of behavioural symptoms in dementia [^115BuvGt]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Outcomes measures

A discretely positioned, trained researcher will record if the selected physically agitated behaviour is present or absent at one-minute intervals over the 90-minute observation period. Behaviour counts will range from zero to 30 in the before intervention period and zero to 60 in the after intervention period. This method was used successfully in previous studies with high levels of inter-rater reliability.

The primary measure in this trial will be the change in mean counts of physically agitated behaviours before and after intervention phases.

Secondary measures will include:

(a) A rating scale completed by the observing researcher during the 90 minute observation period at one-minute intervals of the participant's predominant type of affect. We will include three positive emotions (pleasure, contentment and interest), one neutral and three negative emotions (anger, sadness and fear/anxiety).

(b) The 29-item Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory completed by the researcher in discussion with nursing staff in closest contact with the resident at the end of each week, relating to behaviour in the preceding week. Where possible, the same staff members will be questioned on each occasion.

(c) The proportion of residential facilities that continue to administer lavender as a treatment for agitation after the end of the trial.

(d) The cost of materials.

Blinding and reliability

The order of conditions will be generated randomly using Random Number selection in Excel. An independent researcher will prepare the oil vials and no member of the lavender research team will have access to the code until the trial is completed.

The oils will be identical in appearance and texture, but nursing staff and possibly even the observers may detect by smell which treatment condition has been applied. To exclude this possibility, both the individual applying the oil and the observer will (at regular intervals) apply a cream containing a mixture of lavender and other essential oils (e.g. rosemary) to their upper lip while measuring participants' behaviour. In addition, nursing staff will wear a nose clip during the few minutes it takes to apply the oil to the resident's forearms.

Behaviour counts require some judgement and observers must be trained and monitored. To ensure high reliability (kappa > .90), a second research assistant will co-rate behaviours in the initial sessions following training by an experienced observer. Subsequent debriefing sessions and repeated co-rating will determine how much joint training and supervision is required to achieve this level of agreement.

### Aromatherapy with essential oils (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^115DbWTp]. NCI (2005). Low credibility.

- Studies in animals show sedative and stimulant effects of specific essential oils as well as positive effects on behavior and the immune system. Functional imaging studies in humans support the influence of odors on the limbic system and its emotional pathways.
- Human clinical trials have investigated aromatherapy primarily in the treatment of stress and anxiety in patients with critical illnesses or in other hospitalized patients. Several clinical trials involving patients with cancer have been published. A large body of literature has been published on the effects of odors on the human brain and emotions. Some studies have tested the effects of essential oils on mood, alertness, and mental stress in healthy participants. Other studies investigated the effects of various odors on task performance, reaction time, and autonomic parameters or evaluated the direct effects of odors on the brain via electroencephalogram patterns and functional imaging studies. Most of the resulting articles describe successful incorporation of aromatherapy into the treatment of these patients, although outcomes are clearly subjective. Most of the aromatherapy literature, however, lacks in-depth neurophysiological studies on the nature of olfaction and its link to the limbic system, and it generally does not cite research that shows these links. Proponents of aromatherapy also believe that the effects of the treatments are based on the special nature of the essential oils used and that essential oils produce effects on the body that are greater than the sum of the individual chemical components of the scents.

These assertions have been contested by the biochemistry and psychology communities, which take a different view of the possible mechanism of action of odors on the human brain. This neurobiological view, which focuses mostly on the emotional and psychological effects of fragrances, takes into account what is known about olfactory transduction and the connection of the olfactory system to other central nervous system functions, including memory; however, it is primarily theoretical because of the lack of significant research addressing this topic. No significant long-term benefits of aromatherapy or massage in pain control, QOL, or anxiety were reported, but sleep scores improved significantly in both groups.

A statistically significant reduction in depression scores was also reported in the massage-only group.

### The effects of multivitamins on cognitive performance: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1149RYgT]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Complementary medicine use is becoming increasingly popular with multivitamins being the most commonly used vitamin supplement. Although adequate vitamin and nutrient concentrations are necessary for optimal health and cognitive functioning, there is no scientific consensus as to whether multivitamin use prevents cognitive decline or improves mental functioning. The aim of the present study was to determine if multivitamins can be used efficaciously to improve cognitive abilities. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was performed. Meta-analysis was performed on those cognitive tests used across the largest number of studies. Multiple electronic databases were searched until July 2011 by two authors. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials were considered appropriate if they reported on the chronic effects (≥ 1 month) of oral multivitamin supplementation on any valid cognitive outcomes. Ten trials were included in review (n = 3,200). Meta-analysis indicated that multivitamins were effective in improving immediate free recall memory (SMD = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.09–0.56, p < 0.01) but not delayed free recall memory (SMD = -0.14; 95% CI: -0.43–0.14, p = 0.33) or verbal fluency (SMD = 0.06; 95% CI: -0.05–0.18, p = 0.26). There was no evidence of publication bias or heterogeneity. Other cognitive abilities sensitive to AD pathology, such as executive and visuospatial functions, were found to be under researched. In conclusion, multivitamins were found to enhance immediate free recall memory but no other cognitive domains.

### The effect of olfactory training on olfaction, cognition, and brain function in patients with mild cognitive impairment [^116yt9bn]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The olfactory system is affected very early in Alzheimer's disease and olfactory loss can already be observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an early stage of AD.

Objective

The aim of this randomized, prospective, controlled, blinded study was to evaluate whether olfactory training (OT) may have an effect on olfactory function, cognitive impairment, and brain activation in MCI patients after a 4-month period of frequent short-term exposure to various odors.

Methods

A total of 38 MCI outpatients were randomly assigned to OT or a control training condition, which were performed twice a day for 4 months. Olfactory testing, comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, and a passive odor perception task based on magnetic resonance imaging were performed before and after training.

Results

The results suggested that OT exhibited no significant effect on olfaction and cognitive function. Additionally, OT exhibited a positive effect on frontal lobe activation (left middle frontal gyrus and orbital-frontal cortex) but exhibited no effect on grey matter volume. Moreover, the change of olfactory scores was positively associated with the change of frontal activation.

Conclusion

OT was found to have a limited effect on olfaction and cognition in patients with MCI compared to a non-OT condition but increased their functional response to odors in frontal area.

### Therapy options in irritable bowel syndrome [^115YQAsB]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Numerous meta-analyses have recently assessed the overall clinical benefit of single therapy options and groups of therapies in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). By large, this should enable physicians to select from a number of therapy options available.

Methods

We entered dichotomous outcome data from 121 IBS trials published over the last 35 years with different groups and subgroups of drugs (antispasmodics, motility-affecting agents, antidepressants, peppermint oil), dietary interventions (bran, probiotics), and psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral, psychodynamic, hypnotherapy, relaxation techniques) into meta-analytic tools and estimate the overall efficacy (odds ratio, number needed to treat).

Results

Highest efficacy is currently found for peppermint oil, followed by psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions and probiotics. Traditional antispasmodic therapy has a moderate efficacy, whereas the list of (partially failed or cancelled) motility affecting drugs yielded weak clinical results, and therapies by bran and fibers are of no value in IBS.

Conclusion

Evidence-based therapy in IBS provides a number of effective treatment options beyond the fact that many novel compounds under development have failed to reach the market. An algorithm for clinical therapy decision is proposed.

### Aging and olfactory training: a scoping review [^113sQsV3]. Innovation in Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

Cognition and Neurodegenerative Disease

Olfactory dysfunction is closely associated with age-related neurodegenerative diseases and changes in olfactory function may even serve as an early biomarker for neurodegeneration. Persons with dementia and those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) tend to have exacerbated or elevated olfactory deficits. AD pathology includes olfactory brain regions, and performance on standardized olfactory assessments has correlated with dementia-related biomarkers. Furthermore, olfactory functions tend to correlate with the cognitive abilities that decline in AD, and the olfactory deficits among persons living with AD are more pronounced in the cognitively demanding olfactory tests such as odor identification, which relies on memory and semantic activation.

Olfactory stimulation can help alleviate behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia, such as aggression, agitation, hallucinations, and irritability. Other studies have demonstrated that olfactory training (OT) was beneficial not only to the olfactory status of persons with dementia but also reduced depressive symptoms. While some studies report a positive effect of OT, others have reported no effect, and there is still no consensus regarding OT and those with neurodegenerative conditions.

### Lower odor identification in subjective cognitive decline: a meta-analysis [^115GqFqb]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, followed by widespread neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, culminating in dementia. Early identification of individuals at risk for AD is critical for timely intervention, particularly as the disease progresses over decades before the occurrence of first cognitive deficitsand as therapies targeting amyloid pathology and other early pathological stages become available. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) refers to self‐reported cognitive decline in the absence of measurable deficits on neuropsychological tests. According to the SCD research framework, SCD is measured based on self‐report, which can be reported spontaneously or on request via questionnaires or interviews, in individuals whose performance on cognitive tests remains within normal limits on neuropsychological testing using cognitive screening tools (e.g. Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]or the Mini‐Mental State Examination [MMSE]) and/or comprehensive neuropsychological test batteries. SCD is considered the first symptom of AD, appearing at stage 2 of the disease, and has been associated with an increased risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and progression to the dementia stages of the disease.

### Multi-domain interventions for the prevention of dementia and cognitive decline [^113eqheC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Dementia is a worldwide concern. Its global prevalence is increasing. Currently, no effective medical treatment exists to cure or to delay the onset of cognitive decline or dementia. Up to 40% of dementia is attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors, which has led to the notion that targeting these risk factors might reduce the incidence of cognitive decline and dementia. Since sporadic dementia is a multifactorial condition, thought to derive from multiple causes and risk factors, multi-domain interventions may be more effective for the prevention of dementia than those targeting single risk factors.

Objectives

To assess the effects of multi-domain interventions for the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults, including both unselected populations and populations at increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), and ClinicalTrials.gov on 28 April 2021. We also reviewed citations of reference lists of included studies, landmark papers, and review papers to identify additional studies and assessed their suitability for inclusion in the review.

Selection Criteria

We defined a multi-domain intervention as an intervention with more than one component, pharmacological or non-pharmacological, but not consisting only of two or more drugs with the same therapeutic target. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of such an intervention on cognitive functioning and/or incident dementia. We accepted as control conditions any sham intervention or usual care, but not single-domain interventions intended to reduce dementia risk. We required studies to have a minimum of 400 participants and an intervention and follow-up duration of at least 12 months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We initially screened search results using a 'crowdsourcing' method in which members of Cochrane's citizen science platform identify RCTs. We screened the identified citations against inclusion criteria by two review authors working independently. At least two review authors also independently extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and applied the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. We defined high-certainty reviews as trials with a low risk of bias across all domains other than blinding of participants and personnel involved in administering the intervention (because lifestyle interventions are difficult to blind). Critical outcomes were incident dementia, incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI), cognitive decline measured with any validated measure, and mortality. Important outcomes included adverse events (e.g. cardiovascular events), quality of life, and activities of daily living (ADL). Where appropriate, we synthesised data in random-effects meta-analyses. We expressed treatment effects as risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

We included nine RCTs (18.452 participants) in this review. Two studies reported incident dementia as an outcome; all nine studies reported a measure for cognitive functioning. Assessment of cognitive functioning was very heterogeneous across studies, ranging from complete neuropsychological assessments to short screening tests such as the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). The duration of the interventions varied from 12 months to 10 years. We compared multi-domain interventions against usual care or a sham intervention. Positive MDs and RRs < 1 favour multi-domain interventions over control interventions. For incident dementia, there was no evidence of a difference between the multi-domain intervention group and the control group (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; 2 studies; 7256 participants; high-certainty evidence). There was a small difference in composite Z-score for cognitive function measured with a neuropsychological test battery (NTB) (MD 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.06; 3 studies; 4617 participants; high-certainty evidence) and with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale (MD 0.76 point, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.46; 2 studies; 1554 participants), but the certainty of evidence for the MoCA was very low (due to serious risk of bias, inconsistency and indirectness) and there was no evidence of an effect on the MMSE (MD 0.02 point, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.09; 6 studies; 8697participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of an effect on mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; 4 studies; 11,487 participants; high-certainty evidence). There was high-certainty evidence for an interaction of the multi-domain intervention with ApoE4 status on the outcome of cognitive function measured with an NTB (carriers MD 0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.25, noncarriers MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.10, P for interaction 0.09). There was no clear evidence for an interaction with baseline cognitive status (defined by MMSE-score) on cognitive function measured with an NTB (low baseline MMSE group MD 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11, high baseline MMSE group MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.04, P for interaction 0.12), nor was there clear evidence for an effect in participants with a Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) score > 6 points (MD 0.07, 95%CI -0.00 to 0.15).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence that multi-domain interventions can prevent incident dementia based on two trials. There was a small improvement in cognitive function assessed by a NTB in the group of participants receiving a multi-domain intervention, although this effect was strongest in trials offering cognitive training within the multi-domain intervention, making it difficult to rule out a potential learning effect. Interventions were diverse in terms of their components and intensity.

### Best practices of ASRM and ESHRE: a journey through reproductive medicine [^113wzQTn]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Hormone therapy (HT) in post-menopausal women — timing, cardiovascular and cognitive effects: The timing of initiation of HT may be critical in determining risks and benefits, with early and continued estrogen treatment having beneficial effects that can arrest atherosclerotic lesion development, whereas when initiated late HT could have adverse effects including triggering a coronary event. It is postulated that standard doses of oral estrogens may cause early cardiovascular events in older women through up-regulation of MMPs, disruption of the fibrous cap, and subsequent rupture of plaque. In recent RCTs, administration of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) for up to 6 years provided no protection against myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary death in generally healthy post-menopausal women who were in the wide age span of 50–79 years, but there was a statistical reduction in coronary heart disease with CEE among women in the 50 to 59 year old age group. Also in the WHI, women 50 to 59 years old receiving estrogen had less calcified-plaque burden in their coronary arteries compared with placebo, and a case control study suggested that early initiation of HT reduced the prevalence of abnormal coronary angiograms. However, the 'timing' hypothesis has not been tested in a RCT as hard end-points of MI or cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality are not possible in a young healthy population; use of 'intermediate' end-points with a high correlation to coronary heart disease (CHD) have been incorporated into the design of on-going RCTs, namely KEEPS and ELITE. For cognition, many observational studies and meta-analyses agree that estrogens in mid-life reduce a woman's risk of subsequent dementia, whereas late-life HT initiation could have deleterious effects, and in Alzheimer's disease estrogens seem to affect cognition most on tasks of semantic memory. The article notes it is unlikely that we will ever see an HT indication for either coronary disease or Alzheimer's risk.

### Interventions for preventing falls in older people in care facilities and hospitals [^1173fGCc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Other single interventions

Three trials (564 participants) examined other single interventions of lavender olfactory stimulation (Sakamoto 2012), sunlight exposure (Sambrook 2012), and multisensory stimulation in a Snoezelen room (Klages 2011); two trials (169 participants) were individually randomised (Sakamoto 2012; Klages 2011) and one (Sambrook 2012; 395 participants) was cluster randomised. The quality of the evidence was considered very low for all of these single‐trial comparisons.

For one year, Sakamoto 2012 (145 participants) tested the effect of lavender olfactory stimulation by applying lavender patches or placebo patches to clothing near the neck daily. This intervention did not show strong evidence for a reduction in the rate of falls (Analysis 10.1: RaR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01) or risk of falling (Analysis 10.2: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.12). The authors reported that there were no adverse events. We are uncertain of the effectiveness of lavender olfactory stimulation as the quality of the evidence is very low.

In Sambrook 2012 (395 participants), a trial of increased sunlight exposure had low adherence to the sunlight intervention (Durvasula 2012). We are uncertain of the effects on falls as the quality of the evidence has been assessed as very low for all outcomes (downgraded one level for each of risk of bias, indirectness and imprecision; Analysis 10.1.2: RaR 1.05, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.56; Analysis 10.2.2: RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.36; Analysis 10.3: risk of fracture: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.17, total 32 fractures). The authors reported no difference in the incidence rates of new skin cancers between arms of the trial and one fall on the way to a sunlight session. Adverse‐event data for this three‐arm trial are also reported below under Multiple interventions.

Klages 2011 (24 participants) compared the effect of multisensory stimulation in a Snoezelen room with control activities in people with dementia and reported, without providing data, that the "Group membership did not alter falls frequency". Adverse‐event data were not reported. We are uncertain of the effectiveness of multisensory stimulation as the quality of the evidence is very low.

### Summary of evidence-based guideline: complementary and alternative medicine in multiple sclerosis: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^117MEc87]. Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Magnetic therapy in multiple sclerosis (MS) is evaluated across controlled trials, showing fatigue benefits but insufficient evidence for other outcomes, with Level B counseling language. The search "identified 6 studies (1 Class I, 2 Class II, and 3 Class III)". A Class I "12-week RCT (N = 41, RRMS) reported significantly less fatigue (MFIS)", and a secondary measure showed "FSS mean [SD]: placebo 4.7 [1.6], treatment 3.5 [1.3]", with "no change in depression or disability (EDSS)". An underpowered Class II trial "(N = 30; RRMS/progressive MS) found no significant change after Bonferroni correction" using a wristwatch-size device "(10–24 hours/day for 2 months)", and another underpowered Class II trial "(N = 50; RRMS, SPMS, PPMS) found no significant difference in fatigue… 4 sessions per week for 8 weeks (intensity 37.5 mT and a sequence of pulses at 4–7 Hz)". Overall, "Magnetic therapy is probably effective for reducing fatigue in RRMS (1 Class I, 1 Class II) and probably ineffective for reducing depression in RRMS over 15 weeks (1 Class I). Data are inadequate to support or refute the effect of magnetic therapy on reducing MS-related disability… or on improving cognition, mobility, sensation, or vision". The practice recommendation states, "Clinicians might counsel patients with MS that magnetic therapy is probably effective for reducing fatigue (Level B) and probably ineffective for reducing depression (Level B)", and tolerability noted "most studies reported no AEs. One study reported headache, spasms, and burning sensation".

### Changing society, changing research: integrating gender to better understand physical and psychological treatments use in chronic pain management [^113UF5H4]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

2.2.1. Physical and psychological treatments

In the COPE study, the use of PPTs for pain management was our primary dependent variable of interest and was measured dichotomously (current use for pain yes or no). A standardized list of 31 treatment options, inspired by Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH)and Canadian Pain Task Forcereports, was presented to participants. Participants were asked "Apart from medication, do you currently use any other types of treatment for your pain?" The PPTs were listed as follows: acupuncture/acupressure, aquatic therapy, aromatherapy, biofeedback, hot–cold, chiropractic care, ergotherapy, exercises/physical activity, support groups, hypnosis, neurostimulator implantation, group intervention, massage therapy, meditation, music therapy, osteopathic treatments, physiotherapy, homeopathic products, psychotherapy (miscellaneous), virtual/augmented reality, reflexology, reiki, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), tai chi, tapping-elastic bands, relaxation/respiration, cognitive behavioural therapy, behavioural therapy, yoga, and animal-assisted therapy. Participants were asked to check off treatments currently used (participants could check more than one treatment). A category named "other" (open-ended question) allowed participants to indicate whether a treatment was not listed, and a thorough cleaning process was applied and validated by more than one member of the research team. For the individual treatments, some PPTs were recategorized according to their nature. We regrouped the variables "meditation" and "relaxation/respiration" under the label "meditation". We combined the variables "psychotherapy", "cognitive behavioural therapy", and "behavioural therapy" under "psychotherapy". The label "yoga" combined the "yoga" and "tai chi" variables. In addition to the overall use of PPTs, 4 other nonmutually exclusive variables were created for the purpose of our analysis — (1) use of active treatments, as defined in the literature as treatments that require active patient involvement: aquatic therapy, biofeedback, exercises or physical activity, support group, meditation, physiotherapy, psychotherapy, virtual or augmented reality, yoga, ergotherapy, and group intervention; (2) use of passive treatments, which include all treatments not requiring active patient involvement (travelling to and from destinations does not constitute active involvement): acupuncture, aromatherapy, hot–cold therapies, chiropractic care, homeopathic products, hypnosis, neurostimulator implantation, massage therapy, music therapy, osteopathic treatments, reflexology, tapping-elastic bands, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and animal-assisted therapy; (3) use of a multimodal approach, which includes participants who combined pharmacological treatment and at least one PPT; and (4) use of do-it-yourself (DIY) treatments which we defined, for the purpose of our study, as treatments that can be performed at home, without the help of a health care professional, and at nearly no cost (aromatherapy, hot–cold therapies, exercises, music therapy, meditation, and yoga).

### Supplementation with oil rich in eicosapentaenoic acid, but not in docosahexaenoic acid, improves global cognitive function in healthy, young adults: results from randomized controlled trials [^115Yo3Qr]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence regarding the effects of the omega-3 (ɷ-3) PUFAs (n-3 PUFAs) DHA and EPA on cognition is lacking.

Objectives

We investigated whether supplementation with oils rich in EPA or DHA improves cognition, prefrontal cortex (PFC) hemoglobin (Hb) oxygenation, and memory consolidation.

Methods

Healthy adults (n = 310; age range: 25–49 y) completed a 26-wk randomized controlled trial in which they consumed either 900 mg DHA/d and 270 mg EPA/d (DHA-rich oil), 360 mg DHA/d and 900 mg EPA/d (EPA-rich oil), or 3000 mg/d refined olive oil (placebo). Cognitive performance and memory consolidation were assessed via computerized cognitive test battery. PFC Hb oxygenation was measured using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).

Results

Both global accuracy and speed improved with EPA-rich oil compared with placebo and DHA-rich oil [EPA vs. placebo accuracy: estimated marginal mean (EMM) = 0.17 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.24) vs. EMM = 0.03 (95% CI = -0.04, 0.11); P = 0.044; EPA vs. placebo speed: EMM = -0.15 (95% CI: -0.22, -0.07) vs. EMM = 0.03 (95% CI: -0.05, 0.10); P = 0.003]. Accuracy of memory was improved with EPA compared with DHA [EMM = 0.66 (95% CI: 0.26, 1.06) vs. EMM = -0.08 (95% CI: -0.49, 0.33); P = 0.034]. Both EPA- and DHA-rich oils showed trends towards reduced PFC oxygenated Hb (oxy-Hb) compared with placebo [placebo: EMM = 27.36 µM (95% CI: 25.73, 28.98); DHA: EMM = 24.62 µM (95% CI: 22.75, 26.48); P = 0.060; EPA: EMM = 24.97 µM (95% CI: 23.35, 26.59); P = 0.082].

Conclusions

EPA supplementation improved global cognitive function and was superior to the oil enriched with DHA. Interpreted within a neural efficiency framework, reduced PFC oxygenated Hb suggests that n-3 PUFAs may be associated with increased efficiency. These trials were registered in the clinical trials registry (https://clinicaltrials.gov/) as NCT03158545, NCT03592251, NCT02763514.

### Fall prevention using olfactory stimulation with lavender odor in elderly nursing home residents: a randomized controlled trial [^112gYAFM]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the effects of lavender olfactory stimulation intervention on fall incidence in elderly nursing home residents.

Design

Randomized placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Three randomly selected nursing homes in northern Japan.

Participants

One hundred and forty-five nursing home residents aged 65 and older.

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned to the lavender (n = 73) or placebo group (n = 72) for a 360-day study period. The lavender group received continuous olfactory stimulation from a lavender patch. The placebo group received an unscented patch.

Measurement

The primary outcome measure was resident falls. Other measurements taken at baseline and 12 months included functional ability (assessed using the Barthel Index), cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)), and behavioral and psychological problems associated with dementia (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI)).

Results

There were fewer fallers in the lavender group (n = 26) than in the placebo group (n = 36) (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.34–0.95) and a lower incidence rate in the lavender group (1.04 per person-year) than in the placebo group (1.40 per person-year) (incidence rate ratio = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.30–0.88). The lavender group also had a significant decrease in CMAI score (P = 0.04) from baseline to follow-up in a per protocol analysis.

Conclusion

Lavender olfactory stimulation may reduce falls and agitation in elderly nursing home residents; further research is necessary to confirm these findings.
