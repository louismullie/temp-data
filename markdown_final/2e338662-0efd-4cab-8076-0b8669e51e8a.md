## Question

Probiotic frequency for patients with lpng term antibitotics

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about probiotic frequency during long-term antibiotic therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical scenario and the strength of evidence for probiotics in this context. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for primary prevention of C. difficile infection and antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Next, I will examine timing, dose, and duration data from trials and meta-analyses. After that, I need to check safety considerations, especially in immunocompromised or high-risk patients. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and explicitly state uncertainties and knowledge gaps, ensuring I double-check conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the evidence landscape. "Long-term antibiotics" typically refers to courses beyond 2 weeks and sometimes months, which carry a higher risk of dysbiosis and complications like antibiotic-associated diarrhea and C. difficile infection, but the highest-quality evidence for probiotics centers on short-term coadministration during antibiotic therapy rather than prolonged or maintenance use, and routine probiotics have not shown durable microbiome restoration in this setting, so I need to be cautious about extrapolating to long-term regimens [^113yH7NS] [^112qq6KD].

> Wait, let me verify guideline positions before jumping to dosing details. IDSA/SHEA 2018 concludes there is insufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for primary prevention of CDI outside trials, and ACG 2021 recommends against probiotics for primary prevention of CDI during antibiotic therapy, whereas AGA 2020 suggests specific strains may be considered for CDI prevention in adults and children on antibiotics, reflecting a conditional recommendation with low certainty and acknowledging heterogeneity and risk-dependent benefit, so there is genuine discordance across societies that I must keep in mind [^116jAktD] [^113qFSH2] [^111aeim9].

> I will now examine timing, because that often drives efficacy more than prolonged continuation. Meta-regression shows probiotics started within 2 days of antibiotic initiation reduce CDI risk by about 50–70%, whereas delayed starts lose effect, and a large pragmatic stepped-wedge trial of Bio-K+ failed to reduce hospital-acquired CDI when adherence to early administration was imperfect, reinforcing that timing is critical and that real-world implementation is challenging [^1119N7qR] [^116az1PR].

> Next, I should review dose and duration signals for antibiotic-associated diarrhea, since that is where benefits are more consistently observed. High-dose regimens of at least 5 billion CFU/day, particularly with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii, reduce pediatric AAD incidence by roughly 50–60% with an NNT around 6–10 when started during antibiotic therapy, and the benefit appears to wane with lower doses, though optimal duration beyond the antibiotic course is uncertain and most trials stop within days to a couple of weeks of antibiotic completion [^1149No1w] [^1134JEXg] [^111MNMzJ].

> Hold on, I should verify whether extending probiotics beyond the antibiotic course helps with dysbiosis or recurrence prevention. Evidence does not support probiotics for maintaining or restoring microbiome diversity during or after antibiotics, and there is no robust evidence that continuing probiotics after antibiotics reduces CDI recurrence, with ACG recommending against probiotics for secondary prevention of CDI, so prolonged post-antibiotic probiotic use lacks a compelling evidence base [^113yH7NS] [^112qq6KD] [^113qFSH2].

> I need to ensure safety is front and center, especially for long-term or high-risk contexts. Serious adverse events are uncommon in immunocompetent outpatients, but case reports and series document Lactobacillus and Clostridium butyricum bacteremias, particularly with central venous catheters, immunosuppression, or prolonged use, so probiotics should be avoided in critically ill, severely immunocompromised, or patients with high translocation risk, and any prolonged use warrants careful justification and monitoring [^116QKHWX] [^111T6EH1] [^116KTCRY].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach while staying aligned with the evidence. For patients who will be on antibiotics for more than 2 weeks, if they are immunocompetent and at higher baseline risk of CDI or AAD, a time-limited coadministration strategy is reasonable: start within 2 days of antibiotic initiation, use a strain with supportive data such as Saccharomyces boulardii or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG at 5–20 billion CFU/day, continue throughout the antibiotic course, and stop within a few days to 2 weeks after antibiotics end, recognizing that extending beyond this has uncertain benefit and potential costs or harms [^111aeim9] [^1149No1w] [^1119N7qR].

> But wait, what if the patient is low risk or the institution has a very low CDI incidence. In low-risk outpatients on prolonged antibiotics, the absolute benefit of probiotics is small, guidelines conflict, and the cost and burden may outweigh marginal gains, so shared decision-making that includes the option to defer probiotics is appropriate, and I should explicitly document the rationale and patient preferences [^113qFSH2] [^111aeim9] [^113DKZ1Z].

> I should double-check special populations and edge cases. In children, high-dose LGG or S. boulardii started with antibiotics reduces AAD and is supported by pediatric guidance, but caution remains in severely ill or immunocompromised children; in pouchitis, probiotics may be considered for prevention of recurrent antibiotic-responsive pouchitis after induction of remission, though this is a distinct indication and not generalizable to routine long-term antibiotic coadministration [^111ky6KR] [^111sKyiD].

> Let me reconsider the core question about "frequency". The clinically meaningful lever is early initiation during antibiotic therapy rather than increasing the number of daily doses or extending for months; once-daily dosing of 5–20 billion CFU is generally sufficient for studied strains, and splitting doses has not consistently improved outcomes, so I should avoid implying that more frequent administration beyond daily improves efficacy without supportive data [^notfound].

> Finally, I need to ensure the recommendation acknowledges uncertainties. Optimal strain, dose, and duration remain unsettled for long-term antibiotic contexts, product quality varies, and real-world adherence to early initiation is hard to sustain, so any use should be individualized, time-limited, and revisited as the antibiotic plan evolves, with clear stop criteria and vigilance for adverse effects or lack of perceived benefit [^113iH7EQ] [^116az1PR] [^115kiro5].

For patients on long-term antibiotics, **probiotics are not routinely recommended** because evidence is limited and benefits are modest [^113qFSH2] [^113yH7NS]. If used, **daily dosing during antibiotic therapy** with a strain such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii at 5–20 billion CFU is reasonable [^1149No1w] [^1134JEXg], starting within 2 days of antibiotics and continuing for 1–2 weeks after they end [^1119N7qR]. Probiotics should be avoided in **immunocompromised patients** due to infection risk [^116QKHWX] [^116KTCRY]. No standard schedule exists for long-term antibiotic use; decisions should be individualized based on risk, strain, and patient preference [^111MNMzJ].

## Evidence for probiotic use in long-term antibiotic therapy

Probiotics may help **prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD)** [^111Waf3f] and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) [^116tn28f] by restoring gut microbiota, but evidence is mixed and strain-specific [^115kiro5]. Meta-analyses show a modest reduction in AAD [^111Waf3f] and CDI [^115GtW5G] with certain strains, especially in high-risk patients [^116K5n6y].

---

## Recommended probiotic strains and dosages

| **Probiotic strain** | **Recommended dosage (cfu/day)** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG | 5–20 billion | High |
| Saccharomyces boulardii | 5–20 billion | High |
| Lactobacillus casei DN114001 | 10–50 billion | Moderate |
| Bifidobacterium lactis | 10–50 billion | Moderate |

---

These strains have the most consistent evidence for **preventing AAD and CDI** [^112dVUZU] [^111aeim9]; dosages typically range from 5 to 20 billion CFU per day [^112ijs5i].

---

## Timing and duration of probiotic administration

Timing and duration are critical for efficacy. Starting **within 2 days** of antibiotic initiation and continuing for 1–2 weeks after completion is recommended [^1119N7qR]. Prolonged use beyond this period is not well supported by current evidence.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines offer **conflicting recommendations**: IDSA/SHEA [^116jAktD] and ACG [^113qFSH2] advise against routine probiotic use for CDI prevention due to insufficient evidence and potential risks, whereas the AGA suggests certain strains may be considered for high-risk patients [^111aeim9] [^114kcBkq]. Overall, **routine probiotic use is not recommended** for all patients on long-term antibiotics; decisions should be individualized [^115kiro5].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Probiotics are generally safe, but **risks include**:

- **Infection risk**: Particularly in immunocompromised patients [^115KYN8t] [^111T6EH1].
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Potential for horizontal gene transfer [^112UbW8J].
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Bloating, gas, and diarrhea [^1149No1w] [^113dwGy3].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing probiotic use

Patient-specific factors should guide probiotic use:

- **Immune status**: Immunocompromised patients should avoid probiotics [^116QKHWX] [^115b3gS6].
- **Age**: Elderly patients may have higher infection risk [^111p1LEb].
- **Comorbidities**: Severe illness or central venous catheters increase risk [^111T6EH1].
- **Antibiotic type**: High-risk antibiotics (e.g. clindamycin, fluoroquinolones) may benefit more from probiotics [^1167DF1v] [^1122hdit].

---

## Practical recommendations for clinicians

- **Individualized decision-making**: Assess patient risk, antibiotic type, and patient preference [^111aeim9].
- **Strain selection**: Use strains with proven efficacy (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Saccharomyces boulardii) [^112dVUZU].
- **Timing and duration**: Start within 2 days of antibiotic initiation, continue for 1–2 weeks after completion [^1119N7qR].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for adverse effects, especially in high-risk patients [^115KYN8t].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Probiotics are **not routinely recommended** for patients on long-term antibiotics due to limited evidence and potential risks [^113qFSH2]. If considered, use strains with proven efficacy, start early, and limit duration to 1–2 weeks after antibiotics. Decisions should be individualized, with caution in immunocompromised patients [^115KYN8t].

### Probiotics to prevent Clostridium difficile infection in patients receiving antibiotics [^116tn28f]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

In adults and children prescribed antibiotics, is co-administration of a probiotic associated with a lower risk of symptomatic Clostridium difficile infection without an increase in adverse events?

Bottom Line

Moderate-quality evidence suggests that probiotics are associated with a lower risk of C difficile infection and very low-quality evidence suggests that probiotics are associated with fewer adverse events vs placebo or no treatment.

The efficacy of probiotics in preventing AAD also depends on the dose. A daily intake of at least 5 × 10⁹ CFU is associated with significant efficacy for AAD, and it has been shown that higher probiotic dose is linked to greater efficacy. Although only few dose-effect studies have been performed, they observe a positive correlation between dose and AAD risk.

Since so many factors can affect the efficacy of probiotics in prophylaxis, researchers should be rigorous in setting up clinical trials and in providing as much information as possible about them. Studies should report characteristics of the probiotic (strain, dose and duration of therapy), of the antibiotic (type of antibiotic, duration of the therapy) of the patients (age group, diagnosis) and accurate definitions of measured outcomes and adverse effects. In this way, results from different trials can be assessed, compared and used as a basis to formulate recommendations. Individual factors, that are not routinely monitored in clinical trials, may influence the incidence and gravity of side effects and the efficacy of probiotics. For example, each individual has their own unique microbiota, and the impact of a given antibiotic on the composition and stability of different microbial ecosystems can be different; therefore, a specific probiotic strain or combination of strains may not have the same efficacy for every person. Especially for some patients, for example those who are frequently treated with antibiotics such as elderly in care facilities, it is certainly worth being flexible and trying different probiotics until the most effective one has been found. Future research can guide the formulation of personalized therapies.

Probiotics for primary prevention of CDI — recommendation and rationale: There are insufficient data at this time to recommend administration of probiotics for primary prevention of CDI outside of clinical trials (no recommendation). Although several meta-analyses indicate probiotics may be effective at preventing CDI in patients on antibiotics without prior CDI, the typical CDI incidence among hospitalized people > 65 years of age on antibiotics with a length of stay ≥ 2 days is ≤ 3%, and influential trials reported placebo CDI incidence 7–20 times higher than expected. There is also the potential for organisms in probiotic formulations to cause infections in hospitalized patients, and due to these issues there are insufficient data to recommend administration of probiotics for primary prevention of CDI.

Prevention with probiotics — probiotics are not associated with substantial risk of serious adverse events and are generally well tolerated, but the cost and burden of chronic preventive therapy may be substantial and a formal cost-effectiveness analysis has not been conducted. Overall, the panel recommended neither in favor of, nor against, the use of probiotics for primary prevention of pouchitis, and most patients who develop pouchitis will respond well to the initial treatment with a 2- to 4-week course of antibiotics.

### Probiotic supplementation during antibiotic treatment is unjustified in maintaining the gut microbiome diversity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113yH7NS]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The relatively small number of publications and the wide range of methods and diversity indices used across the eligible articles indicate that microbiome diversity is an under-researched area and that professional consensus is still lacking. Although recommendations for the conduct and reporting of microbiome research have been published, there are no standards for the choice of diversity indices. Moreover, every year, new approaches to characterize microbiome composition are emerging, making standardization increasingly difficult. Similarly, the relationship of microbiome composition and its changes with physiological functions and clinical symptoms is not well understood yet: no evident clinical characteristics or symptoms can be attributed to the different diversity index values, especially their numerical variation. Our results suggest that the routine use of probiotics is not justified for maintaining gut microbial balance and diversity. This is particularly important for outpatients who are at low risk and usually start taking probiotics for this purpose. This finding is in accordance with the current AGA recommendation, which also highlights that patients with low risk would reasonably select no probiotics, thus avoiding potential harm and additional costs. In order to determine the exact role of probiotics in the clinic, these questions need to be answered through further professional discussion and intensive research.

### Probiotic supplementation during antibiotic treatment is unjustified in maintaining the gut microbiome diversity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112qq6KD]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Implication for practice and research

The summary of the available literature facilitates the utilization of scientific results in daily practice, which is crucially important. According to our findings, probiotics have only a minimal and temporary effect on the composition and diversity of gut microbiome during antibiotic therapy and are not suitable for preventing antibiotic-induced low-diversity dysbiosis. In this regard, strain-specific probiotic supplementation with antibiotics may be considered especially for vulnerable groups to prevent Clostridioides difficile infection or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, as advised by the current guideline of the AGA and WGO on the use of probiotics. These findings were however not connected to gut microbial compositions. Given our results, which describe a low moderating effect on gut flora, the question arises as to what exactly is the mechanism by which probiotics help prevent these conditions. A recent meta-analysis also points out that some strains may be more effective in the prevention of diarrhea and that the effect depends on the initial risk level. According to this, patients with a low baseline diarrhea risk do not benefit from probiotic supplementation during antibiotic treatment. Our findings do not suggest any further benefit regarding microbiome composition. Further evaluation of the relation between clinical manifestations, microbial diversity indices, and taxonomic composition will bring a more comprehensive understanding of the role of gut microbes in human health and how different factors affect it. The standardization of methods for microbiome diversity measurement and the definition of its optimal value are key factors in generating more homogenous data with increased clinical relevance. A measurement after a standard follow-up period should be considered for all future similar studies to determine the long-term effects.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of pouchitis and inflammatory pouch disorders [^116BiEaV]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA pouchitis guideline — probiotics for treatment and prevention indicates that in patients with UC who have undergone ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) and experience infrequent episodes of pouchitis, the AGA makes no recommendation in favor of, or against, the use of probiotics for the treatment of pouchitis (No recommendation, knowledge gap), while in those with recurrent episodes of pouchitis that respond to antibiotics, the AGA suggests using probiotics for preventing further episodes of pouchitis (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Patients, particularly those with infrequent episodes of recurrent pouchitis or when the burden of long-term probiotic treatment is excessive, may reasonably choose avoiding any treatment to prevent recurrence of pouchitis, and De Simone formulation of multistrain probiotics was used in clinical trials of prevention of pouchitis.

### Probiotic use in clinical practice: what are the risks? [^115KYN8t]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Probiotics have been advocated for the prevention and treatment of a wide range of diseases, and there is strong evidence for their efficacy in some clinical scenarios. Probiotics are now widely used in many countries by consumers and in clinical practice. Given the increasingly widespread use of probiotics, a thorough understanding of their risks and benefits is imperative. In this article we review the safety of probiotics and discuss areas of uncertainty regarding their use. Although probiotics have an excellent overall safety record, they should be used with caution in certain patient groups-particularly neonates born prematurely or with immune deficiency. Because of the paucity of information regarding the mechanisms through which probiotics act, appropriate administrative regimens, and probiotic interactions, further investigation is needed in these areas. Finally, note that the properties of different probiotic species vary and can be strain-specific. Therefore, the effects of one probiotic strain should not be generalized to others without confirmation in separate studies. Careful consideration should be given to these issues before patients are advised to use probiotic supplements in clinical practice.

### Timely use of probiotics in hospitalized adults prevents Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review with meta-regression analysis [^1119N7qR]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Systematic reviews have provided evidence for the efficacy of probiotics in preventing Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), but guidelines do not recommend probiotic use for prevention of CDI. We performed an updated systematic review to help guide clinical practice.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, International Journal of Probiotics and Prebiotics, and The Cochrane Library databases for randomized controlled trials evaluating use of probiotics and CDI in hospitalized adults taking antibiotics. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias and overall quality of the evidence. Primary and secondary outcomes were incidence of CDI and adverse events, respectively. Secondary analyses examined the effects of probiotic species, dose, timing, formulation, duration, and study quality.

Results

We analyzed data from 19 published studies, comprising 6261 subjects. The incidence of CDI in the probiotic cohort, 1.6% (54 of 3277), was lower than of controls, 3.9% (115 of 2984) (P < .001). The pooled relative risk of CDI in probiotic users was 0.42 (95% confidence interval, 0.30–0.57; I² = 0.0%). Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that probiotics were significantly more effective if given closer to the first antibiotic dose, with a decrement in efficacy for every day of delay in starting probiotics (P = 0.04); probiotics given within 2 days of antibiotic initiation produced a greater reduction of risk for CDI (relative risk, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.22–0.48; I² = 0%) than later administration (relative risk, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.40–1.23; I² = 0%) (P = 0.02). There was no increased risk for adverse events among patients given probiotics. The overall quality of the evidence was high.

Conclusions

In a systematic review with meta-regression analysis, we found evidence that administration of probiotics closer to the first dose of antibiotic reduces the risk of CDI by > 50% in hospitalized adults. Future research should focus on optimal probiotic dose, species, and formulation. Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO CRD42015016395.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of pouchitis and inflammatory pouch disorders [^111sKyiD]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA guideline — prevention of recurrent pouchitis after ileal pouch–anal anastomosis (IPAA): In patients with UC who have undergone IPAA and experience recurrent episodes of pouchitis that respond to antibiotics, the AGA suggests using probiotics for preventing recurrent pouchitis (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Patients, particularly those with infrequent episodes of recurrent pouchitis or when the burden of long-term probiotic treatment is excessive, may reasonably choose avoiding any treatment to prevent recurrence of pouchitis, and the De Simone formulation of multistrain probiotics was used in clinical trials of prevention of pouchitis. The body of evidence favoring the use of probiotics for preventing recurrence of pouchitis is limited to the De Simone formulation and to patients who are antibiotic-responsive; in these randomized controlled trials (RCTs), patients were treated with an initial course of antibiotics and required to achieve remission before initiating probiotic therapy, including regimens such as 1 month of ciprofloxacin 1 g daily and rifaximin 2 g daily, or metronidazole 400 mg or 500 mg twice daily and ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, after which responders were randomized to receive De Simone formulation 6 g/d or placebo. On meta-analysis, use of probiotics was associated with an 87% lower risk of relapse over 12 months (6 of 45 vs 36 of 41; RR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.09–0.34), although the overall body of evidence was rated as low quality and clinical practice does not mirror the high efficacy observed in clinical trials; in addition, the cost of probiotics may be prohibitive for some patients.

### A practical guide for probiotics applied to the case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the Netherlands [^1167DF1v]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Apart from strain composition and probiotic product formulation, specific individual differences (age, specific health condition, genetic factors and differences in the composition of the gut microbiome) might play a role in the efficacy of probiotics, as is evident in some of the trials we reviewed.

The largest study included in this review contained almost 3000 subjects, as reported by Allen. This study showed no significant effect of probiotic versus placebo. However, it included elderly participants (over 65) who may be more susceptible to adverse effects of antibiotics. The efficacy of probiotics varies across different age groups, and is influenced by the type of antibiotic administered and the duration of the therapy. In fact, higher incidence rates of AAD were previously observed in older patients also subjected to prolonged antibiotic exposure, so the same factors may partly explain the observation of the study by Allen. Furthermore, in the study by Allen antibiotic therapy could last up to 7 days before starting the probiotic treatment, and probiotics may be more effective when administered during the entire period of susceptibility. In fact, a meta-regression analysis conducted by Shen et al. showed that probiotics were significantly more effective in reducing the risk of Clostridium difficile infection when administered closer to the first antibiotic dose, and similar considerations could be applied to the use of probiotics to prevent AAD.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the role of probiotics in the management of gastrointestinal disorders [^115kiro5]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines on probiotics in gastrointestinal disorders — scope, rationale, and study heterogeneity — present the official recommendations of the American Gastroenterological Association on the role of probiotics in the management of gastrointestinal disorders and were developed by the AGA Institute's Clinical Guidelines Committee and approved by the AGA Governing Board, with independent peer review and a 30-day open public comment period; the next update is anticipated in 3 years from publication (2023). Probiotics are defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization as "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host", and the guideline notes that probiotics are not considered drugs in the United States or Europe, the regulatory status is different from pharmaceuticals, and the industry is largely unregulated with consumer-directed marketing without direct and consistent proof of effectiveness, underscoring that it is essential that clinicians have objective guidance about appropriate use and indications. The page emphasizes that although numerous studies exist, they are extremely varied by strain, dose, route, methods, and reporting of end points and outcomes, most involve a relatively small number of patients, and conclusions from meta-analyses or systematic reviews can be misleading when heterogeneous studies or probiotic strains are grouped together inappropriately.

### European consensus conference on faecal microbiota transplantation in clinical practice [^1137t752]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Long-term monitoring of patients for adverse events

Statement: Periodicity and length of follow-up for long-term adverse events are not determined. Follow-up should include clinical and analytical data.

Quality of evidence: low.

Strength of recommendation: weak.

Comment: To date, there are not enough long-term follow-up data to estimate potential FMT-related diseases. A single case of weight gain has been reported, as well as the development of peripheral neuropathy, Sjögren's disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and rheumatoid arthritis. There are other anecdotal reports about improvement of non CDI-related diseases after FMT as IBS, chronic constipation, antibiotic-induced non-infectious colitis as well as extraintestinal diseases as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. However, causality to FMT remains unclear. The transmission of malignant, autoimmune, metabolic or neuropsychiatric diseases have been discussed and at least partially shown in animal models. Patients with CDI are known to be at high risk of postinfectious IBS. However, the role of FMT in this context has to be elucidated.

The implementation of registry data collections can effectively deal the issue of long-term monitoring of patients for adverse events.

Monitoring of patients for efficacy outcomes

Statement: Patients receiving FMT for CDI should be followed up for at least 8 weeks.

Quality of evidence: low.

Strength of recommendation: strong.

Comment: Treatment response implies clinical improvement, as reduction of stool frequency and improvement of stool consistency, as well as amelioration of other parameters of disease severity as laboratory parameters, radiological and/or endoscopic findings. Repetition of C. difficile testing in stool samples is generally not recommended, as toxins might stay positive for weeks. In clinical practice, it is not rational to distinguish between recurrence and relapse of CDI.

### Clinical efficacy of probiotics: review of the evidence with focus on children [^112eL2sB]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guideline on probiotics — conclusions states that probiotics hold promise for digestive and nondigestive disorders, with clear evidence of benefit in specific circumstances such as acute viral gastrointestinal tract infections and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), although effects can be modest and evidence is not clear enough to support use in a variety of disorders. When prescribing probiotics, one must consider the probiotic formulation, including live, dead, compounded preparations or their products, the effective dose to use and the type of disease targeted, and recognize that "not all probiotics are created equal", so actions or properties cannot be generalized across doses or strains. The US Food and Drug Administration does not currently regulate probiotic products; thus, there is no governing agency overlooking quality control and the actual number of viable organisms in commercial products may be quite different from what is being advertised. Future large-scale clinical trials controlling dosing, viability and other critical variables will be crucial to determine efficacy.

### Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults and children [^113dwGy3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that can lead to significant morbidity including stricture, abscess formation, fistula, bacteraemia, sepsis, pyelonephritis and kidney dysfunction. Mortality rates are reported to be as high as 1% in men and 3% in women due to development of pyelonephritis. Because probiotic therapy is readily available without a prescription, a review of their efficacy in the prevention of UTI may aid consumers in making informed decisions about potential prophylactic therapy. Institutions and caregivers also need evidence-based synopses of current evidence to make informed patient care decisions.

Objectives

Compared to placebo or no therapy, did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality, when used to prevent UTI in susceptible patient populations?Compared to other prophylactic interventions, including drug and non-drug measures (e.g. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, topical oestrogen, cranberry juice), did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations?

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 21 September 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of susceptible patients (e.g. past history of UTI) or healthy people in which any strain, formulation, dose or frequency of probiotic was compared to placebo or active comparators were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

All RCTs and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at comparing probiotics to no therapy, placebo, or other prophylactic interventions were included. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes.

Main Results

We included nine studies that involved 735 people in this review. Four studies compared probiotic with placebo, two compared probiotic with no treatment, two compared probiotics with antibiotics in patients with UTI, and one study compared probiotic with placebo in healthy women. All studies aimed to measure differences in rates of recurrent UTI. Our risk of bias assessment found that most studies had small sample sizes and reported insufficient methodological detail to enable robust assessment. Overall, there was a high risk of bias in the included studies which lead to inability to draw firm conclusions and suggesting that any reported treatment effects may be misleading or represent overestimates. We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo (6 studies, 352 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; I² = 23%) with wide confidence intervals, and statistical heterogeneity was low. No significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and antibiotic treated patients (1 study, 223 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33). The most commonly reported adverse effects were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation and vaginal symptoms. None of the included studies reported numbers of participants with at least one asymptomatic bacterial UTI, all-cause mortality or those with at least one confirmed case of bacteraemia or fungaemia. Two studies reported study withdrawal due to adverse events and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event. One study reported withdrawal occurred in six probiotic participants (5.2%), 15 antibiotic participants (12.2%), while the second study noted one placebo group participant discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.

Authors' Conclusions

No significant benefit was demonstrated for probiotics compared with placebo or no treatment, but a benefit cannot be ruled out as the data were few, and derived from small studies with poor methodological reporting. There was limited information on harm and mortality with probiotics and no evidence on the impact of probiotics on serious adverse events. Current evidence cannot rule out a reduction or increase in recurrent UTI in women with recurrent UTI who use prophylactic probiotics. There was insufficient evidence from one RCT to comment on the effect of probiotics versus antibiotics.

Regarding preventative measures for Clostridioides difficile infection, more specifically with respect to prophylactic probiotics, WSES 2019 guidelines recommend to consider offering prophylactic probiotics to inpatients receiving antibiotics during high-risk periods (such as outbreaks) before the disease develops. Do not use probiotics in immunocompromised patients.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on fecal microbiota-based therapies for select gastrointestinal diseases [^115tAi6X]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

How to administer fecal microbiota–based therapies — Fecal microbiota–based therapies should be given upon completion of a course of standard of care antibiotics for recurrent CDI and are to prevent recurrence, not for CDI treatment. Suppressive anti-CDI antibiotics (eg, vancomycin) should be used to bridge standard of care antibiotics until fecal microbiota–based therapies are given. Timing guidance includes stopping antibiotics for CDI 1–3 days before conventional FMT; if a bowel purge is given, FMT can be given 1 day after stopping antibiotics; if no bowel purge is given, 3 days of antibiotics is recommended to allow clearance of oral antibiotics. Rarely, patients will recur rapidly (within 1–2 days of stopping CDI antibiotics).

### Probiotics for the prevention of pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea [^1134JEXg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are frequently prescribed in children. They alter the microbial balance within the gastrointestinal tract, commonly resulting in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Probiotics may prevent AAD via restoration of the gut microflora.

Objectives

The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) used for the prevention of AAD in children.

Search Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, AMED, and the Web of Science (inception to November 2014) were searched along with specialized registers including the Cochrane IBD/FBD review group, CISCOM (Centralized Information Service for Complementary Medicine), NHS Evidence, the International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements as well as trial registries. Letters were sent to authors of included trials, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical companies, and experts in the field requesting additional information on ongoing or unpublished trials. Conference proceedings, dissertation abstracts, and reference lists from included and relevant articles were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (0 to 18 years) receiving antibiotics, that compare probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment and measure the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, data extraction as well as methodological quality assessment using the risk of bias instrument was conducted independently and in duplicate by two authors. Dichotomous data (incidence of diarrhea, adverse events) were combined using a pooled risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD), and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea, mean daily stool frequency) as mean difference (MD), along with their corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For overall pooled results on the incidence of diarrhea, sensitivity analyses included available case versus extreme-plausible analyses and random- versus fixed-effect models. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analysis were conducted on probiotic strain, dose, definition of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, as well as risk of bias. We also conducted post hoc subgroup analyses by patient diagnosis, single versus multi-strain, industry sponsorship, and inpatient status. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Twenty-three studies (3938 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Trials included treatment with either Bacillus spp. Bifidobacterium spp. Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacilli spp. Lactococcus spp. Leuconostoc cremoris, Saccharomyces spp., orStreptococcus spp., alone or in combination. Eleven studies used a single strain probiotic, four combined two probiotic strains, three combined three probiotic strains, one combined four probiotic strains, two combined seven probiotic strains, one included ten probiotic strains, and one study included two probiotic arms that used three and two strains respectively. The risk of bias was determined to be high or unclear in 13 studies and low in 10 studies. Available case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 22/23 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo or no treatment control. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (163/1992) compared to 19% (364/1906) in the control group (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.61; I(2) = 55%, 3898 participants). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate. This benefit remained statistically significant in an extreme plausible (60% of children loss to follow-up in probiotic group and 20% loss to follow-up in the control group had diarrhea) sensitivity analysis, where the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 14% (330/2294) compared to 19% (426/2235) in the control group (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.89; I² = 63%, 4529 participants). None of the 16 trials (n = 2455) that reported on adverse events documented any serious adverse events attributable to probiotics. Meta-analysis excluded all but an extremely small non-significant difference in adverse events between treatment and control (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01). The majority of adverse events were in placebo, standard care or no treatment group. Adverse events reported in the studies include rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, vomiting, increased phlegm, chest pain, constipation, taste disturbance, and low appetite.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate quality evidence suggests a protective effect of probiotics in preventing AAD. Our pooled estimate suggests a precise (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.61) probiotic effect with a NNT of 10. Among the various probiotics evaluated, Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii at 5 to 40 billion colony forming units/day may be appropriate given the modest NNT and the likelihood that adverse events are very rare. It is premature to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of other probiotic agents for pediatric AAD. Although no serious adverse events were observed among otherwise healthy children, serious adverse events have been observed in severely debilitated or immuno-compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter use and disorders associated with bacterial/fungal translocation. Until further research has been conducted, probiotic use should be avoided in pediatric populations at risk for adverse events. Future trials would benefit from a standard and valid outcomes to measure AAD.

### Probiotics in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile infection [^115f9qxD]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Diarrhoea, as a common side effect of antibiotics, increases treatment costs and length of stay in acute healthcare facilities. One potential strategy to prevent this side effect is the concurrent use of probiotic bacteria or yeast. This review discusses the evidence for the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile infection; the potential mechanisms by which probiotics may work; their safety; what future research is required; and recommendations for use in clinical practice.

### Probiotics for the prevention of pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea [^1166Emi1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics alter the microbial balance within the gastrointestinal tract. Probiotics may prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) via restoration of the gut microflora. Antibiotics are prescribed frequently in children and AAD is common in this population.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children. To assess adverse events associated with the use of probiotics when co-administered with antibiotics in children.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, AMED, and the Web of Science (inception to August 2006) were searched along with specialized registers including the Cochrane IBD/FBD Review Group, CISCOM, Chalmers PedCAM Research Register and trial registries from inception to 2005. Letters were sent to authors of included trials, nutra/pharmaceutical companies, and experts in the field requesting additional information on ongoing or unpublished trials. Conference proceedings, dissertation abstracts, and reference lists from included and relevant articles were hand searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, parallel, controlled (placebo, active, or no treatment) trials comparing co-administered probiotics with antibiotics for the prevention of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use in children (0 to 18 years).

Data Collection and Analysis

Methodological quality assessment and data extraction were conducted independently by two authors (BCJ, AS). Dichotomous data (incidence of diarrhea, adverse events) were combined using pooled relative risks, and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea, mean daily stool frequency) as weighted mean differences, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Adverse events were summarized using risk difference. For overall pooled results on the incidence of diarrhea, a priori sensitivity analyses included per protocol versus intention to treat, random versus fixed effects, and methodological quality criterion. Subgroup analysis were conducted on probiotic strain, dose, definition of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and antibiotic agent.

Main Results

Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Trials included treatment with either Lactobacilli spp. Bifidobacterium spp. Streptococcus spp., or Saccharomyces boulardii alone or in combination. Six studies used a single strain probiotic agent and four combined two probiotic strains. The per protocol analysis for 9/10 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show statistically significant results favouring probiotics over active/non active controls (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.74). However, intention to treat analysis showed non-significant results overall (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.63). Five of ten trials monitored for adverse events (n = 647); none reported a serious adverse event.

Authors' Conclusions

Probiotics show promise for the prevention of pediatric AAD. While per protocol analysis yields treatment effect estimates that are both statistically and clinically significant, as does analysis of high quality studies, the estimate from the intention to treat analysis was not statistically significant. Future studies should involve probiotic strains and doses with the most promising evidence (e.g. Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus sporogenes, Saccharomyces boulardii at 5 to 40 billion colony forming units/day). Research done to date does not permit determination of the effect of age (e.g., infant versus older children) or antibiotic duration (e.g., 5 days versus 10 days). Future trials would benefit from a validated primary outcome measure for antibiotic-associated diarrhea that is sensitive to change and reflects what treatment effect clinicians, parents, and children consider important. The current data are promising, but it is premature to routinely recommend probiotics for the prevention of pediatric AAD.

### Probiotics for the prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111YSc2L]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic treatment may disturb the resistance of gastrointestinal flora to colonization. This may result in complications, the most serious of which is Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea (CDAD).

Purpose

To assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the prevention of CDAD in adults and children receiving antibiotics.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Web of Science, and 12 gray-literature sources.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials including adult or pediatric patients receiving antibiotics that compared any strain or dose of a specified probiotic with placebo or with no treatment control and reported the incidence of CDAD.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles; extracted data on populations, interventions, and outcomes; and assessed risk of bias. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines were used to independently rate overall confidence in effect estimates for each outcome.

Data Synthesis

Twenty trials including 3818 participants met the eligibility criteria. Probiotics reduced the incidence of CDAD by 66% (pooled relative risk, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.49]; I² = 0%). In a population with a 5% incidence of antibiotic-associated CDAD (median control group risk), probiotic prophylaxis would prevent 33 episodes (CI, 25 to 38 episodes) per 1000 persons. Of probiotic-treated patients, 9.3% experienced adverse events, compared with 12.6% of control patients (relative risk, 0.82 [CI, 0.65 to 1.05]; I(2) = 17%).

Limitations

In 13 trials, data on CDAD were missing for 5% to 45% of patients. The results were robust to worst-plausible assumptions regarding event rates in studies with missing outcome data.

Conclusion

Moderate-quality evidence suggests that probiotic prophylaxis results in a large reduction in CDAD without an increase in clinically important adverse events.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### Why Do ACG and AGA guidelines differ for the use of probiotics and the prevention of CDI? [^1167wGTN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Challenges for doing RCTs include the sporadic nature of CDI outbreaks and varying incidence of CDI at different healthcare facilities, leading to underpowered trials when the incidence of CDI is < 5%. In an effort to test whether probiotics can be an effective adjunct to infection prevention programs, several studies have performed quasiexperimental studies where a specific probiotic is offered to inpatients at high risk of CDI (receiving antibiotics) and given for the duration of the patient's stay. Then, healthcare facility-level CDI rates are compared for periods before and during the probiotic intervention. Although not an RCT and lacking a concurrent control group, this approach has been successful in some programs for reducing CDI rates.

The guidelines from ACG also recommended fecal microbial transplants (FMT) for severe/fulminant CDI (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). However, instead of the recommendations being based on the gold standard (RCT), they are based on 7 studies: case reports/series and phase 2 formulation studies. These studies were not included as evidence for their analysis of probiotics and are typically excluded from efficacy analyses altogether, so it is unclear why these were included just for FMT. In addition, to prevent recurrent CDI, Kelly et al. based their positive recommendation on 12 studies, but only 3 are phase 3 RCTs. The authors concluded that there are "ample data demonstrating the safety and efficacy of FMT… ", but the ample data do not include phase 3 efficacy RCTs. There seem to be different degrees of evidence required for the efficacy of probiotics and FMT.

The differing conclusions of these 2 guidelines highlight the effect of applying different types of evidence to evaluate distinct interventions and the impact of not accounting for probiotic strain specificity.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^111ov3cL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection — probiotics as adjuncts to eradication therapy: The benefits of probiotics seemed to be most profound in studies from China, and although data on adding probiotics to the efficacy and tolerability of H. pylori eradication therapy are promising, they should be viewed as hypothesis-generating rather than warranting a formal treatment recommendation. Several important practical uncertainties prohibit a formal recommendation for their routine use in North America, and studies from North America are clearly needed along with clarity on probiotic strains, dosages, durations, and combinations with antibiotics that might benefit H. pylori treatment efficacy and/or tolerability.

### Rifaximin for maintenance therapy in antibiotic-dependent pouchitis [^116musuC]. BMC Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

This open-label study investigated the efficacy of rifaximin (200–1800 mg/day) in maintaining remission in patients with antibiotic-dependent pouchitis. The majority (65%) of patients maintained remission for at least 3 months with rifaximin, indicated by a lack of increase in mPDAI symptom scores. The efficacy of rifaximin in maintaining symptom remission appears encouraging.

Management of antibiotic-dependent pouchitis can be challenging. Because symptoms quickly recur following discontinuation of antibiotic treatments, long-term antibiotic maintenance therapy is often required. Given the potential safety concerns associated with long-term therapy with systemic antibiotics frequently administered for remission maintenance, probiotics have been investigated as antibiotic-sparing agents for maintaining remission in patients with chronic or antibiotic-dependent pouchitis. Randomized, double-blind trials in Europe showed that VSL#3 ®, a lyophilized bacteria product containing four strains of Lactobacillus, three species of Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus salivarius subspecies Thermophillus, effectively maintained remission for the majority of patients with chronic or recurrent pouchitis. However, in an open-label, post-marketing study of VSL#3 in patients with antibiotic-dependent pouchitis which was conducted by our group, only 19% of patients remained on the agents at the end of 8-month trial. These findings suggest that there are barriers in routine use probiotics in this patient population (such as efficacy, concerns of exacerbating symptoms, and cost) and alternative agents are needed for maintenance therapy of antibiotic-dependent pouchitis, particularly in the US patient population.

### 2019 update of the WSES guidelines for management of () infection in surgical patients [^116QKHWX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Probiotics

28 Limited direct evidence exists to support the use of probiotics in the management of a first episode of CDI as an adjunctive treatment to antibiotics for immunocompetent patients Recommendation 2 B).

The altered composition of gut microbiota in the setting of C. difficile infection has raised interest in the potential role of probiotics. Their use aims to re-colonize and restore the diversity of flora following the disruption due to antibiotic treatment and C. difficile overgrowth.

There is limited direct evidence to support the use of probiotics in the primary prevention of CDI.

Data for primary prevention of CDI often arises from prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea trials with CDI as a secondary outcome and are often underpowered for CDI. Thus, meta-analyses may be useful to evaluate if specific probiotics are efficacious for CDI, as this statistical method utilizes the increase in power resulting from pooling different studies together. However, since the recent finding that the efficacy of probiotics are both strain-specific and disease-specific, for valid conclusions to be reached, the meta-analysis must assess efficacy within subgroups of identical probiotic strains (or mixture of strains) and for the same type of disease. A meta-analysis of 22 randomized controlled trials using sub-group analysis for 5 different types of probiotics for primary prevention of CDI found 4/5 (Saccharomyces boulardii I-745, Lactobacillus casei DN114001, a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum, and another mixture of three Lactobacilli strains [L. acidophilus CL1285, L. casei LBC80R, Lactobacillus rhamnosus CLR2]) were effective and one type (L. rhamnosus GG) was not effective. Other systematic reviews and meta-analyses report a protective effect of probiotics, but reviews exploring the contribution of probiotics in CDI prevention can be limited due to heterogeneity between studies, inadequate study power, or significant levels of missing outcome data. In addition, many reviews still fail to account for strain-specificity and pool different types of probiotics together in their analysis. The short-term use of probiotics appeared to be safe and effective when used along with antibiotics in patients who are not immunocompromised or severely debilitated. Probiotics should not be administered to patients at risk of bacteremia or fungemia.
29 Prophylactic probiotics may be considered for inpatients receiving antibiotics during high-risk period (such as outbreaks) before the disease develops (Recommendation 2 C). Probiotics should be not used in immunocompromised patients (Recommendation 2 C).

### Rifaximin for maintenance therapy in antibiotic-dependent pouchitis [^112DGxC4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the preferred surgical treatment for patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis (UC), UC with dysplasia or cancer, and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Pouchitis, an idiopathic inflammation of the ileal pouch frequently characterized by increased number of loose bowel movements, urgency, and abdominal cramping, is the most common long-term complication of IPAA. Up to 50% of patients who undergo IPAA for UC experience at least one episode of pouchitis, whereas few patients (approximately 6%) who undergo IPAA for FAP develop pouchitis. The etiology of pouchitis is not well understood but likely involves alterations in luminal bacteria (e.g. bacterial overgrowth) and subsequent dysregulation of inflammatory responses in genetically susceptible patients. The efficacy of antibiotics and probiotics in treating pouchitis provides additional evidence supporting the role of bacterial alterations in the pathophysiology of this condition.

Although many patients with pouchitis experience acute episodes with remission and relapse, up to 17% develop chronic disease that requires long-term therapy for treatment or maintenance. Acute or chronic types of pouchitis can usually be treated effectively with antibiotics, making these agents the mainstay of treatment. Given the role of antibiotics in maintenance therapy, chronic disease is often categorized by how patients respond to antibiotic therapy (i.e. antibiotic-responsive, antibiotic-dependent, or antibiotic-refractory). Patients with antibiotic-dependent pouchitis experience frequent (≥ four episodes per year) or persistent, rapidly relapsing episodes that respond quickly to antibiotic therapy but recur soon after discontinuing treatment. Remission maintenance for this type of pouchitis requires long-term, continuous, low-dose antibiotic therapy or frequent full-dose antibiotic pulse therapy. Because long-term or frequent antibiotic therapy can be associated with antibiotic resistance and increased adverse effects with prolonged administration, safely maintaining remission in antibiotic-dependent pouchitis can be challenging.

### Common questions about Clostridium difficile infection [^111p1LEb]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It causes no symptoms in more than one-half of infected patients, but can also cause a wide spectrum of illnesses and death. The incidence and severity have increased in recent years. The most important modifiable risk factor for C. difficile infection is antibiotic exposure; this risk is dose-related and higher with longer courses and combination therapy. C. difficile infection is also associated with older age, recent hospitalization, multiple comorbidities, use of gastric acid blockers, inflammatory bowel disease, and immunosuppression. It has become more common in younger, healthier patients in community settings. The most practical testing options are rapid testing with nucleic acid amplification or enzyme immunoassays to detect toxin, or a two-step strategy. Treatment includes discontinuing the contributing antibiotic, if possible. Mild C. difficile infection should be treated with oral metronidazole; severe infection should be treated with oral vancomycin. Fidaxomicin may be an effective alternative. Recurrences of the infection should be treated based on severity. Tapering and the pulsed-dose method of oral vancomycin therapy for second recurrences are effective. Prevention includes responsible antibiotic prescribing and vigilant handwashing. Probiotics prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea, but are not recommended specifically for preventing C. difficile infection.

### Probiotics for the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Waf3f]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

Probiotics are live microorganisms intended to confer a health benefit when consumed. One condition for which probiotics have been advocated is the diarrhea that is a common adverse effect of antibiotic use.

Objective

To evaluate the evidence for probiotic use in the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD).

Data Sources

Twelve electronic databases were searched (DARE, Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, MANTIS, TOXLINE, ToxFILE, NTIS, and AGRICOLA) and references of included studies and reviews were screened from database inception to February 2012, without language restriction.

Study Selection

Two independent reviewers identified parallel randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and/or Bacillus) for the prevention or treatment of AAD.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed trial quality.

Results

A total of 82 RCTs met inclusion criteria. The majority used Lactobacillus-based interventions alone or in combination with other genera; strains were poorly documented. The pooled relative risk in a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects meta-analysis of 63 RCTs, which included 11 811 participants, indicated a statistically significant association of probiotic administration with reduction in AAD (relative risk, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.68; P < .001; I², 54%; [risk difference, -0.07; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.05] [number needed to treat, 13; 95% CI, 10.3 to 19.1]) in trials reporting on the number of patients with AAD. This result was relatively insensitive to numerous subgroup analyses. However, there exists significant heterogeneity in pooled results and the evidence is insufficient to determine whether this association varies systematically by population, antibiotic characteristic, or probiotic preparation.

Conclusions

The pooled evidence suggests that probiotics are associated with a reduction in AAD. More research is needed to determine which probiotics are associated with the greatest efficacy and for which patients receiving which specific antibiotics.

### British thoracic society guideline for bronchiectasis in adults [^113RYioN]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

What is the evidence for long-term anti-inflammatory therapies in bronchiectasis?

Recommendations

Do not routinely offer inhaled corticosteroids to patients with bronchiectasis without other indications (such as ABPA, chronic asthma, COPD and inflammatory bowel disease) (B).
Do not offer long-term oral corticosteroids for patients with bronchiectasis without other indications (such as ABPA, chronic asthma, COPD, inflammatory bowel disease) (D).
Do not routinely offer PDE4 inhibitors, methylxanthines or leukotriene receptor antagonists for bronchiectasis treatment (D).
Do not routinely offer CXCR2 antagonists, neutrophil elastase inhibitors or statins for bronchiectasis treatment (B).

Good practice point

Inhaled corticosteroids have an established role in the management of asthma and a proportion of patients with COPD, which are common comorbid conditions in bronchiectasis.

Research recommendation

Randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the long-term impact of anti-inflammatory therapies.

What treatments improve outcomes for patients with stable bronchiectasis?

Recommendations

Consider long -term antibiotics in patients with bronchiectasis who experience three or more exacerbations per year (A). (see figure 2 and full guideline appendix 2 and 3)
In these patients, the following are recommended

P. aeruginosa colonised patients

Use inhaled colistin for patients with bronchiectasis and chronic P. aeruginosa infection. (B)
Consider inhaled gentamicin as a second line alternative to colistin for patients with bronchiectasis and chronic P. aeruginosa infection. (B)
Consider azithromycin or erythromycin as an alternative (eg if a patient does not tolerate inhaled antibiotics) to an inhaled antibiotic for patients with bronchiectasis and chronic P. aeruginosa infection. (B)
Consider azithromycin or erythromycin as an additive treatment to an inhaled antibiotic for patients with bronchiectasis and chronic P. aeruginosa infection who have a high exacerbation frequency. (D)

### The gut microbiota and host health: a new clinical frontier [^111DFWwW]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis

In terms of probiotic research, one of the largest clinical trials in IBD was the use of E. coli Nissle 1917 in the setting of remission maintenance in UC. Patients (n = 327) were assigned to a double-blind, double-dummy trial to receive either the probiotic or mesalazine. Both treatments were deemed equivalent with regards to relapse. E. coli Nissle is now considered an effective alternative to 5-aminosalicylate for remission maintenance in UC. There are two published clinical trials of the multistrain probiotic VSL#3 in the setting of mild to moderate flares of UC. Both demonstrate that high doses improve disease activity scores but whether such improvements in scores are clinically meaningful for patients, particularly compared with other treatment options, remains to be clarified. An alternative approach is transplantation of the whole gut microbiota from a healthy donor: FMT. In IBD, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis has shown that of nine cohort studies, eight case studies and one randomised controlled trial, overall 45% (54/119) achieved clinical remission. When only cohort studies were analysed 36% achieved clinical remission. Since that meta-analysis, two randomised controlled trials in UC show discrepant results. One trial, in which two faecal transplants were given via the upper GI route, showed no difference in clinical or endoscopic remission between the faecal transplant group and the control group (given autologous stool). A second trial, in which patients with UC were randomised to weekly faecal enemas from healthy donors or placebo enemas for 6 weeks, demonstrated remission in a greater percentage of patients given FMT compared with the control group (given water enema). There are unanswered questions regarding mode of delivery, frequency of delivery and optimal donor/host characteristics.

Crohn's disease

Antibiotics demonstrate efficacy in particular groups of patients with CD but some antibiotics may be detrimental, showing a complex interplay between host and microbiota. Patients who have had a resection for CD have a decreased rate of endoscopic and clinical recurrence when metronidazole or ornidazole are used as prophylactic therapies. Several studies have assessed the specific role of antimycobacterial therapies in CD treatment but overall results are disappointing. There is no clinically relevant evidence base for the use of probiotics in CD and in terms of prebiotics, although an open label trial of fructo-oligosaccharide in CD showed promise, and a subsequent randomised placebo-controlled trial of fructo-oligosaccharide did not support any clinical benefit.

### The use of long-term antibiotics for suppression of bacterial infections [^112x2xqo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Suppressive antibiotic therapy is prescribed when a patient has an infection that is presumed to be incurable by a defined course of therapy or source control. The cohort receiving suppressive antibiotic therapy is typically highly comorbid and the infections often involve retained prosthetic material. In part due to a lack of clear guidelines regarding the use of suppressive antibiotics, and in part due to the complex nature of the infections in question, patients are often prescribed suppressive antibiotics for extremely long, if not indefinite, courses. The risks of prolonged antibiotic exposure in this context are not fully characterized, but they include adverse drug effects ranging from mild to severe, the development of antibiotic-resistant organisms, and perturbations of the gastrointestinal microbiome. In this narrative review we present the available evidence for the use of suppressive antibiotic therapy in 4 common indications, examine the gaps in the current literature, and explore the known and potential risks of this therapy. We also make suggestions for improving the quality of evidence in future studies, particularly by highlighting the need for a standardized term to describe the use of long courses of antibiotics to suppress hard-to-treat infections.

### Probiotics for the prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in adults and children [^116K5n6y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics can disturb gastrointestinal microbiota which may lead to reduced resistance to pathogens such as Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). Probiotics are live microbial preparations that, when administered in adequate amounts, may confer a health benefit to the host, and are a potential C. difficile prevention strategy. Recent clinical practice guidelines do not recommend probiotic prophylaxis, even though probiotics have the highest quality evidence among cited prophylactic therapies.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics for preventing C.difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register from inception to 21 March 2017. Additionally, we conducted an extensive grey literature search.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled (placebo, alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment control) trials investigating probiotics (any strain, any dose) for prevention of CDAD, or C. difficile infection were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (independently and in duplicate) extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcome was the incidence of CDAD. Secondary outcomes included detection of C. difficile infection in stool, adverse events, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and length of hospital stay. Dichotomous outcomes (e.g. incidence of CDAD) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where appropriate. Continuous outcomes (e.g. length of hospital stay) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the mean difference and corresponding 95% CI. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of missing data on efficacy and safety outcomes. For the sensitivity analyses, we assumed that the event rate for those participants in the control group who had missing data was the same as the event rate for those participants in the control group who were successfully followed. For the probiotic group, we calculated effects using the following assumed ratios of event rates in those with missing data in comparison to those successfully followed: 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 5:1. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analyses were conducted on probiotic species, dose, adult versus pediatric population, and risk of bias as well as a post hoc subgroup analysis on baseline risk of CDAD (low 0% to 2%; moderate 3% to 5%; high > 5%). The overall quality of the evidence supporting each outcome was independently assessed using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Thirty-nine studies (9955 participants) met the eligibility requirements for our review. Overall, 27 studies were rated as either high or unclear risk of bias. A complete case analysis (i.e. participants who completed the study) among trials investigating CDAD (31 trials, 8672 participants) suggests that probiotics reduce the risk of CDAD by 60%. The incidence of CDAD was 1.5% (70/4525) in the probiotic group compared to 4.0% (164/4147) in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.52; GRADE = moderate). Twenty-two of 31 trials had missing CDAD data ranging from 2% to 45%. Our complete case CDAD results proved robust to sensitivity analyses of plausible and worst-plausible assumptions regarding missing outcome data and results were similar whether considering subgroups of trials in adults versus children, inpatients versus outpatients, different probiotic species, lower versus higher doses of probiotics, or studies at high versus low risk of bias. However, in a post hoc analysis, we did observe a subgroup effect with respect to baseline risk of developing CDAD. Trials with a baseline CDAD risk of 0% to 2% and 3% to 5% did not show any difference in risk but trials enrolling participants with a baseline risk of > 5% for developing CDAD demonstrated a large 70% risk reduction (interaction P value = 0.01). Among studies with a baseline risk > 5%, the incidence of CDAD in the probiotic group was 3.1% (43/1370) compared to 11.6% (126/1084) in the control group (13 trials, 2454 participants; RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.42; GRADE = moderate). With respect to detection of C. difficile in the stool pooled complete case results from 15 trials (1214 participants) did not show a reduction in infection rates. C. difficile infection was 15.5% (98/633) in the probiotics group compared to 17.0% (99/581) in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.10; GRADE = moderate). Adverse events were assessed in 32 studies (8305 participants) and our pooled complete case analysis indicates probiotics reduce the risk of adverse events by 17% (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97; GRADE = very low). In both treatment and control groups the most common adverse events included abdominal cramping, nausea, fever, soft stools, flatulence, and taste disturbance.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of 31 randomized controlled trials including 8672 patients, moderate certainty evidence suggests that probiotics are effective for preventing CDAD (NNTB = 42 patients, 95% CI 32 to 58). Our post hoc subgroup analyses to explore heterogeneity indicated that probiotics are effective among trials with a CDAD baseline risk > 5% (NNTB = 12; moderate certainty evidence), but not among trials with a baseline risk ≤ 5% (low to moderate certainty evidence). Although adverse effects were reported among 32 included trials, there were more adverse events among patients in the control groups. The short-term use of probiotics appears to be safe and effective when used along with antibiotics in patients who are not immunocompromised or severely debilitated. Despite the need for further research, hospitalized patients, particularly those at high risk of CDAD, should be informed of the potential benefits and harms of probiotics.

### Hellenic consensus oninfection [^115v3JmP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Statement 29: Only certain probiotic strains, including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Saccharomyces boulardii, may be potentially useful in reducing gastrointestinal side effects (mainly diarrhea), associated with H. pylori eradication therapies.

Recommendation grade: A; Evidence level: 1a; Agreement level: 88.9%

The most commonly studied probiotic species are the Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Saccharomyces genera. Concerning the use of probiotics as a single therapy in H. pylori treatment, limited studies suggest that specific probiotics, such as Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacillus johnsonni La1, probably diminish the bacterial load, but do not completely eradicate the H. pylori infection. A recent meta-analysis of RCTs, involving 4,515 patients, showed that the addition of probiotics to triple therapies significantly increased H. pylori eradication rates by 12.2% and 14.1%, respectively. Yet, other recent meta-analyses have been shown similarly good results by using probiotics as adjunctive to triple regimens. On the contrary, another meta-analysis of 21 RCTs showed that a standard triple regimen plus probiotics may reduce the frequency of adverse events compared to the same triple regimen with or without placebo, but does not increase the eradication rate. Moreover, when probiotics were added to quadruple eradication regimens, no additional benefit in H. pylori eradication rates was demonstrated, but only a reduction in the rate of adverse events. More specifically, probiotics were shown to significantly decrease side effects such as nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, and mainly diarrhea. One study analyzed the microbiome of patients receiving eradication treatment with or without the addition of probiotics and found a greater proportional shift in functional gene families in the group that received antibiotics only. However, the beneficial effects of probiotics seem to be strain-, dose- and duration-specific, which could result in misleading conclusions. Consequently, more data are definitely needed to assess the direct efficacy of probiotics against H. pylori.

### Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^1122hdit]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The type of antibiotic was reported as the strongest predictor for AAD. Although ampicillin/amoxicillin, cephalosporins, and clindamycin used alone were most frequently associated with AAD, other antibiotics, when used in combination, also increased the risk of AAD. Unfortunately, many RCTs did not register specific antibiotics, which prevented us from performing subgroup analysis.

We extracted the data related to adverse events from 15 studies and thus calculated the pooled RR of 1.00 with no statistical significance (95% CI, 0.87–1.14; P = 0.97). A comprehensive systematic review on probiotics safety based on 622 studies displayed a pooled RR of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.93–1.07; P = 0.999), which was close to our finding. These pieces of evidence were sufficient to show that short-term use of probiotics would not bring about serious side effects on a population without severe systemic disease or immunodeficiency. However, specific patients, including critical illness, using a central venous catheter, immunosuppression, should be sensitive to the adverse effects. Some case reports and clinical studies have reported probiotics-related adverse events involving systemic infections, gastrointestinal side effects, deleterious metabolic activities, and gene transfer. In short, probiotics are safe to use in preventing AAD.

There were some limitations. First, some heterogeneity was observed in our results. Both the subgroup analyses and sensitivity analysis failed to explain the source of heterogeneity. Second, some included studies failed to mention all specific characteristics. Thus, several subgroup analyses could not enroll all the 36 RCTs.

Nevertheless, our research also had some advantages. We adopted rigorous inclusion criteria to collect more representative data. During the citations identified, we excluded 2 publications with unknown probiotics composition. To avoid interference with baseline conditions, RCTs that included existing diarrhea or containing laxative-related diarrhea were also excluded. In addition, we conducted subgroup analyses as comprehensive as possible, and the trend of probiotics in some specific situations had been explored.

Our study suggests that using probiotics within 2 days during antibiotic treatment significantly reduces the incidence of AAD in adults and is safe. Besides, the existing evidence showed that S. boulardii supplementation or Lactobacillus supplementation in H. pylori eradication therapy significantly increased the eradication rate and reduced the incidence of diarrhea. But the role of other probiotics in H. pylori eradication had not yet been fully clarified. Of course, to match the population included in this meta-analysis, these findings are restricted to adults without immunodeficiency and the history of intensive care unit.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the role of probiotics in the management of gastrointestinal disorders [^111aeim9]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) prevention during antibiotic treatment — AGA suggestion and evidence: In adults and children on antibiotic treatment, the AGA states "we suggest the use of S boulardii; or the 2-strain combination of L acidophilus CL1285 and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R;… over no or other probiotics for prevention of C difficile infection", with "Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence". Evidence included 39 trials with 9955 patients and a pooled reduction vs placebo (RR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.30–0.52), with overall certainty "downgraded from Moderate to Low"; subgroup benefits were reported for S boulardii (RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.22–0.79), L acidophilus CL1285 plus L casei LBC80R (RR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.11–0.42), a 3-strain combination (RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15–0.85), and a 4-strain combination (RR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11–0.67), and effects were seen mainly in those "with very high risk… (> 15% baseline risk)", while some patients "may choose not to use any probiotics".

### Intestinal dysbiosis and probiotic use: its place in hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^1121sgAd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

HE is a serious and common complication of liver disease. Current treatment strategies, including lactulose and poorly absorbable antibiotics, may not be the most appropriate treatment for all patients with liver disease in view of their side effects and cost. Therefore, probiotics are seen as an alternative treatment for HE. The use of probiotics is associated with significant improvement, especially in MHE. Since probiotics are a suitable, safe, natural and well-tolerated treatment option for long-term use, probiotic therapy is considered to be ideal for HE. However, although it has been shown that probiotics can be an effective treatment in HE, more clinical studies are needed to better define factors such as the type and amount of strain to be administered and the duration of intervention. We believe that this would allow for more accurate recommendations to be made.

### Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^115yu6Mi]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is defined as diarrhea developing from the beginning of antibiotic treatment to 6 to 8 weeks after discontinuation, which may contribute to antimicrobial prescription noncompliance and the overconsumption of second-line antibiotics. The prevalence of AAD varies between 5% and 39% in adults. It largely depends on the antibacterial spectrum and pharmacokinetic characteristics including the absorption rate of oral administration and enterohepatic circulation of parenteral administration. The pathogenesis of AAD includes the following 2 aspects: (1) the direct effect of antibacterial agents on the intestinal mucosa; (2) the interference of antibacterial agents on the intestinal flora ecosystem, which leads to normal metabolic dysfunction and overgrowth of pathogens (especially Clostridioides difficile).

As a live microorganism, probiotic with adequate amounts can bring health benefits to the host. The mechanisms by which probiotics work on AAD may associate with the following: (1) altering the gut microbiota composition and metabolism; (2) modulating the solute secretion and absorption; and (3) improving the intestinal barrier function and intestinal immune responses. Although several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have shown its efficacy in preventing AAD, there are currently no clear clinical practice guidelines for probiotics use in preventing AAD. A review comparing the effectiveness of multiple probiotics suggested that positive or negative generalization about probiotics was inadequate. Strain specificity, the designated patient population, and various treatment conditions would change the effect of probiotics. Therefore, our meta-analysis aims to combine the latest research evidence and compare the effects of probiotic products under different conditions through the most comprehensive subgroup analyses.

We also explored the dose effect of probiotics in our meta-analysis. Our results showed that high-dose probiotics (≥ 10¹⁰ CFU/d) were statistically less effective than low-dose probiotics (P = 0.05 < 0.10). However, a previous meta-analysis conducted by Johnston et al (involving adults and children) demonstrated that higher dosage (> 10¹⁰ CFU/d) had a more effective trend than lower dosage but not significantly (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.23–0.49 vs. RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.08–4.60; P = 0.57 > 0.10). This may be because we excluded children and the difference in sample size between subgroups. Hence, more RCTs on dose-response were needed to determine whether probiotics in higher doses were more effective and safe.

Our results are almost consistent with the previous meta-analysis in terms of the duration and starting time of probiotics. It is beneficial to use probiotics as early as possible to maintain the gut flora's stability and prevent the overgrowth of pathogens. Concerning the optimal duration of probiotics, we suggested that probiotics use during antibiotic therapy can effectively prevent AAD. However, whether it is necessary to prolong the use of probiotics after the end of antibiotic treatment still needs more clinical evidence and theoretical support.

Twelve studies applied Lactobacillus as intervention indicated a more protective trend among all the probiotics species (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.50–0.91). Among them, L. rhamnosus GG (LGG) is the most studied. A meta-analysis proposed that LGG significantly reduced the risk of diarrhea (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29–0.83). This effect may be related to the colonization of LGG in the intestine. It not only enhances the survival rate of the intestinal epithelium survival and preserves cytoskeletal integrity, but also secretes lectin-like proteins 1 and 2 to resist biofilms produced by various pathogens. Unfortunately, because of the insufficient sample size, some probiotics strains cannot be analyzed separately. In addition, we did not find significant differences in the efficacy of single species and multiple species (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.44–0.93 vs. RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.49–0.76; P = 0.86 > 0.1).

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of pouchitis and inflammatory pouch disorders [^1119KPDC]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Primary prevention of pouchitis with probiotics after IPAA for ulcerative colitis — The AGA makes no recommendation in favor of, or against, the use of probiotics for primary prevention of pouchitis (No recommendation, knowledge gap). Evidence identified 4 RCTs, with 1 RCT contributing no events, and meta-analysis showed the RR for development of pouchitis among patients receiving probiotics for prevention compared with placebo was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.05–0.62); the overall body of evidence was rated as very low certainty with very serious imprecision due to very low event rate, < 35, and strong concern for publication bias. In current practice, most patients undergoing IPAA for UC do not use a primary preventive strategy and most who develop pouchitis respond well (and rapidly) to an initial course of antibiotics, so the potential downside of not using prevention may be offset by the benefit of not taking a daily preventive therapy.

### Microbiota modulation-based therapy for luminal GI disorders: current applications of probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation [^114n1H5W]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Alteration in the intestinal microbiota also termed as intestinal dysbiosis has been demonstrated in numerous gastrointestinal disorders linked to aberrant immune processes, acquisition of pathogenic organisms and often administration of antibiotics. Restoration of microbiota through probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has gained tremendous popularity among researchers in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. Areas covered: In this review, studies testing the safety and efficacy of probiotics and FMT for the treatment of various infectious and inflammatory luminal gastrointestinal diseases are reviewed. Randomized control studies are given priority while important uncontrolled studies are also highlighted. Expert opinion: Probiotics have demonstrated efficacy in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection. Their utility in the primary and secondary prevention of Clostridioides difficile infection is debatable. The future of medicine should bring forth a personalized approach to probiotic use. FMT has revolutionized the treatment of recurrent CDI as well as severe and fulminant CDI. At the same time, it has galvanized gut microbiota research in the last decade. While FMT in ulcerative colitis appears promising, further studies on the durability and long-term safety are needed before it can be recommended in clinical practice.

Probiotics for prevention of Clostridioides difficile infection — In the PLACIDE randomized trial of elderly inpatients, participants were randomized to a multistrain probiotic (n = 1,493) or placebo (n = 1,488) for 21 days, and either antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) or CDI occurred in 159 (10.8%) vs 153 (10.4%); relative risk [RR] 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84–1.28; P = 0.71, with CDI occurring in 12 (0.8%) vs 17 (1.2%). A 2017 Cochrane review analyzed 31 studies enrolling 8,672 participants, noted most studies (n = 27) had high or unclear risk of bias, and concluded a modest benefit with number needed to benefit = 42, with benefits only in trials with baseline CDI risk > 5% and results heavily influenced by 5 studies with baseline risk > 15%. For a lactobacilli combination (Bio-K +), of 3 RCTs only one showed efficacy in a Chinese study where the background CDI incidence was nearly 24%. More recently, a meta-analysis of 19 RCTs suggested that probiotics reduce CDI risk when started closer to antibiotics, with a 70% lower risk if started within 2 days.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of pouchitis and inflammatory pouch disorders [^113MSgrB]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Pouchitis is the most common complication after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. This American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline is intended to support practitioners in the management of pouchitis and inflammatory pouch disorders.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of content experts and guideline methodologists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework to prioritize clinical questions, identify patient-centered outcomes, conduct an evidence synthesis, and develop recommendations for the prevention and treatment of pouchitis, Crohn's-like disease of the pouch, and cuffitis.

Results

The AGA guideline panel made 9 conditional recommendations. In patients with ulcerative colitis who have undergone ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and experience intermittent symptoms of pouchitis, the AGA suggests using antibiotics for the treatment of pouchitis. In patients who experience recurrent episodes of pouchitis that respond to antibiotics, the AGA suggests using probiotics for the prevention of recurrent pouchitis. In patients who experience recurrent pouchitis that responds to antibiotics but relapses shortly after stopping antibiotics (also known as "chronic antibiotic-dependent pouchitis"), the AGA suggests using chronic antibiotic therapy to prevent recurrent pouchitis; however, in patients who are intolerant to antibiotics or who are concerned about the risks of long-term antibiotic therapy, the AGA suggests using advanced immunosuppressive therapies (eg, biologics and/or oral small molecule drugs) approved for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. In patients who experience recurrent pouchitis with inadequate response to antibiotics (also known as "chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis"), the AGA suggests using advanced immunosuppressive therapies; corticosteroids can also be considered in these patients. In patients who develop symptoms due to Crohn's-like disease of the pouch, the AGA suggests using corticosteroids and advanced immunosuppressive therapies. In patients who experience symptoms due to cuffitis, the AGA suggests using therapies that have been approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, starting with topical mesalamine or topical corticosteroids. The panel also proposed key implementation considerations for optimal management of pouchitis and Crohn's-like disease of the pouch and identified several knowledge gaps and areas for future research.

Conclusions

This guideline provides a comprehensive, patient-centered approach to the management of patients with pouchitis and other inflammatory conditions of the pouch.

### Prevention of Clostridium difficile infection with probiotics [^111wFWGQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and prevention efforts to reduce the spread of C. difficile, CDI remains a significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. Further advances in prevention of CDI may need to focus on those who continue to be exposed to the organism and who are susceptible. Interventions directed toward this susceptible population, particularly hospitalized patients who receive antibiotics, may be effective. There is moderate evidence on the effectiveness of probiotics to prevent primary CDI, but there are few data to support use in secondary prevention of recurrent CDI. This review discusses the literature available on the use of probiotics to prevent primary and secondary CDI.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^1147NrFS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Probiotics and Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy — recommendation and evidence: Recommendation 12 states, "There is insufficient evidence to suggest that the use of probiotic therapy improves the efficacy or tolerability of H. pylori eradication therapy (conditional recommendation; low quality of evidence)". A network meta-analysis included data from 40 studies and 8,924 patients and observed a modest benefit for eradication (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01–1.19) and lower total side effects (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.39–0.56), but there was significant heterogeneity across regimens and formulations, and to date no high-quality RCTs have been reported from North America. The analysis also noted that probiotic duration greater than 2 weeks and combining probiotics with BQT were associated with higher eradication rates compared with shorter durations and non-BQT combinations.

Clostridioides difficile infection — Adjunctive agents for recurrent or refractory disease are summarized as follows: Adjunctive agents including other antimicrobials, binding agents, and probiotics may be considered in addition to standard treatment in cases of recurrent or refractory CDI, with Grade of recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C. Rifaximin may be used to treat recurrent CDI and has a moderate success rate (53%–67%) in this setting, and because of the propensity of C difficile to develop resistance to rifaximin, this drug should typically be used in combination with other recommended agents. For refractory CDI, tigecycline can be used with dosing of 100 mg IV loading dose followed by 50 mg every 12 hours for 5–24 days, and in a pooled analysis of 47 cases of refractory CDI treated with standard antibiotics together with adjunctive tigecycline, 7 patients (15%) died and 35 (77%) were cured. Toxin-binding agents such as cholestyramine and colestipol are also used as adjuncts for recurrent CDI with variable success, and because binding agents can also bind oral vancomycin (based on in vitro studies), the administration of these medications should be staggered by a few hours; data regarding tolevamer show it is inferior to vancomycin and metronidazole for treating CDI, with unknown adjunctive efficacy. Finally, administering antimotility agents to patients with CDI has historically been discouraged, but prospective data regarding this practice is not available; probiotics may be useful in treating recurrent or refractory disease, but the efficacy under these circumstances remains unclear, and when used with appropriate medical therapy one small randomized trial reported decreased recurrence (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35–0.98) whereas 3 other randomized controlled trials did not demonstrate a benefit.

### Clostridium butyricum bacteremia associated with probiotic use, Japan [^111T6EH1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Our findings also bring to light the potential adverse effects related to the inappropriate prescribing of probiotics. In all cases where MIYA-BM was prescribed, probiotics were administered for > 1 week. However, after a comprehensive review of the detailed medical records, we were unable to identify the appropriate reasons for prescribing probiotics in half of the cases. Probiotics exhibit various therapeutic and preventive effects in different medical conditions, such as averting antibiotic-associated diarrhea and CDI, preventing hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver cirrhosis, and managing symptoms in patients with ulcerative colitis. Although probiotics may demonstrate effectiveness in such specialized clinical scenarios, those scenarios were not observed in the cases we studied, in which probiotics appeared to have been prescribed indiscriminately over an extended period.

One limitation of our study was that it was a single-center, retrospective investigation. Multicenter studies are needed to elucidate the prevalence of C. butyricum bacteremia and the genetic origin of the strains. Another limitation was that patient 1 showed improvement with ceftriaxone use, although C. butyricum is resistant to it. There is a possibility of contamination resulting from such factors as polymicrobial bacteremia and the absence of central venous catheterization. However, it cannot be ruled out that patients with concurrent sacral pressure ulcers are at risk of developing polymicrobial bacteremia, including C. butyricum bacteremia. Also, the duration of probiotic use for each case patient was based on information documented in their medical records, and the precise prescription durations were not always clear. However, the actual prescription periods must exceed the durations documented in the medical records, because the recorded periods represent at least the minimum assessable timeframe. Moreover, although specific reasons for probiotic prescription were not evident in the medical records, unique justifications may have existed. Nevertheless, it is crucial to note that none of the patients had a history of prior antibiotic use, CDI, irritable bowel syndrome, or liver cirrhosis. Hence, the need for prolonged administration exceeding 2 weeks for therapeutic purposes seems unlikely.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that all clinical strains of C. butyricum identified in the positive blood cultures of the 5 cases we analyzed were derived from the strain found in probiotics. Although this type of bacteremia is rare, careful monitoring is essential when bacteremia is caused by probiotics. Clinicians must avoid long-term, inappropriate prescription of probiotics for hospitalized patients with multiple comorbidities, including immunosuppressive treatment and intraabdominal problems, to prevent bacteremia caused by probiotics.

Infectious diarrhoea

Enteric and diarrhoeal diseases are leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children under the age of 5 worldwide, with low- and middle-income countries bearing the brunt of this burden. Repeated infections lead to acute and chronic undernutrition, resulting in more frequent and more severe infections; eventually this leads to developmental deficits in growth, fitness and cognition, which persist into adulthood with devastating human and economic consequences globally. – A better understanding of the intestinal microbiota and of potential action mechanisms of probiotics has led to studies evaluating their efficacy in acute infectious gastroenteritisand in the setting of persistent diarrhoea. Such approaches have the potential to help reduce the global burden of childhood disease. Treatment of acute diarrhoea with probiotics appears to reduce diarrhoea duration by about 1 day (predominantly in developed areas; 22 studies carried out in developing areas were more variable). In persistent diarrhoea in developing areas, an approximate 4-day reduction in the duration of persistent diarrhoea, coupled with improved growth parameters, has been noted.

Several studies with probiotics, including Saccharomyces boulardi, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and other strains report reductions in nosocomial diarrhoea rates, as well as reductions in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and recurrences of Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhoea. These effects include a 40–60% reduction in the frequency of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, but studies documenting a reduction in C difficile -associated diarrhoea are far fewer and remain the subject of controversy. – Indeed, Floch et al considered evidence insufficient for an 'A' recommendation for this indication.

Nosocomial infections remain a major healthcare concern, with estimated yearly direct medical costs in the United States of US $28–45 billion, pointing to the need for a preventive approach. However, the results of studies evaluating the preventive effect of probiotics on nosocomial infections have been mixed. Some show benefit, whereas others do not. – Three RCTs (including 1043 children) tested L rhamnosus GG supplementation and showed significantly reduced rates of nosocomial rotavirus diarrhoea. – Supplementing infant formula with B bifidum and Streptococcus thermophilus reduced the frequency of episodes of acute infectious diarrhoea. L rhamnosus GG was effective in reducing nosocomial gastrointestinal and respiratory tract illnesses in over 2000 immunocompetent children ≥ 1 year of age without underlying illnesses who were suddenly hospitalised for reasons unrelated to gastrointestinal or respiratory tract problems. Although probiotics show promise in reducing nosocomial infections among some populations, they are not recommended for critically ill hospitalised patients at this time.

Pediatric VAP/VAE prevention — approaches generally not recommended: The following interventions have unknown impact on VAP and VAE rates and/or have inadequate data on risks. Prolonged systemic antibiotics for ventilator-associated tracheitis (Quality of Evidence: LOW) did not protect against VAP but did increase the prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms, and whether, when, and how long to treat ventilator-associated tracheitis to prevent VAP in children remains unresolved. Selective oropharyngeal or digestive decontamination (Quality of Evidence: LOW) may be associated with a decrease in pneumonia rates but no change in mortality, with small trials and unassessed long-term impact on antibiotic resistance. Prophylactic probiotics (Quality of Evidence: LOW) should be considered with caution due to sparse data on impact in children, lack of clear benefit in adults, and case reports of Lactobacillus bacteremia in pediatric patients, including those not known to be immunocompromised.

### Probiotics for the prevention of Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea in adults and children [^115GtW5G]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Antibiotics can disturb gastrointestinal microbiota, which may lead to reduced resistance to pathogens such as Clostridioides difficile. Probiotics are live microbial preparations that, when administered in adequate amounts, may confer a health benefit to the host, and are a potential C difficile infection prevention strategy.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of probiotics for preventing C difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) in adults and children receiving an antibiotic for any reason.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid Embase from 18 March 2017 (search date of the previous version of the review) to 3 March 2025.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials with a placebo, alternative prophylaxis, or no-treatment control investigating probiotics (any strain or dose) for the prevention of CDAD in adults and children receiving an antibiotic for any reason.

Outcomes

The critical outcome was incidence of CDAD. Important outcomes included detection of C difficile in stool (i.e. colonization in absence of symptoms), adverse events, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), and length of hospital stay.

Risk Of Bias

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool.

Synthesis Methods

We pooled dichotomous outcomes (e.g. incidence of CDAD) using a random-effects complete-case model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and absolute risk reduction (ARR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We pooled continuous outcomes (e.g. length of hospital stay) using a random-effects model to calculate the mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% CI. We conducted sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of missing outcome data on benefits and harms outcomes. To investigate heterogeneity, we conducted a priori subgroup analyses on risk of bias, probiotic dose, probiotic species, adults versus children, inpatients versus outpatients, and the event rate in the control group for developing CDAD (low 0% to 2%; moderate 3% to 5%; high > 5%). The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was independently assessed using the GRADE approach.

Included Studies

Eight new studies (n = 4595) met our inclusion criteria, for a total of 47 included studies (n = 15,260). Although we noted a high risk of bias in individual studies for sequence generation or allocation concealment, this did not impact our findings. Around 30% of studies lacked a published protocol or clinical trial registration, and in some cases there were inconsistencies between the reported methods and published results. We noted authors' affiliation with a probiotic company and financial support received from probiotic companies in 28 studies.

Synthesis Of Results

Evidence from 38 trials (13,179 participants) suggests that probiotics may result in a small absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.6% (incidence of 1.6% [110/6787] in the probiotic group versus 3.2% [203/6392] in the control group), and a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 50% (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.64; P < 0.001; low-certainty evidence) in incidence of CDAD. Twenty-seven of 38 trials had missing CDAD data, ranging from 2% to 45%. Our complete-case CDAD results proved robust to sensitivity analyses of plausible and worst-plausible assumptions regarding missing outcome data. Pooled results from 16 trials (1302 participants) suggest that probiotics may result in a small absolute reduction in C difficile in stool (i.e. colonization in absence of symptoms) (ARR 2.1%; incidence of 14.9% [101/677] in the probiotic group versus 16.2% [101/625] in the control group; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.11; P = 0.27; low-certainty evidence). Thirty-seven studies (11,911 participants) reported on adverse events. Our pooled analysis indicates that probiotics probably result in a small ARR of 1.7% (incidence of 10.9% [669/6148] in the probiotic group versus 12.2% [701/5763] in the control group), and an RRR of 14.0% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.01; P = 0.074; moderate-certainty evidence). The most common adverse events in both the treatment and control groups were abdominal cramping, nausea, fever, soft stools, flatulence, and taste disturbance. Pooled results from 40 studies (13,419 participants) suggest that probiotics may result in a large ARR of 9% (incidence of 23% [1592/6901] in the probiotic group versus 27.4% [1787/6518] in the control group), and an RRR of 33% (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.78; P < 0.001; low-certainty evidence) in incidence of AAD. Only seven trials (6553 participants) investigated length of hospital stay. There is likely little to no difference in length of hospital stay between treatment and control groups (MD -0.07, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.21; P = 0.63; moderate-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for CDAD and AAD due to the low number of events or publication bias. We observed some variability in CDAD control group event rate (< 2% to > 5%) that may impact the applicability of evidence depending on clinical setting. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for adverse events due to variation between the results of the studies and for hospital stay due to selective reporting.

Authors' Conclusions

The currently available evidence suggests that probiotics may be effective for preventing CDAD, suggesting that for every 65 people taking probiotics, one case of CDAD may be prevented (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 65, 95% CI 48 to 97). There are probably fewer adverse events in the probiotic group. The short-term use of probiotics may have a small absolute benefit, and is likely not associated with adverse effects when used in patient populations receiving systemic antibiotics who are not immunocompromised. Large trials comparing probiotics with placebo in people with a low baseline risk of CDAD are needed.

Funding

There was no source of funding for this update.

Registration

The original review was done in 2013 by Johnston and colleagues, for which the protocol was developed. We followed the methods specified in the 2017 review, while modifying the search strategy and risk of bias assessment for selective reporting for this update.

### A commentary on the safety of probiotics [^112UbW8J]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Probiotics have a long record of safety, which relates primarily to lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Experience with other forms of probiotic is more limited. There is no such thing as zero risk, particularly in the context of certain forms of host susceptibility. There is poor public understanding of the concept of risk, in general, and risk/benefit analysis, in particular. Uncertainty persists regarding the potential for transfer of antibiotic resistance with probiotics, but the risk seems to be low with currently available probiotic products. As with other forms of therapeutics, the safety of probiotics should be considered on a strain-by-strain basis.

Prevention of Disease

Exposure to antibiotics is the most important modifiable risk factor for development of CDI. Antibiotic stewardship programs that target reduction of inappropriate use in adults have proven helpful in reducing CDI rates, though comparable data in children are needed. Stewardship efforts are also needed in the outpatient setting, with at least 30% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions estimated to be unnecessary. Probiotics have been used as a preventative measure for C. difficile in an attempt to restore some of the microbial disruption caused by antibiotics, the benefit of which is still debated. A large systematic review reported the risk of CDI was lowered 60% with probiotics. Conversely, in a recent trial of hospitalized children who received antibiotics randomized to receive Lactobacillus reuteri (2 × 10⁸ CFU) or placebo twice daily for the duration of antibiotic treatment, no difference in prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea was found. The wide heterogeneity in formulations, dose, and optimal timing casts uncertainty on the generalizability of probiotics for CDI prevention. The 2017 IDSA and SHEA guidelines state there is insufficient evidence at this time to recommend use for primary prevention of CDIProbiotics are generally well tolerated, though caution with use in severely immunocompromised or debilitated patients is needed and the cost to families must also be factored if used.

Other novel preventative approaches aimed at promoting colonization resistance by binding concomitantly administered antibiotics, such as activated charcoal and the oral β-lactamase ribaxamase, are under exploration. Demonstration of protection against disease by antibodies to toxin supports ongoing efforts to develop a vaccine, but both toxin based and nontoxin based candidates are much further away from use in children.

### Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children [^112dVUZU]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

This article provides recommendations, developed by the Working Group (WG) on Probiotics of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, for the use of probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in children based on a systematic review of previously completed systematic reviews and of randomized controlled trials published subsequently to these reviews. The use of probiotics for the treatment of AAD is not covered. The recommendations were formulated only if at least 2 randomized controlled trials that used a given probiotic (with strain specification) were available. The quality of evidence (QoE) was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation guidelines. If the use of probiotics for preventing AAD is considered because of the existence of risk factors such as class of antibiotic(s), duration of antibiotic treatment, age, need for hospitalization, comorbidities, or previous episodes of AAD diarrhea, the WG recommends using Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (moderate QoE, strong recommendation) or Saccharomyces boulardii (moderate QoE, strong recommendation). If the use of probiotics for preventing Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea is considered, the WG suggests using S boulardii (low QoE, conditional recommendation). Other strains or combinations of strains have been tested, but sufficient evidence is still lacking.

### Probiotics [^112ijs5i]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Probiotics are microorganisms with potential health benefits. They may be used to prevent and treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea and acute infectious diarrhea. They may also be effective in relieving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and in treating atopic dermatitis in children. Species commonly used include Lactobacillus sp. Bifidobacterium sp. Streptococcus thermophilus, and Saccharomyces boulardii. Typical dosages vary based on the product, but common dosages range from 5 to 10 billion colony-forming units per day for children, and from 10 to 20 billion colony-forming units per day for adults. Significant adverse effects are rare, and there are no known interactions with medications.

### Effectiveness of bio-K + for the prevention ofinfection: stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial [^116az1PR]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of administering probiotics to prevent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) among patients receiving therapeutic antibiotics.

Design

Stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial between September 1, 2016, and August 31, 2019.

Setting

This study was conducted in 4 acute-care hospitals across an integrated health region.

Patients

Hospitalized patients, aged ≥ 55 years.

Methods

Patients were given 2 probiotic capsules daily (Bio-K+, Laval, Quebec, Canada), containing 50 billion colony-forming units of Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285, L. casei LBC80R, and L. rhamnosus CLR2. We measured hospital-acquired CDI (HA-CDI) and the number of positive C. difficile tests per 10,000 patient days as well as adherence to administration of Bio-K+ within 48 and 72 hours of antibiotic administration. Mixed-effects generalized linear models, adjusted for influenza admissions and facility characteristics, were used to evaluate the impact of the intervention on outcomes.

Results

Overall adherence of Bio-K+ administration ranged from 76.9% to 84.6% when stratified by facility and periods. Rates of adherence to administration within 48 and 72 hours of antibiotic treatment were 60.2% -71.4% and 66.7%-75.8%, respectively. In the adjusted analysis, there was no change in HA-CDI (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–1.23) or C. difficile positivity rate (IRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.89–1.24). Discharged patients may not have received a complete course of Bio-K+. Our hospitals had a low baseline incidence of HA-CDI. Patients who did not receive Bio-K+ may have differential risks of acquiring CDI, introducing selection bias.

Conclusions

Hospitals considering probiotics as a primary prevention strategy should consider the baseline incidence of HA-CDI in their population and timing of probiotics relative to the start of antimicrobial administration.

### Evidence-based guidelines for use of probiotics in preterm neonates [^114ihRXH]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the advances in neonatal intensive care over past 20 years, the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm neonates has not changed significantly. The mortality (approximately 20 to 25%) and morbidity related to definite (greater than stage II) NEC, including prolonged hospitalisation, survival with short-bowel syndrome and long-term neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) continues to be high, especially in preterm or extremely low birth weight (ELBW) (birth weight < 1000 g, gestation < 28 weeks) neonates needing surgery for this illness. Mortality reaches nearly 100% in children with extensive and full-thickness necrosis of the gut.

Antenatal use of glucocorticoids, with postnatally, preferential feeding with fresh human milk, aggressive prevention and treatment of sepsis, and a cautious uniform approach to enteral feeds are the strategies available to prevent NEC. Previous systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showed that probiotic supplementation significantly reduces the risk of definite NEC, all-cause mortality and the time to reach full enteral feeds (~120 to 150 ml/kg/day of milk) in preterm neonates. Based on these results, reports have indicated that routine probiotic supplementation is justified, except for ELBW neonates, given the lack of specific data on this high-risk cohort. Our most recent updated systematic review and meta-analysis confirmed previous results, while improving their precision and reducing the likelihood of these being due to chance alone (Table 1). Moreover, trial sequential analysis (TSA) indicated that the results gave conclusive evidence of at least 30% reduction in the incidence of NEC. These conclusive results, along with those from observational studies on routine use of probiotics, their use in ELBW neonates, and their safety and possible benefits in terms of long-term NDI, justify a change in practice if safe and suitable probiotic products are available. Some have supported our views, but others cite difficulties such as problems in pooling data in the presence of clinical heterogeneity, reproducibility of the results in different studies, role of breast milk, pitfalls of TSA, lack of availability of safe and effective products, development of antibiotic resistance, cross-contamination and long-term adverse effects (AEs) as reasons for opposing routine use of probiotics in preterm neonates. We have previously addressed these concerns, and pointed out that probiotic research has completed a full circle, from basic science and cohort studies, to conclusive meta-analysis, routine use, and long-term follow up. Many level III neonatal units in Japan, Italy, Finland and Columbia have been using probiotics routinely for over a decade, and have not reported any significant AEs. Based on the quality and totality of the evidence in the context of the related health burden and the lack of equally effective therapies, we believe that probiotics should be offered routinely to preterm neonates. Additionally, from the perspective of a preterm neonate or their family, there would need to be a good reason to ignore the evidence base for using probiotics to prevent NEC. Offering probiotics routinely, but still within a framework of research other than placebo-controlled trials, is the way forward to deal with the as yet unanswered questions. As the debate about the pros and cons of routine probiotic supplementation continues, many institutions are satisfied with the current evidence and wish to use probiotics routinely. Because of the lack of detail on many practical aspects of probiotic supplementation, clinician-friendly guidelines are urgently needed to optimise use of probiotics in preterm neonates.

### Probiotics for the prevention of pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea [^1149No1w]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics alter the microbial balance commonly resulting in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Probiotics may prevent AAD via providing gut barrier, restoration of the gut microflora, and other potential mechanisms of action.

Objectives

The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) used for the prevention of AAD in children.

Search Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and the Web of Science (inception to 28 May 2018) were searched along with registers including the ISRCTN and Clinicaltrials.gov. We also searched the NICE Evidence Services database as well as reference lists from relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (0 to 18 years) receiving antibiotics, that compare probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment and measure the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by two authors. Dichotomous data (incidence of AAD, adverse events) were combined using a pooled risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD), and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea) as mean difference (MD), along with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where appropriate. For studies reporting on microbiome characteristics using heterogeneous outcomes, we describe the results narratively. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE.

Main Results

Thirty-three studies (6352 participants) were included. Probiotics assessed included Bacillus spp. Bifidobacterium spp. Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacilli spp. Lactococcus spp. Leuconostoc cremoris, Saccharomyces spp., orStreptococcus spp., alone or in combination. The risk of bias was determined to be high in 20 studies and low in 13 studies. Complete case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 33 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo or no treatment control. After 5 days to 12 weeks of follow-up, the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (259/3232) compared to 19% (598/3120) in the control group (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.56; I² = 57%, 6352 participants; NNTB 9, 95% CI 7 to 13; moderate certainty evidence). Nineteen studies had loss to follow-up ranging from 1% to 46%. After making assumptions for those lost, the observed benefit was still statistically significant using an extreme plausible intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, wherein the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 12% (436/3551) compared to 19% (664/3468) in the control group (7019 participants; RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.77; P < 0.00001; I² = 70%). An a priori available case subgroup analysis exploring heterogeneity indicated that high dose (≥ 5 billion CFUs per day) is more effective than low probiotic dose (< 5 billion CFUs per day), interaction P value = 0.01. For the high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (162/2029) compared to 23% (462/2009) in the control group (4038 participants; RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.46; P = 0.06; moderate certainty evidence). For the low dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (97/1155) compared to 13% (133/1059) in the control group (2214 participants; RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.01; P = 0.02). Again, assumptions for loss to follow-up using an extreme plausible ITT analysis was statistically significant. For high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 13% (278/2218) compared to 23% (503/2207) in control group (4425 participants; RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.70; P < 0.00001; I² = 68%; moderate certainty evidence). None of the 24 trials (4415 participants) that reported on adverse events reported any serious adverse events attributable to probiotics. Adverse event rates were low. After 5 days to 4 weeks follow-up, 4% (86/2229) of probiotics participants had an adverse event compared to 6% (121/2186) of control participants (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; P < 0.00001; I² = 75%; low certainty evidence). Common adverse events included rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, and constipation. After 10 days to 12 weeks of follow-up, eight studies recorded data on our secondary outcome, the mean duration of diarrhea; with probiotics reducing diarrhea duration by almost one day (MD -0.91; 95% CI -1.38 to -0.44; P < 0.00001; low certainty evidence). One study reported on microbiome characteristics, reporting no difference in changes with concurrent antibiotic and probiotic use.

Authors' Conclusions

The overall evidence suggests a moderate protective effect of probiotics for preventing AAD (NNTB 9, 95% CI 7 to 13). Using five criteria to evaluate the credibility of the subgroup analysis on probiotic dose, the results indicate the subgroup effect based on high dose probiotics (≥ 5 billion CFUs per day) was credible. Based on high-dose probiotics, the NNTB to prevent one case of diarrhea is 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). The overall certainty of the evidence for the primary endpoint, incidence of AAD based on high dose probiotics was moderate due to the minor issues with risk of bias and inconsistency related to a diversity of probiotic agents used. Evidence also suggests that probiotics may moderately reduce the duration of diarrhea, a reduction by almost one day. The benefit of high dose probiotics (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus orSaccharomyces boulardii) needs to be confirmed by a large well-designed multi-centered randomized trial. It is premature to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy and safety of 'other' probiotic agents as an adjunct to antibiotics in children. Adverse event rates were low and no serious adverse events were attributable to probiotics. Although no serious adverse events were observed among inpatient and outpatient children, including small studies conducted in the intensive care unit and in the neonatal unit, observational studies not included in this review have reported serious adverse events in severely debilitated or immuno-compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter use and disorders associated with bacterial/fungal translocation.

Regarding specific circumstances for Clostridioides difficile infection, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, prophylactic probiotics, ESPGHAN 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering high doses (≥ 5 billion CFU/day) of Saccharomyces boulardii or Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG started simultaneously with antibiotic treatment to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in outpatients and hospitalized pediatric patients if the use of probiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea is considered because of the existence of risk factors, such as class of antibiotic, duration of antibiotic treatment, age, need for hospitalization, comorbidities, or previous episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

### Use of probiotics in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [^116TFRnk]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

The gut flora plays a fundamental role in maintaining normal intestinal function. A disturbance of this flora, or the host response to this flora, has been clearly demonstrated to play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This has led to attempts to modify the bacterial flora with "live non-pathogenic organisms that confer health benefits by improving the microbial balance", otherwise known as probiotics. Recent attention has focused on this potential strategy to treat or prevent IBD. The potential therapeutic benefit is enhanced by the natural and apparently safe approach that probiotics offer. Animal models of colitis have provided the proof of principle that probiotics can prevent and treat established intestinal inflammation. Controlled clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of probiotics in the maintenance of remission of pouchitis, prophylaxis of pouchitis after the formation of an ileoanal reservoir, maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, and treatment of Crohn's disease. However, large controlled trials are needed to definitively establish the place for probiotics in the treatment of IBD and resolve issues such as the dose, duration, frequency of treatment, and use of single or multiple strains. Research is focusing on establishing the mechanism of action, so that treatments with individually tailored properties are developed and innovative approaches are explored.

Implementation considerations for FMT in severe or fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) specify that cessation of other non–Clostridioides difficile antibiotics is essential when possible, FMT earlier in the course of severe or fulminant CDI is likely to be more successful than delaying treatment, response to antibiotics should be assessed at 48–72 hours, a single FMT is likely to be insufficient and multiple FMTs are generally needed, and most published reports also resume anti-CDI antibiotics or continue anti-CDI antibiotics when administering FMT.

### Probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea [^116rezgm]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2002). Low credibility.

Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is a common event. In some cases, it could represent a life-threatening event. Clostridium difficile colitis is a further distinct complication of antibiotic administration. Treatment options for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile colitis include supplementation with several types of probiotics, as overviewed in this paper. Three randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trials show a therapeutic effect of Saccharomyces boulardii in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. The efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus has also been ascertained in two double-blind controlled studies. Other studies focusing on Lactobacillus as a new preventive agent for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are not double-blind. Among these, a positive effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium longum and Enterococcus faecium SF68 has been reported. Effectiveness of probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea has, therefore, a consistent scientific rationale, however few studies have performed an assessment of bacterial recovery in stools, and this approach may be helpful in deciding a more rigorous dose standardisation.

### Probiotics in gastroenterology: how pro is the evidence in adults? [^1153Afra]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Probiotic usage has become popular with both medical practitioners and the community in general; patients commonly seek advice regarding what, if any, such preparation would be useful for their own diseases. Since such advice should be evidence-based, identified randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for a number of gastrointestinal conditions were reviewed; the data were organized by individual probiotic genera/species. Only trials in adults were considered. Most of the identified RCTs were small and low-quality, so any conclusions to be drawn will be limited at least by methodologic problems. Using the GRADE system to consider the reliability of the evidence generated from these RCTs, it did appear that the use of fecal microbial transplantation to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile infection is well justified. Given the methodologic issues, there was moderately good evidence for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea with Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, or Saccharomyces boulardii and for using Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, or Saccharomyces as adjunct therapy in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori. There were other conditions for which some supportive evidence was available. These conditions include VSL#3 for maintaining remissions in patients with pouchitis or treating active ulcerative colitis (UC), fecal microbial transplantation for treating active UC, Bifidobacterium for treating patients with UC in remission, Lactobacillus in patients with painful diverticulosis, a variety of probiotics (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, or VSL#3) in patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy, and providing synbiotics to patients postoperatively after liver transplantation. Unfortunately, other limitations in the evidence made it very likely that future research will have an effect on the estimated benefit; these interventions cannot yet be recommended for routine use.

RESULTS

Patient Characteristics

Electronic pharmacy records were identified for 13 922 adult inpatient visits at which antibiotics were prescribed, representing 4383 unique patients in the 12-month observation period and 6079 patients in the 18-month intervention period. Among those prescribed antibiotics, the proportions of patients aged ≥ 70 years were consistent during the observation (2142 patients) and intervention (2995 patients) periods (both 49%). There were significant changes to antibiotic prescribing practices. Quinolones were prescribed less frequently during the intervention than during the observation period (odds ratio [OR], 0.59, Table 1). The opposite trend was observed for third-generation cephalosporins (OR, 2.1). The number of antibiotics prescribed per visit was higher during the intervention (1.98 vs. 1.94; p = 0.009). There was a greater proportion of patients taking an antibiotic that historically poses a high risk for development of CDI during the intervention (OR, 1.2).

### The potential of probiotics to prevent Clostridium difficile infection [^115EaPrH]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Exposure to antibiotics is the major risk factor for Clostridium difficile diarrhea (CDD), suggesting that impairment of colonization resistance due to depletion of the gut flora is a significant underlying disease susceptibility factor. Many properties of probiotic organisms indicate that they may be able to replenish the depleted gut flora and restore colonization resistance. However, despite numerous clinical trials, the evidence base for probiotics in the prevention of CDD remains weak. A recent large trial of a multistrain, high-dose probiotic did not show clear evidence of efficacy. The role of probiotics in the prevention of CDD remains unclear.

### Probiotics for Clostridium difficile diarrhea: putting it into perspective [^116KmEG5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile diarrhea is an expensive, life-threatening infection associated with serious morbidity and mortality, even among previously healthy individuals. Relapses from the infection are common following standard antibiotic treatments, with 3–5% of patients who contract C. difficile diarrhea unable to discontinue vancomycin due to continual relapses. Such patients may have a focal immunodeficiency in which they fail to mount an immune response against C. difficile. For these individuals, antimicrobial therapies are unable to eradicate the microorganism because no antibiotics are capable of killing C. difficile spores. Although they are considered alternative medicine, probiotics have provided a safe and effective means of restoring gastrointestinal flora and alleviating diarrhea, particularly for individuals experiencing multiple relapses.

Guideline Statement 23 — long-term oral antibiotics: Long-term oral antibiotic administration should not be offered. Standard (Evidence Strength: Grade B). One RCT reported that an 18 week protocol of sequential antibiotic administration resulted in 20% of the treatment group reporting 50% or greater symptom improvement compared to 16% of the placebo group – a nonsignificant difference, with AEs typical of long-term antibiotic administration. Using less intensive protocols, two observational studies reported higher efficacy rates of 45% and 47%, but the Panel judged that antibiotic treatment is contraindicated in patients who have previously been administered antibiotics without efficacy and who present with a negative urine culture. This Standard is not intended to prevent antibiotic administration to antibiotic-naïve patients; it is focused on preventing repeated or chronic antibiotic administration to patients for whom no relief was obtained in an initial course, and it is also not intended to prevent prophylactic antibiotic administration (e.g., nightly for several months) to patients who present with recurrent UTIs and symptoms suggestive of IC/BPS between infections.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines update: diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^111E2R2F]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Celiac disease — probiotics and microbiome: Administration of probiotics might restore the putative dysbiosis documented in CD, and small trials report short-term effects in children and adults. In children, a pilot study of 40 children with CD administered a probiotic containing a combination of Bifidobacterium strains for 3 months resulted in a stool Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio that seemed more similar to controls after the intervention, and a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a Bifidobacterium probiotic in 33 children for 3 months found a marginally greater increase in height percentile without a difference in ongoing symptoms. In adults, a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 22 adults with elevated CD serologies who were still eating a gluten-containing diet and had not yet undergone duodenal biopsy evaluated probiotics, and in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 109 adults with CD a probiotic was superior to placebo for the primary end point of improvement in the irritable bowel syndrome severity scoring system although quality of life did not improve. Despite these promising pilot studies, there remain multiple uncertainties about the role of probiotics in the treatment of CD; the clinical significance of the symptom responses was measured in the short term and their durability is not certain, there is concern that some probiotics on the market contain detectable gluten despite being labeled gluten-free, and recovery from antibiotic-induced dysbiosis is actually delayed among individuals exposed to probiotics.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^114gomj3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Key concept statements for mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC) emphasize that patients with a number of prognostic factors associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or surgery should be treated with therapies for moderate-to-severe disease. Patients with mildly to moderately active UC should be reassessed to determine response to induction therapy within 8 weeks. There is not sufficient evidence for routine use of probiotics, prebiotics, or other alternative therapies as primary induction therapy for patients with mildly to moderately active UC, and there is not sufficient evidence of an optimal approach to fecal microbial transfer as a primary induction treatment. Patients with previously mildly to moderately active UC who have achieved remission should be treated with maintenance therapy with demonstrated efficacy in prevention of relapse, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of a probiotic as primary or adjunctive maintenance therapy.

Probiotics for acute infectious diarrhea in adults — evidence summary indicates broad trial activity with limited adult data and mixed products. A Cochrane review identified 63 randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials between 1966 and 2010 with 8,014 subjects, and only six trials were among adults. In pediatric studies, probiotics significantly reduced duration of diarrhea (mean difference 24.8 h; 95% confidence interval (CI): 15.9–33.6 h; n = 4,555, 35 trials) and stool frequency on day 2 (mean difference 0.80 stools; 95% CI, 0.5–1.1; n = 2,751, 20 trials). For adult studies, six randomized controlled trials used two different probiotics (five studies with Enterococcus LAB SF68 and one with Saccharomyces boulardii); these were conducted in varied countries and clinical settings with differing eligibility, regimens, and endpoints, and one combinable endpoint for Enterococcus LAB SF68 was diarrhea lasting greater than 4 days. No additional randomized controlled trials have subsequently been published.
