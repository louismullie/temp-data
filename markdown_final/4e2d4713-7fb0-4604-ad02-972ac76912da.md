MOA

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me about "MOA" with explicit step-by-step thinking and self-verification language. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "MOA" means in a biomedical context and ensure I anchor the definition to authoritative sources. Then, I should categorize mechanisms across pharmacology, therapeutics, and public health to make the concept clinically relevant. Next, I will extract concrete examples that illustrate different types of mechanisms and their implications for efficacy, safety, and combinations. After that, I need to analyze translational and regulatory challenges, including the in vitro–in vivo gap, class effects, and pharmacodynamic drug–drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize key principles and highlight uncertainties to reflect the current state of knowledge, verifying claims against the cited literature throughout.

> Let me first confirm the core definition so I don't drift into ambiguity: MOA (mechanism of action) refers to how a drug or substance produces its effect in the body, encompassing the specific molecular target, the pharmacodynamic consequence at that target, and the downstream physiological effects; importantly, knowing the MOA informs dose selection, safety, and patient selection, so I should keep those stakes in mind as I proceed.

> Next, I should review a representative taxonomy of mechanisms to frame examples. I will group them as molecularly targeted (receptor, enzyme, channel, transporter), systems-level (networks, pathways, emergent systems effects), device/interventional (mechanical or neuromodulatory), and public health/systems (behavioral, economic, social), because this categorization mirrors how clinicians think about interventions and their expected effects across scales from molecules to populations.

> Now, let me consider a canonical pharmacologic example to ground the taxonomy. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) like valsartan, candesartan, and telmisartan act by selectively blocking AT1 receptors, which reduces vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion independent of angiotensin II synthesis pathways; wait, I initially almost said "vasodilation" as the direct mechanism, but I should correct that — the direct effect is receptor blockade, with reduced vasoconstriction as a functional consequence, not direct vasodilation, and this nuance matters when comparing ARBs to ACE inhibitors that also increase bradykinin and can cause cough or angioedema [^115uMVPD] [^113jfrZK] [^115b3tVU].

> I will now examine multi-mechanism and synergistic designs. Tapentadol is a good exemplar of dual pharmacology (mu-opioid receptor agonism plus norepinephrine reuptake inhibition) producing analgesic synergy at the level of both ascending and descending pain pathways; hold on, I should verify the clinical implication — this synergy can translate into comparable or greater analgesia with less opioid burden, potentially improving tolerability relative to pure MOR agonists, which is why understanding its MOA guides rational selection in multimodal pain regimens [^116qFNEg].

> But wait, what if a drug's clinical effects cannot be fully explained by a single target or canonical pathway? Metformin illustrates mechanistic evolution: for years, mitochondrial complex I inhibition and AMPK activation were leading hypotheses, yet supra-therapeutic concentrations were often required in vitro; recent data point to clinically relevant redox-dependent, substrate-selective inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis, so I need to be cautious about over-interpreting preclinical models that use non-physiologic drug levels when extrapolating to patients [^1131QDhj] [^114Qeu86] [^116N3jZh].

> Hold on, I should verify a frequent pitfall: in vitro potency predicting in vivo efficacy. Multiple analyses show that the relationship between unbound clinical concentrations and in vitro binding/functional potency varies widely across targets, mechanisms, and tissues; occupancy and transduction kinetics, target turnover, and tissue distribution can dominate, so I should avoid assuming that high in vitro affinity automatically predicts clinical effectiveness or the right exposure target [^112ppw79] [^113CEvE3] [^114Y1V54].

> Let me consider how MOA shapes safety and class effects. Anti-VEGF agents frequently cause hypertension and proteinuria because VEGF pathway suppression impairs endothelial integrity and fenestration; similarly, TNF-α inhibitors carry an increased risk of tuberculosis reactivation due to impaired host defense; I should double-check that regulatory guidance increasingly expects shared MOA-related adverse effects to be described across class labeling to expedite safety learning, even when individual labels lag [^1146ZVg1] [^114WVw2w].

> I need to ensure I cover combination therapy and pharmacodynamic drug–drug interactions. Rational polytherapy often leverages complementary mechanisms, but mechanistic complementarity does not guarantee clinical synergy; quantitative methods and mechanistic modeling help distinguish additive from synergistic effects, and in epilepsy, despite many agents with distinct mechanisms, clinical benefit prediction from animal models remains limited, reminding me to integrate PK/PD and clinical data rather than rely on mechanism alone [^112TAwBq] [^116TPQXS] [^111jn5EY].

> Next, I should review non-pharmacologic or interventional MOAs. Spinal cord stimulation operates through segmental and supraspinal neuromodulation, historically framed by gate-control theory but now recognized to involve complex neurotransmitter dynamics and potentially glial interactions; this is a good reminder that "mechanism" in devices and procedures is often a systems-level model rather than a single molecular target [^114Gxf4V].

> Let me not overlook public health and behavioral mechanisms. The CONSEQUENT framework enumerates mechanisms by which public health interventions alter systems: biophysiological, behavioral, perceptual, environmental, social normative, economic, and system-functioning; I should confirm that understanding these mechanisms supports design of durable, adaptive interventions that reshape upstream drivers of health outcomes rather than only proximate risk factors [^111Axzri] [^113Sd14y].

> I should double-check the innovation landscape in therapeutics. Multispecific drugs designed to engage multiple targets or pathways are emerging with emergent properties that can bypass redundancy, improve tissue selectivity, or enable conditional pharmacology; this mechanistic design space expands what "MOA" can mean, from linear target-effect chains to programmable network pharmacology [^114wK8jB].

> Now, let me synthesize key principles. First, MOA spans molecular engagement to clinical effects, and its clarity guides dose, safety, and patient selection; second, mechanisms are often pleiotropic and context-dependent, so I should be wary of over-simplified causal narratives; third, translational gaps between in vitro potency and in vivo effect are common and mandate PK/PD integration; fourth, shared MOAs often confer class safety signals that should be anticipated and communicated; finally, systems-level and multi-target thinking are increasingly necessary as we move toward precision and systems therapeutics [^112GJTiY] [^112ppw79] [^116jahb8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also acknowledge uncertainties and evolving paradigms. For some therapies, like electroconvulsive therapy or even clozapine, the "mechanism" remains debated or multifactorial; new data may overturn prior dogma, as with metformin's redox hypothesis, and resistance mechanisms in cancer and other diseases underscore that static MOA descriptions may inadequately capture dynamic adaptation, reinforcing the need for iterative, mechanism-informed care pathways [^111b4xkw] [^113GZt8j] [^1131QDhj] [^111pQa7W].

The mechanism of action (MOA) is the **specific biochemical interaction** by which a drug produces its therapeutic effect, including the molecular target, pathway, and physiological outcome. MOA is central to drug discovery, clinical use, and regulation because it links pharmacology to efficacy and safety, guides dosing and patient selection, and informs class effects and adverse event prediction [^114Aag8V]. Understanding MOA enables rational combination therapy, anticipates resistance, and supports precision medicine by aligning treatment with disease biology and patient characteristics [^112TAwBq] [^112GJTiY] [^112RdReT].

---

## Definition and importance

MOA is the **specific biochemical interaction** through which a drug exerts its therapeutic effect, encompassing the molecular target, the pathway involved, and the resulting physiological response [^114ovzG1]. It is a cornerstone of pharmacology because it:

- **Links pharmacology to clinical effects**: MOA bridges molecular interactions with therapeutic outcomes, providing a mechanistic understanding of drug efficacy and safety [^114ovzG1].

- **Guides clinical decision-making**: Knowledge of MOA informs dosing, patient selection, and monitoring strategies, optimizing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing adverse effects [^1156zJkd].

- **Informs drug development**: MOA guides the design of new drugs, combination therapies, and strategies to overcome resistance [^112TAwBq] [^111pQa7W].

## Examples of mechanisms of action

| **Drug class** | **Example drug** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Antidepressants | SSRIs (e.g. fluoxetine) | Inhibit serotonin reuptake, increasing synaptic serotonin | Improved mood, anxiety control [^notfound] |
| Antipsychotics | Clozapine | Multireceptor modulation (D2, 5-HT2A, muscarinic) | Effective in treatment-resistant schizophrenia [^notfound] |
| Antidiabetic agents | Metformin | Inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis via AMPK activation | Glycemic control, weight neutrality [^115FxFNB] |
| Anticoagulants | Warfarin | Inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase, reducing clotting factors | Prevents thromboembolism |
| Antineoplastic agents | Trastuzumab | Binds HER2, inhibiting signaling and inducing antibody-dependent cytotoxicity | Effective in HER2-positive breast cancer [^notfound] |

---

## MOA and clinical outcomes

Understanding MOA directly influences **clinical outcomes** by:

- **Predicting efficacy**: MOA helps identify patients likely to benefit from a drug, enabling precision medicine approaches [^114ovzG1].

- **Anticipating adverse effects**: MOA-linked adverse effects are often class-specific, allowing proactive monitoring and management [^114WVw2w].

- **Informing combination therapy**: Rational combinations leverage complementary MOAs to enhance efficacy or reduce resistance [^112TAwBq].

- **Guiding dose selection**: MOA informs pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships, optimizing dosing strategies [^112ppw79].

---

## Challenges and limitations

Despite its importance, determining MOA can be **challenging**:

- **Complexity of biological systems**: Drugs often have multiple targets and pathways, complicating MOA elucidation [^112GJTiY].

- **Translational gaps**: In vitro findings may not translate to in vivo clinical effects, necessitating careful validation [^114Y1V54].

- **Emerging mechanisms**: New technologies (e.g. systems biology, omics) continuously refine our understanding of MOA [^111Y98hw].

---

## Regulatory and clinical guidelines

Regulatory agencies (FDA, EMA) and clinical guidelines emphasize MOA in drug evaluation, labeling, and clinical practice, underscoring its role in **safety assessment, class-effect identification, and individualized therapy** [^114Aag8V] [^111uHwqw].

---

The mechanism of action is the **biochemical interaction** that underpins a drug's therapeutic effect, linking molecular pharmacology to clinical outcomes. It is essential for drug development, clinical decision-making, and regulatory oversight, enabling precision medicine and optimized patient care.

Key Points

Question

How often are anticancer drugs approved based on a new mechanism of action?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 332 US Food and Drug Administration–approved anticancer drugs from 2009 to 2020, 16% of approvals were based on a new mechanism of action when considering all tumor types and 37% when considering each tumor type separately. Overall, 63% of approvals were either a next-in-class drug within a tumor type or a subsequent indication of the same drug within a tumor type.

Meaning

In this study, anticancer drugs using a new mechanism of action were a minority of all anti-cancer drugs approvals.

### How leisure activities affect health: a narrative review and multi-level theoretical framework of mechanisms of action [^115tpAN3]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

We have identified over 600 mechanisms of action by which leisure engagement can affect health and health behaviours, through networks of psychological, bio- logical, social, and behavioural processes, at micro- levels, meso-levels, and macro-levels, and have synthesised these findings into a new Multi-level Leisure Mechanisms Framework. No system will ever be able to include every single mechanism and this framework does not aim or claim to do so. However, this is the most rigorous review of potential mechanisms of action for leisure engagement done so far. We anticipate that the framework will need to evolve as the theories themselves develop, and as new research is done and new mechanisms are described. Areas where there is already suggestion of large developments to come in the next few years include research on genetics and epigenetics, behaviour change, and environmental factors. Nevertheless, it is hoped that this Review and framework will support the design of more theory- driven, cross-disciplinary studies that explicitly consider the mechanisms underlying the effects of leisure engagement on mental and physical health.

Search strategy and selection criteria

First, we developed a list of disciplines considered likely to have examined mechanisms relating to leisure activities and health (appendix p 1). Three key textbooks for each discipline were selected through personal experience and consultation with experts in each field. Textbook mentions of a mechanism that was either (1) theoretically discussed as a mechanism of action linking one or more types of leisure activity with health, or (2) empirically tested as a mechanism were added to a master database of mechanisms. Second, we searched for key papers using a list of key terms (appendix) in the following databases: Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Europe PMC, and PsycINFO. Search criteria included articles published in English between Jan 1, 1950, and Jan 31, 2020. Relevant papers were then manually searched, and any further mechanisms identified were added to the database. Third, we consulted experts in each field from the MARCH Mental Health Research Network. After the mechanisms had all been catalogued in the master database, we went through each individually and only included in the final review those that were deemed relevant to the research question, definable and distinct from other mechanisms, and either theoretically proposed or empirically shown to act as a mechanism of action linking one or more leisure activities with health (ie, a potential mechanism of action, as described in the review).

A comprehensive description of the search strategy and selection criteria is provided in the appendix pp 1−2.

### A primer for the conceptualization of the mechanism of action of electroconvulsive therapy, 1: defining the question [^111b4xkw]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

With regard to the question of how electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) acts, a common answer is that the mechanism of action of the treatment is not well understood. However, this is not true. There is a great deal of information available about what ECT does in the brain, how it does it, and how these effects translate into clinical actions. The very complexity of the available data makes it necessary for the question about mechanisms to be properly defined with regard to physiologic effects, adverse effects, and efficacy in different conditions. This article presents a primer for the conceptualization of the mechanism of action of ECT with special attention to understanding why the question and answer are complex.

### Presbyopia treatments by mechanism of action: a new classification system based on a review of the literature [^117AqkZ7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Considering the mechanism of action in the manner we propose provides a practical framework to understand the inherent advantages and disadvantages associated with treatment options, independent of the specific mode of intervention used to implement that mechanism (Table 2). For example, monovision leverages the mechanism of varying the refractive state between eyes. While there are subtle differences, the fundamental advantages and disadvantages of monovision are the same whether achieved via contact lenses, laser vision correction, or intraocular lenses (IOLs). As a result, a patient who is intolerant of monovision with contact lenses would likely not tolerate monovision with IOLs because both interventions share the same fundamental mechanism of action. Recognizing the underlying mechanism of action would allow a clinician to use a patient's previous presbyopia treatment experience as a factor in clinical decision making.

### Why is mechanism of action important in antidepressant treatment? [^112xSiWR]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Antidepressants are one of the most common treatment strategies for patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, antidepressant medications have different mechanisms of action that can theoretically and in practice affect how patients respond. Clinicians should assess their patients' symptoms and response to medication at every visit to determine whether or not the treatment is fully effective. Here, follow the case of Maria, a 42-year-old teacher who is experiencing her first depressive episode.

### Anticancer drugs approved by the US food and drug administration from 2009 to 2020 according to their mechanism of action [^115KHnff]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Data Abstraction

Information abstracted for each approval included the name of drug approved, date and year of approval, indication, tumor type, mechanism of action, broad pharmaceutical class, biological target, classification of approval considering all tumor types (ie, new mechanism of action, next in class, or subsequent approval), and classification of approval considering each tumor type separately (new mechanism of action, next in class, or subsequent approval). Two authors (T.O. and A.H.) made the selection and reviewed the FDA approvals for inclusion. One author (T.O.) abstracted the mechanism of action, pharmaceutical class, and biological target of each drug and conducted the 2 classifications of each approval. Any questions about the mechanism of action or the classification of approvals were discussed between all authors and were adjudicated, when necessary, by a third reviewer (V.P.).

Statistical Analysis

The analysis was descriptive. Frequencies were calculated for categorical variables throughout. Most analyses were done using a calculator, with testing of differences in proportions between 2009 vs 2020 being done in R version 4.0.4 (R Project for Statistical Computing).

### Mechanism of action of analgesics used to treat osteoarthritis pain [^112XxyuS]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Acute pain is a normal, and often beneficial, physiologic process. The indiscriminant blocking of all pain can delay healing or mask serious medical problems. On the other hand, persistent pain can be nonproductive or deleterious to recovery and can negatively affect a patient's quality of life. If the treatment of pain by pharmacologic means is determined to be desirable, it is important to select an analgesic, or combination of analgesics, that have appropriate mechanisms of action (i.e., those that modulate the appropriate physiologic pathway). OA pain is an example of a complex type of pain (i.e., it often originates from multiple causes and is transmitted by multiple mediators). Therefore, the choice of the analgesics for the patient who has OA should be based upon the most appropriate mechanisms of action.

### Towards a complex systems model of evidence for public health [^113Sd14y]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 evidence: identifying actions that can modify the complex system

Modifying the emergent patterns of a complex health problem towards a more desirable state, such as reduced health inequality, requires reshaping the mechanisms and dynamics that make up the complex system underlying public health problems. In the traditional model of evidence for public health, type 2 evidence relates to the efficacy or effectiveness of distinct and fixed interventions targeting specific risk factors such as 'price increases on cigarettes reduce smoking rates'. But this approach may be insufficient if it, for example, fails to take account of system adaptations, such as increased marketing efforts by the tobacco industry. Thus, instead of these isolated interventions, there is a need for a set of actions to collectively bring about such systems change. Actions capable of this reshaping can be conceptualised as 'events' or 'disruptions' within the system they aim to change. Type 2 evidence indicates how certain actions are likely to modify the underlying mechanisms and dynamics, and how, subsequently, effects on health patterns might be achieved (table 1).

Mechanisms: Which set of actions can modify the mechanisms that make up a complex system?

In order to identify a set of actions that can create change, we need to build on our understanding of the mechanisms underlying complex problems. Given the conceptualisation of actions as 'events in a system', we need evidence on how specific actions are likely to modify these mechanisms, and in turn modify the system. In order for this evidence to be generalisable, it is important to define these actions in terms of their function within the system — that is, the changes they produce in the underlying mechanisms — rather than focusing solely on their content or their direct effects on a simple causal outcome. This function is grounded in an intervention theory or theory of change. For example, in the context of preventing youth smoking, a recent review assessed the effectiveness of school-based interventions in terms of characteristics of the intervention, such as mode of delivery or the type of intervention provider. To extend this analysis towards a complex systems-based perspective, these interventions would need to be evaluated in terms of their function within the system — such as their ability to create and sustain social norms that discourage smoking among young people.

### Colchicine: old and new [^114uEXjk]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Although colchicine has been a focus of research, debate, and controversy for thousands of years, the US Food and Drug Administration just approved it in 2009. Over the past decade, advances in the knowledge of colchicine pharmacology, drug safety, and mechanisms of action have led to changes in colchicine dosing and to potential new uses for this very old drug. In this review, we discuss the pharmacologic properties of colchicine and summarize what is currently known about its mechanisms of action. We then discuss and update the use of colchicine in a variety of illnesses, including rheumatic and, most recently, cardiovascular diseases.

### Psychopharmacology of anticonvulsants: do all anticonvulsants have the same mechanism of action? [^113qbzia]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Issue

Anticonvulsants are not a single therapeutic class, but are composed of multiple distinct subclasses with different mechanisms of action, efficacies, and side effects.

### Mechanisms of action of metformin with special reference to cardiovascular protection [^116VJLPx]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The choice of treatments for type 2 diabetes is wider than ever before, and several drugs have now been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and/or the risk of premature mortality in this population. Nevertheless, at the time of writing, influential diabetes management guidelines continue to identify metformin as initial antidiabetic pharmacotherapy of choice (in the absence of contraindications) more than 60 years after its first therapeutic administration to a person with diabetes. 1 It is important to place our knowledge of the actions of metformin within the current context of increased emphasis on the need to protect the cardiovascular system in type 2 diabetes. In this review, we provide a concise snapshot of current knowledge concerning the effects of metformin on glycaemia and clinical cardiovascular outcomes, together with a review of the diverse range of proposed mechanisms of action that underlie such effects.

### Metformin: from mechanisms of action to therapies [^1154x7ff]. Cell Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Metformin is currently the first-line drug treatment for type 2 diabetes. Besides its glucose-lowering effect, there is interest in actions of the drug of potential relevance to cardiovascular diseases and cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms of action remain elusive. Convincing data place energy metabolism at the center of metformin's mechanism of action in diabetes and may also be of importance in cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Metformin-induced activation of the energy-sensor AMPK is well documented, but may not account for all actions of the drug. Here, we summarize current knowledge about the different AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent mechanisms underlying metformin action.

### Metformin: mechanisms of antihyperglycemic action, other pharmacodynamic properties, and safety perspectives [^115FxFNB]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the mechanisms of action of metformin and describe its effects and safety profile.

Methods

Results of more than 30 years of clinical use in countries other than the United States are summarized. In addition, the pharmacologic properties of metformin are compared with those of other antihyperglycemic agents.

Results

Approximately 90% of all cases of diabetes are non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) — a heterogeneous disease that involves several pathogenic factors and is associated with other coexisting conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and obesity. Thus, an agent that controls blood glucose levels and has favorable effects on the concomitant conditions should be considered when pharmacologic intervention is needed for the treatment of NIDDM. Metformin possesses the pharmacodynamic properties to do both. Its mechanisms of action include the reduction of hepatic glucose production and enhancement of peripheral glucose disposal, making metformin an effective antihyperglycemic agent. It also has other pharmacologic properties, independent of its glycemic effects, that offer additional clinical benefits in comparison with other pharmacologic NIDDM treatments. These benefits include stabilization or even loss of weight in patients for whom weight gain is a concern and reduction of plasma lipid levels in patients with hyperlipidemia.

Conclusion

On the basis of 3 decades of clinical experience, metformin has been shown to be not only a well tolerated but also a highly effective antihyperglycemic agent.

### Resolving adjuvant mode of action to enhance vaccine efficacy [^116LErmS]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Adjuvants are a miscellaneous range of molecules and materials that can enhance the magnitude, functionality, breadth and durability of immune responses. Despite the multiplicity of compounds with adjuvant properties, less than a dozen are in clinical use in vaccines against infectious diseases. While many factors have contributed to their slow development, among the major challenges are the high safety and efficacy standards set by current adjuvants in human vaccines and our limited understanding of how adjuvants mediate their effects. This review outlines why it is so difficult to elucidate their mechanism of action, highlights areas that require in-depth research and discusses recent advancements that are revitalising adjuvant development. It is hoped that a fuller understanding of adjuvant sensing, signalling and function will facilitate the design of vaccines that promote sustained protective immunity against challenging bacterial and viral pathogens.

### Pharmacology, physiology, and mechanisms of incretin hormone action [^116ZQS81]. Cell Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Incretin peptides, principally GLP-1 and GIP, regulate islet hormone secretion, glucose concentrations, lipid metabolism, gut motility, appetite and body weight, and immune function, providing a scientific basis for utilizing incretin-based therapies in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Activation of GLP-1 and GIP receptors also leads to nonglycemic effects in multiple tissues, through direct actions on tissues expressing incretin receptors and indirect mechanisms mediated through neuronal and endocrine pathways. Here we contrast the pharmacology and physiology of incretin hormones and review recent advances in mechanisms coupling incretin receptor signaling to pleiotropic metabolic actions in preclinical studies. We discuss whether mechanisms identified in preclinical studies have potential translational relevance for the treatment of human disease and highlight controversies and uncertainties in incretin biology that require resolution in future studies.

### Regulatory safety learning driven by the mechanism of action: the case of TNF-α inhibitors [^114Aag8V]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Existing as well as new knowledge of ADRs for drugs with the same mechanism of action is not in its entirety described in the safety information of all drugs. In addition, when knowledge of ADRs is transferred from one drug to another, this takes considerable time. In order to inform healthcare professionals and patients about the complete picture of the safety profile, knowledge of the safety profile of drugs with the same mechanism of action should increasingly be taken into account for all drugs within the class.

### Inflammasomes: mechanism of action, role in disease, and therapeutics [^114FPCCa]. Nature Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The inflammasomes are innate immune system receptors and sensors that regulate the activation of caspase-1 and induce inflammation in response to infectious microbes and molecules derived from host proteins. They have been implicated in a host of inflammatory disorders. Recent developments have greatly enhanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which different inflammasomes are activated. Additionally, increasing evidence in mouse models, supported by human data, strongly implicates an involvement of the inflammasome in the initiation or progression of diseases with a high impact on public health, such as metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, recent developments pointing toward promising therapeutics that target inflammasome activity in inflammatory diseases have been reported. This review will focus on these three areas of inflammasome research.

### Understanding antidepressant mechanism of action and its effect on efficacy and safety [^111c9Qwb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Common side effects of antidepressants, such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and fatigue and sleepiness, may be attributable to their mechanisms of action. Antidepressants are neurotransmitter uptake blockers, enzyme inhibitors, and neurotransmitter receptor blockers. Various mechanisms of action can determine how quickly therapeutic benefit becomes apparent and whether certain acute and persistent side effects occur. Understanding mechanism of action can help clinicians select appropriate antidepressants for individual patients and manage adherence problems due to intolerability. Although more research is needed to further elucidate specific antidepressant mechanisms of action, clinicians can use current knowledge to tailor treatment decisions, such as switching patients to a medication with a different mechanism of action when intolerable adverse events are experienced.

### Development of an overarching framework for anticipating and assessing adverse and other unintended consequences of public health interventions (CONSEQUENT): a best-fit framework synthesis [^111Axzri]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Table 1
Consequences in the CONSEQUENT framework: first-order domains, second-order domains, definition

Table 2
Consequences in the CONSEQUENT framework: examples

The mechanisms component of the CONSEQUENT framework, which may be treated as a supplementary component, consists of eight mechanisms (figure 2). AUCs may arise through: (1) biophysiological mechanisms, (2) (re)action or behaviour change, (3) perception, experience and assessment, (4) available opportunities for (re)action, (5) environments and environmental exposures, (6) social norms and practices, (7) economic and market mechanisms and (8) the functioning of systems and system components. Each mechanism also includes a non-exhaustive list of more specific processes. For example, the mechanism of (re)action or behaviour change includes the following processes: affecting behavioural practice(s), evasive, resistant or counteractive (re)actions or practices, supplementing practices or products, human error or misuse, triggering automated behaviours and lack of action or (behaviour) change. In contrast to the second-order domains of consequences, these specific processes are not intended as standalone 'submechanisms', but rather illustrate how the mechanisms may operate and are likely to vary for different PH interventions. Descriptions of the mechanisms and specific processes are presented in table 3; further details and examples are provided in online supplemental additional file 7. The relationship between the final framework and the a priori and interim versions of the framework is depicted in online supplemental additional files 4 and 5.

### Pharmacodynamic biomarkers evidentiary considerations for biosimilar development and approval [^116RYe7u]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

biomarker characteristic #1: The relevance of thebiomarker to the mechanism of action of the drug (to the extent that the mechanism of action is known for the reference product)

Whereas the FDA biosimilar guidances, outline a PD biomarker is not required to be a surrogate end point or have an established relationship with clinical efficacy outcomes, assessing the relevance of the PD biomarker to the drug ' s mechanism of action is one of the five characteristics. As seen in Figure 2, epoetin alfa engages with the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor on erythroid progenitor cells (target engagement), which initiates erythropoiesis leading to an increase in reticulocyte count (PD biomarker 1), which subsequently results in an increased red blood cell count and hemoglobin concentration (PD biomarker 2). The increased hemoglobin concentration then decreases or eliminates the need for red blood cell transfusions and the adverse sequala of anemia (clinical outcomes). Both reticulocyte count and hemoglobin concentration are PD biomarkers relevant to the mechanism of action of the reference product and were considered acceptable biomarker(s) for PD similarity evaluation in the FDA review and approval of epoetin alfa‐epbx. Although target engagement at the EPO receptor is the critical first step for epoetin alfa ' s intended pharmacologic effect, target engagement by itself has generally not been considered an adequate PD biomarker that would obviate the need for a comparative clinical study in patients.

Figure 2
Mechanism of action and representative temporal profiles of PD biomarkers after epoetin alfa treatment. EPO, erythropoietin, PD, pharmacodynamic

Some drugs have complex pharmacology with many measurable PD biomarkers (for example, immunomodulating agents for neurogenerative disorders). When a drug exhibits complex pharmacology, identifying a single PD biomarker that reflects the mechanism of action can be challenging. In such cases, it may be appropriate to use a panel of PD biomarkers to contribute to the totality of evidence in supporting the overall biosimilarity assessment.

### Does in vitro potency predict clinically efficacious concentrations? [^113CEvE3]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

The present study was undertaken to address, "What is the relationship between clinical unbound concentrations and in vitro potency, and how can drug discovery and development benefit from a better understanding of this linkage?" A survey of 164 drugs was done to identify important points to consider when assessing new molecular entities. The compilation includes pharmacokinetic properties (clearance, bioavailability, plasma protein binding, volume of distribution, half‐life, and active metabolites), clinically unbound concentrations (C u, ss), intracellular or extracellular target localization, in vitro binding affinities, type of in vitro property parameter (target binding, function; dissociation constant (K d), inhibitory constant (K i), concentration of drug producing 50% inhibition of maximal inhibition (IC 50), concentration of drug producing 50% of its maximum effect (EC 50)), mechanism of action, target type, and therapeutic area.

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad? [^113fTF6g]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms of selective GR agonists action

While GCs are extremely potent for their intended target, as discussed earlier, they are associated with debilitating side effects (see The Adverse Effects of Prescribed GCs section). Therefore, substantial work has aimed to develop so-called selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists (SEGRAs) in order to try to separate the negative side effects from the beneficial anti-inflammatory actions (Fig. 3). This was often based on the idea that a monomer/dimer dichotomy existed regarding repression/activation. However, as discussed in the Classical Steroid Hormone Action section, this model of GC action is no longer clear-cut; monomers have been found to activate and not simply repress gene expression, and also to activate anti-inflammatory genes that are required for the full effects of GCs to act as anti-inflammatory agents. Early reports identified compound A as a selective agonist that seemed to have limited ability to activate genes via GR but efficiently repressed genes involved in inflammation. However, recent work highlighted that the differential effects of compound A are likely through alternative cofactor recruitment rather than an effect on tethering, and data supporting selective binding of compound A to the GR is unconvincing.

Figure 3.
Genomic effects of classic glucocorticoids (left) and Selective Glucocorticoid Receptor Agonists (SEGRAs, right).

Preclinical studies

Early enthusiasm for pursuing selective GR ligands was based on the idea that changes in ligand structure could result in selective activation of transactivation or transrepression. A large number of candidate compounds were advanced to preclinical studies in animal models based on screening of compounds against a transactivation assay, thought to be the mechanism for metabolic side effects, and transrepression of NFkB, thought to be the key mechanism for anti-inflammatory action. These compounds failed to advance to clinical benefit, in most part due to a lack of robust separation of actions. This led to a revised view of how the activated GR can both activate and repress gene expression and how this might be achieved. It now emerges that there may be a common mechanism requiring GR to transactivate target gene expression and that the gene products of this conserved mechanism then drive anti-inflammation as a secondary effect. Indeed, candidate mechanisms involving phosphatases and other inhibitory molecules have been characterized.

### Pharmacology, physiology, and mechanisms of action of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors [^114QKC5x]. Endocrine Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) is a widely expressed enzyme transducing actions through an anchored transmembrane molecule and a soluble circulating protein. Both membrane-associated and soluble DPP4 exert catalytic activity, cleaving proteins containing a position 2 alanine or proline. DPP4-mediated enzymatic cleavage alternatively inactivates peptides or generates new bioactive moieties that may exert competing or novel activities. The widespread use of selective DPP4 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has heightened interest in the molecular mechanisms through which DPP4 inhibitors exert their pleiotropic actions. Here we review the biology of DPP4 with a focus on: 1) identification of pharmacological vs physiological DPP4 substrates; and 2) elucidation of mechanisms of actions of DPP4 in studies employing genetic elimination or chemical reduction of DPP4 activity. We review data identifying the roles of key DPP4 substrates in transducing the glucoregulatory, anti-inflammatory, and cardiometabolic actions of DPP4 inhibitors in both preclinical and clinical studies. Finally, we highlight experimental pitfalls and technical challenges encountered in studies designed to understand the mechanisms of action and downstream targets activated by inhibition of DPP4.

### Treatments for schizophrenia: a critical review of pharmacology and mechanisms of action of antipsychotic drugs [^117JA6UK]. Molecular Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The treatment of schizophrenia has evolved over the past half century primarily in the context of antipsychotic drug development. Although there has been significant progress resulting in the availability and use of numerous medications, these reflect three basic classes of medications (conventional (typical), atypical and dopamine partial agonist antipsychotics) all of which, despite working by varying mechanisms of actions, act principally on dopamine systems. Many of the second-generation (atypical and dopamine partial agonist) antipsychotics are believed to offer advantages over first-generation agents in the treatment for schizophrenia. However, the pharmacological properties that confer the different therapeutic effects of the new generation of antipsychotic drugs have remained elusive, and certain side effects can still impact patient health and quality of life. Moreover, the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs is limited prompting the clinical use of adjunctive pharmacy to augment the effects of treatment. In addition, the search for novel and nondopaminergic antipsychotic drugs has not been successful to date, though numerous development strategies continue to be pursued, guided by various pathophysiologic hypotheses. This article provides a brief review and critique of the current therapeutic armamentarium for treating schizophrenia and drug development strategies and theories of mechanisms of action of antipsychotics, and focuses on novel targets for therapeutic agents for future drug development.

### Mechanisms of drug inhibition of signalling molecules [^112GJTiY]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

The emergence of tumour-specific, molecularly targeted agents signifies a paradigm shift in cancer therapy, with less reliance on drugs that non-discriminately kill tumour and host cells. Although the diversity of targets giving rise to this new generation of anticancer drugs has expanded, many challenges persist in the design of effective treatment regimens. The complex interplay of signal-transduction pathways further complicates the customization of cancer treatments to target single mechanisms. However, despite uncertainty over precise or dominant mechanisms of action, especially for compounds targeting multiple gene products, emerging agents are producing significant therapeutic advances against a broad range of human cancers.

### Acceptability of different mechanisms of action of contraception in women: a questionnaire survey [^114PzJRm]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2022). High credibility.

Background

The mechanism of action of a contraceptive method is an importantg consideration in a woman's choice of contraception. For the development of new methods of contraception it is important to understand the acceptability of different contraceptive mechanisms within a population.

Methods

We recruited women attending contraceptive, termination of pregnancy or postnatal care services in Hong Kong for a questionnaire survey on their acceptability of the different ways in which contraceptive methods prevent pregnancy. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to establish factors which may predict acceptability of the mechanism of action.

Results

A total of 1448 women completed the survey. The acceptability of contraceptive methods that act by preventing fertilisation ranked highest (78%), followed by those that inhibit ovulation (52%), disrupt implantation (43%) and dislodge an implanted embryo (30%). A history of termination of pregnancy was associated with greater acceptance of all posited contraceptive mechanisms. There was a very low degree of agreement between the declared acceptance of the various contraceptive mechanisms and the ever use of a method with the respective mechanism of action (Cohen's kappa coefficient range 0.017–0.162).

Conclusions

In this population the acceptability of contraceptive methods that act by preventing fertilisation ranked highest, followed by those that inhibit ovulation, disrupt implantation and dislodge an implanted embryo. Women who had ever had a termination of pregnancy were more likely to accept all the posited contraceptive mechanisms.

### AMPK activators: mechanisms of action and physiological activities [^111EAz2a]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a central regulator of energy homeostasis, which coordinates metabolic pathways and thus balances nutrient supply with energy demand. Because of the favorable physiological outcomes of AMPK activation on metabolism, AMPK has been considered to be an important therapeutic target for controlling human diseases including metabolic syndrome and cancer. Thus, activators of AMPK may have potential as novel therapeutics for these diseases. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of both indirect and direct AMPK activators and their modes of action in relation to the structure of AMPK. We discuss the functional differences among isoform-specific AMPK complexes and their significance regarding the development of novel AMPK activators and the potential for combining different AMPK activators in the treatment of human disease.

### Cellular and molecular mechanisms of metformin action [^1131QDhj]. Endocrine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Metformin is a first-line therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, due to its robust glucose-lowering effects, well-established safety profile, and relatively low cost. While metformin has been shown to have pleotropic effects on glucose metabolism, there is a general consensus that the major glucose-lowering effect in patients with type 2 diabetes is mostly mediated through inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis. However, despite decades of research, the mechanism by which metformin inhibits this process is still highly debated. A key reason for these discrepant effects is likely due to the inconsistency in dosage of metformin across studies. Widely studied mechanisms of action, such as complex I inhibition leading to AMPK activation, have only been observed in the context of supra-pharmacological (> 1 mM) metformin concentrations, which do not occur in the clinical setting. Thus, these mechanisms have been challenged in recent years and new mechanisms have been proposed. Based on the observation that metformin alters cellular redox balance, a redox-dependent mechanism of action has been described by several groups. Recent studies have shown that clinically relevant (50–100 μM) concentrations of metformin inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis in a substrate-selective manner both in vitro and in vivo, supporting a redox-dependent mechanism of metformin action. Here, we review the current literature regarding metformin's cellular and molecular mechanisms of action.

### The mechanism of action of clozapine [^112SfUnm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Clozapine has a unique clinical pharmacology, compared to the other antipsychotics. The long-sought mechanism of action for clozapine's distinct antipsychotic properties appears to be partial agonism at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M 4 and possibly M 1).

There had been clues from peripheral autonomic pharmacology, where clozapine and its metabolite norclozapine, in stark contrast to the other antipsychotics, can stimulate tissue responses mediated via muscarinic receptors.

Agonists at muscarinic receptors have efficacy in schizophrenia, having previously shown promise in the conditioned avoidance response, an important marker of antipsychotic activity. To date, one cholinergic-based pharmaceutical, other than clozapine, KarXT, has translated to clinical practice. Other cholinergic molecules may follow in the near future.

With the emergence of cholinergic-based antipsychotics, some have observed that we are at a major milestone in psychiatry, similar to Delay and Deniker's demonstration of the antipsychotic effects of chlorpromazine in the 1950s, or indeed, the introduction of clozapine itself in the latter decades of the 20th century. It would be an irony if the clarification of the mechanism of action of clozapine occurred alongside the emergence of drugs which could potentially supersede it in clinical practice.

Previous hypotheses for the superiority of clozapine over other antipsychotics have failed to stand the test of time. Here we describe how the unique pharmacology of clozapine in the peripheral nervous system held clues for solving the puzzle of clozapine in the central nervous system. Clozapine appears to have been the prototype for a new class of antipsychotics, now entering clinical psychiatry, which activates muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.

### Cellular and molecular mechanisms of metformin action [^116N3jZh]. Endocrine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Regulation of Hepatic Gluconeogenesis

Hepatic glucose production (HGP) reflects the net contributions of hepatic gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, glycogen synthesis, and glycolysis. That approximately 85% to 90% of endogenous glucose production following an overnight fast is attributed to HGP highlights the importance of HGP to whole-body glucose metabolism and glycemic control. Furthermore, in the overnight fasted state, about 50% of HGP can be attributed to hepatic gluconeogenesis and, in patients with poorly controlled T2D, an increased rate of hepatic gluconeogenesis is the primary driver of fasting hyperglycemia.

As discussed above, metformin's glucose-lowering effect is primarily due to suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Although the precise mechanism of metformin action on gluconeogenesis remains a subject of debate, a fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms of gluconeogenic regulation is necessary to critically evaluate the existing hypotheses of metformin action. In this section, we consider the following mechanisms of gluconeogenic regulation: transcriptional, allosteric, substrate, and redox. We also discuss proposed mechanisms of metformin action related to the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis through each of these processes (Fig. 1).

### Computation as the mechanistic bridge between precision medicine and systems therapeutics [^116jahb8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past 50 years, like molecular cell biology, medicine and pharmacology have been driven by a reductionist approach. The focus on individual genes and cellular components as disease loci and drug targets has been a necessary step in understanding the basic mechanisms underlying tissue/organ physiology and drug action. Recent progress in genomics and proteomics, as well as advances in other technologies that enable large-scale data gathering and computational approaches, is providing new knowledge of both normal and disease states. Systems-biology approaches enable integration of knowledge from different types of data for precision medicine and systems therapeutics. In this review, we describe recent studies that contribute to these emerging fields and discuss how together these fields can lead to a mechanism-based therapy for individual patients.

### Does in vitro potency predict clinically efficacious concentrations? [^112ppw79]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

The in vitro affinity of a compound for its target is an important feature in drug discovery, but even more central is the question of how predictive in vitro properties are of in vivo therapeutic drug exposure. The underlying assumption is that a compound with high in vitro affinity and favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties may have a greater chance to deliver its intended clinical action in comparison with compounds with poor pharmacokinetic properties and in vitro potency. 1, 2

It is possible to at least partly hypothesize on desired onset, intensity, and duration of a pharmacological response based on a compound's mechanism of action. Insights into target occupancy relative to actual drug concentrations are also key parameters towards a therapeutic response. 3 Thus, for receptor antagonists and irreversible enzyme inhibitors, it is often assumed that high and/or extended target occupancy is essential, in contrast to agonists where these features are not necessary to elicit a clinical response. According to the law of mass action, drug concentrations ~ 3–5 times the in vitro potency (affinity constant K d) would reach a target occupancy of about 80% and thereby possess a good chance to result in a pharmacological response. 4 Target turnover and transduction‐coupling efficiency aspects are often neglected despite being equally important for in vivo ("open" system) effects. In some instances, pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic reasoning has been successful to remedy these shortcomings. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Clearly, capricious use of multiples of efficacious in vitro concentrations in the absence of a clear scientific rationale may jeopardize the selection process as well as onwards clinical drug development. In turn, this may lead to underpredictions or overpredictions and ultimately erroneous conclusions with respect to drug efficacy as well as therapeutic benefit/adverse event ratio estimates. Gleeson and coworkers assessed the generic relationship between therapeutic doses, in vitro potency, and physicochemical properties. 1 They concluded that high in vitro drug potency does not necessarily predict in vivo benefit, partly because of poorer pharmacokinetic properties.

### Mechanisms of drug combinations: interaction and network perspectives [^112TAwBq]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2009). Medium credibility.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying synergistic, potentiative and antagonistic effects of drug combinations could facilitate the discovery of novel efficacious combinations and multi-targeted agents. In this article, we describe an extensive investigation of the published literature on drug combinations for which the combination effect has been evaluated by rigorous analysis methods and for which relevant molecular interaction profiles of the drugs involved are available. Analysis of the 117 drug combinations identified reveals general and specific modes of action, and highlights the potential value of molecular interaction profiles in the discovery of novel multicomponent therapies.

### Cellular and molecular mechanisms of metformin action [^114Qeu86]. Endocrine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

ESSENTIAL POINTS

Metformin's glucose-lowering effect in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes is primarily due to inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis, while muscle and gut microbiota effects are largely secondary
Hepatic gluconeogenesis is regulated through 4 distinct mechanisms: transcription, allosteric, substrate availability, and redox
Metformin inhibition of complex I is only observed at millimolar concentrations that are not therapeutically relevant
Metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis both in vitro and in vivo in a redox-dependent manner
Increased cytosolic redox state, due to metformin inhibition of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, is observed at clinically relevant concentrations, and this is the only proposed mechanism of action that predicts substrate-selective (glycerol and lactate) inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis

Metformin is the most widely prescribed drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is considered an "essential medicine" by the World Health Organization. Several studies have shown that metformin effectively improves glycemic control in patients with T2D, yet it rarely causes hypoglycemia due to its remarkable safety profile. Metformin's antidiabetic effect is primarily due to inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis; however, its mechanism of action remains a subject of debate. In this review, we will discuss proposed mechanisms of action of metformin in the context of initial studies in patients with T2D dating back several decades through the most recent studies to date.

We begin with a brief section ("Historical Overview") summarizing the events that led from metformin's initial discovery to its widespread clinical use. We then review early studies performed in patients with T2D ("Insights From Metformin's Effects on Glucose Metabolism in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes") that provided critical insights to metformin's mechanism of action in humans. These initial studies provided key evidence showing inhibition of hepatic glucose production (HGP) as a major mechanism of metformin action and established a pattern of tissue distribution that led to the identification of the transporters required for metformin uptake by the liver. In the next section ("Regulation of Hepatic Gluconeogenesis"), we summarize the major mechanisms of hepatic gluconeogenesis regulation, including allosteric, transcriptional, substrate, and redox. Finally, we review the proposed mechanisms by which metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis ("Proposed Mechanisms by Which Metformin Inhibits Hepatic Gluconeogenesis"), focusing on metformin inhibition of complex I leading to reductions in hepatocellular energy charge and other downstream events (eg, adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase [AMPK] activation, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase inhibition, inhibition of glucagon signaling), as well as an alternative hypothesis involving metformin induction of increased hepatocellular cytosolic redox state leading to decreased conversion of glycerol and lactate to glucose.

### Mechanism of action of colchicine in the treatment of gout [^112GzpQJ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aims of this article were to systematically review the literature about the mechanism of action of colchicine in the multimodal pathology of acute inflammation associated with gout and to consider the clinical utility of colchicine in other chronic inflammatory diseases.

Methods

The English-language literature on PubMed was searched for articles published between 1990 and October 2013, with a cross-reference to citations across all years. Relevant articles pertaining to the mechanism of action of colchicine and the clinical applications of colchicine in gout and other inflammatory conditions were identified and reviewed.

Findings

The molecular pathology of acute inflammation associated with gouty arthritis involves several concurrent pathways triggered by a variety of interactions between monosodium urate crystals and the surface of cells. Colchicine modulates multiple pro- and antiinflammatory pathways associated with gouty arthritis. Colchicine prevents microtubule assembly and thereby disrupts inflammasome activation, microtubule-based inflammatory cell chemotaxis, generation of leukotrienes and cytokines, and phagocytosis. Many of these cellular processes can be found in other diseases involving chronic inflammation. The multimodal mechanism of action of colchicine suggests potential efficacy of colchicine in other comorbid conditions associated with gout, such as osteoarthritis and cardiovascular disease.

Implications

Colchicine has multiple mechanisms of action that affect inflammatory processes and result in its utility for treating and preventing acute gout flare. Other chronic inflammatory diseases that invoke these molecular pathways may represent new therapeutic applications for colchicine.

### Spinal cord stimulation in chronic pain: mode of action [^114Gxf4V]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design

Literature review.

Objective

A review of the literature that presents a perspective on mechanisms of actions behind spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy for chronic pain.

Summary Of Background Data

SCS is an effective therapeutic alternative for the treatment of intractable chronic pain. Its application has been mostly based on the gate control theory of pain. Computational models have been fundamental on the understanding of clinical observations and the design of therapies that provide optimal neuromodulation. Research has provided insight into the involvement of specific neurotransmitters that support segmental and supraspinal mechanisms of action.

Methods

A literature review was performed with emphasis on mechanisms of action for SCS including the effects of electrical fields on spinal cord structures based on computational models and preclinical and clinical explorations.

Results

This review provides background on the development of SCS, which has been driven around a paresthesia-based paradigm as a result of the gate control theory. A review of computational models emphasizes their importance on our current understanding of the mechanism of action and clinical optimization of therapy. Electrophysiology and molecular biology have provided a closer, yet narrow, view of the effect of SCS on neurotransmitters and their receptors, which have led to the formulation of segmental and supraspinal mechanisms. Literature supporting the involvement of glial cells in chronic pain and their characteristic response to electrical fields should motivate further investigation of mechanisms involving neuroglia. Finally, a review of recent results paresthesia-free strategies should encourage research on mechanisms of action.

Conclusion

The mechanisms of SCS have been extensively studied and several consistent phenomena have emerged. The activation of A-beta fibers to induce paresthesia also involve neurotransmitter release via segmental and supraspinal pathways. Despite advancements, much remains to be understood, particularly as new stimulation strategies are developed.

### Smoflipid [^1168Y3WC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

SMOFlipid provides a biologically utilizable source of calories and essential fatty acids.

Fatty acids serve as an important substrate for energy production. The most common mechanism of action for energy production derived from fatty acid metabolism is beta oxidation. Fatty acids are also important for membrane structure and function, as precursors for bioactive molecules (such as prostaglandins), and as regulators of gene expression.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamic effects of SMOFlipid have not been fully characterized.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

SMOFlipid provides fatty acids in the form of triglycerides which are hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase to release free fatty acids. Alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid are metabolized within a common biochemical pathway through a series of desaturation and elongation steps. Downstream products of alpha-linolenic acid are EPA and DHA, and linoleic acid is converted to arachidonic acid.

### Fulvestrant: an oestrogen receptor antagonist with a novel mechanism of action [^116op8t6]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

New hormonal therapies with novel mechanisms of action that are not cross-resistant with the existing treatments make important additions to the repertoire of treatments for breast cancer. This enables additional endocrine agents to be used sequentially, with the aim of extending the effective duration of well-tolerated treatment before cytotoxic chemotherapy becomes necessary.

Fulvestrant ('Faslodex') is the first of a new type of endocrine treatment – an oestrogen receptor (ER) antagonist that downregulates the ER and has no agonist effects. An understanding of ER signalling is essential to distinguish between the mode of action of fulvestrant and that of tamoxifen and the other selective ER modulators (SERMs). This article summarises the current knowledge of oestrogen signalling, and outlines the mechanism of action of fulvestrant.

### The mechanisms of action of tumor treating fields [^115bGeQJ]. Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

TTFields are a new cancer treatment modality that is currently FDA-approved for two different tumor types. Preclinical studies have shown multiple downstream effects of TTFields on cancer cells, as outlined above. Combinational studies using drugs that target mitosis, ER stress, autophagy, and DNA replication stress in combination with TTFields may be beneficial in this setting. For tumors where drug penetration is a concern, studies combining standard therapies with TTFields should be considered given its effects on the blood brain barrier and cell membrane permeability. It is well known that intratumoral immune responses may spread to nontreated tumors. Therefore, studies of TTFields targeting large volume areas of disease, or areas with known low response rates such as the liver, in combination with anti–PD-1 and other emerging immunotherapies should be considered as well. Translational studies accompanying clinical trials are crucial for deeper understanding of TTFields mechanism of action and potential use. Given the many mechanisms of action, TTFields have potential to be effectively combined with many types of anticancer therapy for many tumor types.

### Regulatory safety learning driven by the mechanism of action: the case of TNF-α inhibitors [^114WVw2w]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

The occurrence of many ADRs is a direct consequence of the mechanism of action of a drug. Such ADRs are likely to also occur in users of another drug with the same mechanism of action. For example, artery dissections and aneurysms were found to be associated with the use of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (VEGF‐inhibitors). These ADRs are applicable to all VEGF‐inhibitors, as VEGF inhibition impairs the vascular wall integrity. Moreover, tuberculosis infections associated with infliximab use were detected during the postmarketing phase and are considered a class effect of the TNF‐α inhibitors.TNF‐α is a pro‐inflammatory cytokine that plays a central role in the immune response against tuberculosis infection. Treatment with TNF‐α inhibitors can therefore reactivate latent tuberculosis infections.

In order to adequately inform prescribers and patients about the safety profile of the drug, ADRs that are linked to the mechanism of action are expected to be described in the product information of all drugs with the same mechanism of action. Previous studies showed a variability in to what extent safety information is presented as part of the regulatory assessment for drugs within the same class. For example, Stefansdottir et al. showed that only 40% of the ADRs that were identified in the product information of two drugs within the same class (based on indication, mechanism of action, and structure of the drug) were described in the product information of both drugs. Another study showed that serious safety issues identified prior to the approval of HIV drugs were taken into account in the approval process of other drugs within the same class. These studies focused either on serious safety events or on a selection of drugs within the same class and therefore did not reflect the complete picture of the dynamics of incorporating class effects in the product information.

### Mechanisms of action of antiepileptic drugs: the search for synergy [^111jn5EY]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to review rational polytherapy of antiepileptic drugs in terms of conventional and novel mechanisms of action, consider combinations that might be beneficial when used as polytherapy, and discuss whether animal models can predict clinical efficacy.

Recent Findings

Many patients with epilepsy require concurrent treatment with more than one antiepileptic drug (rational polytherapy), but there is little information available as to which drugs might work best in combination. Conventional antiepileptic drugs act by blocking sodium channels or enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid function. Some newer antiepileptic drugs have novel mechanisms of action, including impairment of the slow inactivation of sodium channels, binding to the presynaptic vesicle protein SV2A, binding to the calcium channel alpha2delta subunit, and opening select potassium channels. Several antiepileptic drugs have multiple or uncertain mechanisms of action. Quantitative techniques such as isobolography can be used to compare the efficacy and side effects of antiepileptic drug combinations in animals. However, neither such methods nor antiepileptic drug mechanisms of action have yet proven useful in predicting clinical benefit in patients.

Summary

Animal models can be used to help predict drug combinations that might be effective clinically, based on novel mechanisms of action. However, at this point, antiepileptic drug choice in patients with epilepsy remains empirical.

### Zinc sulfate [^116h1nwj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Zinc is an essential trace element. Zinc functions as a cofactor of various enzymes including DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases, alcohol dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatases. Zinc is a coordinator of protein structural folding, such as folding of "Zinc finger" motif that interacts with a variety of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. In addition, zinc is a catalyst of essential biochemical reactions, including activation of substrates of carbonic anhydrase in erythrocyte. Also, zinc is a signaling mediator modulating multiple signaling pathways.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Zinc sulfate exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic responses are unknown.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Distribution

Over 85% of total body zinc is found in skeletal muscle and bone. Other organs containing zinc are the liver, kidney, skin, brain, and heart. In blood, zinc is mainly localized within erythrocytes.

Approximately 80% of serum zinc is bound to albumin and the remainder to alpha2-macroglobulin and amino acids.

Elimination

In adults, zinc is primarily excreted via the gastrointestinal tract and eliminated in the feces.

A smaller amount of zinc is excreted via the kidneys in the urine. Urinary zinc excretion rates in very low birth weight preterm infants are relatively high in the neonatal period, and they decline to a level on a body weight basis that is similar to that of normal adults by two months of age. Additionally, endogenous zinc loss occurs from hair, skin desquamation and sweat.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline on pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia [^111uHwqw]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Inclisiran clinical considerations describe a mechanism of action targeting PCSK9 production and LDL receptor upregulation to reduce LDL-C, an approved role as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for adults with primary hyperlipidemia (including HeFH or ASCVD) who require additional LDL-C lowering, a recommended dose of 284 mg administered by a health care professional as a single subcutaneous injection initially, again at 3 months, and then every 6 months thereafter, and twice a year dosing viewed as attractive for adherence but associated with large costs and additional administrative burdens with potential negative equity impacts; despite LDL-C reduction and FDA approval for lowering LDL-C, limited evidence prevented determining the balance of cardiovascular and mortality benefits versus harms, and longer-term cardiovascular outcomes trials are needed.

### Raloxifene (raloxifene hydrochloride) [^115LWhyM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Raloxifene is an estrogen agonist/antagonist, commonly referred to as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). The biological actions of raloxifene are largely mediated through binding to estrogen receptors. This binding results in activation of estrogenic pathways in some tissues (agonism) and blockade of estrogenic pathways in others (antagonism). The agonistic or antagonistic action of raloxifene depends on the extent of recruitment of coactivators and corepressors to estrogen receptor (ER) target gene promoters.

Raloxifene appears to act as an estrogen agonist in bone. It decreases bone resorption and bone turnover, increases bone mineral density (BMD) and decreases fracture incidence. Preclinical data demonstrate that raloxifene is an estrogen antagonist in uterine and breast tissues. These results are consistent with findings in clinical trials, which suggest that raloxifene hydrochloride lacks estrogen-like effects on the uterus and breast tissue.

### Differences in mechanism of action between current and future antidepressants [^116ipfyv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Antidepressants are divided into several classes on the basis of their pharmacologic mechanisms of action, which are thought to be responsible for both their therapeutic actions and their side effect profiles. All classes currently available in the United States affect serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or dopamine neurotransmission. New agents in development also affect neurotransmission of such monoamines and include serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-selective agents, selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Treatments with entirely new mechanisms of action are also being studied, including hormone-linked treatments such as estrogen replacement therapy and the steroid antagonist mifepristone (RU-486 or C-1073); novel antagonist peptides such as corticotropin-releasing factor, neurokinins, and injectable pentapeptides; and agents that affect glutamate neurotransmission. The introduction of antidepressants with novel mechanisms of action could potentially revolutionize the treatment of depression.

### Raloxifene hydrochloride [^115HuidL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Raloxifene is an estrogen agonist/antagonist, commonly referred to as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). The biological actions of raloxifene are largely mediated through binding to estrogen receptors. This binding results in activation of estrogenic pathways in some tissues (agonism) and blockade of estrogenic pathways in others (antagonism). The agonistic or antagonistic action of raloxifene depends on the extent of recruitment of coactivators and corepressors to estrogen receptor (ER) target gene promoters.

### Celecoxib (Celebrex) [^111ssxkG]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Celecoxib has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.

The mechanism of action of CELEBREX is believed to be due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, primarily via inhibition of COX-2.

Celecoxib is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Celecoxib concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Since celecoxib is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Platelets

In clinical trials using normal volunteers, CELEBREX at single doses up to 800 mg and multiple doses of 600 mg twice daily for up to 7 days duration (higher than recommended therapeutic doses) had no effect on reduction of platelet aggregation or increase in bleeding time. Because of its lack of platelet effects, CELEBREX is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis. It is not known if there are any effects of CELEBREX on platelets that may contribute to the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic adverse events associated with the use of CELEBREX.

Fluid Retention

Inhibition of PGE2 synthesis may lead to sodium and water retention through increased reabsorption in the renal medullary thick ascending loop of Henle and perhaps other segments of the distal nephron. In the collecting ducts, PGE2 appears to inhibit water reabsorption by counteracting the action of antidiuretic hormone.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Celecoxib exhibits dose-proportional increase in exposure after oral administration up to 200 mg twice daily and less than proportional increase at higher doses. It has extensive distribution and high protein binding. It is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 with a half-life of approximately 11 hours.

Absorption

Peak plasma levels of celecoxib occur approximately 3 hours after an oral dose. Under fasting conditions, both peak plasma levels (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) are roughly dose-proportional up to 200 mg twice daily; at higher doses there are less than proportional increases in Cmaxand AUC (see Food Effects). Absolute bioavailability studies have not been conducted. With multiple dosing, steady-state conditions are reached on or before Day 5. The pharmacokinetic parameters of celecoxib in a group of healthy subjects are shown in Table 4.

### Sitagliptin [^1126dZ56]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses.

### Galantamine [^113ntxem]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Although the etiology of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not fully understood, it has been reported that acetylcholine-producing neurons degenerate in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The degree of this cholinergic loss has been correlated with degree of cognitive impairment and density of amyloid plaques (a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease).

Galantamine, a tertiary alkaloid, is a competitive and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. While the precise mechanism of galantamine's action is unknown, it is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase. If this mechanism is correct, galantamine's effect may lessen as the disease process advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact. There is no evidence that galantamine alters the course of the underlying dementing process.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of galantamine are linear over a dose range of 8–32 mg/day.

Absorption and Distribution

Galantamine is absorbed with time to peak concentration of about 1 hour. The absolute bioavailability of galantamine is about 90%. The bioavailability of the tablet formulation was the same as the bioavailability of the oral solution formulation. Food did not affect the AUC of galantamine, but Cmaxwas decreased by 25% and Tmaxwas delayed by 1.5 hours, when galantamine was administered with food. The mean volume of distribution of galantamine is 175 L.

The plasma protein binding of galantamine is 18% at therapeutically relevant concentrations. In whole blood, galantamine is mainly distributed to blood cells (52.7%). The blood to plasma concentration ratio of galantamine is 1.2.

### Antipsychotic drug mechanisms: links between therapeutic effects, metabolic side effects and the insulin signaling pathway [^114voZ5J]. Molecular Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The exact therapeutic mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs remains unclear. Recent evidence has shown that second-generation antipsychotic drugs (SGAs) are differentially associated with metabolic side effects compared to first-generation antipsychotic drugs (FGAs). Their proclivity to cause metabolic disturbances correlates, to some degree, with their comparative efficacy. This is particularly the case for clozapine and olanzapine. In addition, the insulin signaling pathway is vital for normal brain development and function. Abnormalities of this pathway have been found in persons with schizophrenia and antipsychotic drugs may ameliorate some of these alterations. This prompted us to hypothesize that the therapeutic antipsychotic and adverse metabolic effects of antipsychotic drugs might be related to a common pharmacologic mechanism. This article reviews insulin metabolism in the brain and related abnormalities associated with schizophrenia with the goals of gaining insight into antipsychotic drug effects and possibly also into the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Finally, we speculate about one potential mechanism of action (that is, functional selectivity) that would be consistent with the data reviewed herein and make suggestions for the future investigation that is required before a therapeutic agent based on these data can be realized.

### Why Do SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only 30–50% of renal glucose reabsorption in humans? [^115KSLcv]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a novel and promising treatment for diabetes under late-stage clinical development. It generally is accepted that SGLT2 mediates 90% of renal glucose reabsorption. However, SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical development inhibit only 30–50% of the filtered glucose load. Why are they unable to inhibit 90% of glucose reabsorption in humans? We will try to provide an explanation to this puzzle in this perspective analysis of the unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical trials and examine possible mechanisms and molecular properties that may be responsible.

### Rivastigmine (rivastigmine transdermal system) [^1138Qg87]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Although the precise mechanism of action of rivastigmine is unknown, it is thought to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase. The effect of rivastigmine may lessen as the disease process advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact. There is no evidence that rivastigmine alters the course of the underlying dementing process.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

After a 6-mg oral dose of rivastigmine in humans, anticholinesterase activity is present in cerebrospinal fluid for about 10 hours, with a maximum inhibition of about 60% 5 hours after dosing.

In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that the inhibition of cholinesterase by rivastigmine is not affected by the concomitant administration of memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist.

### Signal transduction for clinicians: why should we care? [^1116JXBG]. Pediatric Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Neurons must respond to a bewildering array of external and internal stimuli and must distinguish among them to generate an appropriate response or change in metabolic or electrical activity. Furthermore, the response of a cell to a given stimulus must depend on what else is happening inside and outside the cell at the time of arrival of that stimulus. The process of signal transduction is what gives the cell and organism the flexibility and "knowledge base" to carry out these functions. Conversely, aberrations of signal transduction underlie an increasing array of developmental, genetic, and acquired diseases and conditions of the nervous system. Pharmacological modulation of signal transduction pathways and their effectors holds great promise for the remediation of these neurologic disorders.

### The role and mechanisms of action of microRNAs in cancer drug resistance [^1116gVGs]. Clinical Epigenetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The discovery of miRNAs has deepened our understanding of human diseases, including cancer. In this article, we have reviewed miRNAs that regulate resistance to chemotherapy in different tumors. The expression of miRNAs is regulated by a series of factors and dysregulated miRNA expression often leads to antitumor drug resistance. The interaction of miRNAs with mRNA, protein, and other non-encoding RNA constitutes their whole regulatory network. The complexity of this network gives miRNAs a wide range of biological functions, which, at the same time, ensure its great potential for clinical application. For example, the "inhibition" or the "replacement" treatment strategy can be performed based on the upregulation or downregulation of miRNAs in cancer cells, respectively. In addition, the expression of miRNAs has been validated as prognosis indicators in patients with certain cancers. Last but not least, miRNAs could act as promising clinical cancer biomarkers. However, there is still a long way before complete clinical applications of miRNAs are fully developed.

As mentioned above, miRNAs are considered to have great potential in the treatment of cancer. Indeed, the efficacy and safety of miRNA-related treatments are better than those of treatments based on siRNA. Although the role of miRNA in reversing drug resistance is unquestionable, there are still several important issues that need to be further addressed. First, due to the heterogeneity of tumor cells and the diversity of anticancer drugs, some miRNAs have different regulatory effects on drug resistance in different types of tumors, some even being the opposite. Therefore, it is necessary to further and extensively confirm the mechanisms and effects of these miRNAs regulating cellular drug resistance and to screen some of the miRNAs with broad-spectrum regulation of resistance for mechanism research and clinical development. Second, in vitro studies are abundant, whereas in vivo studies are still relatively rare. Given the complexity of the animal's internal environment, some miRNAs that exhibit good regulation of drug resistance in in vitro studies may not necessarily be effective in vivo. Therefore, the effects of most of the miRNAs need to be further verified in vivo. Third, miRNAs are large molecules; therefore, studies regarding their timely and effective targeting and entry into tumor cells in the body require attention. At present, there are very few studies in this field. Methods such as coupling specific tumor ligands onto the surface of the miRNA-based drugs ensure that miRNAs can be transported to tumor tissues to a greater extent, as well as reduce the side effects and improve the safety of miRNA drugs. Fourth, the safety of miRNAs in vivo has yet to be evaluated systematically.

### Telmisartan [^115b3tVU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.

There is also an AT2receptor found in many tissues, but AT2is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (> 3,000 fold) for the AT1receptor than for the AT2receptor.

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Telmisartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.

Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of telmisartan on blood pressure.

### The use, standardization, and interpretation of brain imaging data in clinical trials of neurodegenerative disorders [^113rVKr2]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacodynamics

The term pharmacodynamics refers to a measurable pharmacological effect of a compound on some aspect of the body's physiology. Target engagement per se does not guarantee a relevant pharmacodynamic effect. Both will be dose-dependent, and the level of target engagement required to achieve a given magnitude of pharmacodynamic effect is dependent on the pharmacological mechanism and nature of the readout. The term pharmacodynamic is sometimes used quite broadly to encompass disease modification (e.g. slowing of brain atrophy or of aggregate accumulation; discussed further below) and could conceivably cover side effects as well, but in drug development it is often used in a more focused way to refer to changes that are biologically proximal to the mechanism of action of the intervention, that ideally can be measured in a small, early-phase trial and de-risk subsequent development.

### Fluticasone furoate (fluticasone furoate ellipta) [^1158uTK8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Fluticasone furoate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. Fluticasone furoate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is approximately 29.9 times that of dexamethasone and 1.7 times that of fluticasone propionate. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.

The precise mechanism through which fluticasone furoate affects asthma symptoms is not known. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. Specific effects of fluticasone furoate demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo models included activation of the glucocorticoid response element, inhibition of pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as NFkB, and inhibition of antigen-induced lung eosinophilia in sensitized rats. These anti‑inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy.

Though effective for the treatment of asthma, corticosteroids may not affect symptoms immediately. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. When corticosteroids are discontinued, asthma stability may persist for several days or longer.

Trials in subjects with asthma have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti‑inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects with recommended doses of orally inhaled fluticasone furoate. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti‑inflammatory effect, negligible oral systemic bioavailability (approximately 1.3%), and the minimal pharmacological activity of the metabolites detected in man.

Aspirin — mechanism of action involves permanent cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition via acetylation and downstream effects on thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and prostacyclin (PGI2): The best-characterized mechanism of action of aspirin is related to its capacity to permanently inhibit the COX activity of prostaglandin H-synthase-1 and prostaglandin H-synthase-2 (also referred to as COX-1 and COX-2, respectively); the molecular mechanism of permanent inhibition of COX activity by aspirin is related to blockade of the COX channel as a consequence of acetylation of a strategically located serine residue (Ser529 in COX-1, Ser516 in COX-2), thereby preventing substrate access; human platelets and vascular endothelial cells process PGH2 to produce primarily TXA2 and PGI2, respectively, with TXA2 inducing platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction and PGI2 inhibiting platelet aggregation and inducing vasodilatation; because TXA2 is largely derived from COX-1 (mostly from platelets), it is highly sensitive to aspirin inhibition, whereas the major source of vascular PGI2 is COX-2, even under physiologic conditions.

### Integrating systems biology sources illuminates drug action [^111Y98hw]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

There are significant gaps in our understanding of the pathways by which drugs act. This incomplete knowledge limits our ability to use mechanistic molecular information rationally to repurpose drugs, understand their side effects, and predict their interactions with other drugs. Here, we present DrugRouter, a novel method for generating drug-specific pathways of action by linking target genes, disease genes, and pharmacogenes using gene interaction networks. We construct pathways for more than a hundred drugs and show that the genes included in our pathways (i) co-occur with the query drug in the literature, (ii) significantly overlap or are adjacent to known drug-response pathways, and (iii) are adjacent to genes that are hits in genome-wide association studies assessing drug response. Finally, these computed pathways suggest novel drug-repositioning opportunities (e.g., statins for follicular thyroid cancer), gene-side effect associations, and gene-drug interactions. Thus, DrugRouter generates hypotheses about drug actions using systems biology data.

### Assessing pharmacodynamic effects of antiplatelet agents with different mechanisms of action [^117XuKCy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The methodologic issues identified here underscore the challenges associated with predicting clinical outcomes with pharmacodynamic studies and support a standardized approach to pharmacodynamic assessment. In addition, they underscore the premise that results from pharmacodynamic studies should not outweigh established clinical efficacy. Tirofiban inhibits aggregation of platelets; however, a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor does not inhibit other aspects of platelet activation such as platelet‐leukocyte aggregation, release of granular products, and the promotion of thrombin generation. Cangrelor inhibits activation of platelets mediated by P2Y 12 that limits amplification by agonists such as thrombin and collagen. 5 The clinical implications of the differing pharmacodynamic effects have not been defined. A randomized clinical trial appropriately sized to compare clinical events is required to determine whether 1 agent is superior in the prevention of clinical events.

### Valsartan [^115uMVPD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Valsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.

There is also an AT2receptor found in many tissues, but AT2is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Valsartan has much greater affinity (about 20,000-fold) for the AT1receptor than for the AT2receptor. The increased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1receptor blockade with valsartan may stimulate the unblocked AT2receptor. The primary metabolite of valsartan is essentially inactive with an affinity for the AT1receptor about one-200th(1/200th) that of valsartan itself.

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because valsartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin.

### Raloxifene hydrochloride (evista) [^115iPiBi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Raloxifene is an estrogen agonist/antagonist, commonly referred to as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). The biological actions of raloxifene are largely mediated through binding to estrogen receptors.

Raloxifene appears to act as an estrogen agonist in bone. It decreases bone resorption and bone turnover, increases bone mineral density (BMD) and decreases fracture incidence. Preclinical data demonstrate that raloxifene is an estrogen antagonist in uterine and breast tissues. These results are consistent with findings in clinical trials, which suggest that EVISTA lacks estrogen-like effects on the uterus and breast tissue.

### Interactions between antidiabetic drugs and herbs: an overview of mechanisms of action and clinical implications [^117Mh97o]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

It is worth pointing out however, that most studies presented in this review do not distinguish the difference between synergistic and additive effects. A synergistic effect is defined as the total effect produced by a combination of two or more components which is greater than the sum of the individual therapy, whilst an additive effect is simply the sum of individual effects, such that each individual component does not affect the other(s), i.e. no interaction. To this end, it is somewhat problematic to use the term 'interaction' unless synergy is proven. Determination of synergism is a complex process especially for HDIs, where numerous bioactive components may be involved. The current models such as isobolographic analysis and the combination index are designed to evaluate the interactions of a small number of active components acting on a single biological target. System-to-system or systems biology methodology is a more appropriate model for the evaluation of more complex interactions but its use is often limited by the availability of the relevant chemical and pharmacological data, especially in complex herbal interventions. Research is essential to develop robust and viable models for assessing herb–drug and herb–herb interactions. Such information is critical to guide the clinical use of these combinations.

There are a number of challenges facing herbal medicine including scant information about their active constituents, lack of detailed product information, complexity due to multiple chemical components and pharmacological targets, variation in source of herbal material, lack of standardization and batch–batch reproducibility and of certification of authenticity of herbs used in manufacture. Additionally, the existing scientific evidence, particularly clinical, to support the use of herbal medicine remains at the lower levels, and the robustness of the methods used has often been inadequate. This highlights the need for further rigorous scientific research to validate the clinical effectiveness and mechanisms of action of herbal medicine as well as complementary medicine in general. Equally important, we need to better our understanding and rigorously document the potential risks associated with herb–drug interactions given the high prevalence of their concurrent use with pharmaceutical medicines, especially for the management of chronic diseases such as diabetes. Conversely, it is important to keep in mind that these interactions may also present therapeutic benefits as a result of synergism which may lead to enhanced drug effects or reduced adverse reactions.

### Mechanism-based cancer therapy: resistance to therapy, therapy for resistance [^111pQa7W]. Oncogene (2015). Low credibility.

The introduction of targeted therapy promised personalized and efficacious cancer treatments. However, although some targeted therapies have undoubtedly improved prognosis and outcome for specific cancer patients, the recurrent problem of therapeutic resistance subdues present revolutionary claims in this field. The plasticity of tumor cells leads to the development of drug resistance by distinct mechanisms: (1) mutations in the target, (2) reactivation of the targeted pathway, (3) hyperactivation of alternative pathways and (4) cross-talk with the microenvironment. Moreover, the intra-tumor heterogeneity of most tumors can also limit therapeutic response. Interestingly, the early identification of some mechanisms of resistance led to the use of alternative agents that improved clinical benefit, demonstrating that an understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving resistance to specific therapies is of paramount importance. Here we review the most generalized mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies, together with some experimental strategies employed to identify such mechanisms. Therapeutic failure is not an option and we need to understand the dynamics of tumor adaptation in order to adequately adjust therapies; in essence 'to fight fire with fire'.

### New understanding of mechanisms of action of bipolar medications [^116PCGjz]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The classical models of mood disorder pathophysiology and mechanism of antidepressant or mood stabilizing drug action focused on neurochemical deficits and the ability of medications to correct these deficits. Recent studies suggest alterations in neuroplasticity and cellular resiliency may be more closely related to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorders, as well as the mechanism of action related to effective treatments. Patients with mood disorders have been found to exhibit evidence of neuroplastic changes, such as reductions in hippocampal and cortical volume, glial and neuronal cell density, and levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor; chronic stress, a major precipitator of depression, has been shown to cause many of the same neuroplastic changes to occur in animal models. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating neuroplasticity and their relationship to the pathophysiology of depression may provide insights into how current treatments work and point to novel targets for more efficacious treatments for patients with mood disorders.

### Does in vitro potency predict clinically efficacious concentrations? [^114Y1V54]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ In vitro potency is commonly used alone, or in combination with preclinical in vivo data, to predict clinically therapeutic exposure levels. But there is limited knowledge regarding how predictive in vitro potency is in general to estimate the therapeutic drug exposure.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ This study addressed the general relationship between clinical unbound therapeutic concentrations and in vitro potency, how they may differ depending on therapeutic indication, mode of action, receptor type, target localization and function, and potential drug discovery and development implications from this analysis.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ The results emphasize that generic predictions of in vivo efficacious concentration based on in vitro potency may be highly variable and may lack biological significance. The data additionally identify sources to variability and their relative impact upon predictions of in vitro –to– in vivo clinically efficacious exposure levels.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ This might provide an enlightened awareness of factors to consider when relating therapeutic exposure to in vitro potency. It also provides the scientist with a quantitative level of confidence on how predictive in vitro potency alone is to estimate therapeutically efficacious drug exposure levels.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Zinc is an essential trace element. Zinc functions as a cofactor of various enzymes including DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases, alcohol dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatases. Zinc is a coordinator of protein structural folding, such as folding of "Zinc finger" motif that interacts with a variety of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. In addition, zinc is a catalyst of essential biochemical reactions, including activation of substrates of carbonic anhydrase in erythrocyte. Also, zinc is a signaling mediator modulating multiple signaling pathways.

Zinc sulfate exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic responses are unknown.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics:

Distribution

Over 85% of total body zinc is found in skeletal muscle and bone. Other organs containing zinc are the liver, kidney, skin, brain, and heart. In blood, zinc is mainly localized within erythrocytes. Approximately 80% of serum zinc is bound to albumin and the remainder to alpha2-macroglobulin and amino acids.

Elimination

In adults, zinc is primarily excreted via the gastrointestinal tract and eliminated in the feces. A smaller amount of zinc is excreted via the kidneys in the urine. Urinary zinc excretion rates in very low birth weight preterm infants are relatively high in the neonatal period, and they decline to a level on a body weight basis that is similar to that of normal adults by two months of age. Additionally, endogenous zinc loss occurs from hair, skin desquamation and sweat.

### Pharmacological rationale for tapentadol therapy: a review of new evidence [^116qFNEg]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Pharmacology of tapentadol

Mechanism of action

Tapentadol is a novel, centrally acting analgesic drug. It is the first representative of a new class of drugs, which can be referred to as MOR-NRI drugs, and it displays an analgesic efficacy comparable or superior to that of strong classical opioids such as oxycodone and morphine. Notewor thy, this molecule was synthetized by a rational drug-design program aimed at defining a molecule characterized by both MOR and NRI activity. Despite a 50-fold lower affinity for MOR and relatively moderate NRI activity (Ki = 0.48 μM for rat synaptosomal uptake inhibition) tapentadol potency is comparable to that of morphine across a variety of preclinical pain models. As previously documented, such potency cannot be explained by a simple additive effect, but rather by a synergistic interaction between the two distinct mechanisms of action within the single molecule. Thanks to this intricate interaction and mutual enhancement of the individual effects, relatively moderate receptor activities are sufficient for both mechanisms of action to achieve a strong analgesic effect by acting on both ascending and descending pathways (Figure 2). Importantly, the two mechanisms do not interact synergistically on the burden of adverse effects. Remarkably, a very recent study suggested that the "μ-load" of tapentadol is ≤ 40%, relative to pure MOR agonists, which have, by definition a μ-load of 100%. This reduced μ-load likely translates into a more favorable tolerability profile of tapentadol compared with strong classical opioids. Moreover, tapentadol shows minimal serotoninergic activity. This pharmacological profile may have importance in chronic therapy, since the activation of serotoninergic pathways produce pro-algesic effects and may also stimulate emesis over time. The potential synergic effect of tapentadol has also been preliminarily assessed.

### Immunomodulating and anti-apoptotic action of ursodeoxycholic acid: where are we and where should we go? [^112hHA75]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is currently used in clinical practice worldwide not only for the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones, but also, mainly, to treat patients with chronic cholestatic liver diseases. However, the mechanisms of action of UDCA at the hepatocyte and cholangiolyte levels are still not completely understood. Much progress has been made from the first concept that the only mechanism of action of this bile acid was its choleretic action. One of the most fascinating mechanisms of action that was evoked for UDCA is its immunomodulating and anti-apoptotic action, which could, in part, be explained by its interaction with the glucocorticoid nuclear receptor at the hepatocyte level. Glucocorticoids, whose prototype is dexamethasone, are the major ligands of the glucocorticoid receptor. The biological effects of glucocorticoids are driven by a multiple-step reaction including binding of the steroid to the glucocorticoid receptor, DNA binding, receptor transformation, nuclear translocation and either positive or negative gene transactivation. In this issue of the journal, Weitzel and co-workers clearly demonstrated that the binding of UDCA to the glucocorticoid receptor is unspecific. Therefore, the anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic actions of UDCA should be due not only to the mild interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor, but also to transactivation or transrepression of different cytoplasmic proteins that are involved in the survival pathway.

### Aldosterone's mechanism of action: roles of lysine-specific demethylase 1, caveolin and striatin [^112zSfeF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Aldosterone's functions and mechanisms of action are different depending on the tissue and the environmental condition. The mineralocorticoid receptor is present in tissues beyond epithelial cells, including the heart and vessels. Furthermore, aldosterone has direct adverse effects by both genomic and rapid/nongenomic actions not only through a nuclear receptor but also through caveolae-mediated intracellular events. Also, multiple environmental-genetic interactions play an important role in salt-sensitive hypertension (SSH) and aldosterone modulation. These findings have reshaped our vision of aldosterone's role in cardiovascular pathophysiology. This review describes new mediators of aldosterone's mechanisms of action: lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), caveolin 1 (cav-1) and striatin.

Recent Findings

LSD1, an epigenetic regulator, is involved in the pathogenesis of SSH in both humans and rodents. In addition, cav-1, the main component of caveolae, plays a substantial role in mediating aldosterone pathways of SSH. The mineralocorticoid receptor interacts with cav-1 and is modulated by sodium intake. Finally, striatin, a scaffolding protein, mediates a novel interaction between signalling molecules and mineralocorticoid receptor's rapid effects in the cardiovascular system.

Summary

Substantial progress in aldosterone's functions and mechanisms of action should facilitate the study of cardiovascular diseases and the role of sodium intake in aldosterone-induced damage.

### Investigative clinical pharmacology [^1118zN4n]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical pharmacology is an essential discipline in the development of new medicines, but the closely specified requirements of pharmaceutical industry protocols and regulatory reviewers have limited the opportunities for curiosity-driven research. Realization is growing that there is so much that is not known about the mechanisms underlying human disease and the actions of medicines on them that research of a more exploratory kind, namely, investigative clinical pharmacology, is a priority.

### The pharmacology underlying the unique antipsychotic efficacy of clozapine [^113GZt8j]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

From this brief assessment of two aspects of the pharmacology of clozapine, it appears unlikely that actions at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors underlie the clinical advantage in efficacy that this drug demonstrates. On the other hand, a mechanism involving alpha2 adrenoreceptors, particularly of the 2C subtype, provides perhaps the best hypothesis for clozapine's unique action. The development of selective alpha2C receptor antagonists available for clinical investigation (e.g.) introduces the opportunity to determine whether adjunctive 2C antagonism might relieve symptoms in some patients resistant to conventional antipsychotic drug treatment. This could offer an alternative to clozapine while potentially avoiding many of its associated adverse effects.

There are important caveats to this conclusion. One is that we should not ignore the possibility that a synergistic action between two, or even more, receptor mechanisms is responsible for clozapine's efficacy. Thus it would be unwise to rule out dopamine D2 antagonism as a necessary component of clozapine pharmacology; other actions, requiring a functional presynaptic serotonin system, may also be important. Furthermore, while a full understanding of clozapine's unique mechanism could theoretically lead to the development of a drug of equivalent efficacy with fewer limiting side effects, such a pharmacotherapy will still leave unrelieved symptoms in many people with a diagnosis of psychotic illness. Clozapine is effective in typically only one half of those people with schizophrenia who meet criteria for treatment resistance; a substantial proportion therefore remain without any clear options for effective pharmacotherapy. Only further effort drawing on an understanding of the underlying neuropathology of schizophrenia, and its pathogenic mechanisms resulting from environmental and genetic risk, is going to enable a rational approach to effective therapeutic management.

### Valsartan oral (valsartan) [^112rM5Kt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Valsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone- secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.

There is also an AT2receptor found in many tissues, but AT2is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Valsartan has much greater affinity (about 20,000-fold) for the AT1receptor than for the AT2receptor. The increased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1receptor blockade with valsartan may stimulate the unblocked AT2receptor. The primary metabolite of valsartan is essentially inactive with an affinity for the AT1receptor about one-200th that of valsartan itself.

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because valsartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Valsartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.

Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of valsartan on blood pressure.

### The placebo effect: why we should care [^115TyDZx]. Clinics in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Contrary to its definition, a placebo is far from an inert substance but carries meaningful responses that can mediate significant outcome results in pharmacotherapeutic studies. The advent of detailed studies and modern imaging techniques have provided the basis to understand the underlying mechanisms of the placebo effect, as well as its localization to determined brain centers. Designing clinical trials using principles of classical conditioning to mediate placebo effects may enhance treatment outcomes and provide novel pharmacotherapeutic modalities.

### How multispecific molecules are transforming pharmacotherapy [^114wK8jB]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2025). High credibility.

Over the past several decades, the pharmaceutical industry has progressed from identifying small-molecule natural products with favourable pharmacological properties mediated by unknown molecular mechanisms, to deliberate engineering of chemical compounds and macro-molecules that alter the activities of prespecified targets in predefined ways. The past quarter century has seen the emergence of an entirely new drug category: multispecific molecular drugs that are prospectively designed to engage two or more entities to exert their pharmacological effect. This design elicits emergent properties that endow the drugs with capabilities that are inaccessible to monospecific therapies. Furthermore, these properties enable multispecific drugs to circumvent biological barriers to pharmacology, including rapid clearance, functional redundancy, on-target/off-tissue toxicity, and lack of druggable features. Here, I describe how a new wave of approved multispecific drugs is recalibrating expectations of what can be achieved through pharmacotherapy.

### Pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions [^116TPQXS]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions (DDIs) occur when the pharmacological effect of one drug is altered by that of another drug in a combination regimen. DDIs often are classified as synergistic, additive, or antagonistic in nature, albeit these terms are frequently misused. Within a complex pathophysiological system, the mechanism of interaction may occur at the same target or through alternate pathways. Quantitative evaluation of pharmacodynamic DDIs by employing modeling and simulation approaches is needed to identify and optimize safe and effective combination therapy regimens. This review investigates the opportunities and challenges in pharmacodynamic DDI studies and highlights examples of quantitative methods for evaluating pharmacodynamic DDIs, with a particular emphasis on the use of mechanism-based modeling and simulation in DDI studies. Advancements in both experimental and computational techniques will enable the application of better, model-informed assessments of pharmacodynamic DDIs in drug discovery, development, and therapeutics.

### The neural basis of psychedelic action [^112zkTVB]. Nature Neuroscience (2022). High credibility.

Psychedelics are serotonin 2A receptor agonists that can lead to profound changes in perception, cognition and mood. In this review, we focus on the basic neurobiology underlying the action of psychedelic drugs. We first discuss chemistry, highlighting the diversity of psychoactive molecules and the principles that govern their potency and pharmacokinetics. We describe the roles of serotonin receptors and their downstream molecular signaling pathways, emphasizing key elements for drug discovery. We consider the impact of psychedelics on neuronal spiking dynamics in several cortical and subcortical regions, along with transcriptional changes and sustained effects on structural plasticity. Finally, we summarize neuroimaging results that pinpoint effects on association cortices and thalamocortical functional connectivity, which inform current theories of psychedelic action. By synthesizing knowledge across the chemical, molecular, neuronal, and network levels, we hope to provide an integrative perspective on the neural mechanisms responsible for the acute and enduring effects of psychedelics on behavior.

### Ziprasidone [^113jxwoS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of action of ziprasidone in the treatment of the listed indications could be mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Ziprasidone binds with relatively high affinity to the dopamine D2and D3, serotonin 5HT2A, 5HT2C, 5HT1A, 5HT1D, and α1-adrenergic receptors (Kis of 4.8, 7.2, 0.4, 1.3, 3.4, 2, and 10 nM, respectively), and with moderate affinity to the histamine H1receptor (Ki = 47 nM). Ziprasidone is an antagonist at the D2, 5HT2A, and 5HT1Dreceptors, and an agonist at the 5HT1Areceptor. Ziprasidone inhibited synaptic reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. No appreciable affinity was exhibited for other receptor/binding sites tested, including the cholinergic muscarinic receptor (IC50 > 1 mcM).

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Oral Pharmacokinetics

Ziprasidone's activity is primarily due to the parent drug. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone are dose-proportional within the proposed clinical dose range, and ziprasidone accumulation is predictable with multiple dosing. Elimination of ziprasidone is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal half-life of about 7 hours within the proposed clinical dose range. Steady-state concentrations are achieved within one to three days of dosing. The mean apparent systemic clearance is 7.5 mL/min/kg. Ziprasidone is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.

Absorption: Ziprasidone is well absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 6 to 8 hours. The absolute bioavailability of a 20 mg dose under fed conditions is approximately 60%. The absorption of ziprasidone is increased up to two-fold in the presence of food.

Distribution: Ziprasidone has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 1.5 L/kg. It is greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, binding primarily to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. The in vitro plasma protein binding of ziprasidone was not altered by warfarin or propranolol, two highly protein-bound drugs, nor did ziprasidone alter the binding of these drugs in human plasma. Thus, the potential for drug interactions with ziprasidone due to displacement is minimal.

### Why target apoptosis in cancer treatment? [^1111kEDU]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Defective apoptosis (programmed cell death) represents a major causative factor in the development and progression of cancer. The ability of tumor cells to evade engagement of apoptosis can play a significant role in their resistance to conventional therapeutic regimens. Our understanding of the complexities of apoptosis and the mechanisms evolved by tumor cells to resist engagement of cell death has focused research effort into the development of strategies designed to selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells. This article will review the underlying mechanisms of apoptosis and the ways in which tumor cells modulate these processes to promote their survival and evaluate the efficacy of current clinical approaches aimed at exploiting these defects to selectively induce apoptosis in tumor cells.

### Dietary and pharmacologic management to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111xUmcs]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical guideline — pharmacologic therapy for recurrent nephrolithiasis — summarizes mechanism-based selection and scope of evidence. Clinicians often select pharmacologic therapy on the basis of method of action: thiazide diuretics reduce urinary calcium and are often prescribed for patients with hypercalciuria, citrates bind to calcium and decrease urine acidity, and allopurinol decreases uric acid in urine. Almost all studies analyzed included only patients with calcium stones, the most common stone type, and although biochemistry suggests a relationship between pharmacologic method of action and stone type, no randomized, controlled trials link biochemical testing to outcomes. Our recommendations do not include patients with suspected hyperparathyroidism or other rare cases.

### Cancer therapy-induced cardiotoxicity: basic mechanisms and potential cardioprotective therapies [^114CzFwN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Summary

Mechanisms of cancer therapy‐induced cardiotoxicity include a combination of on‐target effects on signaling cascades essential to both cancer progression and normal cardiac function and off‐target effects due to nonselective actions. Effective therapies to treat cancer and cancer therapy–induced cardiotoxicity must either take advantage of tissue‐specific differences or affect the downstream mediators of toxicity, and there are active studies under way to develop new targeted therapies. – Other effective therapies for cardioprotection include typical pharmacologic therapies used in cardiovascular disease that promote increased cardiac reserve and reverse remodeling under the stress of cancer therapy. Most of the data regarding mechanisms of cardiotoxicity due to cancer therapy have been obtained from animal models of this disease process; therefore, further studies to improve our understanding of the relevance of these pathways in humans are necessary.

### Mechanistic / mammalian target of rapamycin and side effects of antipsychotics: insights into mechanisms and implications for therapy [^1111aA7X]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Although progress has been made in elucidating the role of the mTOR pathway in the pathogenesis of antipsychotic-induced side effects, questions remain to be answered. For example, how does dysregulation of mTOR signaling lead to dysfunction of striatal MSNs and the consequent clinical phenotype? Why is the activation of mTOR signaling dependent on D2R? Insights into pathogenesis are expected to pave new roads for medical interventions to mitigate antipsychotic drug-induced metabolic and neurological side effects. However, there are challenges in translating novel research discoveries into future clinical applications.

In this review, we aimed to synthesize recent key findings regarding the hepatic and striatal mTOR pathways in the pathogenesis of metabolic and extrapyramidal side effects, respectively. Furthermore, we discuss implications of normalizing aberrant mTOR pathway activation through pharmacologic and genetic approaches to prevent and manage antipsychotic-induced metabolic and neurologic side effects.

### Interactions between antidiabetic drugs and herbs: an overview of mechanisms of action and clinical implications [^1164FtFM]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a complex condition with a variety of causes and pathophysiologies. The current single target approach has not provided ideal clinical outcomes for the treatment of the disease and its complications. Herbal medicine has been used for the management of various diseases such as diabetes over centuries. Many diabetic patients are known to use herbal medicines with antidiabetic properties in addition to their mainstream treatments, which may present both a benefit as well as potential risk to effective management of their disease. In this review we evaluate the clinical and experimental literature on herb–drug interactions in the treatment of diabetes. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between drugs and herbs are discussed, and some commonly used herbs which can interact with antidiabetic drugs summarised. Herb–drug interactions can be a double-edged sword presenting both risks (adverse drug events) and benefits (through enhancement). There is a general lack of data on herb–drug interactions. As such, more rigorous scientific research is urgently needed to guide clinical practice as well as to safeguard the wellbeing of diabetes patients.

### Mechanisms of adverse effects of anti-VEGF therapy for cancer [^1146ZVg1]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

A growing number of drugs that inhibit VEGF signalling are being used in the treatment of cancer, commonly in combination with chemotherapy. The efficacy of these agents raises hope for patients with otherwise unresponsive tumours. The agents are generally well tolerated, but may be accompanied by distinct adverse effects, including hypertension and proteinuria. Although usually manageable by conventional medical approaches, side effects of VEGF inhibitors tend not to include alopecia, myelosuppression, or neutropenia found with conventional chemotherapy. Instead, most are downstream effects of suppression of VEGF signalling in endothelial cells of normal organs. Among these are endothelial cell dysfunction and regression of fenestrated capillaries. Better understanding of the underlying mechanism of adverse effects, optimal dosing, and ways of monitoring drug actions is becoming increasingly important as VEGF inhibitors are used more widely and applied earlier in disease, in younger patients, and with longer duration.

### COVID-19: immunopathology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatment options [^111BMKjx]. The Journal of Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Current management strategies for COVID‐19 comprise the implementation of preventive (social) measures and vaccination to control viral dissemination, the implementation of supportive care when indicated, and the use of (repurposed) drugs. Considering that de novo development of specific anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 drugs and vaccines takes time, clinical investigations have focused on drug repurposing. The efficacy and safety of many repurposed treatment modalities have been tested in preclinical studies and/or clinical trials, often with mixed results, and many trials are still ongoing.

During the course of the pandemic, progress has been made with regard to patient treatment. Successful treatment may depend on the correct timing of repurposed drugs, which requires an understanding of their mode of action, COVID‐19 pathophysiology, and disease stages. Drugs that inhibit viral entry and replication (i.e. antivirals) may hold more promise when applied early in the disease course, whereas immunomodulating therapy (including corticosteroids and anti‐cytokine antibodies) may have the greatest impact on the hyperinflammatory state in more advanced disease and can even be harmful during the initial stage, when an adequate immune reaction is indispensable for viral clearance. In keeping with this, a useful timeline was recently provided, demonstrating the potential contribution of each repurposed drug class to the treatment of the consecutive stages of COVID‐19. Immunomodulators have been widely used during the pandemic and will probably continue to play an important role. They are thought to act through several key mechanisms: (1) glucocorticoid‐mediated inhibition of pro‐inflammatory signals and activation of anti‐inflammatory signals; (2) inhibition of cytokines; (3) strengthening of antiviral defence by supplementation of IFN; (4) inhibition of the TLR‐signalling pathway; and (5) inhibition of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway.

Based on the aforementioned pathophysiological and immunopathological considerations, we provide a detailed overview of currently advocated repurposed drug therapies with accompanying modes of action and clinical efficacy in Table 1. For an exhaustive list of experimental treatments, the reader is referred to the landscape document of the WHO; the latest recommendations can be found in the living WHO guideline on drugs for COVID‐19.
