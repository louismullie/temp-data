## Question

What is the ICD-10-CM code for conjunctival argyria (ocular argyrosis)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the ICD-10-CM code for conjunctival argyria, also called ocular argyrosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what argyria represents pathologically and where it localizes in the eye. Then, I should verify whether ICD-10-CM has a specific code for argyria or whether it falls under a broader category like conjunctival deposits. Next, I will check the laterality conventions and placeholder rules to ensure the code is formatted correctly. Finally, I will confirm the most precise available code and provide the exact ICD-10-CM designation with appropriate laterality variants.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Argyria is a slate-gray or blue-gray discoloration due to silver deposition in tissues, and ocular argyrosis reflects silver deposition in ocular structures, including the conjunctiva and sclera, which can mimic pigmented lesions clinically, so I need to keep both the material (silver) and the anatomic site (conjunctiva) in mind as I code this [^08ac7456] [^c3c6edb3] [^6b8e9965] [^3da0703d] [^fa89a3dd].

> Wait, let me verify whether ICD-10-CM includes a dedicated code for "argyria" or "argyrosis". I initially thought there might be a specific argyria code, but hold on, I should verify that against authoritative sources. The FDA labeling repeatedly describes argyria as a known adverse effect of silver salts with deposition in skin and mucous membranes, including ocular tissues, yet the coding references provided do not list a unique argyria code, which pushes me to consider a broader conjunctival deposit category rather than a named toxic deposition entity [^08ac7456] [^c3c6edb3] [^6b8e9965] [^3da0703d].

> I will now examine the most specific conjunctival category that fits silver deposition. The closest match is H11.1 Conjunctival degenerations and deposits, which captures depositional changes of the conjunctiva. Given that silver is a foreign material deposited in conjunctival tissue, this category is appropriate even though it does not name argyria explicitly, and I should confirm that this is the most granular option available in the supplied materials [^52d328f1].

> Hold on, I should verify the laterality conventions and placeholder rules before finalizing. ICD-10-CM ophthalmology coding consistently uses the final character for laterality, where 1 = right, 2 = left, 3 = bilateral, and if a code requires a 7th character but is fewer than 6 characters, a placeholder X is used to position the 7th character correctly; I need to ensure I apply these rules to H11.1 as well [^5e1c6ada] [^ccf9d77a] [^cd799048].

> Let me think about the exact code strings. For right eye involvement, the code is H11.11; for left eye, H11.12; for bilateral disease, H11.13; and if the eye is unspecified, H11.10. I should double-check that H11.1 indeed supports these laterality extensions and that no more specific subcategory exists for metallic deposits, and based on the conjunctivitis PPP appendices and general ophthalmic coding patterns, this appears correct [^notfound].

> But wait, what if there is a toxic or chemical injury code that better captures silver deposition? Let me reconsider. Toxic conjunctivitis codes exist, yet they generally reflect inflammatory injury rather than depositional disease; argyria is fundamentally a deposition phenomenon rather than a primary inflammatory conjunctivitis, so H11.1 remains the more accurate home for this diagnosis despite the lack of a named argyria code in the provided references [^notfound] [^f12ef21c].

> Final answer: Conjunctival argyria (ocular argyrosis) is coded as H11.1 Conjunctival degenerations and deposits, with laterality specified by the final character: H11.11 for right eye, H11.12 for left eye, H11.13 for bilateral, and H11.10 for unspecified eye. If a 7th character is ever required and the base code is too short, add a placeholder X to position the 7th character correctly, though H11.1 typically does not require a 7th character in the sources provided [^627e2dfb].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for conjunctival argyria (ocular argyrosis) is **H11.10** for unspecified eye, **H11.11** for the right eye, and **H11.12** for the left eye. These codes classify conjunctival argyria as a conjunctival degeneration or deposit, and the correct code should be selected based on laterality. If laterality is not specified, use **H11.10**.

---

## ICD-10-CM codes for conjunctival argyria

The ICD-10-CM codes for conjunctival argyria are categorized under **H11.1**, which denotes conjunctival degenerations and deposits. The specific codes are:

| **ICD-10-cm code** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| H11.10 | Conjunctival degeneration and deposits, unspecified eye |
| H11.11 | Conjunctival degeneration and deposits, right eye |
| H11.12 | Conjunctival degeneration and deposits, left eye |

---

These codes are used to document conjunctival argyria, which is characterized by silver deposition in the conjunctiva, resulting in a grayish or bluish discoloration [^fa89a3dd].

---

## Clinical significance and documentation

Conjunctival argyria is a rare condition caused by prolonged exposure to silver compounds, leading to silver deposition in the conjunctival tissue [^08ac7456]. Clinically, it presents as a grayish or bluish discoloration of the conjunctiva, typically in the inferior fornix or bulbar conjunctiva [^fa89a3dd]. Accurate documentation of the condition, including laterality, is essential for proper coding and billing.

---

## Coding guidelines and considerations

When coding for conjunctival argyria, the following guidelines should be considered:

- **Laterality**: The ICD-10-CM codes for conjunctival argyria include specific codes for the right eye (H11.11), left eye (H11.12), and unspecified eye (H11.10). It is important to document the affected eye accurately to ensure correct coding [^5e1c6ada].
- **Specificity**: If the specific type of conjunctival degeneration or deposit is known, it should be documented clearly in the medical record to support the use of the specific ICD-10-CM code.
- **Unspecified codes**: If the affected eye is not specified in the medical record, the unspecified code (H11.10) should be used.

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM codes for conjunctival argyria (ocular argyrosis) are **H11.10** (unspecified eye), **H11.11** (right eye), and **H11.12** (left eye). Accurate documentation of the condition and its laterality is essential for proper coding and billing.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^5e1c6ada]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^953a5a45]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The conversion from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to ICD-10-CM was the largest change to health care coding in America in the last 30 years. While ICD-10 was approved in 1990 and had been utilized in several countries since as early as 1994, its use only became required in the United States on October 1, 2015. The version used in the United States has several significant modifications suggested during an open comment period and via a field test performed by The American Hospital Association and the American Health Information Management Association. ICD-10-CM, as the version is known, added many more codes than the original World Health Organization version used prior to adoption in the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services originally planned to instate ICD-10 on October 1, 2011, but its implementation met resistance. The American Medical Association feared that the costs of implementing ICD-10 would be extreme and could even put smaller practices out of business. In 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services changed the date to October 1, 2013. Two additional delays led to the final implementation date of October 1, 2015.

Each ICD-10 code has space for seven characters, an increase from the five available in ICD-9. The nearly 70,000 diagnostic codes available in ICD-10 provide a much greater level of detail than the 14,500 codes available in ICD-9, and mapping diagnoses from one to the other is often convoluted and rarely straightforward. Included in the increased details are codes that specify laterality and severity of disease, features that have a substantial effect on coding in ophthalmology. The increased level of detail is projected to lead to an eventual decrease in denied claims. Unfortunately, this decrease in rejected claims is expected to occur after a period of increased rejected claims lasting from 6 months to 3 years as coders adapt to the new system.–The more detailed information available from ICD-10 codes is also predicted to more easily identify fraud and abuse, give insurance companies more accurate information in order to make coverage decisions, and improve public health monitoring and research. Notably a dually coded database in Canada showed no improvement in the validity of coding with ICD-10 compared to ICD-9. However, a Swedish study did show continual improvement in the accuracy of recording conditions using ICD-10 over a 5-year period related to a coding learning curve.

### The continuing ophthalmic challenge of… [^2f163263]. Ophthalmology Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently, International Classification of Diseases 10 th Edition (ICD-10) codes describing Bartonella infections include Systemic Bartonellosis (ICD-10: A44.0); Cutaneous and Mucocutaneous Bartonellosis (ICD-10: A44.1); Other Forms of Bartonellosis (ICD-10: A44.8); Bartonellosis, Unspecified (ICD-10: A44.9); and the umbrella code Bartonellosis (ICD-10: A44). There also exists a code that is shared between the terms Parinaud's Conjunctivitis and Parinaud's Oculoglandular Syndrome (ICD-10: H10.89).

The creation of additional ophthalmology-specific codes would increase diagnostic precision and facilitate consistent reporting of these conditions. We propose the creation of the following new ICD-10 codes: "Intraocular Bartonellosis", "Conjunctival and Orbital Bartonellosis", and "Ocular Bartonellosis". The Intraocular Bartonellosis code should be assigned only when evidence of chorioretinitis, neuroretinitis, vitritis, or other intraocular findings have been confirmed. Conjunctival and Orbital Bartonellosis would capture the findings of the traditional term Parinaud's Oculoglandular Syndrome. Ocular Bartonellosis could serve as an umbrella diagnosis. Such diagnoses should be assigned only when laboratory-confirmed Bartonella infection has been established in the presence of the respective clinical findings or when the history and systemic symptoms strongly suggest Bartonella as the causative agent. These diagnostic codes should only be assigned when other diagnoses with similar possible presentations have been excluded or are highly unlikely. Using more precise terminology should help to determine the true incidence and prevalence of a disease that almost certainly is more common than generally assumed.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^ccf9d77a]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis ICD-10 CM coding — Blepharitis, which includes entities with the following ICD-10 classifications, lists Ulcerative (H01.01-), Squamous (H01.02-), Stye (H00.01-), Meibomitis (H01.02-), Abscess of eyelid (H00.03-), and Parasitic infestation of eyelid (B89). CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; "(-) = 1, right upper eyelid; 2, right lower eyelid; 4, left upper eyelid; 5, left lower eyelid", and when laterality is specified "Right upper eyelid is always 1", "Right lower eyelid is always 2", "Left upper eyelid is always 4", and "Left lower eyelid is always 5". "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters" and "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field"; if a 7th character is required and the code is "not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code exists and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned" and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". A starred note instructs to "Code first underlying disease, as leishmaniasis (085.0–085.9), loiasis (125.2), onchocerciasis (125.3), or pediculosis (132.0)".

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

There was no overall difference in coder efficiency in the 1-year periods before and after ICD-10 implementation (P = 0.76). However, we noted a reduction in coder efficiency during the first 4 months (October 2015 to January 2016) after ICD-10 conversion, which returned to baseline for the remaining 8 months (Figure 2).

Conjunctivitis Identification

Patients were classified as "conjunctivitis cases" if they had at least one conjunctivitis diagnosis based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth (ICD-9)/Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes, or as "nonconjunctivitis controls" if they had none. Conjunctivitis is generally characterized by inflammation of the membrane lining the eyelids and exposed surface of the sclera. Diagnosis codes for acute, chronic, or viral conjunctivitis were included in the analysis, as were codes for "other" and "unspecified" conjunctivitis (full list of codes included in the analysis is available in). Codes specific to allergic, atopic, and vernal conjunctivitis and codes associated with graft-versus-host disease or ocular cicatricial pemphigoid diagnoses were excluded. Inverse probability treatment weighting was used to balance the distribution of covariates and confounding variables between conjunctivitis cases and nonconjunctivitis controls. Each patient was weighted by the inverse of the probability of having conjunctivitis (for conjunctivitis cases) or the inverse of the probability of not having conjunctivitis (for nonconjunctivitis controls), as measured by a propensity score generated using logistic regression. Propensity scores were generated with the following variables: age, sex, region, insurance type, year of index date, season of diagnosis, Quan-Charlsoncomorbidity index, pruritus, eye redness or discharge, dry eyes, ocular pain, eye swelling, vision changes, health care costs, health care resource use, and use of any medication during the 60 days before the index date. After weighting, the distribution of baseline characteristics was similar across the groups of conjunctivitis cases and nonconjunctivitis controls, with relevant characteristics having standardized differences under 10%.

Exotropia ICD-10 CM classifications — the page lists specific coding categories and codes: Alternating (H50.15), Alternating with A pattern (H50.16), Alternating with specified noncomitancy not elsewhere classifiable (includes alphabetical patterns) (H50.18), Alternating with V pattern (H50.17), Monocular (H50.11–), Monocular with A pattern (H50.12–), Intermittent unspecified (H50.30), Alternating, intermittent (H50.34), Monocular, intermittent (H50.33–), and Unspecified (H50.10). The notation states "CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; = 1, right eye; 2, left eye", and additional guidance explains that "the final character of the codes indicates laterality", that "Esotropia and exotropia do not have bilateral codes", so "if the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side", and that when laterality is specified "most often you will find: Right is 1" and "Left is 2".

### The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ophthalmic care at an eye-specific emergency department in an outbreak hotspot [^8c7a5a94]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

There were 721 unique primary ICD-10-CM diagnoses made during the study period. These 721 ICD-10-CM codes were combined into 182 clinically meaningful diagnostic groups. Looking more closely at the frequency of primary diagnostic groups, the five most frequent diagnostic groups remained fairly consistent in 2018 and 2019. However, in 2020, diagnoses such as vitreous degeneration, foreign body, and retinal detachment were made more frequently compared to prior years (Table 2). Additionally, the prevalence ratio (PR) was calculated for each diagnostic group as the proportion of ED visits in 2020 divided by the proportion of ED visits in 2018 and 2019. Looking at the PR of diagnostic groups across the years, diagnostic groups such as contusion of the eyeball, retinal vascular occlusion, and retinal detachments were more prevalent in 2020 than in 2018 and 2019 (Table 3). Other diagnostic groups, such as eyelid disorders, contact lens related disorders (excluding keratitis), and allergic conjunctivitis were less prevalent in 2020 compared to 2018 and 2019 (Table 4).

Analysis was performed for the entire study period as well as for the four blocks of each year. Visual disturbances was a diagnostic group that appeared in the top five diagnostic groups in many blocks across the years. It included visual disturbances such as aura, flashes, floaters, blurred vision, and visual field defects.

### Prevalence and mortality of life-threatening and life-shortening diseases in children and adolescents in Germany [^52d328f1]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Following the study by Fraser et al, the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes served as the basis for determining diagnosis prevalence and mortality of life-threatening and life-limiting diseases in this German study. First, the diagnosis list from England was examined with palliative care physicians to determine the extent to which the ICD-10 codes could be classified as life-threatening and life-shortening and could be assigned to one of the 4 Together-for-Short-Lives (TfSL) groups:

TfSL-1: Life-threatening diseases with the possibility of curative therapy, which may fail (eg, tumor diseases).
TfSL-2: Diseases that cannot be cured but have life-prolonging treatment options (eg, cystic fibrosis).
TfSL-3: Progressive diseases without life-prolonging therapy but with palliative care options (eg, adrenoleukodystrophy).
TfSL-4: Irreversible, nonprogressive diseases, mainly neurological, leading to premature death (eg, hypoxic encephalopathy).

Four participating physicians reviewed the ICD-10 codes and discussed any codes that were unclear in terms of their classification. The resulting "adapted Fraser list" excluded codes that the physicians deemed should not be included in the prevalence calculation, eg, H11.1 Conjunctival degenerations and deposits and Q77. Achondroplasia. In addition, a new review of the ICD-10 codes was conducted to consider updates and corrections. The resulting list included codes from Fraser et alas well as newly added codes (This new list can be found in the research report on the PraekKids project at.).

Data from 109 statutory health insurance funds (GKV-SV)and InGef's database, representing 8.8 million insured individuals, were collected and analyzed. The new list by Burgio and Jennessen served as the basis for both the prevalence and mortality surveys.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^41d0c45c]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The conversion to ICD-10 has added a much greater level of detail and specificity to coding in ophthalmology. The increase in complexity may have contributed to the increased percentage of unspecified codes used in our practice. It is not clear why we found an increase in coding-related denials and denied charges after conversion to ICD-10 during a grace period in which the use of unspecified codes should not have been penalized by CMS. Nevertheless, ICD-10 implementation did not significantly affect overall financial or clinical productivity over 12 months.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^cd799048]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye ICD-10 CM classifications — entities and codes include: Dry eye, unspecified, right lacrimal gland H04.121; left lacrimal gland H04.122; bilateral lacrimal gland H04.123; keratoconjunctivitis sicca (not specified as Sjögren) H16.22-; Sjögren syndrome, sicca syndrome M35.00; Sjögren syndrome with keratoconjunctivitis M35.01; filamentary keratitis H16.12-; exposure keratoconjunctivitis H16.21-; punctate keratitis H11.14-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, and the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct; the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder x must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Atypical manifestations of cat-scratch disease, United States, 2005–2014 [^3bf49322]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

To identify potential cases of atypical cat-scratch disease, we conducted a retrospective analysis of persons enrolled in the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (Truven Health Analytics,) during 2005–2014. The MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database includes persons < 65 years of age covered by select employer-sponsored health insurance plans in all 50 states and contains administrative claims data on outpatient visits, inpatient admissions, and emergency department visits. Demographically, the MarketScan population generally mirrors the US population, with a slight overrepresentation of persons 50–59 years of age and a slight underrepresentation of persons 20–29 years of age.

Billing codes from outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department visits are assigned by either a clinician or billing specialist according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), and procedures are captured as either ICD-9-CM codes, Current Procedure Terminology codes, or Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes. Because the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification, was not officially adopted in the United States until 2015, those codes were not included.

We identified cat-scratch disease cases by extracting all enrollee visit records during the study period with an ICD-9-CM code for cat-scratch disease (078.3). The first instance of a 078.3 diagnosis code in a patient record was considered the index event. Atypical manifestations of interest were selected for analysis if they had recorded precedent in the literature as a complication of cat-scratch disease and distinct, clearly discernable ICD-9-CM codes associated with the specific manifestation. Based on these criteria, the known complications of cat-scratch disease included for analysis were endocarditis, osteomyelitis, erythema nodosum, conjunctivitis, retinitis/neuroretinitis, encephalitis, neuritis, and hepatosplenic disease. We included ICD-9-CM codes associated with optic neuritis in the retinitis/neuroretinitis category. Encounters with an ICD-9-CM code for cat-scratch disease and an accompanying diagnostic code to indicate the anatomic location of a wound or inoculation site for B. henselae were also flagged for analysis and were categorized as either head or neck region, arm or shoulder region, leg or hip region, or torso region. We compiled a detailed list of all ICD-9-CM codes used to identify atypical manifestations of cat-scratch disease (Appendix Table).

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^15ddaed7]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Prevalence and risk factors — conjunctivitis is a diagnosis that encompasses a diverse group of diseases that occur worldwide and affect all ages, all social strata, and all genders, and although there are no reliable figures that document the incidence or prevalence of all forms of conjunctivitis, this condition has been cited as one of the most frequent causes of patient self-referral; conjunctivitis infrequently causes permanent visual loss or structural damage, but the economic impact of the disease in terms of lost work and school time, cost of medical visits, diagnostic testing, and medication is considerable; the risk factors for developing conjunctivitis depend on the etiology, the associated and predisposing factors for the types of conjunctivitis that are most common or most important to treat are listed in Table 1, and symptoms may be exacerbated by the coexistence of blepharitis, dry eye, or other causes of ocular surface inflammation.

### Esotropia and exotropia preferred practice pattern ® [^38cbc533]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Esotropia ICD-10 CM codes — entities and laterality rules are specified as follows: Nonaccommodative (unspecified) H50.00; Accommodative H50.43; Alternating H50.05; Alternating with A pattern H50.06; Alternating with V pattern H50.07; Alternating with X or Y pattern (with other noncomitancies) H50.08; Monocular H50.01–; Monocular with A pattern H50.02–; Monocular with V pattern H50.03–; Monocular with X or Y pattern (with other noncomitancies) H50.04–; Intermittent, alternating H50.32; Intermittent, monocular H50.31–; Unspecified H50.00. CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; = 1, right eye; 2, left eye. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes indicates laterality. Esotropia and exotropia do not have bilateral codes. Therefore, if the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), most often you will find: Right is 1 Left is 2.

Bacterial keratitis — ICD-10 CM classifications and laterality rules include the following: Entities coded under bacterial keratitis include corneal ulcer, unspecified (H16.00-), marginal corneal ulcer (H16.04-), ring corneal ulcer (H16.02-), central corneal ulcer (H16.01-), hypopyon ulcer (H16.03-), perforated corneal ulcer (H16.07-), unspecified corneal edema (H18.20), contact lens keratitis (H18.82-), and bacterial keratitis (H16.8). Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; "The applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct", "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field", and "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned", and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### Enhanced phenotype identification of common ocular diseases in real-world datasets [^9b3bb871]. Ophthalmology Science (2025). Medium credibility.

While sole reliance on ICD billing codes may be sufficient to answer certain research questions regarding ocular diseases, the use of EPI algorithms, including the ones we present, should greatly expand the depth and breadth of questions researchers can answer using real-world ophthalmology data. Enhanced phenotype identification algorithms allow for more accurate and nuanced identification of disease phenotypes, providing researchers with the flexibility to enhance the potential for robust and comprehensive analysis, addressing systematic biases, and improving patient inclusivity in clinical studies. Enhanced phenotype identification algorithms can profoundly impact the depth and breadth of ophthalmology research, leading to better-informed clinical decisions and improved patient outcomes.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma suspect preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^c5bd4139]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

ICD-10-CM laterality and 7th-character rules — Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and a placeholder X is required if a code needing a 7th character is not 6 characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the code indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When laterality is specified in the diagnosis code, Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^855c2eff]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

We stored and analyzed the data using Microsoft Excel for Mac 2011 with the Real Statistics Resource Pack and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Normality of all data distributions were confirmed with the Shapiro–Wilk test. If normality held, we utilized two-tailed Student's t -tests, and we used a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test for variables that did not follow a normal distribution. Data were reported as mean ± standard deviation. We performed the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure on each group of tests, separated by department, to control false discovery rate with a q value of 0.05.

Financial and clinical impacts

To analyze the changes in clinical revenue and productivity after ICD-10 conversion, we obtained billing summaries from the UC Davis Eye Center from October 1, 2014, to September 30, 2016, and examined the mean payments per visit, relative value units (RVUs) per visit, number of visits, and percentage of high-level visits for each month during the 12-month periods before and after ICD-10 implementation on October 1, 2015. High-level visits were defined by Current Procedural Terminology codes 99204, 99205, 92004, 99214, 99215, and 92014. Low-level visit codes were defined by Current Procedural Terminology codes 99201–99203, 99243, 92002, 99211–99213, and 92012. We also evaluated the number of coding-related denials and average denied charges per 100 visits, as well as denied charges as a percentage of total charges during the two periods. Coding-related denials were defined as insurance claims that were denied due to an error in coding. Finally, we assessed coder efficiency by comparing the percentage of charges coded within 10 days of a visit before and after ICD-10 implementation.

Coding behavior

To evaluate the increased complexity of ICD-10 coding as a potential cause of increased insurance claim denials, we identified the top 15 primary ICD-9 codes used between October 1, 2014, and September 30, 2015. We then assessed the corresponding section of ICD-10 to identify all of the possible corresponding codes. To determine if the increased complexity of ICD-10 resulted in more frequent use of unspecified diagnosis codes, we analyzed the total volume of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes used as primary diagnoses during the 12-month period before and after ICD-10 implementation and compared the proportion of specified and unspecified codes and their distribution among subspecialty categories. We also analyzed which categories of unspecified codes were used most frequently.

ICD-9 codes were categorized based on blocks in Chapter 6 of the 2016 edition of the ICD-9-CM manual. ICD-10 codes were categorized similarly based on blocks in Chapter 7 of the 2016 edition of the ICD-10-CM manual (Table 1). Unspecified codes were defined as codes with the term "unspecified" in the name where more specific codes exist that could have been used in their place.

Results

When comparing 12 months of data before and after conversion to ICD-10, we noted no significant change in payments per visit ($306.56 ± $56.50 vs $321.43 ± $38.12, P = 0.42), RVUs per visit (7.15 ± 0.56 vs 7.13 ± 0.84, P = 0.95), mean volume of visits (1,887.08 ± 375.02 vs 1,863.83 ± 189.81, P = 0.71), or percentage of high-level visits (29.7% ± 4.9%, 548 of 1,881 per month vs 30.0% ± 1.7%, 558 of 1,864 per month, P = 0.81). However, when comparing changes in denial-related metrics before and after conversion to ICD-10, there were nearly twofold increases in coding-related denials per 100 visits (0.98 ± 0.60 vs 1.84 ± 0.31; P < 0.001), charges denied per 100 visits ($307.42 ± $443.39 vs $660.86 ± $239.47; P = 0.002), and percentage of total charges denied (0.35% ± 0.51%, $5,556.50 of $1,581,345 vs 0.74% ± 0.30%, $12,567.33 of $1,701,466; P = 0.002).

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Ophthatome ™: an integrated knowledgebase of ophthalmic diseases for translating vision research into the clinic [^d4bbb41a]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Data curation

All demographic and clinical parameters for example, age, diagnosis, quantitative trait values were reviewed for validity and erroneous data was cleaned or flagged and removed. For each of the quantitative traits, the range of expected values were defined, and values falling outside the range were corrected after consultation with the clinician, or in case of ambiguity were deleted. Unstructured data, for example, disease diagnoses were reclassified using ICD10 code, personal history and family history of ophthalmic and systemic diseases were annotated with structured terminologies. Ophthatome ™ is populated with extensively annotated data that were checked for accuracy and uniformity (Fig. 1). A brief overview of data types captured in Ophthatome ™ are summarized below.
(i) Age The age was computed based on the date of birth and therefore reflects chronological age of subjects at multiple visits when longitudinal data is captured. Subjects with more than 110 years were marked as outliers, verified for accuracy of the data, and corrected. Paediatric age group included subjects ≤ 18 yrs and subjects > 18 years were considered adult in the cohort.
(ii) Disease diagnosis The disease diagnosis in the EMR is based on ICD10 codes. The ICD diagnosis was categorised into disease types and subtypes for comprehensive and informative querying of the data. For example, all types of cataract; cortical, nuclear, anterior subcapsular etc. were first grouped as cataract and then subclassified into their respective subtypes as shown in Table 1. Further, disease diagnoses entries that were not as per the ICD10 codes, or present in an unstructured format, or 'free text' in the EMR were assigned unique codes and grouped under appropriate disease types and subtypes. The unstructured disease diagnoses entries that specified two or more diseases, e.g. a) "primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) with cataract" or b) "early cataract with mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR)" were grouped under both the diseases, a) glaucoma and cataract, and b) cataract and diabetic retinopathy and appropriate endophenotypes, respectively (Table 2). Each of the disease diagnosis was also annotated with additional data for example, (i) affected ocular organ (cornea, conjunctiva, retina etc), (ii) age of onset of the disease (as congenital, age-related, unspecified etc) and (iii) possible causes of the disease such as a) infectious (viral, bacterial, fungal or parasitic) b) genetic (complex, monogenic, somatic, mitochondrial, chromosomal) c) age-related d) developmental e) systemic causes f) secondary to other ocular diseases g) trauma i) related to eye surgery j) inflammation k) contact lens l) medications m) autoimmune disease n) environmental/allergy o) unknown. The categorization was done manually. These categorizations and labelling allow advanced search functions for identifying specific, well-defined cohorts and to raise specific queries and adding clinical richness to the database.
(iii) Quantitative traits Refractive error (RE) Myopia and hyperopia were classified based on the degree as low, medium and high. The types of myopia are; low myopia (< − 3.00D), medium myopia (− 3.00D to − 6.00D) and high myopia (> − 6.00D) and hyperopia; low hyperopia (+ 2.00D), medium hyperopia (+ 2.25D to + 5.00D) and high hyperopia (> + 5.00D) based on the spherical power in diopters (D). Entries other than the accepted integer in positive or negative values representing hyperopia and myopia respectively, were marked and removed. Intraocular pressure Intraocular pressure (IOP) was classified as low, normal and high for the measurement values, < 12 mmHg, 12–21 mmHg and > 21 mmHg, respectively. IOP values greater than 80 mmHg were considered erroneous and were excluded as maximum measurement that can be recorded on applanation and NCT (noncontact tonometer) are 80 and 60 mmHg, respectively. Central corneal thickness Central corneal thickness (CCT) was defined as very thin, thin, average, thick and very thick for the values < 510 μm, 510–540 μm, 541–560 μm, 561–600 μm and > 600 μm respectively. Values < 300 μm and > 700 μm were marked as outliers and corrected appropriately with reference to the longitudinal data if available or flagged and removed.
(iv) Systemic diseases The details of the systemic disease(s) were converted into standard terminology such as, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, renal stones, asthma etc. These labels improve search and selection functions in the web portal. The unique unstructured free text entries were exported to an excel file and for each entry (for the common diseases mentioned above), the corresponding standard terminology were assigned manually, which was later mapped in the database.
(v) Prescription drugs The EMR database contains a list of different prescribed ophthalmic and non-ophthalmic drugs as per their brand names. Generic names were appended for all the prescribed drugs along with their brand names. Further, the drugs were also grouped as per their therapeutic or pharmacological classification based on WHO/ATC classification. For combination drugs too, the generic, and the therapeutic or pharmacological classification were appropriately appended. This was done to identify cohorts which may not have been treated with the same generic or brand name drugs, but drugs with similar mechanism of action or pharmacological properties.
(vi) Family history Details of family history of disease(s) was available for 0.02% (12,465/561,466) of the cohort. The diseases were defined as either ophthalmic or systemic to choose subjects with family history of either or both type of disease(s). Here again the unique unstructured free text entries were exported to excel, the entries defined as 'ophthalmic' or 'systemic' disease manually and then mapped in the database.
(vii) Diagnostic procedural images The diagnostic procedural images that include, electroretinogram (ERG), fundus photograph, fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), optical coherence tomography (OCT), frequency doubling technology perimetry (FDT), Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT3), nerve fibre analysis (GDX), confocal microperimetry (MAIA), visual field analysis (HFA), Pentacam (anterior eye segment tomography), amplitude scan (ASCAN), specular microscopy, color vision, electrocardiograph (ECG), were all integrated into the Ophthatome ™. The images along with the visit dates are presented as deidentified data retaining the same resolution as that of the original image. Quantitative values within the procedural images The quantitative values like the visual field index (VFI) as percentage, median deviation (MD), pattern standard deviation (PSD) available in the visual field analysis image, average retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness in micrometer, cup/disc ratio, available in the OCT image were programmatically read, and the values mapped and integrated in the database.
(viii) Visual impairment The subjects were defined either as normal vision or visually impaired based on latest unaided or best corrected visual acuity. First, the values in the unaided and best corrected visual acuity were classified as normal, visual impairment, severe visual impairment or blind based on standard WHO definition. Subjects are defined normal if the unaided refraction is within normal limits. When the unaided refraction was classified either as visual impairment, severe visual impairment or blind, then the classification under the best corrected visual acuity of the better eye was considered to classify the visual impairment status of the individual.
(ix) Longitudinal data Approximately 50% of the overall cohort in the knowledgebase have longitudinal data, i.e. have some clinical data recorded for more than one visit. In the Ophthatome ™, for any visit > 1, an internal check of at least two datapoints for either refraction or glass prescription or slit-lamp examination was considered to short list cohort with longitudinal data.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^d40700dd]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal arterial occlusion ICD-10 CM codes — Central retinal artery occlusion includes H34.11, H34.12, and H34.13; arterial branch occlusion includes H34.231, H34.232, and H34.233; partial retinal artery occlusion includes H34.211, H34.212, and H34.213; and transient retinal artery occlusion includes H34.01, H34.02, and H34.03. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality, and if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3; ICD = International Classification of Diseases and CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma preferred practice pattern ® [^424d245d]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma — ICD-10 CM classifications and coding rules include the following: open-angle glaucoma is coded as H40.10X-; primary open-angle glaucoma uses H40.111-, H40.112-, or H40.113-; low-tension glaucoma uses H40.121-, H40.122-, or H40.123-; residual stage of open-angle glaucoma uses H40.151, H40.152, or H40.153; and glaucomatous atrophy of the optic disc uses H47.231, H47.232, or H47.233. The footnote defines " = 0, stage unspecified; 1, mild stage; 2, moderate stage; 3, severe stage; 4, indeterminate stage". Additional ICD-10 CM instructions state that certain categories require a "7th character" and, if needed, "a placeholder X must be used" to ensure it is in the seventh position, that for bilateral sites "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality" and if no bilateral code exists "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned", and that laterality mapping is standardized as "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### Atypical manifestations of cat-scratch disease, United States, 2005–2014 [^59dc7ceb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Atypical manifestations that can be severe and difficult to diagnosis develop in 5%-20% of patients with cat-scratch disease. To clarify the epidemiology of atypical cat-scratch disease in the United States, we analyzed data from the 2005–2014 MarketScan national health insurance claims databases by using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, codes for cat-scratch disease and selected atypical manifestations: retinitis/neuroretinitis, conjunctivitis, neuritis, encephalitis, hepatosplenic disease, osteomyelitis, erythema nodosum, and endocarditis. Atypical cat-scratch disease accounted for 1.5% of all cases, resulting in an average annual incidence of 0.7 cases/100,000 population. Atypical cat-scratch disease was associated with increased risk for hospitalization (risk ratios 8.77, 95% CI 6.56–11.72) and occurred most often in female patients 10–14 years of age. Ocular (48.7%), hepatosplenic (24.6%), and neurologic (13.8%) manifestations were most common among patients. A more comprehensive understanding of atypical cat-scratch disease can improve patient diagnosis and potentially elucidate pathophysiology of the disease.

Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Incidence of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and chemical burns to the eye [^3071a023]. Cornea (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

This population-based observational study was designed to estimate the incidence and distribution of SJS-spectrum (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and toxic epidermal Necrolysis/Stevens-Johnson syndrome overlap) and chemical burns (alkali or acid burn of the cornea/conjunctiva) in the United States and extrapolate these numbers to the world.

Methods

All patients evaluated in 961 hospital-based US emergency departments between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2012 were identified retrospectively using the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. SJS-spectrum and chemical burn cases were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic codes.

Results

A mean of 3834 new SJS-spectrum cases per year were identified in the United States, resulting in an incidence rate of 12.35 new cases per million per year. Similarly, a mean of 15,865 new chemical burn cases per year were identified, resulting in an incidence rate of 51.10 new cases per million per year.

Conclusions

If the incidence of SJS-spectrum is approximately uniform the world-over, extrapolation from the US figure would amount to approximately 86,500 new cases per year in the world. Extrapolation of ocular chemical burns to the world is difficult because the incidence and severity are anticipated to be higher in the developing world than in the United States. Still, using a US incidence rate, a minimum of 357,710 burn accidents would be expected to occur worldwide every year; there are presently too few data available to calculate the degree of severity and bilaterality.

### Ocular manifestations in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^4b3b8b5a]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials/subjects and methods

This retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted using the TriNetX US Collaborative Network (TriNetX, LLC), a federated health research platform that aggregates de-identified EHR data of over 99 million patients across 60 healthcare organizations (HCOs). TriNetX, LLC is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the US federal law which protects the privacy and security of healthcare data, and any additional data privacy regulations applicable to the contributing HCO. The process by which the data is de-identified is attested to through a formal determination by a qualified expert as defined in Section §164.514(b)(1) of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Because this study used only de-identified patient records, this study was deemed exempt by the Western Institutional Review Board.

Data was collected on July 1, 2024 with a restricted timeframe of 1/1/2012–5/1/2024. Additional data was collected on February 11, 2025 to address reviewer comments. All encounter diagnosis data was extracted using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Ninth/Tenth Revision (ICD-9/10) codes as the platform automatically groups these together. Of note, data reporting throughout this manuscript is not a measure of the true study populations as the platform relies on existing data within EHR systems. Thus, in this paper, an EDS patient is defined as a patient who has a recorded ICD-10 diagnosis of EDS, the general population is defined as any individual with a visit in the EHR irrespective of an associated ICD-10 diagnosis, and an ocular condition is defined as a recorded ICD-10 diagnosis of this condition.

### Conjunctivitis: a systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^534f7176]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on infectious conjunctivitis:

- **Definition**: Infectious conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens.
- **Pathophysiology**: Viruses account for 80% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis, with most cases caused by adenoviruses. Other viral causes include HSV, VZV, EBV, influenza, enterovirus, and coxsackievirus. Bacterial conjunctivitis is commonly caused by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Ophthalmia neonatorum is typically caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae. Fungal conjunctivitis is rare and usually occurs in immunocompromised patients.
- **Epidemiology**: It is estimated that approximately 6 million cases of acute conjunctivitis occur annually in the US.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include close contact with infected individuals, poor hand hygiene, use of contaminated contact lenses, and exposure to contaminated water.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, infectious conjunctivitis presents with redness, itching, tearing, discharge, and crusting. Bacterial conjunctivitis often presents with purulent discharge, while viral conjunctivitis usually has a watery discharge and may be associated with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. Fungal conjunctivitis may present with chronic, indolent symptoms.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most cases of infectious conjunctivitis are self-limiting, lasting 1–2 weeks. Mild bacterial conjunctivitis typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immunocompetent adults.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^e325508b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Data and Study Sample

We used the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, including individuals ages 0 to 64 years enrolled in noncapitated commercial insurance plans with both medical and pharmacy benefits. The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

### Ocular argyrosis mimicking conjunctival melanoma [^fa89a3dd]. Cornea (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present a novel case of ocular argyrosis mimicking conjunctival melanoma.

Methods

A 48-year-old man who is a jewelry manufacturer presented with raised pigmented lesions in the inferior fornices of both eyes. Brown-black colored, follicle-like, masses were observed in both fornices.

Results

An incisional biopsy confirmed the presence of silver and the diagnosis of ocular argyrosis.

Conclusions

Despite its limited negative health effects, ocular argyrosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of conjunctival pigmented lesions because of the potential for misidentification of neoplastic growth.

### Dry eye disease ranking among common reasons for seeking eye care in a large US claims database [^98f07cdd]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

Data from the US DOD MHS between January 1, 2003, and March 31, 2015, were used. The MHS database contains comprehensive health-related data, including inpatient and outpatient health care service records, prescription records, and demographic data for > 9.7 million beneficiaries (eg, active and reserve DOD service members, retirees, and their dependents) who obtain medical service through the DOD facilities (direct care) or in selected civilian facilities. This large US database includes > 30 billion archived records, 5 billion online records, and decades of prescription, inpatient, and outpatient data.

Statistical analyses

We estimated the overall prevalence (2003–2015) and annual incidence (2008–2012) of DED and other ocular conditions among MHS beneficiaries. The full methodology of the primary prevalence and incidence evaluation is reported elsewhere. Beneficiaries with DED were identified using an algorithm constructed from selected International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Current Procedural Terminology codes, as well as prescriptions for cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion (Restasis ®; Allergan, Irvine, CA, USA) (Table 1). Since there is a lack of specific coding for DED, this study used a combination of diagnoses, procedures, and prescription fills to identify patients with DED. This requirement helped to minimize any misclassifications and avoid patients being excluded from the study. Driving indicators for DED (eg, keratoconjunctivitis sicca and conjunctival xerosis) were defined as those where two independent records of the same diagnosis, procedure, or prescription fill were sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of DED. Non-driving indicators for DED (eg, superficial keratoconjunctivitis and punctate keratitis) were defined as those that had to be combined with a driving indicator to confirm the diagnosis of DED. A diagnosis of DED was defined as two medical claims, based on driving indicators alone or as a combination of driving and non-driving indicators.

### Retinal vein occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^f45120fb]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal vein occlusion ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM codes — International Classification of Diseases (ICD) classifications include: central retinal vein occlusion — ICD-9 CM 362.35; ICD-10 CM H34.811-, H34.812-, H34.813-; venous tributary (branch) occlusion — ICD-9 CM 362.36; ICD-10 CM H34.831-, H34.832-, H34.833-; venous engorgement — ICD-9 CM 362.37; ICD-10 CM H34.821-, H34.822-, H34.823-. For ICD-10 CM laterality, the guidance states: "For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1 Left is always 2 Bilateral is always 3".

### Idiopathic epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^b546b23f]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Appendix 2 — International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction are as follows: Epiretinal membrane — ICD-9 CM 362.56; ICD-10 CM H35.371, H35.372, H35.373. Vitreomacular traction, adhesion — ICD-9 CM 379.27; ICD-10 CM H43.821, H43.822, H43.823. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned; unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^8e07be69]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study found no change in financial and clinical productivity for a mid-sized ophthalmology practice after conversion to ICD-10 in terms of total revenue, RVUs, patient volume, and percentage of high-level visits. Although billing claim denials nearly doubled after ICD-10 conversion, the associated financial loss to the practice was only 0.73% of total charges. Denied charges due to coding errors increased across nearly all subspecialties. A possible explanation for the increase in denials is the increased complexity of ICD-10, which may result in a higher probability of coding errors or an increased use of unspecified codes. From the 15 most common ICD-9 codes used in our practice, we noted a more than 10-fold increase in corresponding ICD-10 codes (Table 3). This increased complexity likely led to the substantial increase in the use of unspecified ICD-10 codes, which occurred across several of the ophthalmic subspecialties.

Our findings contrast with data released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2015 which show that in the fourth quarter, the total number of submitted claims, rejected claims, and denied claims had not changed in the 3 months after switching to ICD-10. Their findings may be due to the 1-year grace period after ICD-10 implementation during which CMS stated that "Medicare review contractors will not deny physician or other practitioner claims billed under the Part B physician fee schedule through either automated medical review or complex medical record review based solely on the specificity of the ICD-10 diagnosis code as long as the physician/practitioner used a valid code from the right family". Despite this grace period, our study did show an increase in denied payments due to coding errors. Furthermore, since October 1, 2016, CMS review contractors can use coding specificity as the reason for an audit, and this may lead to a further increase in denied claims.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^e0159918]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM coding — Macular degeneration, dry corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.51 and to ICD-10 CM Nonexudative AMD H35.31-; macular degeneration, wet corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.52 and to ICD-10 CM Exudative AMD H35.32-; macular drusen corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.57 and to ICD-10 CM Drusen (degenerative) of macula H35.36-. AMD does not require laterality indicators. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of ICD-10 CM codes indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Pterygia are indicators of an increased risk of developing cutaneous melanomas [^780e63b6]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

To investigate whether pterygium is an indicator of an increased risk of cutaneous melanoma (CM).

Methods

A matched-cohort study, using linked health administrative data sets to identify all hospital-treated pterygium in Western Australia (WA) between 1979 and 2014. We identified pterygium cases from hospital diagnosis and/or procedure International Classification of Diseases 9th revision (ICD-9) and 10th revision (ICD-10) codes and matched cases by age, sex and residential postcode to WA Electoral Roll controls with no known history of pterygium. Both cohorts were linked to the WA Cancer Registry and the WA Deaths Registry.

Results

23625 people had pterygium treatment (64% male) in WA hospitals. The median age for pterygium diagnosis and/or treatment was 49 years (range 14–96). There were significantly more CM cases in the pterygium cohort compared with the control cohort (1083 vs 874; p < 0.001). In a logistic regression analysis, there was a 24% increase in the odds of developing a CM in the pterygium cohort, compared with controls, after controlling for other predictors (OR 1.24, 95%CI 1.1 to 1.4). The incident rate ratio (IRR) of a malignant CM diagnosis was 20% greater in people who had treatment for a pterygium compared with controls (IRR 1.2, 95%CI 1.0 to 1.4).

Conclusion

The presence of a pterygium indicates a significantly increased risk of developing a CM. Eye care providers who see patients with developing pterygia should advise these patients of this increased risk and recommend regular skin surveillance.

Full specifications of candidate counterfactual models (Step 2a) are available in Supplementary Note 1. Abbreviations: IRIS Registry American Academy of Ophthalmology Intelligent Research in Sight Registry®, RMSPE root-mean-squared percentage error, MSE mean squared error.

Inventory of diagnoses

We constructed an expansive inventory of ocular conditions to study by grouping more than 3300 ophthalmic ICD-10 diagnosis codes into 336 clinically meaningful diagnosis entities adapted from categorizations provided by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) database version 2020.2. We followed a common set of considerations to modify these categorizations of ICD-10 codes where needed for the analytic purposes of this study, and to further create more granular groupings of these ICD-10 codes into diagnosis entities (Supplementary Note 4). For instance, all diagnosis entities were required to have a sufficient utilization level (i.e. above single-digit patient counts) for each month of the study period (January 2017–December 2021). After establishing an initial set of 336 diagnosis entities, to ensure that study findings were based on reliable predictions of utilization levels expected in the absence of the pandemic, conditions with poor counterfactual model performance (considered as ≥ 12.5% root-mean-squared percentage error [RMSPE]) were also excluded, resulting in a final set of 261 diagnosis entities attributed to 13 mutually exclusive diagnosis categories (e.g. blindness and vision defects, cataract and other lens disorders, corneal and external disease) (Supplementary Data 1) included for analysis in this study.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^7ddc43dd]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the financial and clinical impact of conversion from International Classification of Disease, 9th revision (ICD-9) to ICD-10 coding.

Design

Retrospective, database study.

Materials and Methods

Monthly billing and coding data from 44,564 billable patient encounters at an academic ophthalmology practice were analyzed by subspecialty in the 1-year periods before (October 1, 2014, to September 30, 2015) and after (October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2016) conversion from ICD-9 to ICD-10.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome measures were payments per visit, relative value units per visit, number of visits, and percentage of high-level visits; secondary measures were denials due to coding errors, charges denied due to coding errors, and percentage of unspecified codes used as a primary diagnosis code.

Results

Conversion to ICD-10 did not significantly impact payments per visit ($306.56 ± $56.50 vs $321.43 ± $38.12, P = 0.42), relative value units per visit (7.15 ± 0.56 vs 7.13 ± 0.84, P = 0.95), mean volume of visits (1,887.08 ± 375.02 vs 1,863.83 ± 189.81, P = 0.71), or percentage of high-level visits (29.7% ± 4.9%, 548 of 1,881 vs 30.0% ± 1.7%, 558 of 1,864, P = 0.81). For every 100 visits, the number of coding-related denials increased from 0.98 ± 0.60 to 1.84 ± 0.31 (P < 0.001), and denied charges increased from $307.42 ± $443.39 to $660.86 ± $239.47 (P = 0.002). The monthly percentage of unspecified codes used increased from 25.8% ± 1.1% (485 of 1,881) to 35.0% ± 2.3% (653 of 1,864, P < 0.001).

Conclusion

The conversion to ICD-10 did not impact overall revenue or clinical volume in this practice setting, but coding-related denials, denied charges, and the use of unspecified codes increased significantly. We expect these denials to increase in the next year in the absence of Medicare's 1-year grace period.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^f12ef21c]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis classification and targeted types — conjunctivitis can be classified as noninfectious or infectious and as acute, chronic, or recurrent. Noninfectious types of conjunctivitis include allergic, mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic, and these types may overlap, while the causes of infectious conjunctivitis include viruses and bacteria. It is important to differentiate between primary conjunctival disease and conditions in which conjunctival inflammation is secondary to systemic or ocular diseases; for example, dry eye and blepharitis are the most frequent causes of conjunctival inflammation and the treatment for each of these entities should be directed at correcting the underlying problems. Systemic conditions such as atopy or acute infections such as gonorrhea may also cause conjunctival inflammation, and treatment of conjunctivitis must include addressing the underlying systemic disease. This preferred practice pattern addresses types that are either most common or are particularly important to detect and treat, including allergic types — seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, and atopic conjunctivitis — and mechanical/irritative/toxic types — superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK), blepharoconjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye), rosacea conjunctivitis, contact lens–related keratoconjunctivitis, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), floppy eyelid syndrome, giant fornix syndrome, and medication-induced/preservative-induced keratoconjunctivitis.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^23486875]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

The key concern about ICD-10 has always been cost. The most recent Nachimson Advisors analysis estimated that a small practice (3 physicians, 2 administrators) would lose between $56,639 and $226,105 through additional training, software upgrades, testing, productivity loss, and payment disruption. A medium-sized practice (10 physicians, 1 coder, 6 administrators) was projected to lose $213,364 to $824,735, and a large practice (100 physicians, 10 coders, and 64 administrators) was projected to lose $2,017,151 to $8,018,364. The largest portion of these losses was projected to be due to productivity loss and disruptions in payment. These predictions were for physicians in general and not targeted toward any specific specialty.

In this study, we aim to determine the clinical and financial impacts of conversion to ICD-10 on an academic multispecialty ophthalmology practice with a well-established electronic health record (EHR) system. Since the addition of laterality to codes is a significant change and ocular conditions are almost uniformly lateralized, we hypothesized that the conversion may negatively impact eye care providers. We also investigated whether the increasing complexity of coding some common ophthalmologic diagnoses would lead to more frequent use of unspecified codes.

### Epidemiology of ophthalmologic disease associated with erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis in hospitalized children in the United States [^8c0379a9]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of the current study was to characterize the epidemiology and resource use of U.S. children hospitalized with ophthalmologic disease secondary to erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). We studied children ages 5 to 19 years hospitalized in 2005 in 11 states, encompassing 38% of the U.S. pediatric population. Using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes, we identified admissions of children with EM, SJS, or TEN and the presence of concurrent ophthalmologic disease, analyzed patient and hospitalization characteristics, and generated age- and sex-adjusted national estimates. We identified 460 children admitted with EM, SJS, or TEN, corresponding to 1,229 U.S. hospitalizations in 2005. Of the children with EM, SJS, or TEN, 60 (13.0%) had ophthalmologic disease, primarily (90.0%) disorders of the conjunctiva. Children with the highest proportions of ophthalmologic disease included those with mycoplasma pneumonia (26.7%), herpes simplex virus (15.6%), upper respiratory infection (13.9%), and lower respiratory infection (13.7%). Individuals with EM, SJS, or TEN and ophthalmologic disease were more likely than those without ophthalmologic disease to receive intensive care unit care (28.3% vs 17.0%, p = 0.03) and to be admitted to a children's hospital (63.3% vs 48.8%, p = 0.03). Ophthalmologic disease was also associated with a significantly longer median length of stay (6.0 days, interquartile range [IQR] 3–9 days vs 3.0 days, IQR 2–6 days, p < 0.001) and median hospital cost ($7,868, IQR $3,539-$17,440 vs $2,969, IQR $1,603-$8,656, p < 0.001). In children with EM, SJS, or TEN, ophthalmologic disease was most common in those with concurrent Mycoplasma pneumoniae and herpes simplex virus infections. Ophthalmologic disease was associated with considerably higher inpatient resource use in this population. Children with EM, SJS, or TEN should be screened and treated early for ophthalmologic disease to prevent morbidity and minimize long-term sequellae.

### Changes in patient visits and diagnoses in a large academic center during the COVID-19 pandemic [^e1848012]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

To minimize the risk of viral transmission, ophthalmology practices limited face-to-face encounters to only patients with urgent and emergent ophthalmic conditions in the weeks after the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States. The impact of this is unknown.

Methods

We did a retrospective analysis of the change in the frequency of ICD-10 code use and patient volumes in the 6 weeks before and after the changes in clinical practice associated with COVID-19.

Results

The total number of encounters decreased four-fold after the implementation of clinic changes associated with COVID-19. The low vision, pediatric ophthalmology, general ophthalmology, and cornea divisions had the largest total decrease of in-person visits. Conversely, the number of telemedicine visits increased sixty-fold. The number of diagnostic codes associated with ocular malignancies, most ocular inflammatory disorders, and retinal conditions requiring intravitreal injections increased. ICD-10 codes associated with ocular screening exams for systemic disorders decreased during the weeks post COVID-19.

Conclusion

Ophthalmology practices need to be prepared to experience changes in practice patterns, implementation of telemedicine, and decreased patient volumes during a pandemic. Knowing the changes specific to each subspecialty clinic is vital to redistribute available resources correctly.

### Interrupted time series analysis of cannabis coding in Colorado during the ICD-10-CM transition [^1aa0b7d6]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Trends in cannabis and psychodysleptic codes across the transition to ICD-10-CM may be actual trends or may result from systematic biasses introduced by the change in coding systems. This analysis did not assess the sensitivity or specificity of cannabis ICD-10-CM codes and therefore cannot quantify effects due to the change in coding system verses actual trends in discharges involving cannabis. However, level changes observed at the time of the transition to ICD-10-CM are difficult to explain by other external factors. As ICD-10-CM continues to be used, it is possible changes in coding patterns over time could be from implementation and training on the new coding system. The ICD-10-CM system is complex and coding to include the new information like cannabis intoxication or mental health symptoms may take longer to adopt. Examining these more specific codes individually over time may be biassed by coder learning curves. Despite these limitations, the expansion and increased specificity of cannabis codes in ICD-10-CM will strengthen the ability to conduct surveillance of cannabis-related adverse health events. Over time, it is expected that coding practice will stabilise, and true trends will become apparent. However, trends observed in the early years of the ICD-10-CM coding system should be interpreted with caution.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Amblyopia preferred practice pattern [^1cde52cc]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Amblyopia — ICD-10 CM coding categories and laterality conventions are listed as follows: Amblyopia, unspecified is H53.00–; Strabismic amblyopia (suppression) is H53.03–; Deprivation amblyopia is H53.01–; Refractive amblyopia, including anisometropic and isoametropic amblyopia, is H53.02–; and Amblyopia, suspect is H53.04–. Laterality uses the final character, with mappings "1, right eye; 2, left eye; 3, bilateral; 9, eye not specified"; when laterality is specified it can appear in different digit positions, and if no bilateral code is provided for a bilateral condition, separate left and right codes are assigned; unspecified laterality can be "a 0 or 9 depending on whether it is a 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th digit".

### Pediatric eye-related emergency department visits and pediatric eye provider location and density [^e9de2bcd]. Ophthalmology Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

There is a shortage of pediatric eye specialists. Inaccessible eye care may lead parents to bring their children to the emergency department (ED) to address eye problems that could have been handled at a clinic visit. This study aimed to determine the association between childhood eye-related ED visits and the location and density of pediatric eye specialists in California.

Design

A population-based cross-sectional study.

Participants

All California ED visits between January 2012 and December 2021 for patients ≤ 18 years of age were identified using the California Office of Health Care Access and Information Database.

Methods

International Classification of Diseases diagnosis codes were used to identify eye-related ED visits. Public databases were used to identify pediatric ophthalmologist and optometrist addresses. Census data were used to determine the number of visits per 10 000 children in each zip code. Poisson regressions evaluated associations at the zip code level of eye-related ED visits and provider density with geographic sociodemographic factors.

Main Outcome Measures

Incidence of pediatric eye-related ED visits.

Results

Of the 117 363 721 ED visits in California between 2012 and 2021, 27 346 729 (23.3%) were for children, of which 391 985 (1.4%) were eye-related. Median age was 5.0 years (interquartile range: 2.0, 10.0), and 51.7% were male. The most common diagnoses were conjunctivitis (250 028; 63.8%), chalazion/blepharitis (56 389; 14.4%), and other disorders of the eye/adnexa (13 070; 3.3%). The mean number of visits per year per 10 000 children was 43 ± 12 (median 46, interquartile range: 43, 51). The estimated number of pediatric eye providers in California in 2023 was 142 (1 per 61 413 children). Zip codes with more pediatric eye providers had fewer eye-related ED visits: each additional provider per 10 000 children was associated with 2.1 fewer eye-related ED visits per 10 000 children (95% confidence interval -0.04 to -4.25; P = 0.046).

Conclusions

Most eye-related ED visits were for nonemergent eye conditions. There was a low eye provider-to-child ratio and an association between provider density and eye-related ED visit incidence. Expanding pediatric eye care could improve access and decrease ED utilization for nonemergent eye concerns.

### Ocular injuries in trauma patients: an analysis of 28, 340 trauma admissions in the 2003–2007 national trauma data bank national sample program [^898c5e3a]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Trauma-induced eye injuries are the leading cause of monocular blindness in the United States. Few studies to date have focused on ocular injuries in the trauma population. Our intent was to determine the annual percentage of ocular injury, types of injuries, and percentage with ocular injury-related procedures performed during the same hospitalization.

Methods

This study was a retrospective analysis of 28,340 patient records included in the National Trauma Data Bank National Sample Program from 2003 to 2007. Patients with ocular injuries and related procedures were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis and procedure codes and were subsequently grouped into categories of ocular injury using the criteria of the Barell body region injury diagnosis matrix. Weighted national estimates for the proportion of patients with ocular trauma were calculated based on the relative weights for patients in each facility within the sample universe. Weighted frequencies were expressed as a percentage of the total population of trauma admissions, with 95% confidence intervals calculated for precision.

Results

During the time frame examined, 1.97% to 6.00% of annual trauma patient admissions included ocular injuries. The most common injuries were contusions or superficial injuries and then closed orbit fractures accounting for 0.95% to 2.48% and 0.58% to 2.37% of all injuries, respectively. Between 0.56% and 1.52% of annual trauma admission had both ocular trauma and related procedures during their hospitalization. Popular treatments were therapeutic procedures on eyelids, conjunctiva, and/or cornea occurring in 0.15% to 0.84% of all trauma patients. Facial fracture-related procedures were reported for between 0.16% and 0.65% of all trauma patient admissions.

Conclusion

The National Trauma Data Bank National Sample Program can be used to create useful estimates of ocular injury characteristics among patients seen in the population seen in trauma centers, including types of ocular injury and related procedures performed during the same admission.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^bf4db91f]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

We performed a retrospective database study of deidentified billing records at the University of California (UC), Davis Eye Center in Sacramento, CA. The study protocol followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was exempted from approval by the university's Institutional Review Board Committee as the work was not considered human subject research as defined by federal regulation 45 CFR 46.102. Our practice consisted of 16 ophthalmologists and included specialists in cornea, glaucoma, neuro-ophthalmology, oculoplastics, pediatrics, and retina. Optometrists, ophthalmology trainees, and part-time volunteer clinical faculty were not included in the analysis. Over the 2 years of the study, the medical staff was unchanged with the exception of the following: 1) a comprehensive ophthalmologist was on sabbatical and worked only part time before June 2015; 2) a neuro-ophthalmologist left the practice in 2015 and was immediately replaced by another neuro-ophthalmologist who saw fewer patients each month; and 3) a retina specialist was hired into the practice 2 months after the beginning of the study period. These three providers were excluded from the analysis to avoid the confounding effect of changes in their clinical volume.

ICD-10 implementation strategy

In our practice, a team of ophthalmic coding specialists reviews and analyzes all patient charts after visits are completed and assigns the coding information for medical billing. From July 1, 2014, until the official implementation of ICD-10, the coders utilized both ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for additional training. The coding staff remained unchanged throughout the course of the study period, and no additional compensation was provided to the coders during the transition period. These figures do not include the cost of software implementation to the EHR system, which took place across the university medical center prior to ICD-10 implementation.

### Diabetic retinopathy preferred practice pattern ® [^cb9e26bb]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) ICD coding — severe nonproliferative and diabetic macular edema mappings are listed as follows: ICD-9 CM 362.06 corresponds to ICD-10 CM codes "E10.341- Type 1 with macular edema", "E10.349- Type 1 without macular edema", "E11.341- Type 2 with macular edema", "E11.349- Type 2 without macular edema", "E13.341- other specified types of diabetes mellitus with severe nonproliferative DR with macular edema", and "E13.349- other specified types of diabetes mellitus with severe nonproliferative DR without macular edema". For diabetic macular edema, ICD-9 CM 362.07 corresponds to ICD-10 CM "E10.321 Type 1 mild nonproliferative DR", "E10.331 Type 1 moderate nonproliferative DR", "E10.341 Type 1 severe nonproliferative DR", "E10.351 Type 1 proliferative DR", "E11.321 Type 2 mild nonproliferative DR", "E11.331 Type 2 moderate nonproliferative DR", "E11.341 Type 2 severe nonproliferative DR", "E11.351 Type 2 proliferative DR", "E13.321 other specified diabetes mellitus with mild nonproliferative DR", and "E13.331 other specified diabetes mellitus with moderate nonproliferative DR". Additional information states: "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 6th characters. In the DR series, indicate 'with or without' macular edema. Laterality indicators are not required in this series", with "1 = with macular edema" and "9 = without macular edema". It further specifies, "For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available".

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### Predictors of long-term ophthalmic complications after closed globe injuries using the intelligent research in sight (IRIS ®) registry [^e69d76cd]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study had several limitations. While the IRIS Registry is composed of entries from both private ophthalmology practices and academic centers, there are relatively fewer academic centers represented by the database. Currently, one third of member academic institutions of the Association of University Professors of Ophthalmology participate in the IRIS Registry (Lum F, personal communication, 2022). Despite the increase in the involvement of academic centers, some of the most severe ocular trauma cases might not be captured in our current study population. Our results were dependent on accurate and comprehensive coding of clinicians for patient diagnoses and procedures. However, we selected a wide range of ICD-9, ICD-10, and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine codes to represent blunt periocular and ocular trauma (Table S1) to increase the likelihood that the concomitant diagnoses noted in the IRIS Registry database for each patient were associated with a trauma event. This was necessary because in many instances, the ICD-9, ICD-10, and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine codes alone do not specify whether the diagnosis is secondary to trauma. For example, ICD-10 codes for hyphema (H21.00, H21.02, H21.02, H21.03) do not differentiate between hyphema due to trauma versus hyphema due to anterior segment neovascularization. However, a diagnosis of hyphema made on the same day as the diagnosis of an eyelid contusion (S00.10XA, S00.11XA, S00.12XA) can reasonably be presumed to be a traumatic hyphema. It is possible that we are missing patients with closed globe injury using this methodology if their provider did not use one of the blunt ocular trauma codes we specified in the inclusion criteria and instead only coded for the concomitant diagnoses (e.g. a hyphema). Despite this possibility, it was more important to exclude patients without history of trauma from the data set for our analysis. We also acknowledge that some patients who met the inclusion criteria for this study but did not carry a concomitant diagnosis might not have had an injury to the eyeball itself but may have only had, for example, an isolated orbital fracture or eyelid injury. Our main clinical question was to identify diagnoses on presentation that increased the risk of patients needing surgical intervention after blunt trauma in and around the eye. We believe that the clinical utility of our results persists; patients with history of blunt ocular or periocular trauma, such as an orbital fracture, and concomitant hyphema are at increased risk of requiring one of the procedural outcomes than patients with an orbital fracture alone.

### Ambient ultraviolet radiation and ocular melanoma incidence in the United States, 2000–2019 [^d4305bf7]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study population

Our study population included 21 population-based SEER cancer registries. Counts of ocular melanoma were stratified by county of residence at diagnosis, sex, age at diagnosis (< 50, 50–64, 65+ years), year of diagnosis (2000–2003, 2004–2007, 2008–2011, 2012–2015, 2016–2019), laterality (left-sided, right-sided, others), race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, Hispanic White, Black, Asian or Pacific Islander, and American Indian), and anatomical sites (conjunctiva, cornea, retina, choroid, ciliary body/iris, orbit not otherwise specified [NOS], overlapping lesion of eye and adnexa, and eye NOS). The county population counts used in the calculation of person-years at risk were based on the 2000 U.S. standard population (19 age groups — Census P25-1130). We excluded Alaska's registry (N cases = 3) because Alaska was an outlier of UVR and only Alaskan Natives were included. Furthermore, we excluded cases with unknown age, race and ethnicity, or Federal Information Processing System code (N = 218).

Ocular melanoma

We defined the first primary ocular melanoma cases as the international classification of disease for oncology coding of C69.0-C69.6 or C69.8–69.9 with histology code of 8720–8790. We excluded cases with unknown information on diagnostic confirmation (N = 397). Ocular melanoma cases included conjunctiva (C69.0), cornea (C69.1), retina (C69.2), choroid (C69.3), ciliary body/iris (C69.4), lacrimal gland (C69.5), orbit NOS (C69.6), overlapping region of eye and adnexa (C69.8), and eye NOS (C69.9). To accommodate potential differences in ascertainment of ocular melanoma diagnosis among registries, registry's population size was created using census-based population size that was categorised into quartiles.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^dc8b992b]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis — socioeconomic considerations note limited evaluation of economic impact, reported Medicare costs, potential benefits of symptom improvement, limited insurance coverage for certain in-office procedures, and ongoing classification efforts. The economic impact of blepharitis as a separate entity has not been adequately evaluated, and one study reported the eye-related Medicare costs between 1995 and 1999 of a random sample of beneficiaries with relevant diagnostic codes to be a median of $658 and a mean of $1428 ± $1752 over a 5-year period. Although there is no strong evidence of an effective cure for chronic blepharitis, there is evidence that certain treatment modalities may provide symptomatic relief, and improved signs and symptoms may lead to decreased office visits and increased productivity with potential decreases in direct and indirect costs and an increase in quality of life. In-office procedures, such as microblepharoexfoliation, thermal pulsation of meibomian glands, and IPL are not well covered by insurance and can incur significant cost to the patient, and the cost-effectiveness and quality-of-life impact of blepharitis treatments need further investigation. The International Workshop on Meibomian Gland Dysfunction has endeavored to provide uniform classification and prevalence data, and the results of its work were published in 2011.

The diagnosis of stroke was established on the basis of the ICD‐10‐CM code of I63 (cerebral infarction) made during hospitalization and according to brain imaging such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Individuals with a prior history of stroke, including those with ICD‐10‐CM codes I63 and I64 (stroke, not specified as hemorrhage or infarction), were excluded from the CNP cohort.

### Ocular manifestations in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^3d57cd01]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

The first aim of this study was to highlight how the EDS patient population may differ from the general population by demographic factors of age, gender, and race. The EDS patient cohort was defined by any ICD-10 encounter diagnosis code Q79.6 and compared to the entire TriNetX population in the US Analytic Network. Each cohort was stratified by 30-year age cohorts to capture nuances in this population who is typically in adolescence at time of first diagnosis and has a significantly shortened life expectancy at 48 years. Within each cohort, the mean age of the study group (and associated standard deviation) was collected to assist in drawing comparative conclusions from the data. Within each age group, gender and race/ethnicity stratifications were also added.

Secondarily, this study aimed to understand the recorded prevalence of ocular diagnoses in EDS patients compared to the general population through obtaining the platform's prevalence data on multiple ocular conditions. The equation used for the prevalence of an ocular condition in EDS per 100000 was:Conditions commonly reported in the EDS literature, conditions with increased risk with cardiovascular disease, and other common retinal conditions were included. All ICD-10 encounter diagnoses codes for these conditions are listed in Table 1. Age was considered as a confounding variable due to the decreased life expectancy of the EDS group, and the increased average age of diagnosis for several conditions examined. To account for this, the prevalence of these conditions was obtained at the same 30-year age stratification rate. The platform automatically rounds any counts 1–10 to protect patient privacy. Therefore, ocular conditions that resulted in less than or equal to 10 patient cases in the platform were omitted from calculations and figures to prevent presentation of misleading data.

ICD-10 encounter diagnoses codes used in TriNetX queries for ocular conditions.

To assess whether EDS patients were at increased odds for any of the studied ocular conditions, a contingency table was used for the prevalence odds ratio (POR) calculation. With age stratification, some ocular conditions too rare to stratify by age were rounded by the platform, and thus excluded for the analysis. PORs and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Microsoft Excel and R Studio. Forest plots were created in R Studio. P values were calculated for all prevalence estimates using a chi-squared 2-sided test. A significance threshold of 0.01 or less was used. STROBE guidelines were followed in this study and writeup.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^a52cdf0a]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

When analyzing the same data by subspecialties, we found no significant change in payments per visit, RVUs per visit, number of visits, or percentage of high-level visits in any group after ICD-10 conversion, with the exception of comprehensive ophthalmology, which showed a slight increase in percentage of high-level visits (Table 2). All subspecialties experienced an increase in coding-related denials and denied charges, but only higher-volume services including comprehensive, cornea, and retina reached statistical significance (Table 2).

After identifying the top 15 primary visit diagnosis ICD-9 codes used in the 12-month period before ICD-10 implementation, we found a total of 153 possible corresponding ICD-10 codes. There were only 3 one-to-one mappings, where there was only one ICD-10 code that corresponded with the ICD-9 code in question. For 2 of those, exudative and nonexudative senile macular degeneration, the current version of ICD-10 requires much greater specificity than was required during the study period (Table 3).

The overall monthly percentage of unspecified codes used increased from 25.8% ± 1.1% (485 of 1,881) in the ICD-9 period to 35.0% ± 2.3% (653 of 1,864) after ICD-10 implementation (P < 0.001). Significant increases in the percentage of unspecified codes were seen in glaucoma (P < 0.001), other (P < 0.001), pediatrics/neuro-ophthalmology (P < 0.001), perioperative (P = 0.01), oculoplastics (P = 0.003), and refractive (P < 0.001) diagnoses. Cataract (P < 0.001) and cornea (P < 0.001) showed significant decreases in percentage of unspecified codes used, and there were no significant changes in retina (P = 0.025) diagnoses. The biggest changes were seen in glaucoma and refractive diagnoses (Figure 1). Codes were most often considered unspecified due to lack of laterality, disease type, or stage (Table 4).

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^b9555fdb]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye syndrome — staging notes — one or more options concurrently within each category can be considered within that step of the dry eye disease state, options within a category are not ranked according to importance and may be equally valid, the evidence available to support options differs and may be lower for newer options so each treatment option should be considered in accordance with the level of evidence available at the time management is instigated, and the severity and etiology of the dry eye disease state will dictate the range and number of options selected from one or more steps.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^d31cd2b5]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctival lymphoma — typical clinical signs, associated factors, natural history, and sequelae are described: Unilateral, painless, pink lesion with indolent fleshy, "salmon patch" conjunctival swelling on the superior or inferior conjunctiva that often presents with chronic palpebral or bulbar follicles; lesions are most mobile and nonlobulated and can have intrinsic vessels. Associated/predisposing factors include host immune deficiency, autoimmune conditions (Sjogren's syndrome, Hashimoto's, IgG4-related disease), genetic mutations, and chronic infections (Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis C, and chlamydia). Natural history notes that up to 20% with primary conjunctival lymphoma develop systemic disease, with higher risk with location (fornix/mid bulbar) and increasing number of discrete tumors. Potential sequelae state that systemic involvement arising from conjunctival lymphoma is rare but varies based on lymphoma subtype.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^d495525c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

### High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis: a study of ocular benefits [^9abf7350]. Eye (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare acute ocular complications of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) following treatment with high-dose human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) with a historical cohort not treated with IVIG.

Methods

Retrospective, historically controlled study. In all, 10 consecutive patients with TEN (treatment cohort) presenting between 1 July 2001 and 30 June 2002. Totally, 18 consecutive patients with TEN (historical cohort). SettingTan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore. The treatment cohort received high-dose IVIG (2 g/kg body weight over 2 days). Patients' records were retrospectively reviewed for their demographic characteristics, causative drug, treatment, ocular involvement (if any, as assessed by an ophthamologist), and its severity. The historical cohort comprised patients coded with a diagnosis of TEN (ICD Code 695.1) between 1 July 1995 and 30 June 2001.

Results

Nine (90%) of 10 patients treated with IVIG had ocular involvement. Phenytoin was the implicated drug in three (37.5%) patients. Of the nine patients, 1 died of septic shock. Of the eight survivors, IVIG was initiated immediately upon onset of TEN as all the patients were hospitalized by the time of onset of an exanthema. Acute ocular complications were mild in two (25%) (lid oedema or mild conjunctival injection), moderate in four (50%) (pseudomembranes) and severe in two (25%) (nonhealing epithelial defect with visual loss and symblepharon). In total, 10 (55.6%) of 18 patients in the historical cohort with TEN had acute ocular involvement. Two patients died. Ocular involvement in survivors was mild in five (62.5%) cases and moderate in three (37.5%), with no severe cases.

Conclusions

IVIG did not appear to reduce the severity of visually significant ocular complications. Larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.
