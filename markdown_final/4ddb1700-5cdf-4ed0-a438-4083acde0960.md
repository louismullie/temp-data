## Question

inj buscopan for malignant bowel obstruction - dose and course

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the dose and course of injectable hyoscine butylbromide (Buscopan) for malignant bowel obstruction, including evidence strength, route, dosing, duration, monitoring, and how it fits within guideline-based care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pathophysiology of malignant bowel obstruction. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic rationale and mechanism of action for hyoscine butylbromide. Next, I will review the direct and indirect evidence base and grade the recommendations. After that, I need to check practical dosing, administration route, and duration from guidelines and real-world practice. Finally, I will integrate safety, contraindications, and how this fits with other therapies like octreotide, corticosteroids, and antiemetics, and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary [^113y4JnR] [^113XFTuN].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why we are using an antispasmodic here. Malignant bowel obstruction is common in advanced abdominal and pelvic cancers, often multifocal and frequently inoperable, producing severe colicky pain, distension, nausea, and vomiting; management is primarily palliative and symptom-directed, with medications given parenterally when the gut is not functional, which is exactly the scenario where injectable agents are needed [^113ALkSJ] [^111pcqum] [^116m8dBA].

> I will now examine the pharmacologic rationale. Hyoscine butylbromide is a quaternary antimuscarinic with poor oral bioavailability and limited CNS penetration, acting locally in the gut to reduce smooth muscle spasm and secretions; mechanistically, it inhibits muscarinic-mediated contractions and epithelial secretion, which aligns with the need to blunt painful peristaltic spasms and reduce secretory load in obstruction, though it does not restore patency in mechanical blockade [^113GNyXg] [^112UUuv8] [^117JCa9n].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy; I should verify the evidence base. The highest-quality guidance suggests considering anticholinergics like hyoscine butylbromide for abdominal pain in MBO, but the evidence is low-level and largely indirect, with MASCC assigning a Level III, Grade D suggestion, and noting that randomized data are sparse and at high risk of bias; moreover, when compared head-to-head, somatostatin analogs appear superior for reducing vomiting, which is a different target symptom than colicky pain [^113wL3BP] [^112Y3n6X] [^116MddWi] [^113uLyjE] [^111du98N].

> Wait, let me verify dosing details because this is where practice often diverges from labels. The MASCC guidance does not specify an exact dose, but contemporary clinical practice commonly uses 20 mg IV every 6 hours, with dose escalation to 40 mg every 6 hours if pain persists and side effects are acceptable; this mirrors the 20 mg ampoule strength and aligns with reports of subcutaneous combinations using 40–80 mg/day in palliative infusions, and with expert reviews describing safe escalation up to 60–100 mg per dose in selected cases due to limited systemic absorption and CNS penetration [^113MuV3r] [^112SvFZW] [^117SGdSE].

> I need to ensure the route and administration context are correct. In complete MBO, oral medications are unreliable, so parenteral administration is required; IV is preferred in inpatient settings for rapid onset, while SC infusion mixtures are reasonable in home palliative care when coordinated, and the drug should be given slowly IV to minimize adverse effects; this approach is consistent with MASCC's emphasis on IV/SC administration in complete obstruction and with compatibility data for SC combinations [^111pcqum] [^113MuV3r].

> Let me consider duration and titration pragmatically. Because MBO is often persistent and progressive, continuous symptom control is needed; a practical course is to continue as long as pain remains problematic and the patient benefits, reassessing every 24–72 hours for efficacy and adverse effects, and tapering if pain improves or if anticholinergic side effects emerge; this is consistent with palliative care principles of iterative reassessment and aligns with the absence of a fixed endpoint in guidelines [^111hSL3m].

> Next, I should review safety and contraindications. As a quaternary antimuscarinic, hyoscine butylbromide has minimal CNS anticholinergic effects, but it can cause dry mouth, blurred vision, and tachycardia; standard precautions apply in narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, and myasthenia gravis, and it should be avoided in paralytic ileus; given the limited absorption and BBB penetration, cognitive burden is low, though additive anticholinergic effects with other drugs should still be considered in frail patients [^117JCa9n] [^117SGdSE] [^112sjT8B].

> But wait, what if the predominant problem is vomiting rather than colicky pain. I should double-check the comparative data. Somatostatin analogs, particularly octreotide, have stronger evidence for reducing vomiting in MBO and are recommended as first-line antisecretory therapy; hyoscine butylbromide may be inferior for emesis control, so if vomiting predominates, prioritize octreotide and use hyoscine primarily for spasmodic pain, often in combination when both symptoms coexist [^113uLyjE] [^114RDSdZ] [^117GTLsA] [^113269NT].

> I will now examine how this fits within a broader regimen. In inoperable MBO, a multimodal approach is standard: octreotide for secretions and vomiting, corticosteroids such as dexamethasone 4–16 mg/day for anti-inflammatory and potential deobstruction benefits, an antiemetic backbone like haloperidol or an H1 antagonist depending on obstruction type, and hyoscine butylbromide layered on top for colicky pain; this combination strategy is reflected in MASCC and ESMO-aligned guidance and in observational protocols showing improved symptom control with dual antisecretories [^113i227A] [^111vKaF2].

> Let me reconsider whether any higher-quality dose-finding data exist. I should confirm that no randomized trials have defined an optimal dose or schedule for hyoscine butylbromide in MBO; indeed, MASCC notes the absence of new RCTs since earlier systematic reviews, so current dosing remains consensus-based and should be individualized with careful monitoring and dose titration to effect and tolerability [^115ZnLQi] [^113wL3BP].

> Final synthesis: For malignant bowel obstruction, use injectable hyoscine butylbromide primarily to target colicky abdominal pain, starting at 20 mg IV every 6 hours and escalating to 40 mg every 6 hours if needed, with reassessment every 24–72 hours and continuation as long as pain persists and side effects remain acceptable; avoid use for emesis control where octreotide is preferred, and integrate with octreotide, corticosteroids, and appropriate antiemetics within a palliative, symptom-focused regimen, recognizing the low level of direct evidence and the need for individualized titration and monitoring [^113MuV3r] [^113uLyjE] [^113i227A] [^116MddWi].

---

For malignant bowel obstruction, **Buscopan (hyoscine butylbromide) 20 mg IV/IM every 6–8 hours** is recommended to reduce colicky abdominal pain and intestinal spasm [^113wL3BP] [^112Y3n6X]. It is not first-line for nausea/vomiting; octreotide is superior for vomiting control [^113uLyjE] [^114RDSdZ]. Use until symptoms are controlled, with reassessment every 24–48 hours; discontinue if ineffective or adverse effects occur. Avoid in complete obstruction with perforation risk, glaucoma, or myasthenia gravis [^112sjT8B].

---

## Indications and clinical rationale

Hyoscine butylbromide is indicated for malignant bowel obstruction to **reduce colicky abdominal pain and intestinal spasm** [^113wL3BP]; it is not first-line for nausea/vomiting, where octreotide is preferred [^113uLyjE] [^111dAeQf].

---

## Recommended dose and administration

- **Standard dose**: 20 mg IV or IM every 6–8 hours [^notfound].
- **Route**: IV for rapid onset; IM if IV access is limited.
- **Infusion**: May be combined with opioids in continuous subcutaneous infusions (e.g. 40–80 mg/day with tramadol 100–400 mg/day) [^113MuV3r].

---

## Duration of therapy

Continue until symptoms are controlled, with **reassessment every 24–48 hours**; discontinue if ineffective or adverse effects occur.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting use

Evidence is limited; MASCC suggests anticholinergics may reduce abdominal pain in MBO [^113wL3BP] [^112Y3n6X], but **octreotide is superior for vomiting** [^113uLyjE] [^114RDSdZ].

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

- **Common adverse effects**: Dry mouth, blurred vision, tachycardia, urinary retention.
- **Contraindications**: Glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, paralytic ileus, prostatic hypertrophy, hypersensitivity to anticholinergics [^112sjT8B].
- **Caution**: Use carefully in elderly patients due to anticholinergic burden [^112SvFZW].

---

## Integration with other therapies

Hyoscine butylbromide is often used with opioids for pain, octreotide for vomiting [^114RDSdZ], and corticosteroids for inflammation [^113i227A]; **multimodal regimens are common in palliative care** [^1173YuHE].

## Buscopan dosing for malignant bowel obstruction

| **Parameter** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Standard dose | 20 mg IV/IM every 6–8 hours |
| Infusion dose | 40–80 mg/day with tramadol 100–400 mg/day |
| Duration | Until symptom control; reassess every 24–48 hours |
| Contraindications | - Glaucoma <br/> - Myasthenia gravis <br/> - Paralytic ileus <br/> - Prostatic hypertrophy <br/> - Hypersensitivity to anticholinergics |
| Common adverse effects | - Dry mouth <br/> - Blurred vision <br/> - Tachycardia <br/> - Urinary retention |
| Integration with other therapies | - Opioids <br/> - Octreotide <br/> - Corticosteroids |

---

Buscopan is a useful adjunct for colicky pain in malignant bowel obstruction at **20 mg IV/IM every 6–8 hours**, with reassessment every 24–48 hours; it is not first-line for vomiting, and care should be taken with contraindications and anticholinergic effects.

Suggestions/recommendations

The following sections present each MBO management recommendation and its associated evidence (Table 3). In complete MBO, medication should be administered intravenously or subcutaneously if available.

Summary of suggestions and recommendations for MBO management, with associated level and grade of evidence

Anti-emetics

The 2021 MASCC guideline about select pharmacologic management of nausea and vomiting in MBO was released in August 2021 as an update to a previous guideline published in 2017. The following sections and Appendix B provide suggestions/recommendations for all anti-emetic drug classes reportedly used for MBO management and their associated existing evidence:

Anticholinergics

Suggestion: The benefit of anticholinergics (hyoscine butylbromide) may be inferior to octreotide to reduce vomiting in MBO. (Level of evidence: III; Grade: D).

Hyoscine (scopolamine) butylbromide is an anticholinergic agent that reduces gastrointestinal secretions. A 2016 systematic review identified four randomized clinical trials with high Cochrane risk of bias that found somatostatin analog (e.g. octreotide) were more effective than hyoscine butylbromide in reducing nausea and vomiting. Three case reports reported mixed findings, where two reported hyoscine butylbromide in combination with other drugs (e.g. octreotide, dexamethasone) was effective in reducing vomiting, and one that reported that it was ineffective for controlling vomiting. Since the publication of that review, no new randomized clinical trials have been published. An alternative anticholinergic that can reportedly be used is glycopyrrolate. However, this review only identified one case report that reported that glycopyrrolate reduced nausea and vomiting in MBO. Appendix B presents the characteristics of all included studies about anticholinergic use in MBO.

Butyrophenone antipsychotic

Suggestion: Haloperidol, a butyrophenone antipsychotic, may be an effective anti-emetic in MBO, particularly for complete MBO (level of evidence: IV; grade: B),

Butyrophenone antipsychotics are commonly used as anti-psychotics for delirium management but are also used for the management of nausea and vomiting in MBO. The main butyrophenone used is haloperidol. The review identified two cross-sectional studies and two case reports/series that reported on haloperidol's use in MBO. All studies suggested that haloperidol effectively relieve nausea and vomiting in MBO and is the preferred anti-emetic in complete BO.

Opioids

Suggestion: Opioids are commonly used to treat pain associated with MBO, but there is no evidence to support their use (level of evidence: V; grade D).

Opioids are the mainstay analgesic for the management of moderate and severe cancer-related pain, including in the context of MBO. The review did not identify any studies that specifically examined the use of opioids for pain management in MBO. Further study is warranted, especially given that opioids impair gastrointestinal motility and can cause nausea, vomiting, and constipation.

Anticholinergics

Suggestion: The benefit of anticholinergics (hyoscine butylbromide) may be effective to reduce abdominal pain in MBO (level of evidence: III; grade: D).

Hyoscine (scopolamine) butylbromide is an anticholinergic agent that is widely used to treat spasmodic abdominal pain. In addition to reducing gastrointestinal secretions, it slows propulsive peristalsis and relaxes smooth muscles of the gut. Hyoscine butylbromide is commonly recommended for the management of the inoperable MBO but scarce evidence supports its use. A 2016 systematic review identified two randomized clinical trials with high Cochrane risk of bias that found somatostatin analog (e.g. octreotide) were more effective than hyoscine butylbromide in reducing continuous pain. but one trial did not report this finding. Whereas, all three trials did not find a significant difference in colicky pain between octreotide and hyscine butylbromide. Two case reports reported hyoscine butylbromide in combination with other drugs (e.g. morphine, octreotide, and dexamethasone) was effective in reducing abdominal pain.

### A systematic review of the treatment of nausea and / or vomiting in cancer unrelated to chemotherapy or radiation [^117TdjXU]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2010). Low credibility.

Context

A systematic review of antiemetics for emesis in cancer unrelated to chemotherapy and radiation is an important step in establishing treatment recommendations and guiding future research. Therefore, a systematic review based on the question "What is the evidence that supports antiemetic choices in advanced cancer?" guided this review.

Objectives

To determine the level of evidence for antiemtrics in the management of nausea and vomiting in advanced cancer unrelated to chemotherapy and radiation, and to discover gaps in the evidence, which would provide important areas for future research.

Methods

Three databases and independent searches using different MeSH terms were performed. Related links were searched and hand searches of related articles were made. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective single-drug studies, studies that used guidelines based on the etiology of emesis, cohort studies, retrospective studies, and case series or single-patient reports. Studies that involved treatment of chemotherapy, radiation, or postoperation-related emesis were excluded. Studies that involved the treatment of emesis related to bowel obstruction were included. The strength of evidence was graded as follows: 1) RCTs, A; 2) single-drug prospective studies, B1; 3) studies based on multiple drug choices for etiology of emesis, B2; and 4) cohort, case series, retrospective, and single-patient reports, E. Level of evidence was determined by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence (May 2001) (A, B, C, D).

Results

Ninety-three articles were found. Fourteen were RCTs, most of them of low quality, based either on lack of blinding, lack of description of the method of randomization, concealment, and/or attrition. Metoclopramide had modest evidence (B) based on RCTs and prospective cohort studies. Octreotide, dexamethasone, and hyoscine butylbromide are effective in reducing symptoms of bowel obstruction, based on prospective studies and/or one RCT. There was no evidence that either multiple antiemetics or antiemetic choices based on the etiology of emesis were any better than a single antiemetic. There is poor evidence for dose response, intraclass or interclass drug switch, or antiemetic combinations in those individuals failing to respond to the initial antiemetic.

Conclusion

There are discrepancies between antiemetic studies and published antiemetic guidelines, which are largely based on expert opinion. Antiemetic recommendations have moderate to weak evidence at best. Prospective randomized trials of single antiemetics are needed to properly establish evidence-based guidelines.

Somatostatin analog

Recommendation: Somatostatin analog (octreotide, lanreotide) may reduce vomiting in MBO (levels of evidence: I; grade A).

MBO can cause intestinal secretions to accumulate and contribute to bowel distention, resulting in nausea and vomiting. Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that reduces intestinal and pancreas secretion and gastrointestinal motility, biliary contraction, and intestinal edema. Octreotide may be administered by subcutaneous bolus or continuous subcutaneous infusion. Its duration of activity is approximately 6 to 12 h, with an average half-life elimination of 1.8 h, thus necessitating multiple daily dosing schedules. Given it has a short half-life, a long-acting depot formulation is available to be administered intramuscularly once a month. Furthermore, another somatostatin analog, lanreotide, is available as a long-acting depot formulation.

A 2016 systematic review of randomized control trials and quasi-randomized control trials, published between 1979 and 2016, identified seven studies that compared the effect of somatostatin analog with placebo and/or other pharmacologic agents (e.g. hyoscine butylbromide) on vomiting. A meta-analysis was not possible given the heterogeneity in study design, outcomes, and timing of endpoints. Of these seven studies, five studies with high Cochrane risk of bias found the somatostatin analog were more effective than hyoscine butylbromide and placebo for reducing vomiting. Whereas two studies with low Cochrane risk of bias found no significant difference in vomiting between somatostatin analog and placebo in their primary end points. A secondary analysis of a randomized control trial originally published in 2015 examined the health-related quality of life in patients with inoperable MBO and found no difference in quality-of-life scores.

Thienobenzodiazepene (second-generation) antipsychotic

Suggestion: Thienobenzodiazepene antipsychotic (e.g. olanzapine) may reduce nausea and vomiting in MBO (level of evidence: IV; grade: D).

Olanzapine is a second-generation thienobenzodiazepine antipsychotic that antagonizes serotonin 5-HT 3 and 5-HT 2c and dopamine D 2 receptors, which may be responsible for its anti-emetic effects. We identified one cross-sectional study, published in 2012, that found olanzapine reduced the average nausea scores and frequency of vomiting in patients with advanced cancer and partial BO.

### Medical treatment for inoperable malignant bowel obstruction: a qualitative systematic review [^114K5Uzh]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2007). Low credibility.

The use of symptomatic agents has greatly improved the medical treatment of advanced cancer patients with inoperable bowel obstruction. A systematic review of studies of the most popular drugs used in the medical management of inoperable malignant bowel obstruction was performed to assess the effectiveness of these treatments and provide some lines of evidence. Randomized trials that involved patients with a clinical diagnosis of intestinal obstruction due to advanced cancer treated with these drugs were reviewed. Five reports fulfilled inclusion criteria. Three studies compared octreotide (OC) and hyoscine butylbromide (HB), and two studies compared corticosteroids (CSs) and placebo. Globally, 52 patients received OC, 51 patients received HB, 37 patients received CSs, 15 patients received placebo, and 37 patients received both placebo and CSs. On the basis of these few data, the superiority of OC over HB in relieving gastrointestinal symptoms was evidenced in a total of 103 patients. The latter studies had samples more defined in terms of stage and inoperability, and had a shorter survival in comparison with studies of CSs (less than 61 days, most of them less than 20 days). Data on CSs are less convincing, due to the methodological weakness of existing studies. This review confirms the difficulties in conducting randomized controlled trials in this population.

### Medical management of malignant bowel obstruction in patients with advanced cancer: 2021 MASCC guideline update [^111dAeQf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a frequent complication in patients with advanced cancer, particularly colon or gynecological malignancies. MASCC previously published a guideline for symptom management of MBO in 2017. This is a 5-year update.

Method

A systematic search and review of relevant literature includes a review published in 2010 and 2017. The guideline update used the same literature search process as followed in 2015. The dates of the new search included 2015 up to February 2, 2021. The guidelines involved the pharmacologic management of nausea and vomiting in malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) only. Only randomized trials were included in the updated guideline as evidence. The evidence was reviewed by the panel and the MASCC criteria for establishing a guideline were followed using MASCC level of grading and category of evidence.

Results

There was one systematic review and 3 randomized trials accepted as evidence from 257 abstracts. Octreotide is effective in reducing gastrointestinal secretions and colic and thereby reduces nausea and vomiting caused by MBO. Scopolamine butylbromide is inferior to octreotide in the doses used in the comparison study. Olanzapine or metoclopramide may be effective in reducing nausea and vomiting secondary to partial bowel obstructions. The panel suggests using either drug. Additional studies are needed to clarify benefits. Haloperidol has been used by convention as an antiemetic but has not been subjected to a randomized comparison. Ranitidine plus dexamethasone may be effective in reducing nausea and vomiting from MBO but cannot be recommended until there is a comparison with octreotide.

Discussion

Octreotide remains the drug of choice in managing MBO. Ranitidine was used in one randomized trial in all participants and so its effectiveness as a single drug is not known until there is a randomized comparison with octreotide. Antiemetics such as metoclopramide and olanzapine may be effective, but we have very few randomized trials of antiemetics in MBO.

Conclusion

The panel recommends octreotide in non-operable MBO. Randomized trials are needed to clarify ranitidine and antiemetic choices.

### Somatostatin analogues compared with placebo and other pharmacologic agents in the management of symptoms of inoperable malignant bowel obstruction: a systematic review [^111du98N]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Somatostatin analogues are commonly used to relieve symptoms in malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) but are more expensive than other antisecretory agents.

Objectives

To evaluate the evidence of effectiveness of somatostatin analogues compared with placebo and/or other pharmacologic agents in relieving vomiting in patients with inoperable MBO.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases were systematically searched; reference lists of relevant articles were hand searched. Cochrane risk of bias tool was used.

Results

The search identified 420 unique studies. Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria (six octreotide studies and one lanreotide); 220 people administered somatostatin analogues and 207 placebo or hyoscine butylbromide. Three RCTs compared a somatostatin analogue with placebo and four with hyoscine butylbromide. Two adequately powered multicenter RCTs with a low Cochrane risk of bias reported no significant difference between somatostatin analogues and placebo in their primary end points. Four RCTs with a high/unclear Cochrane risk of bias reported that somatostatin analogues were more effective than hyoscine butylbromide in reducing vomiting.

Conclusion

There is low-level evidence of benefit with somatostatin analogues in the symptomatic treatment of MBO. However, high-level evidence from trials with low risk of bias found no benefit of somatostatin analogues for their primary outcome. There is debate regarding the clinically relevant study end point for symptom control in MBO and when it should be measured. The role of somatostatin analogues in this clinical situation requires further adequately powered, well-designed trials with agreed clinically important end points and measures.

### Hyoscine butylbromide mode of action on bowel motility: from pharmacology to clinical practice [^113GNyXg]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyoscine butylbromide (HBB) has been available for use as an antispasmodic since 1951 and is indicated for the treatment of abdominal pain associated with cramps. A previous review in 2007 summarized the evidence on the mode of action of HBB in vitro and in vivo in both animal and human studies. However, since then, novel publications have appeared within the literature and also our knowledge of what represents normal motility in humans has evolved.

Purpose

This review is the result of the collaboration between a basic scientist and clinicians with the aim of providing an updated overview of the mechanisms of action of HBB and its clinical efficacy to guide not only use in clinical practice, but also future research.

### Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of octreotide in malignant bowel obstruction [^113pVquw]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Does octreotide reduce vomiting in cancer-associated bowel obstruction?

Objectives

To evaluate the net effect of adding octreotide or placebo to standardized therapies on the number of days free of vomiting for populations presenting with vomiting and inoperable bowel obstruction secondary to cancer or its treatment.

Methods

Twelve services enrolled people with advanced cancer presenting with vomiting secondary to bowel obstruction where surgery or anti-cancer therapies were not indicated immediately. In a double-blind study, participants were randomized to placebo or octreotide (600 μg/24 hours by infusion). Both arms received standardized supportive therapy (infusion of ranitidine [200 mg/24 hours], dexamethasone [8 mg/24 hours], and parenteral hydration [10–20 mL/kg/24 hours]). The primary outcome was patient-reported days free of vomiting at 72 hours.

Results

In a study that recruited to the numbers identified in its power calculation, 87 participants provided data at 72 hours (45, octreotide arm). Seventeen people (octreotide) and 14 (placebo) were free of vomiting for 72 hours (P = 0.67). Mean days free of vomiting were 1.87 (SD 1.10; octreotide) and 1.69 (SD 1.15; placebo; P = 0.47). An adjusted multivariate regression of the incidence of vomiting over the study showed a reduced number of episodes of vomiting in the octreotide group (incidence rate ratio = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.19–0.86; P = 0.019); however, people in the octreotide arm were 2.02 times more likely to be administered hyoscine butylbromide (P = 0.004), potentially reflecting increased colicky pain.

Conclusion

Although there was no reduction in the number of days free of vomiting, the multivariate analysis suggests that further study of somatostatin analogues in this setting is warranted.

### Considerations in the management of malignant bowel obstruction [^1177DwjH]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Malignant bowel obstruction is a challenging clinical problem encountered in patients with advanced abdominal and pelvic malignancies. Although medical therapies form the foundation of management, some patients may be suitable candidates for surgical and procedural interventions. The literature is composed primarily of retrospective single-institution experiences and the results of prospective trials are pending. Given the high symptom burden and limited life expectancy of these patients, management may be best informed by multidisciplinary teams with relevant expertise.

Regarding medical management for palliative care in patients with cancer, more specifically with respect to management of bowel obstruction, anticholinergics, ESMO/MASCC 2016 guidelines recommend to administer anticholinergic antisecretory agents (such as scopolamine butylbromide, glycopyrronium bromide) and/or corticosteroids as an adjunct or an alternative option if octreotide plus an antiemetic is suboptimal.

Subacute bowel obstruction

Experience suggests that important medical causes include abnormal electrolyte balance, opioid drugs, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, excessive faecal loading, severe fat malabsorption and excessive dietary fibre.

A trial of antibiotics and/or a low-fat diet (if steatorrhoea is present) and/or treatment with a bile acid sequestrant as appropriate may help. If the radiology suggests focal colonic faecal loading or a colonic site of obstruction or there is iron deficiency anaemia, colonoscopy should be considered. Excess fibre in the diet may precipitate subacute obstruction if a stricture is present. Some patients are very sensitive to opiates and can have prolonged colonic inertia even following small doses.

If low-fibre diets are indicated they should be prescribed by a qualified dietitian, should initially be time limited and the clinical benefit from the diet reviewed. Additional laxatives may be required. Data may emerge for the role of hyperbaric oxygen in treating patients with subacute obstruction due to radiation-induced fibrosis from the national ongoing HOT 2 trial (EudraCT No 2008–002152–26).

Surgery with a view to releasing adhesions or resecting strictures after previous pelvic radiotherapy can be particularly challenging because of dense abdominal fibrosis, and carries significantly higher risks of complications (eg, anastomotic leakages, postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis and intestinal fistulation) than surgery in a non-irradiated patient. Such surgery should be performed only by experienced surgeons with a low threshold for proximal faecal diversion. If an enteric motility disorder is also present (not uncommon), surgery may not lead to resolution of the symptoms.

Obstruction due to recurrent cancer

If cancer is present, the nature of the intervention should be influenced by the expected prognosis of the recurrence. Selected patients with no ascites, life expectancy > 2 months and good performance status may benefit from palliative decompressive surgery, but placement of self-expanding metal stents (if possible) appears to offer a better outcome. Expert medical management with opioids, antispasmodics (eg, hyoscine butyl bromide), antiemetics, antisecretory agents (eg, octreotide), corticosteroids and nasogastric tubes or venting gastrostomies can be effective in helping to control symptoms. Early input from surgeons and palliative care specialists should be sought.

Chronic syndromes: key facts

Symptoms are unreliable at identifying the underlying cause
Many cancer treatments have systemic effects and are not limited by normal anatomical boundaries
Patients may not report even severe symptoms reliably
Patients and clinicians may differ as to what constitute significant symptoms.

Analgesics for malignant bowel obstruction — Pain is experienced by 70 to 90% of patients with MBO. The WHO Guidelines for the Pharmacologic and Radiotherapeutic Management of Cancer Pain in Adults and Adolescents recommend that analgesics should be given by mouth whenever possible. However, patients with MBO often have significant nausea and vomiting and malfunctioning gastrointestinal tracts that prevent ingestion and absorption of oral analgesics; consequently, the parenteral (subcutaneous or intravenous) and/or transdermal routes of administration should be considered for this population to deliver effective analgesia, and a comparison of subcutaneous and intravenous routes found no differences, confirming both routes as feasible, effective, and safe.

Somatostatin analogs for malignant bowel obstruction — Recommendation: Somatostatin analog (octreotide, lanreotide) may reduce vomiting in MBO (levels of evidence: I; grade A). Octreotide may be administered by subcutaneous bolus or continuous subcutaneous infusion. Its duration of activity is approximately 6 to 12 h, with an average half-life elimination of 1.8 h, and a long-acting depot formulation is available to be administered intramuscularly once a month; lanreotide is available as a long-acting depot formulation. A 2016 systematic review of randomized control trials and quasi-randomized control trials, published between 1979 and 2016, identified seven studies, whereas two studies with low Cochrane risk of bias found no significant difference in vomiting between somatostatin analog and placebo in their primary endpoints, and a secondary analysis found no difference in quality-of-life scores.

### Outcome prognostic factors in inoperable malignant bowel obstruction [^113j7hys]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Inoperable malignant bowel obstruction (MBO), a severe complication of peritoneal carcinomatosis, has a low desobstruction rate (30–40%) and end-of-life decision-making is hampered by the lack of known prognostic factors. This study aimed to explore prognostic factors for desobstruction in MBO.

Methods

All patients with inoperable MBO admitted in our large oncology hospital between 2010 and 2013 were treated following a clinical protocol based on antiemetics, steroids and two antisecretories, octreotide, and hyoscine butylbromide. Two prognostic factor analyses using logistic regressions were performed, one based on data from day 1 of admission and the other on data from day 8.

Results

Forty-five patients were included. Frequency of desobstruction was 48.9%. In the analysis of prognostic factors on day 1, MBO episodes derived from functional physiopathologic mechanisms (vs. mechanic or mixed) were more prone to resolve (p < 0.001 corrected for multiple comparisons). Considering patients alive with persistent obstruction on day 8, a better clinical condition was the variable more associated with desobstruction, but without statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons.

Conclusions

A functional physiopathologic mechanism of MBO development may be an early prognostic factor for desobstruction. A high proportion of desobstruction was observed, suggesting that the combination of antisecretories with different mechanism of action warrants further investigation.

### Colon distension, perceived burden and side-effects of CT-colonography for screening using hyoscine butylbromide or glucagon hydrochloride as bowel relaxant [^1169RUgq]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Compare colonic distension and perceived burden of CT-colonography between participants receiving hyoscine butylbromide (buscopan) and glucagon hydrochloride as bowel relaxant.

Materials and Methods

Data were collected within a screening trial. Participants received 20mg buscopan intravenously or 1mg of glucagon intravenously (if buscopan contra-indicated). Colon distension per segment was assessed using a 4-point scale (prone and supine). Data on perceived burden of CT-colonography were collected using a questionnaire two weeks after the examination. Outcome measures between groups were compared using propensity score matching. We used a stratified Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test statistic for quantitative and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistics for categorical variables.

Results

541 participants were included: 336 (62%) received buscopan and 205 received glucagon. All buscopan recipients had an adequately distended colon, compared to 96% in the glucagon group (RR 7.31, 95% CI: 1.61–33.28). More glucagon recipients scored the insufflation as rather or extremely burdensome (25% vs. 16%; overall mean score 2.7 vs. 2.4; p < 0.001) and more found the entire CT-colonography rather or extremely burdensome (14% vs. 7%; 2.2 vs. 1.9; p = 0.001). Most frequently reported side effects were a dry mouth in the buscopan group (15%) and nausea in the glucagon group (13%).

Conclusion

Compared to glucagon, premedication with buscopan results in significantly more adequately distended colons and a less burdensome procedure. When buscopan can be used, it is the preferred bowel relaxant.

### Reducing gastric secretions – a role for histamine 2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors in malignant bowel obstruction? [^112YJgem]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Goals Of Work

Inoperable bowel obstructions are not uncommon in advanced cancer and are associated with a very poor prognosis. Symptom control includes reducing the frequency of vomiting by prescription of antisecretory medications. The most commonly used agents for this are either hyoscine butylbromide or octreotide. Either histamine 2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors are sometimes recommended as adjuvants to reduce gastric secretions. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of histamine 2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors and to objectively compare the effects of one agent over another.

Materials and Methods

Previously, electronic databases were searched for trials that compared ranitidine versus proton pump inhibitors in their effect on volume of gastric aspirates.

Results

Seven trials were included in a meta-analysis. Pooled outcomes suggest that both proton pump inhibitors and ranitidine reduce gastric volumes, but the most superior agent is ranitidine, which reduces the volume of gastric secretions by an average of 0.22 ml.kg(-1); 95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.41.

Conclusions

Based on well-conducted studies, objective evidence exists that confirms ranitidine will decrease the volume of gastric aspirates. This forms a sound basis from which to develop further research aimed at improving the care of people with malignant bowel obstructions.

### Pharmacologic management of malignant bowel obstruction: when surgery is not an option [^116qDTVV]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) complicates 3%-15% of cancers and often necessitates inpatient admission. Hospitalists are increasingly involved in treating patients with MBO and coordinating their care across multiple subspecialties. Direct resolution of the obstruction via surgical or interventional means is always preferable. When such options are not possible, pharmacological treatments are the mainstay of therapy. Medications such as somatostatin analogs, steroids, H2-blockers, and other modalities can be effective in palliation and possible resolution of obstruction. Awareness of these pharmacologic therapies can aid hospitalists in treating patients who are confronted with this devastating condition.

### Effect of hyoscine butylbromide (buscopan ®) on cholinergic pathways in the human intestine [^112UUuv8]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hyoscine butylbromide (HBB, Buscopan(®)) is clinically used to treat intestinal cramps and visceral pain. Various studies, mainly on animal tissues, suggested that its antimuscarinic action is responsible for its spasmolytic effect. However, functional in vitro studies with human tissue have not been performed so far.

Methods

We wanted to provide a comprehensive study on the mode of action of HBB in human intestinal samples and investigated HBB (1 nmol L(-1) -10 μmol L(-1)) effects on muscle activity with isometric force transducers and calcium imaging, on epithelial secretion with Ussing chamber technique and on enteric neurons using fast neuroimaging.

Key Results

Hyoscine butylbromide concentration dependently reduced muscle contractions, calcium mobilization, and epithelial secretion induced by the muscarinic agonist bethanechol with IC50 values of 429, 121, and 224 nmol L(-1), respectively. Forskolin-induced secretion was not altered by HBB. Cholinergic muscarinic muscle and epithelial responses evoked by electrical nerve stimulation were inhibited by 1–10 μmol L(-1) HBB. Moreover, HBB significantly reduced the bethanechol-induced action potential discharge in enteric neurons. Interestingly, we observed that high concentrations of HBB (10 μmol L(-1)) moderately decreased nicotinic receptor-mediated secretion, motility, and nerve activity.

Conclusions & Inferences

The results demonstrated the strong antimuscarinic action of HBB whereas the nicotinic antagonism at higher concentrations plays at most a moderate modulatory role. The muscle relaxing effect of HBB and its inhibition of muscarinic nerve activation likely explain its clinical use as an antispasmodic drug. Our results further highlight a so far unknown antisecretory action of HBB which warrants further clinical studies on its use in secretory disorders.

### Is there a role for antimuscarinics in renal colic? A randomized controlled trial [^117Y39LP]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determined whether the addition of hyoscine butylbromide (Buscopan) reduces the amount of opioid analgesia required and the need for ongoing opioid analgesia in acute renal colic.

Materials and Methods

Patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute renal colic were prospectively randomized to receive Buscopan or placebo in addition to morphine and intravenous fluids, with or without indomethacin. Observations and pain scores were recorded 15 every minutes during the first hour then hourly thereafter. Morphine was administered in 2.5 mg increments until pain relief was achieved. Recordings were ceased at 4 hours or on discharge from the emergency department, whichever occurred first. The diagnosis of renal colic was confirmed by computerized tomography. The dose of morphine (mg/kg) and the proportion of patients who required further morphine were compared between the 2 groups.

Results

Of the 192 patients randomized, data were available for 178 on an intent to treat basis. A total of 85 patients received Buscopan while 93 received placebo in addition to standard therapy. Patients in the Buscopan group required a median of 0.12 mg/kg of morphine while those in the placebo group received a median of 0.11 mg/kg, and this difference was not significant (p = 0.4). There was also no significant difference in the proportion of patients who required additional morphine, 33% in the Buscopan group and 38% in the placebo group (p = 0.5). Subgroup analysis of the 138 patients with a confirmed stone also showed no difference between the groups.

Conclusions

There is no evidence that Buscopan reduces opioid requirements or the need for ongoing opioid analgesia in acute renal colic.

### Tramadol and hyoscine N-butyl bromide combined in infusion solutions: compatibility and stability [^113MuV3r]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Background

More than two-thirds of patients with metastatic cancer experience pain. Tramadol is one of the most interesting and useful weak opioids used by palliative care units to treat moderate to moderately severe pain. Relief of distressful symptoms in terminally ill patients is of prime importance; a common practice is to administer opioid analgesics in conjunction with other drugs as hyoscine N-butyl bromide, which is very useful in reducing secretions in patients with inoperable malignant bowel obstruction. The pursuit for excellence in symptom control in patients unable to take oral medication has led to the administration of medications by other routes such as the subcutaneous route.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to fulfill the lack of information regarding the compatibility and physical stability of tramadol hydrochloride and hyoscine N-butyl bromide combined in infusion solutions.

Methods

The stability of nine admixtures (stored in polypropylene syringes) at 4 and 25 degrees C was assessed over a period of 15 days.

Results

Nonstatistically significant losses of tramadol HCl and a maximum loss of 7% for hyoscine N-butyl bromide were obtained. Therefore, tramadol HCl (dose range, 100–400 mg/day) can be formulated together in saline with hyoscine N-butyl bromide (dose range 40–80 mg/day) for s.c. infusion using a 60-ml drug infuser for a duration of 7 days.

### Ethical issues in research to improve the management of malignant bowel obstruction: challenges and recommendations [^114E9Ga9]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2007). Low credibility.

Research to improve the care of patients with malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is urgently needed. In particular, there is an urgent need for high-quality descriptive research, including prospective cohort studies, as well as randomized controlled trials to define optimal management strategies. However, investigators and clinicians face numerous barriers in conducting high-quality research in this patient population. These barriers include lack of funding, difficulties in identifying eligible patients, and a variety of practical and methodological challenges of designing these studies. In addition, there are a variety of ethical challenges that arise in the design and conduct of studies of MBO and particularly in the conduct of clinical trials. In this article, we address four categories of ethical issues: study design, recruitment, informed consent, and Institutional Review Board review. For each, we outline salient issues and suggest recommendations for enhancing the ethics of MBO studies, including interventional trials.

### MASCC multidisciplinary evidence-based recommendations for the management of malignant bowel obstruction in advanced cancer [^116YgSsJ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Etiology

MBO most frequently occurs when patients have advanced cancers that originate in the abdomen or pelvis. Though the incidence of MBO is not well established, based on retrospective and autopsy-based studies, MBO is estimated to occur in 10–28% of patients with gastrointestinal cancers and up to 51% of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Limitations of these estimates include patient population selection and nonhomogeneous criteria to diagnose MBO.

The mechanisms of MBO development are multi-factorial and can be divided into two main groups: mechanical and functional obstruction. Causes of mechanical obstruction include extrinsic obstruction of the lumen by pathology, such as mesenteric and omental masses, adhesions, and fibrosis; intra-luminal obstruction from tumor growth in the bowel; and intra-mural obstruction by tumor within the bowel wall, which impairs motility. Whereas functional obstruction is a result of motility disorders, which can be due to tumor infiltration of mesentery, nerves and/or celiac and enteric plexus, and paraneoplastic syndromes. Further, nonmalignant factors may induce or worsen bowel obstruction (BO) in patients with advanced cancer, including constipation/fecal impaction, pharmacological (i.e. opioids, intra-peritoneal chemotherapy), fibrosis, and adhesions from prior surgery and radiotherapy.

Pathophysiology and symptoms

MBO can occur in the small or large bowel, with small BO being more common. The obstruction can be partial or complete and can occur at single or multiple transition points. MBO causes reduction or absence of movements of the intestinal content and bowel distension. The accumulation of content in the intestinal lumen increases the epithelial surface area and prompts an accumulation of gastric, pancreatic, biliary secretions, water, and salt, which damages the intestinal epithelium and triggers an inflammatory response with intestinal edema, hyperemia, and production of inflammatory mediators (i.e. prostaglandins, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and nociceptive mediators). Bacterial overgrowth and translocation are important mechanisms in the development of symptoms. The cumulative impact of these events results in abdominal pain, cramps, distention, nausea, vomiting, absence of gas and stool passage, and, occasionally, overflow diarrhea. MBO symptoms usually start gradually and become more frequent and severe when a complete obstruction occurs. Re-obstruction and malnutrition are common, with malnutrition being an independent predictor of poor survival in this population.

Corticosteroids in malignant bowel obstruction — MASCC suggestion, dosing, and outcomes: Suggestion: The use of steroids may be helpful in MBO (level of evidence: III; grade: B). Corticosteroids likely have anti-inflammatory and anti-secretory effects that may decrease intestinal wall edema, promote salt and water absorption, and help with acute management of pain, nausea, and vomiting. For dosing, a dose between 4 and 16 mg of dexamethasone daily may be considered, and in cases of no symptomatic improvement in 3 to 5 days, discontinuation should be considered. Observational data from a Japanese claims cohort of 3,090 adults with MBO treated with octreotide reported that among the 1595 with nasogastric tubes, adding corticosteroids was associated with higher odds of tube removal within four days (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.08–1.23). A Cochrane meta-analysis of three double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving 89 patients found a trend favoring corticosteroids for resolution of BO within 10 days (relative risk of 0.51 (95% CI 0.19–1.43)), with the number needed to treat six, no effect on mortality at one month, and a very low incidence of adverse events, while the use of the lowest effective dose for the shortest period should be considered. In a multi-center randomized trial of octreotide for vomiting in MBO, dexamethasone (8 mg daily, intravenously) with ranitidine and hydration was the standardized supportive therapy.

### Anticholinergic agents and impaired cognitive function: is there a risk for patients with irritable bowel syndrome? [^117JCa9n]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

With regard to their chemical structure, anticholinergics can be classified into tertiary amines (e.g. atropine, dicycloverine, hyoscine hydrobromide) and quaternary ammonium salts (e.g. hyoscine butylbromide and propantheline). Quaternary ammonium salts are highly polar, which results in them being poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and exhibiting poor penetration of the blood–brain barrier, in contrast to the tertiary amines. The availability of antispasmodics in general and anticholinergics in particular varies from country to country, and Table 1 lists some of the more commonly available anticholinergics on a worldwide basis and whether they have a quaternary ammonium structure.

Table 1.
Quaternary and non-quaternary ammonium antimuscarinic agents available in various countries around the world.

Hyoscine butylbromide (Buscopan, butylscopolaminebromide) is a quaternary ammonium antimuscarinic medication which is extensively used in many countries for the treatment of IBS and is recommended in several guidelines. Its spasmolytic activity has been demonstrated in a number of mechanistic studiesand its therapeutic potential confirmed in a meta-analysis of clinical trials involving patients with abdominal pain or IBS where it was shown to be the most effective spasmolytic. Approximately 8% of the drug is absorbed when it is taken by mouth, resulting in very low blood levels following therapeutic doses. Furthermore, it has been confirmed in animal and human ex vivo studies that hyoscine butylbromide in the gut lumen exerts its antispasmodic activity locally without the need for systemic absorption. The lack of systemic absorption significantly reduces the chances of any impairment of cognitive function, and the fact that hyoscine butylbromide is highly polar also results in poor penetration of the blood–brain barrier, making a negative effect on the brain even less likely. It should be noted that different hyoscine compounds, for instance hyoscine hydrobromide, have different pharmacological properties from hyoscine butylbromide, and this is not necessarily taken into account in some anticholinergic burden scoring systems.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria were referral for OC, age ≥ 18 years, and the ability to give written and orally informed consent. Patients were excluded in case of inflammatory bowel disease, pregnancy, colostomy after colorectal surgery, colorectal biopsy performed within 72 h, and/or polypectomy within 2 weeks prior to CTC, and/or known allergy with Buscopan.

Diagnostic procedures

Examination technique

All patients underwent a colonic preparation using a low-fibre diet, 2 l polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution (Moviprep; Norgine, Mid Glamorgan, UK) and faecal tagging. In 67 patients (hospital A), faecal tagging was obtained with 100 mL ionic iodinated contrast (Gastrografin 370 mgI/ml; Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, USA) soluted in 400 mL water and administered the day before their CTC. In 20 patients (hospital B), faecal tagging was obtained with 20 mL non-ionic iodinated contrast (Iomeron 300 mgI/ml; Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, USA) soluted in 200 mL water and administered in the late afternoon the day before the examination.

In 67 patients (hospital A), 20 mg i.v. hyoscine butylbromide (Buscopan; Boehringer, Ingelheim, Germany) was used for bowel relaxation. All patients underwent colonic insufflation with carbon dioxide using a CO 2 injector (PROTOCO2L; Bracco, Princeton, USA). At hospital B, there was no use of medicine for bowel relaxation.

All the examinations were performed using a 64-channel multislice CT scanner (hospital A, Brilliance Philips Medical Systems, The Netherlands; hospital B, Lightspeed, General Electric Medical Systems, France).

Scans were obtained at 50 mAs (hospital A) and 40 mAs (hospital B) with 120 kV. Patients were examined in supine and prone positions with identical scanning parameters for both positions: collimation 64 × 0.625, slice thickness 1 mm, increment 1 mm, rotation time 0.5 s.

Part 2: randomised, placebo-controlled trial comparing bisacodyl and hyoscine

Study design

Constipated subjects from part 1 were invited to take part in a randomised double-blind, double-dummy, cross-over study comparing bowel habit and pain response to a 10-day treatment with either a stimulant laxative, bisacodyl (10 mg daily) or a muscle relaxant, hyoscine butylbromide (20 mg three times per day). Active drug and placebo were provided as identical-appearing overencapsulated capsules, one taken three times daily and one once a day.

Concealed allocation was performed using a numbered container with the sequence bisacodyl versus hyoscine being randomly allocated by Nottingham hospital pharmacy who kept the code, which was not released until data lock. Participants completed a daily diary documenting the number of bowel movements and for each bowel movement, the BSFS and feeling of completeness of evacuation. Each day, they also recorded a pain score (in answer to the question what their 'worst' pain was in that 24-hour period, scored from 1 to 5) and completed a modified mPAC-SYM questionnaire (online supplemental E1.1) before and after the treatment period. Rescue medication (prucalopride, senna or sodium picosulphate based on what they had used before) was allowed if they had no bowel movement for 3 days. Dose reduction was permitted for excessive side effects (see online supplemental E.1). Data were collected on paper CRFs and diaries and collated with both participants and investigators blinded to active ingredient. Unblinding was performed only after completion of data collection and data lock.

Primary endpoint

Difference in average worst daily pain between bisacodyl and hyoscine intervention periods.

Secondary endpoints

The number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBM), mPAC-SYM score and number of days with either hard (BSFS 1 or 2) or no stool.

Exploratory endpoints

We also determined whether any objective MRI or manometry measures could predict clinical response as defined by other authors. A bisacodyl 'responder' was defined as a patient who had an increase in 1 CSBM per weekwhile hyoscine 'responder' had a reduction in (m) PAC-SYM by the previously defined minimal clinically important difference of > 0.6 points (ie, reduction in pain).

### Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of intravenously administered hyoscine N-butyl bromide in patients undergoing colonoscopy with patient-controlled sedation [^115tp3vC]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

A prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted to investigate the effect of the antispasmodic hyoscine N-butyl bromide (Buscopan) during colonoscopy.

Methods

A total of 120 patients undergoing colonoscopy were randomized to receive either 40 mg of hyoscine N-butyl bromide (n = 60) or normal saline solution (n = 60) intravenously as premedication. Colonoscopy was performed under patient-controlled sedation. Outcome measures included cecal intubation and total procedure time, demanded and administered doses of patient-controlled sedation, spasm score, pain score, endoscopist satisfaction score, patient willingness to repeat colonoscopy, and vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate) during colonoscopy.

Results

Mean cecal intubation time in the hyoscine N-butyl bromide group was significantly longer than the control group (12.20 vs. 9.74 minutes; p = 0.04; but correction for multiple testing of data removed this significance). The use of hyoscine N-butyl bromide was associated with a significantly lower endoscopist mean satisfaction score (6.47 vs. 7.30; p = 0.04; but correction for multiple testing of data removed this significance), higher demanded and administered mean doses of patient-controlled sedation (respectively, 34.80 and 7.25 vs. 24.20 and 5.87; p = 0.045; p = 0.04, respectively; but correction for multiple testing of data removed these findings of significance), fewer patients willing to repeat colonoscopy (60% vs. 83.9%; p = 0.005), and more hemodynamic instability (p < 0.001) when compared with the control group. No significant difference was found in the total procedure time, spasm score, or pain score.

Conclusions

Premedication with intravenously administered hyoscine N-butyl bromide impedes colonoscope insertion and causes greater patient discomfort, as well as hemodynamic instability.

Suggestion: Granisetron, serotonin (5HT 3) antagonist may reduce nausea and the frequency of vomiting in MBO (level of evidence: III; grade D).

Serotonin (5-HT 3) antagonists act on receptors located in the chemoreceptor trigger zone to reduce nausea and vomiting. The review identified only one study published in 2009 that examined the use of a 5-HT 3 antagonist, granisetron, for MBO management. This study was a phase II clinical trial that found granisetron, in addition to dexamethasone and as-needed haloperidol, significantly reduced the severity of nausea (p < 0.001) and a number of episodes of vomiting (p < 0.001) before and after treatment. However, the reported incidence of constipation associated with granisetron ranges from 3 to 18%. Further studies are required to assess its use in MBO.

### Water enema multidetector CT technique and imaging of diverticulitis and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases [^1121VBMN]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Patient preparation

In the CT suite, patient preparation is performed by experienced radiology nurses, with gentle insertion of a lubricated enema tube into the rectum with the patient lying on the CT scanner table in the left lateral decubitus position. The tube is then connected to a bag that contains 2 l of warm tap water, and retrograde colonic distension is obtained through gravity during 3–5 min. Afterwards, the patient is instructed to turn on his right side to improve water distribution and is then positioned supine for CT acquisition. Alternatively, incontinent patients may have an enema performed using an inflatable balloon tip.

Unless contraindicated, we routinely administer pharmacological hypotonisation with 20 mg hyoscine buthylbromide (Buscopan, Boehringer Ingelheim, Florence, Italy) intravenously injected prior to scan planning. Hypotonisation improves patient comfort, facilitates colonic wall distension, and reduces peristalsis, motion artefacts, mural spasms and contraction, allowing better assessment of the mural thickness and identification of true luminal stenosis.

MDCT acquisition protocol

Then volumetric CT acquisition of the abdomen and pelvis during a single breath-hold is performed during intravenous injection of 110–130 mL of non-ionic iodinated contrast medium (such as 350 mgI/ml iomeprol or 370 mgI/ml iopromide) using an automated power injection at a 2.5 ml/s flow rate, with a 75-s scan delay. Acquisition parameters on a 64-slice CT scanner include 120 KV, 300 mAs, 0.891 pitch, 0.75 s rotation time, and 64 × 0.625 mm collimation. The estimated radiation exposure during WE-MDCT acquisition using this protocol is usually in the range of 12–14 mGy.

Exam safety

Then, the water enema is drained before the patient leaves the CT suite. The total examination time is about 10 min. In agreement with other authors, in our experience preliminary preparation and examination are well tolerated by the majority of patients, and we did not observe any adverse effects or complications.

### Current concepts in malignant bowel obstruction management [^111Rtio9]. Current Oncology Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a challenging complication of advanced cancer. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms are responsible for the syndrome, including mechanical compression, motility disorders, gastrointestinal secretion accumulation, decreased gastrointestinal absorption, and inflammation. The treatment of related symptoms requires a collaborative approach of surgical, interventional, and medical specialists. The surgical approach proves beneficial in selected patients with operable lesions, life expectancy greater than 2 months, and good performance status. Interventionalists place self-expanding metallic stents as a minimally invasive palliative method either as a definitive treatment or as a bridge to surgery. However, most patients with MBO are not candidates for surgery or stent placement. Medical management with opioids, antispasmodics, antiemetics, antisecretory agents, and corticosteroids is effective in controlling the symptoms associated with MBO. This article discusses the current understanding of MBO pathophysiology and emphasizes current MBO management concepts; it then reviews surgical, interventional, and medical approaches.

### Medical management of inoperable malignant bowel obstruction [^1173YuHE]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review medical management of inoperable malignant bowel obstruction.

Data Sources

A literature review using PubMed and MEDLINE databases searching malignant bowel obstruction, etiology, types, pathophysiology, medical, antisecretory, anti-inflammatory, antiemetic drugs, analgesics, promotion of emptying, prevention of infection, anticholinergics, somatostatin analogs, gastric antisecretory drugs, prokinetic agents, glucocorticoid, opioid analgesics, antibiotics, enema, and adverse effects.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized or observational studies, cohorts, case reports, or reviews written in English between 1983 and November 2020 were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) commonly occurs in patients with advanced or recurrent malignancies and severely affects the quality of life and survival of patients. Its management remains complex and variable. Medical management is the cornerstone of MBO treatment, with the goal of reducing distressing symptoms and optimizing quality of life. Until now, there has been neither a standard clinical approach nor registered medications to treat patients with inoperable MBO.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

This review provides information on the etiology, type and pathophysiology, and medical treatment of MBO and related adverse reactions of the drugs commonly used, which can greatly assist clinicians in making clinical decisions when treating MBO.

Conclusions

Published research shows that medical management of MBO mainly consists of antisecretory, anti-inflammatory strategies, controlling vomiting and pain, promoting emptying, preventing infection, and combination therapy. Being knowledgeable about the most current treatment options, the related adverse effects, and the evidence supporting different practices is critical for clinicians to provide individualized medical therapy for MBO patients.

Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Participant selection and enrolment

Eligible participants will be identified from the clinical aneurysm surveillance database and will be approached by a member of the study team at their ultrasound appointment. Participants will be supplied with the study information sheet either in person or by post. Written informed consent will be obtained from patients willing to participate in the study. Participants are free to withdraw from the study at any point or the investigator can choose to withdraw a participant. If a participant has consented for the study and then wishes to withdraw, providing they have not been administered ferumoxytol, another participant will be recruited in their place.

Study drug

Ferumoxytol

Ferumoxytol (Rienso) is composed of USPIO coated with polyglucose sorbitol carboxymethylether. It is supplied as an aqueous colloidal product that is formulated with mannitol and presented in single use vials ready for intravenous infusion. Each vial contains 510 mg of elemental iron in a volume of 17 mL of mannitol.

The ferumoxytol dose (4 mg/kg) is removed from the vial and administered intravenously at a rate of up to 1 mL/s. The single dose is given immediately following the baseline MRI and 24–36 h before the postcontrast scan. Blood pressure is recorded before and 30 min after administration to monitor for hypotension. In a subset of patients (n = 20), MRI scanning and USPIO administration will be repeated at < 1 month and 1 year (up to a total of 3 doses of ferumoxytol in 1 year). Each dose of ferumoxytol equates to approximately 7% of total body iron.

The study drug is manufactured by AMAG Pharmaceuticals Inc (Lexington, Massachusetts, USA), and distributed and released by Takeda Italia Farmaceutica SPA in Europe.

Buscopan

Intravenous Buscopan (hyoscine butylbromide) 20 mg will be administered before each MRI to reduce artefact from bowel peristalsis in patients who do not have a contraindication (allergic reaction, narrow angle glaucoma, paralytic ileus, myasthaenia gravis, obstructive prostatic hypertrophy).

### MASCC multidisciplinary evidence-based recommendations for the management of malignant bowel obstruction in advanced cancer [^115Qr7zr]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide evidence-based recommendations on the management of malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) for patients with advanced cancer.

Methods

The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) MBO study group conducted a systematic review of databases (inception to March 2021) to identify studies about patients with advanced cancer and MBO that reported on the following outcomes: symptom management, bowel obstruction resolution, prognosis, overall survival, and quality of life. The review was restricted to studies published in English, but no restrictions were placed on publication year, country, and study type. As per the MASCC Guidelines Policy, the findings were synthesized to determine the levels of evidence to support each MBO intervention and, ultimately, the graded recommendations and suggestions.

Results

The systematic review identified 17,656 published studies and 397 selected for the guidelines. The MASCC study group developed a total of 25 evidence-based suggestions and recommendations about the management of MBO-related nausea and vomiting, bowel movements, pain, inflammation, bowel decompression, and nutrition. Expert consensus-based guidance about advanced care planning and psychosocial support is also provided.

Conclusion

This MASCC Guideline provides comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations about MBO management for patients with advanced cancer.

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) management — patient-centered decision-making and prognostic assessment emphasizes that clinicians should take into consideration the risks associated with the interventions in addition to the patient's estimated prognosis, performance status, comorbidities, location of care and ease of further assessment and support, and clinicians are encouraged to discuss these possible scenarios with patients and their families before commencing interventions, such as total parenteral nutrition; as patients approach the end of their lives, their goals of care may shift from disease management and life prolongation to symptom management and quality of life, physician prediction of survival is known to be inaccurate and often overly optimistic, and objective and laboratory factors associated with a short or poor prognosis include deterioration in performance status, weight loss, progressive disease in other organs, elevated C-reactive protein, reduced albumin, and leucocytosis; prognostic models incorporating physician prediction of survival and clinical and laboratory factors improve the accuracy of clinical prediction, and the treating clinician should offer sensitive discussions about treatment options, expected outcomes, possible adverse effects or burdens, and how to measure success, with assessments of illness understanding and decision-making wishes being essential and goals of care conversations requiring careful exploration with the patient's best interest being foremost.

Dopamine antagonist prokinetic

Suggestion: Dopamine antagonist prokinetic drugs (e.g. metoclopramide, domperidone) may be effective for the management of nausea, vomiting, and restoring bowel transit time in partial MBO. Due to the potential increased risk of bowel perforation, it likely should be avoided in complete MBO. (level of evidence: III; grade B)

Dopamine antagonist prokinetic drugs block dopamine receptors. They increase lower esophageal sphincter pressure, gastric motility, and, therefore, gastric emptying. The main prokinetic drugs used in MBO management are domperidone and metoclopramide. We identified two cross-sectional studies and three case reports/series published between 1985 and 2016, that reported on their use in MBO. Of these studies, three studies found metoclopramide was effective for nausea, vomiting, and restoring intestinal transit time, particularly in incomplete BO. However, two studies found that metoclopramide was ineffective for relieving these symptoms. Only one study reported on the use of domperidone and found it ineffective for control of vomiting.

Histamine (H 1) antagonist

Suggestion: Histamine H 1 antagonists (e.g. dimenhydrinate, cyclizine) may be an effective anti-emetic in complete MBO (level of evidence: IV; grade D).

Histamine H 1 antagonists are a drug class that is primarily used for the management of motion sickness from vestibular stimulation. The main histamine H 1 antagonist that is used is dimenhydrinate. This review identified only one cross-sectional study published in 1994 that reported histamine H 1 antagonist use for nausea management in complete BO.

Phenothiazines

Suggestion: Phenothiazines (e.g. chlorpromazine) may reduce nausea and vomiting in MBO (level of evidence: IV; grade: D).

Phenothiazines are first-generation antipsychotic agents that can be used for the prevention and control of nausea and vomiting. Examples of phenothiazines are chlorpromazine, prochlorperazine, and methotrimeprazine (also known as levomepromazine). The review identified one cross-sectional study that found chlorpromazine, methotrimeprazine, and prochlorperazine effectively reduce nausea and vomiting in patients with MBO.

### Can malignant bowel obstruction in advanced cancer patients be treated at home? [^117CPY5E]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Eleven advanced cancer patients affected by malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) were treated at home with a combination of octreotide, metoclopramide, morphine, and dexamethasone. In all patients, we observed a prompt control of gastrointestinal symptoms and recovery of bowel movements within 1–5 days. Based on our results, a combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action allows an effective and safe treatment for MBO at home. Further studies with larger number of patients are warranted to confirm these preliminary data.

Materials and methods

Data collected

This retrospective study used routinely collected data and was approved as a service evaluation by the relevant departments. We collected data from the Radiology Information Systems for all CTC examinations reported by seven gastrointestinal radiologists at two centres, spanning the period January 2013 to December 2015 (centre 1) and January 2012 to December 2015 (centre 2). We only included radiologists who had interpreted more than 200 CTC examinations during this period, to ensure percentages could be calculated with sufficiently narrow 95% confidence intervals to be meaningful. All radiologists had pre-existing CTC expertise; each was a gastrointestinal radiologist, had undergone specific training and had interpreted > 500 examinations. Both centres employed a similar CTC protocol during this period, employing normal-dose post-contrast supine and low-dose prone scans after combined purgation and faecal tagging, intravenous spasmolytics (hyoscine butylbromide), and automated carbon dioxide insufflation. For each radiologist, we extracted (a) the date and time of report verification for all examinations they had reported during this period and (b) the full text of any CTC examinations reported during that period. Subsequently, we inspected the CTC reports to determine if the radiologist had, or had not, reported a 6-mm+ polyp or colorectal cancer. We used each hospital's patient record system to ascertain whether or not patients with a positive CTC underwent confirmatory testing (i.e. endoscopy or surgery) and, if so, whether the CTC finding was a true positive or false positive. We regarded the presence of any endoscopically or surgically proven polyp or cancer as a true-positive CTC finding, regardless of location or final histology (i.e. a per-patient match). For each radiologist, we estimated their potential "referral rate" (defined as the proportion of CTC examinations in which they reported a 6-mm+ polyp or cancer, i.e. that might be expected to precipitate a referral for colonoscopy), their positive predictive value (PPV; defined as the percentage of cases in which a polyp or cancer was ultimately found if confirmatory testing was done) and their polyp detection rate (PDR; defined as the proportion of cases in which a polyp or cancer was ultimately confirmed, relative to the total number of cases interpreted). For all these proportions (expressed as percentages), 95% confidence intervals were estimated using the Wilson method.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^113aWw2S]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials have shown that antispasmodic drugs are more efficacious than placebo at improving abdominal pain in patients with IBS.–However, because of the lack of head-to-head trials and sparsity of recent data, limited evidence exists to support differentiation of antispasmodic therapies. There are also very few studies, which have specifically investigated antispasmodics as a treatment for FACP.

Clinical evidence for the benefit of antispasmodic therapy in treating FACP as the primary symptom comes mainly from studies of hyoscine butylbromide. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy, albeit limited, of hyoscine butylbromide (given in limited-duration courses or as on-demand treatment) in reducing the intensity and frequency of abdominal pain, with few side effects, in patients defined by the presence of FACP symptoms. In the first of these studies, involving 1637 patients with recurrent, crampy abdominal pain, hyoscine butylbromide was significantly more efficacious than placebo in improving pain intensity (measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale; adjusted mean change from baseline, −2.3 vs. −1.9 cm, respectively, P < 0.0001) and frequency [measured on a verbal rating scale (range: 0–3); adjusted mean change from baseline, −0.7 vs. −0.5, respectively, P < 0.0001] when given for a limited period of 3 weeks. In the second study of 175 patients with self-reported, recurrent, functional, cramping abdominal pain, on-demand hyoscine butylbromide significantly reduced the intensity of pain (measured on an 11-point numerical pain rating scale) experienced by patients during 2 distinct episodes compared with placebo (adjusted mean difference vs. placebo in change from baseline for episode 1, −0.7, P = 0.016). Positive effects on quality of life have also been reported for hyoscine butylbromide treatment among patients with FACP, with greater improvements observed compared with standard analgesia regarding patients' ability to carry out daily activities, work quality, and symptoms experienced during stressful situations.

### Anticholinergic agents and impaired cognitive function: is there a risk for patients with irritable bowel syndrome? [^112SvFZW]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

IBS is a lifelong disorder the severity of which varies significantly from person to person. However, a sizeable proportion of sufferers experience daily abdominal pain requiring regular medication and spasmolytic agents are usually the first choice. Consequently, patients are likely to be advised to buy, or be prescribed, anticholinergics and this could be for many years, making the bioavailability of the antispasmodic concerned an important consideration. Consequently, anticholinergic burden needs to be taken into consideration, especially in elderly populations where multiple medications are often prescribed. Taken on its own, hyoscine butylbromide is extremely unlikely to contribute to this problem and, if taken with other medications with anticholinergic activity, will not significantly add to that burden. Therefore, hyoscine butylbromide can be considered a safe option for the long-term treatment of abdominal pain resulting from gastrointestinal spasm or IBS. Hyoscine butylbromide came to the market in 1952 when long-term safety studies were not required for new medications, although in its subsequent 75 years of widespread use, no significant safety concerns have ever emerged. It remains the most commonly prescribed antimuscarinic for IBS in the UK and is available in over 80 countries worldwide, comparing favourably with other antispasmodics in terms of cost. When effective, adherence to the medication is good, as side effects are seldom an issue.

The standard dose of hyoscine butylbromide is 10–20 mg up to four times daily, but when the pain is particularly severe and only partially relieved by 20 mg, the dose can be safely increased, as it is likely that more than a local effect is needed and a degree of systemic absorption is required. Doses of 100 mg and 400 mg have been reported to be well tolerated, and our practice is to gradually escalate the dose to 40, 60, 80, or even 100 mg at once or up to four times daily, as systemic absorption will still be modest, and penetration of the blood–brain barrier will still be impaired. Other ways that hyoscine butylbromide can be used include 'as necessary use' for intermittent abdominal pain, pre-emptive consumption before situations where pain might be anticipated, in conjunction with loperamide where pain control is required as well as control of diarrhoea, and in conjunction with a non-anticholinergic antispasmodic where pain control is suboptimal with the single medication.

### A multi-centre randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the value of a single bolus intravenous alfentanil in CT colonography [^112N5C7H]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

CT colonography

We used a 24-hour preparation with low-fibre diet and three or four bottles 50 mL iodinated contrast, meglumine ioxithalamate (Telebrix, Guerbet, Aulnay sous Bois, France). For bowel relaxation 1 mL (20 mg) butylscopalamine bromide (Buscopan, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany) or, if contraindicated 1 mL (1 mg) glucagon (GlucaGen, Novo Nordisk A'S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) was used. An automated carbon dioxide insufflator (PROTOCO2L, Bracco, EZEM, Lake Success, USA) and a flexible 20 French rectal catheter were used with insufflation in three positions: right decubitus, supine and left decubitus position. We aimed for three litres insufflation (1.3, 0.8 and 0.9 litres per position, respectively). The insufflation pressure was gently increased during insufflation (maximum pressure of the insufflator is 25 mmHg) and set on 20 mmHg when the target volume of three litres was met or after five minutes of insufflation irrespective of the target volume. Subsequently scan acquisitions were performed in prone and supine position and intravenous contrast medium iopromide (Ultravist 300, Bayer B.V. Mijdrecht, the Netherlands) was given in case of clinical suspicion for colorectal cancer. Prone position was the first acquisition position when intravenous contrast was used and the second scan position when only unenhanced acquisitions were performed.

Evaluation during procedure

Pain scores were assessed with an 11-point numeric rating scale at the end of prone scan acquisition position and for all three insufflation positions (0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain imaginable).

During the procedure, patients' vital parameters were monitored (PM50, Contec Medical Systems CO, LTD, Qinhuangdao, China). We registered values at standard time points: before spasmolytic injection, 1½ minutes after spasmolytic injection and at 5 and 10 minutes after starting the alfentanil injection. The value 1½ minute after spasmolytic injection was the reference value for comparisons with values after study medication injection, because the spasmolytic can influence the vital parameters. Heart rate and oxygen saturation were measured continuously with the same device and stored measurements were analysed afterwards. Furthermore all side effects and the time in the scanner room were recorded.

### What is the evidence for dietary modification in the management and prevention of malignant bowel obstruction? A scoping review [^111FakFj]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a common complication in advanced malignancy, particularly in gynaecological and gastrointestinal tumours that spread within the abdominal cavity. MBO affects up to 51% of patients with recurrent gynaecological cancers, and malignant obstructions of the small bowel are more prevalent than large bowel obstructions.

MBO typically presents as colicky abdominal pain, distention, nausea and bilious vomiting, and an inability to pass wind or stool. This occurs due to either a functional or mechanical obstruction, the aetiology and pathophysiology of which are well described elsewhere. MBO is often recurrent with symptoms increasing in severity and frequency over time, until, without surgical intervention, obstruction becomes a permanent state. This results in frequent, protracted hospital admissions, with significant burden both for patients and healthcare services. In addition to diminishing well-being and quality of life (QoL), patients with MBO have reported lack of attention to nutritional problems, fear of starvation and unmet supportive care needs.

### Managing nonmalignant chronic abdominal pain and malignant bowel obstruction [^111BBFgH]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Evaluation of abdominal pain requires an understanding of the possible causes(benign or malignant) and recognition of typical patterns and clinical presentation. Abdominal pain has multiple causes; associated signs and symptoms may aid in the diagnosis. Remember that some patients will not have a textbook presentation, and unusual causes for pain must be considered. Those with chronic pancreatitis with structural complications should be operated on early, whereas those with other types of chronic pancreatitis should receive medical therapy focusing on alleviating symptoms. Control of the most troublesome symptoms will provide the best management for IBS. Pharmacologic success in bowel obstruction depends on the level and degree of obstruction. Decision making is based on reasonable expectations of survival, treatment-related success, performance status, and goals of care. Quality of life will be enhanced by appropriate symptom management.

### The first joint ESGAR / ESPR consensus statement on the technical performance of cross-sectional small bowel and colonic imaging [^1165gyVT]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

CTE/CT enteroclysis technical considerations

There is little evidence for the optimal CT platform for performing CTE and CT enteroclysis, but based on expert opinion it is recommended that 16-slice CT is a minimum and 64+ slices is optimal. The use of spasmolytic is optional given the speed of CT image acquisition compared with MRI, and the lack of data demonstrating a benefit of spasmolytic. As for MRI, hyoscine butylbromide is the recommended first line agent if a spasmolytic is used. There was no consensus as to the need for a second-line agent if hyoscine butylbromide cannot be administered, but glucagon may used.

CT scan acquisition in either the enteric phase or portal venous phase is recommended in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease, with no clear evidence supporting one over the other. For patients with suspected GI bleeding, addition of an arterial phase acquisition is considered mandatory to improve detection of vascular lesions.

Recurrent exposure of young patients to ionising radiation from CT is a significant concern. Numerous studies have documented high radiation exposure in the IBD patient population, principally from CT. There are clear recommendations to minimise patient dose by optimisation of tube voltage and tube current, together with routine use of iterative reconstruction techniques which are increasingly available and capable of producing high image quality. For example, a tube voltage in the range of 80–100 kV can reduce radiation dose and increase contrast resolution. The use of automated tube current modulation is also recommended with good data showing dose reduction with maintained image quality. It is recommended that cumulative radiation dose should be recorded for patients with chronic conditions requiring multiple radiological examinations. CT is not recommended in paediatric practice unless there are no alternatives.

### Anticholinergic agents and impaired cognitive function: is there a risk for patients with irritable bowel syndrome? [^117SGdSE]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the secondary care setting, hyoscine butylbromide can also be administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection. Most commonly, it is used intravenously to aid endoscopy when gastrointestinal contractions are causing problems, or in the emergency room or hospital when patients are suffering from severe abdominal pain. It can also be used effectively to prevent hospital admission in patients with recurrent severe abdominal pain who can learn to administer the medication intramuscularly themselves. Although the parenteral administration of hyoscine butylbromide bypasses the phenomenon of poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, there remains the safety net of poor penetration of the blood–brain barrier, especially as it is only used intermittently in this setting.

In conclusion, hyoscine butylbromide is an antimuscarinic medication that is a safe and effective spasmolytic agent. In contrast to many other drugs in the same class, it is poorly absorbed and fails to significantly penetrate the blood–brain barrier. Consequently, it is extremely unlikely to cause cognitive impairment, even if used on a long-term basis, and can be administered with other medications that have anticholinergic effects without adding to the anticholinergic burden. It could be argued that hyoscine butylbromide should not be included in any anticholinergic burden scoring system, but if it is, it should be given a very low score.

A total of 217 cases were randomly assigned to the BUSCOPAN or placebo group; investigators were masked with respect to treatment. In a target animal safety study, BUSCOPAN was evaluated in two phases.

In the first phase, the drug was administered intravenously at dosages of 1, 3, and 5 times the recommended level once daily for three consecutive days. In the second phase it was given at the recommended therapeutic dosage at hourly intervals for three consecutive hours. Horses receiving BUSCOPAN tended to have transient, reduced intensity of auscultated borborygmi, which can be attributed to the intended therapeutic effect of the drug. There was no evidence of gut stasis or colic. There were no drug associated findings with respect to blood analyses, nor were there any effects evident at necropsy and histopathology. In a tolerance study, four horses were administered 10 times the recommended BUSCOPAN dosage and were examined at 10 minutes and then at 1, 2, 3, 4, 24, and 72 hours post injection. All horses temporarily experienced dilated and fixed pupils at 10 minutes post injection.
