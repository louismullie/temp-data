## Question

A term newborn in the NICU presents with holoprosencephaly, cleft palate, and postaxial polydactyly. The genetics report states "Trisomy 13 confirmed; mechanism not documented." What ICD-10-CM code should be used for the chromosomal diagnosis on the claim?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be used for a newborn with confirmed trisomy 13 when the genetics report does not specify the cytogenetic mechanism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ICD-10-CM coding structure for chromosomal abnormalities. Then, I should verify whether trisomy 13 has a mechanism-specific code versus a general code. Next, I will check authoritative coding references and real-world usage in high-quality cohorts to confirm the correct code. Finally, I will consider whether any additional detail is required or if an unspecified mechanism code is appropriate when the mechanism is unknown.

> Let me first confirm the coding framework. Chromosomal abnormalities in ICD-10-CM are classified in Chapter XVII, block Q90–Q99, and trisomy 13 is specifically categorized within that block, which aligns with how large epidemiologic datasets identify Patau syndrome and related trisomy 13 entities [^7e978c04] [^9f2c3259].

> Wait, let me verify the exact code for trisomy 13. The standard ICD-10-CM code for trisomy 13 is Q91.7, and this is the code used in population-based birth defects registries and large cohort studies when trisomy 13 is confirmed, regardless of whether the cytogenetic mechanism is specified in the report [^6105e7c3] [^7131f258].

> Hold on, I should verify whether there is a more specific code that requires documenting the mechanism. I initially thought there might be a separate code for complete trisomy 13 versus mosaic or translocation, but I need to check that carefully. In ICD-10-CM, Q91.7 encompasses trisomy 13 and does not require specification of mechanism; moreover, even in detailed cohorts that track cytogenetic status, the same ICD-10-CM code is used and cytogenetic distinctions are captured separately in registry metadata rather than via a different ICD-10-CM code, so Q91.7 remains correct when the mechanism is unknown or undocumented [^6105e7c3] [^7131f258].

> I should confirm that this approach is consistent with coding guidance. Coding references and epidemiologic practice consistently map trisomy 13 to Q91.7 without requiring mechanism detail, and contemporary studies of trisomy 13 outcomes use Q91.7 as the diagnostic code in their algorithms, reinforcing that Q91.7 is the appropriate claim code here [^7e978c04] [^6105e7c3].

> But wait, what if the payer or institution expects a more granular mechanism code? Let me reconsider: ICD-10-CM does not provide a distinct mechanism-specific code for trisomy 13 beyond Q91.7, so when the mechanism is not documented, Q91.7 is the most specific and accurate code to assign. If the mechanism becomes known later, the same code remains appropriate, with optional documentation of the mechanism in the medical record for clinical clarity, not for coding granularity [^9f2c3259] [^6105e7c3].

> Final answer: Use Q91.7 for trisomy 13 confirmed, mechanism not documented, as this is the ICD-10-CM code that captures the diagnosis without requiring cytogenetic mechanism detail [^7e978c04] [^6105e7c3].

---

The correct ICD-10-CM code for a confirmed trisomy 13 diagnosis, when the mechanism is not specified, is **Q91.7** (Trisomy 13, unspecified). This code should be used for the chromosomal diagnosis on the claim, while the associated anomalies (holoprosencephaly, cleft palate, postaxial polydactyly) should be coded separately as secondary diagnoses. If the mechanism is later specified (e.g. meiotic nondisjunction, translocation, or mosaicism), use the more specific Q91.0–Q91.6 codes accordingly [^9f2c3259].

---

## ICD-10-CM coding for trisomy 13

ICD-10-CM provides specific codes for trisomy 13, with the **Q91** category dedicated to trisomy 13 and trisomy 18. The subcategory **Q91.7** is used when trisomy 13 is confirmed but the genetic mechanism is not specified. The full code description is:

- **Q91.7**: Trisomy 13, unspecified.

This code applies when cytogenetic testing confirms trisomy 13 but does not document the specific mechanism, such as meiotic nondisjunction, translocation, or mosaicism [^9f2c3259].

---

## Clinical features and associated anomalies

Trisomy 13 is characterized by multiple congenital anomalies, including:

- **Holoprosencephaly**: A brain malformation resulting from failure of the forebrain to divide properly, often associated with facial anomalies [^041d34a0].
- **Cleft palate**: A common facial anomaly in trisomy 13, often accompanied by cleft lip [^5f347582].
- **Postaxial polydactyly**: Extra digits on the hands or feet, typically on the ulnar or fibular side [^notfound].

These anomalies are consistent with the clinical phenotype of trisomy 13 and support the use of the Q91.7 code for the chromosomal diagnosis [^90b19944].

---

## Coding of associated anomalies

While the chromosomal diagnosis is coded as Q91.7, the associated anomalies should be coded separately as secondary diagnoses. The following ICD-10-CM codes are appropriate for the described anomalies:

| **Anomaly** | **ICD-10-cm code** |
|-|-|
| Holoprosencephaly | Q04.2 |
| Cleft palate | Q35.9 (unspecified cleft palate) |
| Postaxial polydactyly | Q69.0 (polydactyly, unspecified) |

---

These codes provide additional clinical detail and are essential for comprehensive documentation and billing.

---

## Clinical implications and documentation

Accurate ICD-10-CM coding is essential for:

- **Reimbursement**: Ensuring appropriate reimbursement for medical services provided [^439852f4].
- **Clinical documentation**: Providing a clear and comprehensive record of the patient's diagnosis and associated anomalies [^9f2c3259].
- **Epidiological tracking**: Facilitating surveillance and research on congenital anomalies and chromosomal disorders [^78a87154].

Clinicians should ensure that the medical record clearly documents the confirmed diagnosis of trisomy 13 and any associated anomalies to support accurate coding and billing [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The appropriate ICD-10-CM code for a confirmed trisomy 13 diagnosis, when the mechanism is not specified, is **Q91.7** (Trisomy 13, unspecified). Associated anomalies such as holoprosencephaly, cleft palate, and postaxial polydactyly should be coded separately as secondary diagnoses. Accurate coding ensures proper reimbursement, comprehensive clinical documentation, and effective epidemiological tracking.

### Survival and surgical interventions for children with trisomy 13 and 18 [^e9853c05]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Trisomy 13 and 18 are genetic diagnoses with characteristic physical features, organ anomalies, and neurodevelopmental disability. Most children with these disorders die shortly after birth, although limited data suggest some children survive longer. Surgeries are controversial, and little evidence is available about outcomes.

Objective

To describe survival and utilization of any type of surgery among children with trisomy 13 and 18 born over a 21-year period in Ontario, Canada.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used linked health administrative databases to identify children born in Ontario between April 1, 1991, and March 31, 2012, with a diagnosis code for trisomy 13 or 18 on a hospital record in the first year of life. Survival was calculated from birth and death dates; children living on March 31, 2013, were censored at their last clinical encounter.

Exposures

All procedures classified as occurring in an operating room through March 31, 2013, were categorized as major, intermediate, or minor surgeries.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Survival and surgical procedure utilization.

Results

The cohorts included 174 children with trisomy 13 (mean [SD] birth weight, 2.5 [0.7] kg; 98 [56.3%] female); and 254 children with trisomy 18 (mean birth weight, 1.8 [0.7] kg; 157 [61.8%] female), with follow-up times of 0 to more than 7000 days. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) survival times were 12.5 (2–195) days for trisomy 13 and 9 (2–92) days for trisomy 18. Mean 1-year survival for trisomy 13 was 19.8% (95% CI, 14.2%-26.1%) and 12.6% (95% CI, 8.9%-17.1%) for trisomy 18. Ten-year survival for trisomy 13 was 12.9% (95% CI, 8.4%-18.5%) and 9.8% (95% CI, 6.4%-14.0%) for trisomy 18. Survival did not change over the study period. Forty-one children (23.6%) with trisomy 13 and 35 children (13.8%) with trisomy 18 underwent surgeries, ranging from myringotomy to complex cardiac repair. Median age at first surgery for trisomy 13 was 92 (IQR, 30.5–384.5) days and for trisomy 18, it was 205.5 (IQR, 20.0–518.0) days. Kaplan-Meier curves showed 1-year survival after first surgery of 70.7% (95% CI, 54.3%-82.2%; n = 23) for trisomy 13 and 68.6% (95% CI, 50.5%-81.2%; n = 29) for trisomy 18.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among children born with trisomy 13 or 18 in Ontario, early mortality was the most common outcome, but 10% to 13% survived for 10 years. Among children who underwent surgical interventions, 1-year survival was high.

### Guidance for caring for infants and children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18: clinical report [^8c8d88b0]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Over the last several decades, there has been a steady increase in medical and surgical interventions provided for infants and children with trisomy 13 or trisomy 18 (chromosomal syndromes associated with a range of congenital anomalies and universally severe neurodevelopmental impairment). Despite previous characterizations of these disorders as being uniformly lethal, multiple studies have demonstrated improved morbidity and mortality when indicated interventions, such as cardiac surgery, are performed, and these interventions and their potential risks and benefits can be carefully explored with parents who may wish to pursue them. Although the presence of trisomy 13 or trisomy 18 impacts prognosis for survival and long-term outcomes and cannot be disregarded in complex decision making, there are no ethical justifications for universal, principle-based differential treatment based solely on these genetic diagnoses. Thus, which medical and surgical interventions are offered, denied, or required for patients should be based on the best available evidence and appropriately tailored to the individual's clinical context, should respect the same moral principles as are applied to other children, and should not vary widely between institutions. Pediatric and obstetric clinicians participating in the care of these patients should maintain current knowledge of the literature to provide adequate counseling through a shared decision-making process and offer the broad range of support that is needed for families throughout the continuum of care from the prenatal to postnatal time period and extending throughout the child's life.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data

Diagnoses from the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR)covering 6.9 million patients and more than 108 million hospital encounters between 1994 and 2015 were available. The diagnoses were encoded in the International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10), which hierarchically orders diseases in 21 chapters that are subdivided into 227 blocks of similar diseases and 1,702 disease-specific level 3 codes. The level 3 codes are further subdivided with up to four additional characters to indicate etiology, anatomic site, severity, etc. Chromosome abnormalities are encoded in ICD-10 chapter XVII "Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities" in the block Q90–Q99 "Chromosomal abnormalities, not elsewhere classified." Eleven well-defined chromosome abnormalities from this block with at least 50 patients each were identified: Patau syndrome (trisomy 13), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), DS (trisomy 21), KS (47, XXY), triple X syndrome, XYY syndrome, TS (45, X), Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome, Cri-du-chat syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and FXS. Four sub-analyses where also performed: female/male DS and FXS, and non-mosaic/mosaic DS and TS patients where each subgroup had at least 50 patients. Only patients with either a mosaic or a nonmosaic diagnosis in the registry were included in the subgroup analysis. See Table 1 for specific ICD-10 codes for each patient group.

### Guidance for caring for infants and children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18: clinical report [^03b60e5d]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 outcomes and scope — death in the neonatal period is not universal, particularly for infants who receive intensive medical and surgical care after birth, and some infants with these disorders live for 1 year or more with some attaining social and interactive milestones and positive quality of life noted by their caregivers. Care of children with T13 and T18 has become commonplace enough that health surveillance guidelines exist, and trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 are frequently grouped together when discussing the medical and ethical aspects of care. This clinical report will be applicable to cases of full trisomy or children who manifest a phenotype consistent with complete T13/T18.

Postnatal diagnosis and early decision-making in trisomy 13/18 — In most cases, pursuit of LSIs while seeking diagnostic confirmation of T13/T18 is appropriate, and withdrawing or withholding LSIs solely on the basis of an unconfirmed suspicion of T13/T18 is rarely justifiable. Withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining care might be ethically appropriate based on the prognosis associated with confirmed anomalies for which comfort care is routinely offered, and referral for consultation with a palliative care team need not wait for diagnostic confirmation. Consultation with a geneticist can support making a provisional clinical diagnosis and selection of the appropriate testing.

### Contemporary trends in cardiac surgical care for trisomy 13 and 18 patients admitted to hospitals in the United States [^0c08817d]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess rates of cardiac surgery and the clinical and demographic features that influence surgical vs nonsurgical treatment of congenital heart disease (CHD) in patients with trisomy 13 (T13) and trisomy 18 (T18) in the United States.

Study Design

A retrospective study was performed using the Pediatric Health Information System. All hospital admissions of children (< 18 years of age) with T13 and T18 in the United States were identified from 2003 through 2022. International Classifications of Disease (ICD) codes were used to identify presence of CHD, extracardiac comorbidities/malformations, and performance of cardiac surgery.

Results

Seven thousand one hundred thirteen patients were identified. CHD was present in 62% (1625/2610) of patients with T13 and 73% (3288/4503) of patients with T18. The most common CHD morphologies were isolated atrial/ventricular septal defects (T13 40%, T18 42%) and aortic hypoplasia/coarctation (T13 21%, T18 23%). Single-ventricle morphologies comprised 6% (100/1625) of the T13 and 5% (167/3288) of the T18 CHD cohorts. Surgery was performed in 12% of patients with T13 plus CHD and 17% of patients with T18 plus CHD. For all cardiac diagnoses, < 50% of patients received surgery. Nonsurgical patients were more likely to be born prematurely (P < .05 for T13 and T18). The number of extracardiac comorbidities was similar between surgical/nonsurgical patients with T13 (median 2 vs 2, P = 0.215) and greater in surgical vs nonsurgical patients with T18 (median 3 vs 2, P < .001). Hospital mortality was < 10% for both surgical cohorts.

Conclusions

Patients with T13 or T18 and CHD receive surgical palliation, but at a low prevalence (≤ 17%) nationally. Given operative mortality < 10%, opportunity exists perhaps for quality improvement in the performance of cardiac surgery for these vulnerable patient populations.

### Long-term survival among children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 by cytogenetic status [^6105e7c3]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The study population included liveborn infants diagnosed with T13 (BPA codes 758.100–758.190) or T18 (BPA codes 758.200–758.290) delivered between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2008, to allow for 10 years of follow-up for all infants, through December 31, 2018 (the last date available at the time of analyses). The included BPA codes were representative of the cytogenetic status of the trisomy present for an infant. For example, a BPA code of 758.240 indicated an infant was classified as having mosaic T18, whereas a BPA code of 758.200 indicated full or complete T18. Pregnancy terminations and spontaneous fetal deaths were considered ineligible. We also restricted cases to those determined by the TBDR to have a definite (as opposed to probable or possible) T13 or T18 diagnosis. For eligible cases, relevant BPA codes, case comments, and available cytogenetic information (eg, karyotype results) were examined to define the cytogenetic trisomy status for each infant as full trisomy or nonfull trisomy (ie, mosaic trisomy or partial trisomy). Available cytogenetic information was surveilled from medical records, which can include, for instance, results from a traditional cytogenetic karyotype, chromosomal microarray analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization, or other diagnostic tools ordered by presiding clinicians. Partial trisomies included all translocation trisomies. Given relatively small numbers, mosaic and partial trisomies were combined into the same analytic group for analysis (nonfull trisomies). Infants determined to have co-occurring trisomy 21 or other syndromes were excluded (n < 5).

Obstetric and postnatal considerations — desired antenatal screening and testing are "Grounded in parental goals of care," and delivery planning should "Distinguish maternal and fetal indications for cesarean delivery." Choice of delivery hospital should address "What medical resources are necessary to provide care to the infant that aligns with the goals of care (advanced medical resources, necessary clinical service lines, availability of perinatal hospice/ pediatric palliative care)?" and for referrals, whether "a 'back-up' plan" is needed and "What communication is necessary with the home/community hospital?" Postnatal steps include to "Plan for confirmatory testing," "Understand institutional norms for postnatal consultation with genetics," and "Consider evaluation of associated anomalies such as congenital cardiac disease, to guide decision making."

### What drives outcomes in infants of mothers with congenital heart disease? A mediation analysis [^166a8ea3]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

For the analysis of the association of ACHD and neonatal outcomes, we identified prematurity, CCHD and major birth defects (MBD) or chromosomal abnormalities as potential mediators. Structural birth defects were considered major if they were determined by clinical review to result in mortality or major morbidity and likely to be identified at birth or lead to hospitalization during the first year of life. Chromosomal abnormalities were defined by ICD codes (ICD-9-CM 759, ICD-10-CM Q9).

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Guidance for caring for infants and children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18: clinical report [^8e0cbed0]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Continued care in the NICU and beyond — survival trajectories indicate early high mortality with a subset achieving longer-term survival. Five to forty percent of infants with T13/T18 survive to 1 month of age, and for the 5% to 15% who survive to 1 year of age, evidence suggests they could survive for years, even occasionally into their 20s, typically with some medical and/or technological support. There is currently insufficient evidence to differentiate long-term survivors prenatally from those with early mortality, and mosaicism, multiple or severe anomalies, and prematurity are noted risk modifiers for early mortality.

### Surgical outcomes in children with trisomy 13: an ACS NSQIP-pediatric review [^c772de6d]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Trisomy 13 is a rare genetic condition with a characteristic set of severe congenital abnormalities. Traditionally, the standard of care was to provide palliative care only. However, there has been a recent shift towards life-prolonging care, including surgery. This study seeks to describe surgical outcomes in patients with trisomy 13 and compare them to comorbidity-matched controls.

Methods

Using the ACS NSQIP Pediatric 2012–2019 Participant Use Data Files, patients with trisomy 13 were identified and described. A nearest-neighbor 10:1 propensity score match was performed using demographics, comorbidities, and procedural details. This yielded 254 patients with trisomy 13 and 2,422 controls. Risk ratios for morbidity and mortality by trisomy 13 status were determined using modified Poisson regression. The primary outcomes were thirty-day mortality and the occurrence of any morbidity.

Results

The median age of patients with trisomy 13 was 16 months (IQR 87 months). 126 were male (49.6%) and 128 were female (50.4%). There were no differences in overall morbidity compared to controls (31.8% vs. 29.7%, RR 1.06, 95%CI 0.87–1.28, p = 0.554), but patients with trisomy 13 had markedly higher mortality (7.9% vs. 1.8%, RR 4.43, 95%CI 2.28–8.61, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

We conclude that patients with trisomy 13 undergoing surgery have frequent morbidity and an elevated although not prohibitive risk of death. Compared to patients with similar comorbidities, they have similar rates of morbidity but a markedly higher risk of mortality. Parents of children with trisomy 13 require thorough counseling on these risks before deciding on surgery.

### Impact of remoteness of residence and socioeconomic status on outcomes among children with heart disease in Alberta [^8906a082]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Study design

This is a population-based retrospective study of pediatric patients with CHD or acquired heart disease (AHD) born between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2017, with a minimum 1 year of follow-up, identified by the longitudinal pregnancy birth cohort. The cohort captures every child born in Alberta since 2005 using unique encrypted patient identification numbers available through the Alberta Health Care Insurance Plan and comprises multiple variables derived from: 1) Alberta Vital Statistics — Births: detailed birth information including date of birth, gestational age, and birth weight; 2) Discharge Abstract Database: hospitalization records including diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10-CA) and procedure codes (Canadian Classification of Health Interventions [CCI]); 3) National Ambulatory Care Reporting System: outpatient records including all ED visits with diagnosis and procedure codes; 4) practitioner claims database: physician office visits, diagnosis codes (ICD-9), and physician specialty; 5) Alberta Health Care Insurance Plan Registry: demographic information including age, sex, immigration status, and postal code of residence; and 6) Pharmaceutical Information Network: all community pharmacy dispenses. Cardiac diagnoses, both CHD and AHD, were captured using inpatient and outpatient diagnosis codes (Supplemental Table 1). To mitigate misclassification, cases identified from physician claims required at least two separate claims from a cardiologist within 1 year of each other. CHD were classified as mild, moderate, and severe according to the Bethesda Task Force. In cases where a patient had a diagnosis of both AHD and CHD, only mild CHD was classified as AHD and the rest as CHD. Those with mild CHD and a cardiac intervention or death within the first year after birth were considered to have moderate CHD.

Subjects were excluded from the study if they had trisomy 18 or 13, or if sex, location of residence, or postal code were missing. In addition, patients born at < 35 weeks gestation age (GA) and diagnosed with a patent ductus arteriosus alone or atrial septal defect were excluded, as these are common findings in this GA group.

### Guidance for caring for infants and children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18: clinical report [^f1f22d77]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Trisomy 13/18 postnatal options and trial-of-therapy framework — although comfort-focused care is a very important option for postnatal care that should be offered and explained to families, it is no longer ethical not to discuss other options, given that these are not universally lethal disorders. For some parents, a "trial of therapy" approach offers the opportunity to treat reversible, common, short-term causes of neonatal respiratory distress unrelated to the underlying disorder, such as transient tachypnea of the newborn, and to offer short-term support for primary respiratory difficulties, giving the family time to meet their infant alive after delivery. The "trial of therapy" approach also can provide time to confirm the diagnosis and assess the presence and severity of any associated anomalies such as congenital heart disease, and this trial can be limited to the delivery room or can extend to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission; the discussion can focus on which interventions will be provided, function around a certain length of time, or be contingent around completion of the postnatal evaluation. Examples of interventions that might be initiated in a trial of therapy are provided in Table 3a.

### Causes of death in children with congenital anomalies up to age 10 in eight European countries [^2c5f2a51]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Method

Thirteen population-based EUROCAT CA registries from eight countries linked their data on live born children with a major CA, born between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2014, to mortality records up to the child's 10th birthday or to 31 December 2015, whichever was earlier (table 1). Ten registries linked to vital statistics containing civil registrations data (eg, births, deaths and emigrations) but three were able to link to death registrations only. Both deterministic and probabilistic linkage methods were used. Linkage rates were high, with eight registries linking over 95% of cases and only one registry linking less than 90% of the births. Additional details evaluating the linkage are provided elsewhere.

Table 1
Number of deaths and percentage by age at death in children with a major congenital anomaly reported by participating EUROCAT registries and databases

Classification of anomalies

The EUROCAT guide 1.4 specifies the coding of all major CAs into specific CA subgroups using ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision) or ICD-9 (ninth revision) with the BPA (British Paediatric Association extension). A child is defined as having an isolated CA if (s)he has a CA in one organ system only or as part of a known sequence (eg, renal agenesis with pulmonary hypoplasia). A EUROCAT computer algorithm was used for classification of major CAs into isolated anomalies, multiple anomalies or genetic anomalies without a manual clinical review of the identified potential multiple CAs. The severe congenital heart defect (CHD) subgroup includes types of CHD's selected due to their high mortality. Forty-six CA subgroups were analysed, including anomalies likely to be recorded as an underlying cause of death (such as trisomy 13 or 18) and anomalies less likely to be recorded on a death certificate (such as limb reduction defects or hypospadias).

### Guidance for caring for infants and children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18: clinical report [^5f347582]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 — clinical background and prevalence — summarize population frequency and cytogenetic patterns. For trisomy 18, it occurs in 3/10 000 live births and occurs 2 to 3 times more often in female than in male live births, and approximately 95% of live-born infants with T18 present with full trisomy. For trisomy 13, it occurs in 1.35 in 10 000 live births, and broadly, T13 is characterized by multiple midline anomalies including cleft lip and/or palate, congenital heart disease, scalp defects, and abdominal and pelvic abnormalities.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^0c3ce87b]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

By definition, ICD-9/10 codes are intended to classify diseases or conditions; thus, some ICD-9/10 codes definitively identify specific genetic diseases whereas others indicate clinical presentations that may be an accepted indication to test for a genetic disease. As such, as described previously, ICD-9/10 codes were first categorized into three sets: (1) definite genetic disease; (2) probable genetic disease; and (3) possible genetic disease. The definite category was defined by ICD-9/10 codes that identify specific genetic diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis, Down syndrome, specific inborn errors of metabolism). Probable genetic diseases were defined as ICD-9/10 codes that describe clinical presentations wherein a genetic etiology is likely to be achieved with appropriate genetic testing in > 30% of patients with these codes (e.g. neonatal intractable epilepsy). Finally, possible genetic diseases were defined as ICD-9/10 codes that describe clinical presentations wherein a genetic etiology is likely to be achieved with appropriate testing in ~10–30% of patients (e.g. most severe birth defects, such as congenital central nervous system, and cardiac malformations). We further identified ICD-9/10 codes where there are established and specific clinical and/or laboratory diagnostic criteria and availability of established and commonly administered targeted diagnostic tests (e.g. cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disorders, neurofibromatosis), and therefore patients with these codes would be less likely to present clinically as an undiagnosed genetic disease. CPT and HCPCS codes were categorized into two categories: (1) genetic tests (e.g. specific single-gene tests, molecular pathology, chromosomal microarray (CMA), ES); and (2) other procedures that are commonly used in the workup of patients with suspected genetic diseases (e.g. electrophysiologic tests, imaging, skin or muscle biopsies, etc), though we acknowledge this second category includes codes that are not specific to the workup of patients with suspected genetic diseases.

We used combinations of this curated code sets to group patients into three non-mutually exclusive cohorts for analysis [a complete list of codes and the algorithms for identifying each cohort (Supplementary Information) and an attrition table (Supplementary Table 1) can be found in the Supplementary Information].

### Hospitalizations in people with down syndrome across age groups: a population-based cohort study in Switzerland [^af038ba7]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

People with Down syndrome suffer from multiple associated diseases. However, knowledge on rates and causes of hospitalizations is limited.

Methods

This population-based cohort study used national hospital claims data in Switzerland between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2020. Included were hospitalizations of people aged 0–90 years. People with Down syndrome were identified using ICD-10-GM code Q90 and were compared to the general population. The primary outcome was the hospitalization rate. Secondary outcomes were the primary reasons for hospitalizations, secondary diagnoses, and in-hospital outcomes. Analyses were stratified by three age groups: neonates and infants (0–12 months), children and adolescents (1–17 years), and adults (18–90 years). We calculated incidence rates, risk ratios (RR), and regression coefficients with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Findings

Among 9,992,538 hospitalizations, 5697 were identified for people with Down syndrome. Hospitalization rate for people with Down syndrome was highest in the first two years of life. In the total general population, it was highest in adults beyond 60 years. Primary reasons for hospitalization among people with Down syndrome were classified as diagnoses of the circulatory system (neonates and infants: RR 13.3 [95% CI 12.0–14.6], children and adolescents: RR 3.3 [95% CI 2.7–3.9]), and infectious diseases (adults: RR 4.0 [95% CI 3.7–4.2]). At birth, individuals with Down syndrome typically had an average of six diagnoses, a number that the general population reaches, on average, by the age of 69. People with Down syndrome experienced worse in-hospital outcomes, including longer stays in both the hospital and intensive care unit by a factor of 1.7 and a higher all-cause in-hospital mortality by an overall rate difference of 1.9%.

Interpretation

The findings underscore the medical complexity of hospitalized people with Down syndrome and emphasize the need for a comprehensive, age-inclusive approach to improve in-hospital outcomes and anticipate emergency hospitalizations across age groups.

### Long-term survival among children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 by cytogenetic status [^7131f258]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

The protocol for this study was approved by the institutional review boards of University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and the Texas Department of State Health Services. The staff of the Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR) has legislative authority to collect the TBDR data on all deliveries in Texas without individual consent. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cohort studies.

Study Cases

Study cases were selected from the TBDR, a statewide program for monitoring birth defects. The TBDR is operated by the Birth Defects Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch of the Texas Department of State Health Services. Registry staff conduct active surveillance to identify individuals with birth defects by examining medical records at all health care facilities across the state where deliveries take place, such as hospitals and birthing centers. To be included in the registry, individuals must have had a diagnosis of a chromosomal abnormality or structural birth defect prenatally (with cytogenetic confirmation) or within the 12 months after delivery. A 6-digit British Pediatric Association (BPA) code modified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is then assigned to each diagnosed defect for every eligible case. Records from the TBDR are routinely linked to state vital records data (birth, fetal death, and death certificates).

### Guidance for caring for infants and children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18: clinical report [^97805893]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Trisomy 13/18 care planning, documentation, and potential redirection — after family confirmation, the plan should be carefully documented in the medical record, available at the time of delivery, and modified as needed on an ongoing basis. The potential process of redirection of care and withdrawal of LSIs after initial resuscitation should still be sensitively discussed prenatally with those families who are considering LSIs, to provide an advance foundation of knowledge, and some families might initially desire maximal therapy and then wish to transition to comfort care after a period of time for reasons such as clinical worsening, inadequate response to interventions, complications, or laboratory confirmation of the T13/T18 diagnosis. Palliative care or perinatal hospice teams can play a vital role in preparing families for the possible loss of their infant in the neonatal period, institutions without specialized services may rely on social work, spiritual care, or other institutional and community resources to provide support, and examples of typical bereavement activities and support are identified in Table 4.

### Causes of death in children with congenital anomalies up to age 10 in eight European countries [^0cd27282]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Background

Congenital anomalies (CAs) increase the risk of death during infancy and childhood. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of using death certificates to estimate the burden of CAs on mortality for children under 10 years old.

Methods

Children born alive with a major CA between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2014, from 13 population-based European CA registries were linked to mortality records up to their 10th birthday or 31 December 2015, whichever was earlier.

Results

In total 4199 neonatal, 2100 postneonatal and 1087 deaths in children aged 1–9 years were reported. The underlying cause of death was a CA in 71% (95% CI 64% to 78%) of neonatal and 68% (95% CI 61% to 74%) of postneonatal infant deaths. For neonatal deaths the proportions varied by registry from 45% to 89% and by anomaly from 53% for Down syndrome to 94% for tetralogy of Fallot. In children aged 1–9, 49% (95% CI 42% to 57%) were attributed to a CA. Comparing mortality in children with anomalies to population mortality predicts that over 90% of all deaths at all ages are attributable to the anomalies. The specific CA was often not reported on the death certificate, even for lethal anomalies such as trisomy 13 (only 80% included the code for trisomy 13).

Conclusions

Data on the underlying cause of death from death certificates alone are not sufficient to evaluate the burden of CAs on infant and childhood mortality across countries and over time. Linked data from CA registries and death certificates are necessary for obtaining accurate estimates.

### Guidance for caring for infants and children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18: clinical report [^4c41a408]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Ethical background for life-sustaining interventions (LSIs) in T13/T18 — controversy has focused on surgery for congenital heart disease and tracheostomy placement for chronic home mechanical ventilation, and although interventions were historically withheld on an explicit assumption of futility — T13 and T18 were considered to be uniformly lethal — recognition that surgery for congenital heart disease, mechanical ventilation, airway stabilization via tracheostomy, placement of gastrostomy tubes, and other surgical treatments could prolong survival for months or years for some infants shifted attention away from a simple futility claim. On the basis of contemporary outcome data and ethical analyses, exclusive comfort care remains a morally acceptable choice that ought to be offered to all parents of infants with confirmed or strongly suspected T13/T18, yet for families who choose to continue the pregnancy the diagnosis alone should not categorically preclude offering therapies that could potentially prolong life and/or facilitate hospital discharge. The only exception would be patient-specific factors leading to true physiologic futility, defined here as a therapy that has no chance of achieving the stated goal; otherwise, parents of infants with T13/T18 should be informed of the availability of appropriately individualized life-sustaining care and counseled in a fashion similar to other multisystem genetic syndromes and/or complex medical conditions, with attention to factors such as gestational age, other comorbidities, or the presence of mosaicism; some families may also choose a more cautious "trial of therapy" with consideration of some therapies but exclusion of others.

### Long-term survival among children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 by cytogenetic status [^1137072a]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the differences in survival to 10 years of age between children with full trisomy 13 or 18 vs those with mosaic or partial trisomy?

Findings

In this cohort study of 798 infants with trisomy 13 and 18, survival to 10 years of age was statistically significantly higher among those with mosaic or partial trisomy compared with full trisomy.

Meaning

These findings suggest that survival to 10 years of age may be relatively common among those with mosaicism or partial trisomy, and families of affected children may benefit from tailored prognostic counseling and care.

### Do parents of children with congenital malformations have a higher cancer risk? A nationwide study in Denmark [^f4631489]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

We identified as controls the parents of a 10% random sample of newborns from the Birth Registry who were born between 1980 and 1995 and whose mothers' citizenship was Danish. We included only first live-borns and obtained 41 206 eligible pairs of parents. For these children we had similar data and from the same data sources as we had for cases.

We obtained the diagnoses of congenital malformations (ICD8 codes before 1994 and ICD10 codes from 1994), by linking the children of cases and controls to the Hospital Discharge Register by means of their CPR numbers. The Hospital Discharge Register started from 1977 as a population-based nation-wide registry with an average completeness over the study period of about 99% of all discharges from non-psychiatric hospitals. Data on congenital malformations include all ICD8 codes 740 to 759 and ICD10 codes Q00 to Q99 as any discharge diagnoses made by midwives or any hospital physicians. We excluded the diagnoses of patent ductus arteriosus, undescended testis and hip dislocation due to the expected large variation in diagnosing these malformations. If a child was registered with more than one malformation, each malformation was counted. Cleft lip/palate are often classified into cleft lip with or without palate and cleft palate and they can also be an isolated malformation (nonsyndromic), or be part of a known syndrome (syndromic), e.g. trisomy 13. We searched our data for associated malformations in all cases of cleft lip/palate. Patients with major malformations or malformations known to be associated with cleft lip/palate were classified as syndromic cleft lip/palate.

From cases and controls we estimated cancer risk as a function of the prevalence of congenital malformation in offspring by means of logistic regression, taking maternal age at birth and sex of child into consideration. We made separate analyses; i.e. analyses including malformations at birth and analyses including malformations diagnosed within first year of life including those diagnosed at birth. We did subanalyses according to the parents' gender, their type of cancer, age at time of cancer diagnosis and time from the birth of the child to the time of cancer diagnosis. We started by analysing all cancers and malformations grouped together. We then examined specific malformations and their relations to parental cancer. Finally, we subdivided the cancer diagnoses to further characterise results.

### Sleep disordered breathing in children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 [^989eca53]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

While the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is well documented in trisomy 21, there has been little published about the incidence in trisomy 13 (T13) and trisomy 18 (T18). Trisomies 13, 18, and 21 have overlapping clinical features that make patients prone to OSA. Because the literature regarding OSA in T13 and T18 children is limited, we performed a retrospective chart review to investigate the characteristics of these patients.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records of children with T13 or T18 seen at seen at a single urban tertiary children's hospital for sleep disordered breathing from 1/1/10 to 5/1/18. Candidates were selected based on ICD-9 diagnosis and procedural codes.

Results

We identified 21 T18 patients that had documented symptoms of SDB, of which 3 were diagnosed with OSA, 11 had clinical SDB, and 7 had snoring. Of the T13 patients, 10 had documented symptoms of SDB, of which 1 patient was diagnosed with OSA, 7 with clinical SDB, and 2 with snoring. In both T13 and T18 patients, anatomical features included micrognathia/mandibular hypoplasia, small mouth/small airway, midface hypoplasia, abnormal/difficult airway, glossoptosis, hypotonia, and GERD. Endoscopic findings included laryngomalacia and/or tracheomalacia, adenoid and lingual tonsil hypertrophy, and inferior turbinate hypertrophy. Surgical interventions performed in T13 and T18 patients included adenoidectomy, lingual tonsillectomy, and tracheostomy. Of the 32 T13 and T18 patients, 15 had to be intubated for respiratory insufficiency.

Conclusion

The results of our study suggest that T13 and T18 patients are at increased risk for OSA due to common features found in this population. These findings indicate a need for otolaryngologist intervention to increase both survival and quality of life in this population.

### Long-term survival among children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 by cytogenetic status [^808d2856]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Incomplete ascertainment of death was also a potential limitation of our analyses; a small number of deaths may have been missed due to inaccurate or missing data, creating difficulties in linking registry cases and death certificates. However, the impact of any missing deaths was likely minimal because previous work in the TBDR has demonstrated that enhancing data with national registry information provided a relatively small number of supplemental cases.

We were additionally limited by lack of availability of data on health care utilization, medical and surgical management, or clinical trajectories of included infants. Relevant health data such as these offer a more comprehensive understanding of the outcomes and factors influencing the health of these children and should be considered in conjunction with genetic factors in any future work. Consistent with this, our PAF calculation demonstrated more than 50% of deaths in both groups could not be attributed to cytogenetic status alone, highlighting the role of other factors in infant outcomes. However, our univariate adjustment for maternal age, preterm birth, small for gestational age, low birth weight, and presence of a heart defect largely did not meaningfully impact the HR for T13 or T18 estimates, and our sensitivity analyses suggested that any unmeasured confounders would need to have very large magnitudes of effect with the exposure and outcome (eg, > 2.97–3.95) to strongly impact our overall interpretation; therefore, it is unlikely that unmeasured confounding could completely explain away the observed associations. Larger pooled samples such as those that could be amassed from the National Birth Defects Prevention Network or the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Research and Prevention may help to facilitate these types of additional analyses, although differences across surveillance systems in documentation and coding of cytogenetic details may pose additional challenges in pooling data.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### 6.2 international classification of diseases archive… [^9f2c3259]. archive.cdc.gov (2021). Medium credibility.

6. 2 International Classification of Diseases The ICD-10 is considered the international standard diagnostic classification system for all general epidemiological purposes, health data-management purposes, and clinical use, and is widely used in many countries as a classification system for diseases. Use of this standardized coding system will facilitate partnerships and collaborations with other programmes using the same coding system. The ICD-10 is developed and maintained by WHO. The most recent version is available on the WHO website. It is available in the six official languages of WHO, as well as in 36 other languages. A list of contact points for the 42 language versions of ICD-10 can be found on the WHO website. On the WHO website, an ICD-10 interactive self-learning tool is available for training purposes.

The ICD-10 has been used to classify diseases in health records and vital records, as a basis for the compilation of national mortality and morbidity statistics by WHO Member States. The ICD-10 codes are listed in alpha-numeric order and are described in detail. Classification of structural congenital anomalies is found in Chapter XVII: "Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities ". This chapter contains the following blocks of codes: Q00–Q07Congenital malformations of the nervous system Q10–Q18Congenital malformations of eye, ear, face and neck Q20–Q28Congenital malformations of the circulatory system Q30–Q34Congenital malformations.

of the respiratory system Q35–Q37Cleft lip and cleft palate Q38–Q45Other congenital malformations of the digestive system Q50–Q56Congenital malformations of genital organs Q60–Q64Congenital malformations of the urinary system Q65–Q79Congenital malformations and deformations of the musculoskeletal system Q80–Q89Other congenital malformations Q90–Q99Chromosomal abnormalities, not elsewhere classified. ICD-10 modifications The ICD-10 codes lack specificity for uniquely coding some congenital anomalies and most genetic syndromes. Therefore, some congenital anomalies surveillance programmes use their own local modification of the ICD-10 that contains additional codes for some specific congenital anomalies not found in the ICD-10, or add an extra digit, or both, to allow for more detailed coding of some defects and certainty of diagnosis.

The following is an example of how the RCPCH developed an adaptation of the ICD-10 by adding an extra digit to the ICD-10 codes to expand and allow for more detailed coding. For example, in this adaptation, specific codes are added to differentiate parietal, orbital, nasal and nasopharyngeal encephaloceles, as follows: Q01. 8Encephalocele of other sites Q01. 80Parietal encephalocele Q01. 81Orbital encephalocele Q01. 82Nasal encephalocele Q01. 83Nasopharyngeal encephalocele.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics," crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one," and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

To identify factors associated with prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal outcomes, and determine medical care use for fetuses and infants with trisomy 13 (T13) and trisomy 18 (T18).

Study Design

This population-based retrospective cohort study included all prenatal and postnatal diagnoses of T13 or T18 in the greater Cincinnati area from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2018. Overall survival, survival to hospital discharge, medical management, and maternal, fetal, and neonatal characteristics are analyzed.

Results

There were 124 pregnancies (125 fetuses) that were identified, which resulted in 72 liveborn infants. Male fetal sex and hydrops were associated with a higher rate of spontaneous loss. The median length of survival was 7 and 29 days, for infants with T13 and T18, respectively. Of the 27 infants alive at 1 month of age, 13 (48%) were alive at 1 year of age. Only trisomy type (T13), goals of care (comfort care), and extremely low birthweight were associated with a shorter length of survival. A high degree of variability existed in the use of medical services, with 28% of infants undergoing at least 1 surgical procedure and some children requiring repeated (≤ 29) or prolonged (> 1 year) hospitalizations.

Conclusions

Although many infants with T13 or T18 did not survive past the first week of life, nearly 20% lived for more than 1 year with varying degrees of medical support. The length of survival for an infant cannot be easily predicted, and surviving infants have high health care use throughout their lifespans.

### Guidance for caring for infants and children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18: clinical report [^be421da5]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Discharge planning and preventive care for infants with trisomy 13/18 should be individualized, ensure continuity after the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and include routine health maintenance and infection prophylaxis based on family goals. Discharge planning must be individualized to medical needs, goals, and practical factors, and it is important to ensure a smooth transition from the NICU to an outpatient medical home. Generally, infants with T13/T18 should receive routine anticipatory guidance and childhood vaccinations, and routine health maintenance should not be withheld solely on the basis of diagnosis. Condition-specific growth curves are available in print and through Support Organization for Trisomy (SOFT), including specific curves for 22 weeks' gestation through term. For infants without access to nirsevimab, palivizumab should be considered during respiratory syncytial virus season even without standard criteria if there is evidence of decreased ability to clear secretions, and the outpatient plan should be reviewed and clarified regularly and provided in writing to the family.

### Guidance for caring for infants and children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18: clinical report [^e23f3f2a]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Trisomy 13/18 prenatal counseling and perinatal planning — clinicians from multiple pediatric disciplines who participate in prenatal counseling ought to maintain a basic understanding of these obstetric testing modalities to be able to provide anticipatory guidance about postnatal care (and potentially fetal intervention) and support parental decision making, and once a diagnosis of T13/T18 is suspected prenatally and the family is considering or planning to continue the pregnancy a neonatal clinician should meet with the family at the earliest opportunity to provide information and support. The prenatal consultation will ideally involve a shared decision-making process, with the clinician giving accurate data in a nonbiased format and eliciting the family members' personal values and goals, and expectant parents choosing to continue the pregnancy will need to make various decisions along the way, including specifics on prenatal and perinatal monitoring, which should be based on parental goals of care, and often require a nuanced, individualized plan. Coordinated consultation with a perinatal hospice or pediatric palliative care team warrants strong consideration to offer information about comfort care after birth and, in some cases, to introduce a team that will provide longitudinal support to the family over time, even if life-prolonging interventions are desired; additional considerations for perinatal care coordination are described in Table 2a.

### Hospital-recorded chronic health conditions in children with and without down syndrome in england: a national cohort of births from 2003 to 2019 [^bbbed179]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data sources

We used Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) Admitted Patient Care data linked with Office for National Statistics (ONS) death records from 1 January 2003 to 1 January 2020. HES contains administrative and demographic information for all hospital admissions funded by the National Health Service (NHS) (99% of all English hospital activity) since 1997. Each record includes up to 20 diagnoses recorded using codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10 codes).ONS records provide up to 15 contributing causes for deaths registered in England and Wales.

Study population

We derived a national cohort of singleton, liveborn infants delivered in English hospitals (capturing 97% of liveborn, singleton infants) from 1 January 2003 to 1 January 2019 using previously described methods. We excluded multiple births because they link less successfully to subsequent hospital admissions. We followed children until age 16, death or 1 January 2020, whichever came first. Stopping follow-up on 1 January 2020 allowed a full year of follow-up for all cohort members prior to reductions in hospital admissions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

We divided the cohort into two groups: children with DS and children without DS. Children with DS were identified by an ICD-10 code of Q90 recorded in any hospital admission or death registration, regardless of the age when recorded. Children without DS never had a Q90 code recorded.

### An aetiological classification of birth defects for epidemiological research [^265f500e]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital anomaly registers collect data on antenatally and postnatally detected anomalies for surveillance, research, and public health purposes. Each anomaly is coded using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-9/ICD-10) based on body systems, allowing accurate comparisons between registers for individual anomalies. When commencing an environmental, epidemiological study, it became clear to us that there is no standard classification that takes aetiology into account. This paper describes a new classification for use in studies addressing aetiology.

Method

A classification system was evolved and piloted using cases in a study of geographical variation in congenital anomaly prevalence.1 Cases that were difficult to categorise were noted, and after discussion with a team of experts, the classification was adjusted accordingly.

Results and Conclusion

A robust, hierarchical method of classifying birth defects into eight categories has been produced, for use at source of data registration in conjunction with, but independent of, ICD coding.

Prenatal diagnosis, care coordination, and decision making — prenatal identification and counseling — note that in resource-abundant health care settings, many of these infants are now identified before birth with noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS), although the diagnostic certainty for this test may be lower than some parents realize, without subsequent amniocentesis and correlation with specific physical findings, and there is a robust body of literature exploring the scientific and ethical complexities of prenatal screening and testing, which includes multiple options for all expectant parents.

### Inpatient hospitalization costs associated with birth defects among persons aged [^b8ef51ff]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

* Identified by scanning up to 40 available fields for ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes Q00–Q99: congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities. Patent ductus arteriosus (Q25.0) and atrial septal defect (Q21.1) were not considered birth defects when occurring in neonates aged < 28 days or with an associated indicator of preterm birth (ICD-10-CM codes P07.2 or P07.3). An additional 23 conditions of lesser clinical importance classified within the Q00–Q99 code range were not considered birth defects.

† Birth defects categories correspond to blocks of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes: cardiovascular (Q20–Q28), central nervous system (Q00–Q07), chromosomal (Q90–Q99), cleft lip/palate (Q35–Q37), ear (Q16–Q17), eye (Q10–Q15), gastrointestinal (Q38–Q45), genitourinary (Q50–Q64), integumentary (Q80–Q85), musculoskeletal (Q65–Q79), and other syndrome (Q87). "Other defect" includes birth defects of the face and neck (Q18), respiratory system (Q30–Q34), and other congenital malformations (Q86 and Q89). Critical cardiovascular defects were operationalized using the National Birth Defects Prevention Network Congenital Malformations Surveillance Report. The specific defects included are only those defined in the National Birth Defects Prevention Network Congenital Malformations Surveillance Report; birth defects not included contribute to frequencies and costs aggregated by birth defect category and overall. Because a single hospitalization might include more than one specific birth defect, individual birth defect frequencies might sum to > 100% of birth defects categories or overall frequencies, and mean costs multiplied by frequencies will correspondingly sum to > 100% of total costs.

### Estimating the burden and economic impact of pediatric genetic disease [^35c99e18]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The maximum number of diagnoses and procedures recorded for each inpatient discharge varies by HCUP member state, but up to 15 diagnoses and 15 procedures were included per discharge in the KID data set and coded in ICD-9-CM. In the HCUP data, the first diagnosis is considered the primary diagnosis, and all other ICD-9-CM codes are considered secondary. Using the 919 ICD-9-CM codes, we identified two sets of criteria by which to define the prevalence range. To establish the upper bound of possible GD discharges, we defined the maximum number of discharges of patients with suspected GD as those for which any diagnosis (up to 15 diagnoses per discharge) was included in the list of 919 codes. For a conservative minimum, discharges with a primary diagnosis in the set of ICD-9-CM codes were selected. In HCUP and other claims data sets, the first listed diagnosis is commonly defined as the condition to be chiefly responsible for inpatient admission and care. To account for variability in coding practice and discharges for newborns, in which "live birth" is often coded first, we considered any diagnosis in our maximum definition, as has been done in similar studies. In addition, we required that the ICD-9-CM diagnosis be a clinical indication for genetic testing given the age at discharge. Specifically, an age cutoff was applied based on estimates of genetic test diagnostic yield for a given ICD-9-CM in neonates versus the remaining pediatric population (Table S2). For example, a diagnosis code indicating scoliosis would only be considered suspected GD if observed in a neonate, but not in an adolescent. For each definition, we consider the background population as those patients represented by discharges with no ICD-9-CM diagnoses codes in the list.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Structured framework for multidisciplinary parent counseling and medical interventions for fetuses and infants with trisomy 13 or trisomy 18 [^a85cfeec]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Trisomy 13 (T13) and 18 (T18) are aneuploidies associated with multiple structural congenital anomalies and high rates of fetal demise and neonatal mortality. Historically, patients with either one of these diagnoses have been treated similarly with exclusive comfort care rather than invasive interventions or intensive care, despite a wide phenotypic variation and substantial variations in survival length. However, surgical interventions have been on the rise in this population in recent years without clearly elucidated selection criterion. Our objective was to create a standardized approach to counseling expectant persons and parents of newborns with T13/T18 in order to provide collaborative and consistent counseling and thoughtful approach to interventions such as surgery.

Study Design

This article describes our process and presents our resulting clinical care guideline.

Results

We formed a multi- and interdisciplinary committee. We used published literature when available and otherwise expert opinion to develop an approach to care featuring individualized assessment of the patient to estimate qualitative mortality risk and potential to benefit from intensive care and/or surgeries centered within an ethical framework.

Conclusion

Through multidisciplinary collaboration, we successfully created a patient-centered approach for counseling families facing a diagnosis of T13/T18. Other institutions may use our approach as a model for developing their own standardized approach.

Key Points

· Trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 are associated with high but variable morbidity and mortality. · Research on which patients are most likely to benefit from surgery is lacking. · We present our institution's framework to counsel families with fetal/neonatal T13/T18.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^7319604b]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic transitions

Not all genetic diseases have specific ICD-9/10 codes; thus, a definitive assessment of genetic disease diagnoses in patients with initial clinical presentations that are indicative of a suspected genetic disease is not possible from an administrative claims-based analysis. However, assessing the proportion of patients transitioning from an initial index diagnosis code in the possible or probable genetic disease categories to a primary diagnosis code in the definite genetic disease category is indicative of a conservative estimate of definitive genetic disease diagnoses. These transitions may have resulted from additional clinical investigations including specialist assessments, the results of imaging or other non-invasive procedures, or, in an extreme minority of cases per the genetic test utilization results above, molecular testing. The number of patients who moved into more definite categories of diagnosis is reported in Table 3.

Table 3
Diagnostic transitions.

The first diagnostic category represents the category of code used for the index event. The second diagnostic category represents a change from a less-specific category to a more specific category during follow-up.

CPT/HCPCS Current Procedural terminology/Healthcare common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS), MCA/ID/DD/E: MCA multiple congenital anomalies, ID intellectual disability, DD developmental delay, E epilepsy/seizures.

In the Broad and MCA/ID/DD/E cohorts of the pediatric population, 1.1% and 2.6% of patients, respectively, transitioned from possible or probable to definite (Table 3). We observed a higher transition rate in the Conservative cohort — which had at least one genetic test by definition — where 15.8% of patients transitioned from a possible or probable diagnosis to a definite diagnosis within the follow-up period (Table 3).

In the Broad and MCA/ID/DD/E cohorts of the critically-ill newborn population, 5.3% and 6.5% of patients, respectively, transitioned from possible or probable to definite (Table 3). As in the pediatric population, the Conservative cohort had a much higher rate of conversion to definite compared to the other two cohorts: 41.6% of patients transitioned from a possible or probable index diagnosis to a definite genetic disease diagnosis during the follow-up period.

### Use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and mortality in pediatric cardiac surgery patients with genetic conditions: a multicenter analysis [^ba2016b8]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Congenital heart disease is commonly a manifestation of genetic conditions. Surgery and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were withheld in the past from some patients with genetic conditions. We hypothesized that surgical care of children with genetic conditions has increased over the last decade, but their cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use remains lower and mortality greater.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Patients admitted to the Pediatric Health Information System database 18 years old or younger with cardiac surgery during 2003–2014. Genetic conditions identified by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition codes were grouped as follows: trisomy 21, trisomy 13 or 18, 22q11 deletion, and all "other" genetic conditions and compared with patients without genetic condition.

Patients

A total of 95,253 patients met study criteria, no genetic conditions (85%), trisomy 21 (10%), trisomy 13 or 18 (0.2%), 22q11 deletion (1%), and others (5%).

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Annual surgical cases did not vary over time. Compared to patients without genetic conditions, trisomy 21 patients, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use was just over half (odds ratio, 0.54), but mortality with and without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were similar. In trisomy 13 or 18 patients, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use was similar to those without genetic condition, but all five treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation died. 22q11 patients compared with those without genetic condition had similar extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use, but greater odds of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation mortality (odds ratio, 3.44). Other genetic conditions had significantly greater extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use (odds ratio, 1.22), mortality with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (odds ratio, 1.42), and even greater mortality odds without (odds ratio, 2.62).

Conclusions

The proportion of children undergoing cardiac surgery who have genetic conditions did not increase during the study. Excluding trisomy 13 or 18, all groups of genetic conditions received and benefited from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation mortality was greater for those with 22q11 deletion and other genetic conditions.

### Increased prevalence of some birth defects in Korea, 2009–2010 [^180d7b79]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

However, the results in this study must be interpreted in the context of some limitations. The study cannot avoid the methodological limitation of insurance based data analysis. Diagnostic criteria, coding and the timing for follow-up of outpatients might vary in the hospitals, and further validation of the diagnosis was difficult with the insurance database analysis due to lack of detailed records. For example, some newborns with birth defects might have died before entering the hospital, although the number of such patients should be rare. In addition, ICD-9 codes were used to specify birth defects for years 1993–1994, while ICD-10 was used to classify birth defects for 2009–2010. Two versions of disease classification differ substantially. The change to the tenth revision resulted in more detailed classification, with about 8,000 categories compared with about 5,000 categories in the ninth revision. The relatively large difference of some birth defects reported between 1993–1994 and 2009–2010 may be due to the switch from ICD-9 to ICD-10. This study used a comparable category of codes for 26 selected defects according to the ninth and tenth revisions. However, there may be an important underlying variation to case ascertainment and diagnostic criteria (inclusion or exclusion of minor cases) which may have given higher reported rates in some birth defects. A study found the comparability ratio of 0.9064 between ICD-10 and ICD-9 while explaining congenital anomalies and chromosomal abnormalities as a cause of death in the United States. Nonetheless, this study is helpful in understanding increased prevalence of some important birth defects in Korea.

### Prevalence and clinical attributes of congenital microcephaly-new york, 2013–2015 [^e14eff22]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Although congenital microcephaly is a reportable birth defect and should be included in hospital reports to the Registry, because of concerns about timeliness and completeness of routine reporting, a query was sent to all 154 New York birth hospitals. Hospitals were asked to report all newborns who had a diagnosis code specifying microcephaly (ICD-9-CM code 742.1 or ICD-10-CM code Q02), born during 2013–2015 to women who resided in New York at the time of delivery. All birth hospitals responded, and 83 (54%) identified suspected cases of microcephaly. The SPARCS database was also queried for ICD-9-CM code 742.1 or ICD-10-CM code Q02. Charts were obtained for all newborns with suspected microcephaly and were reviewed by trained clinicians who abstracted birth measurements (head circumference, length, and weight), demographic information, and prespecified infant clinical characteristics, maternal conditions, and maternal/fetal exposures that might have associations with birth defects. Maternal conditions included preeclampsia, eclampsia, hypertension, and gestational diabetes. Prenatal exposures included in utero and perinatal infections (including infections with Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Treponema pallidum, and varicella, dengue, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses), maternal consumption of alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs and certain teratogenic medications (warfarin, retinoic acid, anticonvulsants, and angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors), and environmental exposures (i.e. radiation, lead, and mercury). Information also was abstracted on any documented genetic anomalies such as trisomy, gene deletions or duplications, and genomic imprinting, and on family history of birth defects, and parental consanguinity.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Dermatologic conditions in down syndrome: a multi-site retrospective review of international classification of diseases codes [^4f9d0c03]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

As the population and life expectancy of people with Down syndrome increases, identifying common skin conditions throughout the lifespan will help inform clinical care and research. We sought to evaluate dermatologic conditions diagnosed in pediatric and adult patients with Down syndrome.

Methods

This multicenter retrospective study analyzed demographic and outpatient visit International Classification of Diseases codes of patients with Down syndrome evaluated at outpatient dermatology clinics in the United States or Canada between 2011 and 2021.

Results

A total of 1529 patients with Down syndrome were identified from eight academic medical centers: 50.8% were children (0-12years), 25.2% were adolescents (13-17years), and 24% were adults (18years and older). Eczematous dermatitis was the most common diagnosis overall (26%), followed by folliculitis (19.3%) and seborrheic dermatitis (15.6%). Other notable diagnoses included dermatophyte infections (13%), alopecia areata (11.6%), and psoriasis (6.7%). About 4.3% of visits included a code for high-risk medication use. Eczematous dermatitis, alopecia areata, and folliculitis were the most common diagnoses observed in children; folliculitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and eczematous dermatitis in adolescents; and seborrheic dermatitis, eczematous dermatitis, and folliculitis in adults.

Conclusions

Dermatologic conditions in patients with Down syndrome vary by age, but are most often eczematous, adnexal, and cutaneous autoimmune disorders. This multicenter retrospective review identifies skin diseases that should be prioritized for clinical care guideline development and research in the Down syndrome community.

### Population-based analyses of mortality in trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 [^d3734793]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Although trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 are generally considered to be lethal, long-term survival of patients has been reported. We sought to evaluate mortality in people with trisomy 13 or 18 using 2 population-based strategies.

Methods

In the first analysis, infants who had trisomy 13 or 18 and were born during 1968–1999 were identified using the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program, a population-based birth defects surveillance system. Dates of death were documented using hospital records, Georgia vital records, and the National Death Index. In the second analysis, we used the Multiple-Cause Mortality Files compiled from US death certificates from 1979 through 1997. Using these 2 analyses, we examined median survival time or median age at death, survival beyond 1 year of age, and factors associated with longer survival.

Results

Using Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program, we identified 70 liveborn infants with trisomy 13 and 114 liveborn infants with trisomy 18. Median survival time was 7 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3–15) for people with trisomy 13 and 14.5 days (95% CI: 8–28) for people with trisomy 18. For each condition, 91% of infants died within the first year. Neither race nor gender affected survival for trisomy 13, but for trisomy 18, girls and infants of races other than white seemed to survive longer. The presence of a heart defect did not seem to affect survival for either condition. Using MCMF, we identified 5515 people with trisomy 13 and 8750 people with trisomy 18 listed on their death certificates. Median ages at death for people with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 both were 10 days; 5.6% of people with trisomy 13 and 5.6% of people with trisomy 18 died at age 1 year or greater. Race and gender seemed to affect survival in both conditions, with girls and blacks showing higher median ages at death.

Conclusions

Although survival is greatly affected by trisomy 13 and trisomy 18, 5% to 10% of people with these conditions survive beyond the first year of life. These population-based data are useful to clinicians who care for patients with these trisomies or counsel families with infants or fetuses who have a diagnosis of trisomy 13 or 18.

### Guidance for caring for infants and children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18: clinical report [^1fdd6642]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Congenital heart disease and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in trisomy 13/18 — There is a high prevalence of congenital cardiac disease in patients with T13/T18 (57–80% of infants with T13 and 80–90% of infants with T18), and multiple studies have demonstrated potential benefit for cardiac surgery in patients with T13/T18, albeit with higher peri- and postoperative mortality. Studies suggest that infants requiring mechanical ventilation preoperatively have the poorest outcomes and are likely to continue to require mechanical ventilation long-term. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used after some cardiac surgeries, although rarely for patients with T13/T18, and it is appropriate to consider ECMO for this population as it is for other surgical candidates, with counseling provided to parents about the increased risk of morbidity and mortality. ECMO has been used successfully for infants with T13/T18 with potentially reversible noncardiac indications such as meconium aspiration syndrome, with comparable outcomes to general pediatric ECMO; thus, the presence of T13/T18 may be considered as one of the relevant factors in assessing for ECMO candidacy but is not a contraindication in isolation. In some cases, patients are offered palliative rather than corrective surgery to allow for discontinuation of prostaglandin infusion, support discharge to home, or reduce symptoms of congestive heart failure. Decisions about whether to offer or withhold congenital heart disease surgery for infants with T13/T18 should be made on the basis of transparent, clearly articulated institutional standards, medical information about the specific patient, and available evidence published about outcomes following surgery, and in 2024 the American Association for Thoracic Surgery advised that surgical decision making should "not be based solely on the presence of trisomy but, instead, should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering both the severity of the baby's heart disease as well as the presence of other anomalies."

### Hospitalizations in people with down syndrome across age groups: a population-based cohort study in Switzerland [^0393f5ee]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Classification of primary causes of hospitalization and secondary diagnoses

We classified the primary causes of hospitalization and secondary diagnoses based on ICD-10 codes and classified these into six main disease groups as most relevant due to their prevalence and clinical importance: circulatory system (I00–I99), infectious diseases (A00–B99), digestive system (K00–K95), nervous system (G00–G99), neoplasms (C00–D49), and musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (M00–N99). Congenital malformations of the nervous system (Q00–Q07) were subclassified in the nervous system diseases, congenital malformations of the circulatory system (Q20–Q28) were subclassified in the circulatory system diseases, and congenital malformations of the digestive system (Q38–Q45) in the digestive system diseases, respectively. Furthermore, we classified the following infectious diseases classified elsewhere in ICD-10 as infectious diseases: respiratory infections (J00–J22), infectious arthropathies (M00–M02), inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (G00–G09). Secondary diagnoses are defined diseases diagnosed according to ICD-10 and include both acute and chronic diagnoses. Physiognomic or expected features of Down syndrome could not be assessed, since they are not part of the ICD-10 catalogue and are hence not documented in the nationwide dataset used in this study.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the number of hospitalizations characterized by the incidence rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 population person-years, displayed across age groups and stratified by primary reasons for hospitalization. Secondary outcomes comprised (i) the number of diagnoses per hospitalized patient over lifetime, (ii) length of hospital stay (LOS) — defined as days spent in the hospital during the hospitalization, (iii) intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, (iv) mechanical ventilation rate, (v) length of ICU stay, (vi) all-cause in-hospital mortality, and (vii) 30-day all-cause hospital readmission.

Retinal arterial occlusion ICD-10 CM codes — Central retinal artery occlusion includes H34.11, H34.12, and H34.13; arterial branch occlusion includes H34.231, H34.232, and H34.233; partial retinal artery occlusion includes H34.211, H34.212, and H34.213; and transient retinal artery occlusion includes H34.01, H34.02, and H34.03. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality, and if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3; ICD = International Classification of Diseases and CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Celiac disease and down syndrome mortality: a nationwide cohort study [^d8d3669e]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Down syndrome

We defined DS through any of the following ICD (International Classification of Diseases) codes (ICD-8: 759,30 and 310–315,51; ICD-9: 758A; ICD-10: Q90) in any of the registers: the Swedish National Patient Register, the Medical Birth Register, and the Register of Congenital Malformations.

The Swedish National Patient Register started in 1964, became nationwide in 1987 and includes hospital-based outpatient care since 2001. The positive predictive value of most diagnoses is 85–95%, and it is estimated to cover > 99% of all non-psychiatric health care in Sweden. The Swedish Medical Birth Register started in 1973 and includes > 98% of all births in Sweden. The National Register of Congenital Malformations collects data on severe malformations and chromosomal abnormalities since 1964. According to the National Board of Health and Welfare, holder of the national health registers in Sweden, the combined data from multiple registers enable a close to complete identification of individuals with DS, including all three genetic variants of DS: trisomy 21 caused by meiotic non-disjunction, mosaicism and translocation. The Patient Register allows identification of DS also for individuals born before 1973. A DS diagnosis can be recorded at any age when a patient seeks healthcare (i.e. not only at birth).

Mortality

We used data from the Swedish Cause of Death Register to ascertain overall mortality and cause-specific mortality.

Covariates

Data on socioeconomic status (according to the European Socioeconomic Classification: six categories with missing data fit into a separate category) and education level (four a priori categories) were obtained from the government agency Statistics Sweden. Other covariates included country of birth (Nordic versus not Nordic), year of CD diagnosis (1989 and earlier, 1990–1999, 2000 and later) and age at CD diagnosis (0–1.99; 2–9.99; 10–39.99; 40+ years). Data on type 1 diabetes were obtained from the Swedish Patient Register (see Additional file 1).

### Transitions in care for infants with trisomy 13 or 18 [^aad32898]. American Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives The scope of interventions offered to infants with trisomy 13 (T13) or trisomy 18 (T18) is increasing. We describe the spectrum of care provided, highlighting transitions in care for individual patients. Patients and Methods This is a single-center, retrospective cohort of infants with T13 or T18 born between 2004 and 2015. Initial care was classified as comfort care or intervention using prenatal counseling notes. Transitions in care were identified in the medical record. Results In this study, 25 infants were divided into two groups based on their care: neonates who experienced no transition in care and neonates who experienced at least one transition. Eleven neonates experienced no transition in care with 10 receiving comfort care. Fourteen neonates experienced at least one transition: three transitioned from comfort care to intervention and 11 from intervention to comfort care. The three initially provided comfort care were discharged home with hospice and readmitted. Among the 11 cases who transitioned from intervention to comfort care, 9 transitioned during the birth hospitalization, 6 had no prenatal suspicion for T13 or T18, and 5 experienced elective withdrawal of intensive care. Conclusion The spectrum of care for infants with T13 or T18 illustrates the need for individualized counseling that is on-going, goal directed, collaborative, and responsive.

### An epidemiological study of holoprosencephaly from a regional congenital anomaly register: 1995–2004 [^041d34a0]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Adequate contemporary information to counsel patients with a prenatal diagnosis of holoprosencephaly is lacking. We addressed this using data from the West Midlands Congenital Anomaly Register (WMCAR), a population-based malformation register, during a time where technological improvements have been stable and anomaly screening is well established.

Methods

Cases were defined using the ICD 10 code for holoprosencephaly. Cases of livebirths, stillbirths and termination at all gestations were included in the study. The diagnosis was verified by a pathology or definitive radiological report with cross validation from the regional pathology, clinical genetics, cytogenetics and fetal medicine databases.

Results

There were 113 cases reported of holoprosencephaly for the years 1995–2004. This represents a prevalence of 1.7 per 10,000 births and terminations, with no change in prevalence over time. There was a decreased risk of holoprosencephaly in the white population [white vs. nonwhite; RR 0.53(0.36–0.79)]. Karyotypical abnormality was noted in 46% of cases where the karyotype was known. Trisomy 13 was the most common chromosomal abnormality. Correct allocation of a diagnosis of holoprosencephaly by ultrasound occurred in 77% of cases, with another 12% having a severe intracranial abnormality but was not reported as holoprosencephaly. In 4%, a prenatal diagnosis of holoprosencephaly was not made. Termination of pregnancy was performed in 80% of all cases.

Conclusion

Holoprosencephaly is a morbid condition associated with significant secondary etiologies.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^68ee46a4]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study has strengths and limitations. Strengths include the size of the population evaluated — which included over 13 million unique patients from a large commercial health plan population, representative of commercially-insured patients more generally. Our methodology, which included a detailed curation of indicators of genetic disease, allowed us to evaluate several different populations of patients based on different levels of specificity. Finally, our administrative claims-based approach allowed for a comprehensive assessment of direct healthcare-related utilization and costs. Several limitations should be considered in the interpretation of our results. First, as our methodology utilized insurance claims data as opposed to electronic health records, we are limited in our ability to interpret both diagnostic thinking and clinical decision-making. For example, while we observe substantial delays in genetic testing in many patients, the reasons for these delays are unclear and may be clinically warranted based on the unique circumstances of individual patients. Similarly, ICD-9/10 codes do not capture the granularity required to distinguish diagnosed genetic conditions. Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a deep ontology that relates detailed clinical features to both diseases and genes. Availability of HPO terms in a large data set like this would have improved our specificity in defining populations and HPO coding (or improvements in ICD coding informed by HPO) could contribute to future studies of genetic disease in populations. In addition, while some genetic diseases have specific ICD-9/10 codes, many do not; thus, we are unable to definitively determine the end of a diagnostic odyssey for many individual patients. Second, our definitions of possible, probable and definite genetic disease are based on expert opinion and manual curation. Not all patients with these features would have had a genetic diagnosis even if optimal testing had been performed. This is likely due to additional undescribed disease-causing genes, oligogenic and complex inheritance, and environmental phenocopies. How ICD-9/10 codes are used for insurance billing purposes may not be aligned with the diagnostic thinking of clinicians. Coding systems, including diagnosis and procedure codes, are used for billing purposes and are likely to fail to reflect the variability observed in clinical practice. Furthermore, a level of miscoding is presumed to occur as is inherent in claims database studies (e.g. a coding specialist may select the first code on a list of possible codes as opposed to the most appropriate code). Third, given the substantial health conditions of patients with genetic diseases, patients may transition to public insurance programs, switch between private insurance plans, or for other reasons stopped being observed in the database. Although our continuous enrollment requirements help control for some of this variability, there are inherent limitations to the comprehensiveness of the follow-up, which could also be exacerbated by the severity of the disease. Finally, in our selection of patients, we found a large number of newborns with codes indicating a possible genetic condition but no stay in a NICU. Because we required a stay in a NICU, these patients were excluded from analysis in the critically-ill infant population and were instead included in the pediatric population.

### Measurement of genetic diseases as a cause of mortality in infants receiving whole genome sequencing [^c0fd025a]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infant mortality has been tracked annually worldwide for many years. Knowledge of causes of infant mortality shapes public health policy and prioritizes diseases for investments in surveillance, intervention and medical research. As a result of such prioritization, programs such as Back to Sleep/Safe to Sleep® have significantly reduced rates of many causes of infant mortality over the past 50 years in the United States –. However, knowledge of the underlying causes of infant mortality is based on death certificates, which are estimated to be inaccurate or incomplete in 33–53% of cases –. In addition, the vast majority of death certificates are not informed by molecular diagnoses.

Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities (International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes Q00–Q99) have been reported to be the leading causes of infant death in the United States for the past 50 years –. Many, but not all, of these are associated with genetic diseases. Several of the other nine leading causes of infant mortality are also associated with genetic diseases, including low birth weight and prematurity, sudden infant death syndrome, newborn sepsis, diseases of the circulatory system and neonatal hemorrhage –. Molecular autopsies have transformed the forensic evaluation of sudden unexplained death in the young, leading to new guidelines and treatments and a decreased number of deaths. Despite this success, and while the molecular basis of 14,000 genetic diseases has been determined, it is not known which genetic diseases are leading contributors to infant mortality other than for sudden unexplained death and chromosomal aneuploidies.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^ac0479d3]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study population

Our methodology to define the study populations was developed with the goal of identifying pediatric (< 18 years of age) patients with indicators of genetic diseases. Diagnostic codes typically do not classify by underlying disease mechanism, and we therefore manually curated lists of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes, Current Procedural Technology (CPT), and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes, and other relevant billing codes (e.g. neonatal intensive care). A detailed list of all codes used in this study can be found in the Supplementary Information. We then used combinations of these codes (see below) to define patient subsets for analysis. These code sets were initially curated by an expert medical geneticist and were reviewed by claims coding experts at Optum. A similar curation methodology for ICD-9 codes has been previously described, though the current study the code sets were expanded to allow for more detailed classification of patient cohorts and utilization of genetic and non-genetic testing and procedures (by including CPT/HCPCS codes) and to allow for additional timeframe analyses (by adding ICD-10 codes). The code curation process resulted in identification of 1269 ICD-9 codes, 2155 ICD-10 codes, and 781 CPT/HCPCS codes. These codes were further curated with respect to the age of presentation as it is well known that some clinical diagnoses are highly suggestive of a genetic disorder within certain age groups but not others (e.g. isolated scoliosis in a newborn may indicate a genetic disorder, but the same feature in an adolescent is more likely to be multifactorial).

### Estimating the burden and economic impact of pediatric genetic disease [^7da3301e]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To identify the economic impact of pediatric patients with clinical indications of genetic disease (GD) on the US health-care system.

Methods

Using the 2012 Kids' Inpatient Database, we identified pediatric inpatient discharges with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes linked to genetic disease, including well-established genetic disorders, neurological diseases, birth defects, and other physiological or functional abnormalities with a genetic basis. Cohort characteristics and health-care utilization measures were analyzed. Discharges with a GD-associated primary diagnosis were used to estimate the minimum burden; discharges with GD-associated primary or secondary codes established the maximum burden.

Results

Of 5.85 million weighted discharges, 2.6–14% included GD-associated ICD-9-CM codes. For these discharges, mean total costs were $16,000–77,000 higher (P < 0.0001) in neonates and $12,000–17,000 higher (P < 0.0001) in pediatric patients compared with background, corresponding to significantly higher total charges and lengths of stay. Aggregate total charges for suspected GD accounted for $14 to $57 billion (11–46%) of the "national bill" for pediatric patients in 2012.

Conclusion

Pediatric inpatients with diagnostic codes linked to genetic disease have a significant and disproportionate impact on resources and costs in the US health-care system.

### Long-term survival among children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 by cytogenetic status [^b4a88d3b]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

We found that individuals with mosaic or partial T13 or T18 compared with those with full trisomy had a greater likelihood of survival to 10 years of age. However, the results also highlight the need to identify additional factors associated with long-term survival among infants with T13 and T18 because less than 50% of survival was attributable to nonfull trisomy status. Additional studies examining the impact of early interventions, such as palliative care or surgical procedures, and clinically relevant factors, such as small-for-gestational-age status, could offer valuable insights into understanding and ultimately improving survival outcomes for affected children. Type-dependent survival demonstrated in our results also emphasizes the need to prioritize cytogenetic classification for development of more tailored care among livebirth infants affected with these anomalies in the US moving forward.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^4ab2a812]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Subset of clinical indications broadly accepted for genetic testing (MCA/ID/DD/E)

This cohort was intended to identify a specific subset of clinical presentations that are broadly accepted indications for genetic testing, as suggested by clinical guidelines –. We defined this cohort as patients with ICD-9/10 diagnosis codes for MCA, moderate or severe ID, DD, or E. For patients with MCA, patients were required to have either a code specific for multiple anomalies or codes for single anomalies in two or more organ systems.

An index date was set on the service date of the first appearing qualifying code for a diagnosis for the Conservative and MCA/ID/DD/E cohorts, or on the first appearing diagnosis or test date for the Broad cohort. Identification of the index date included all ICD codes, regardless of whether the code was principal or secondary, with a hierarchy of definite > probable > possible for the index code for claims with more than one associated diagnosis code. Patients were required to be continuously enrolled for 6 months prior to the index diagnosis, with any child < 6 months of age having a reduced continuous enrollment requirement equal to their age on index.

Finally, we divided the sample into two non-overlapping populations based on age and patient acuity: pediatric patients and critically-ill infants. Pediatric patients were either > 28 days of age and ≤ 18 years on the index date, or were ≤ 28 days of age on the index date but had no observed NICU stay at any time during the observation period. Critically-ill newborns were ≤ 28 days of age on the index date and had a stay in a NICU at any time during the observation period. Thus our final analyses were completed on six groups: within both critically-ill infants and within pediatric patients we evaluated Broad, Conservative, and MCA/ID/DD/E cohorts. (Fig. 3)

### The ongoing relationship between offspring congenital heart disease and preeclampsia across pregnancies [^572ef253]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study that included all pregnancies delivered in the state of California from 2000 to 2012. Patients were identified from linked California Vital Statistics Birth Certificate Data, infant Vital Statistics Death Certificate Data, California Patient Discharge Data, and Vital Statistics Fetal Death File. Data linkage is performed by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Healthcare Information Resource Center, under the California Health and Human Services Agency, which used a unique "record linkage number" unique to the mother-infant pair. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board at Oregon Health and Science University, the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, and the California Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects. Since the linked data set did not contain potential patient privacy and identification information, informed consent was exempted.

We included deliveries with singleton births with gestational age of 23 to 42 weeks. We excluded pre-existing diabetes which was identified using birth certificates and using International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) diagnosis codes (250.×) from hospital discharge data. Other exclusions were chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome (ICD-9 diagnosis code: 758.0), trisomy 18 (758.2), trisomy 13 (758.1), DiGeorge syndrome (279.11), Turner syndrome (758.6), and Noonan syndrome (759.89). The variables of interest were neonatal CHD which was identified using ICD-9 diagnosis codes (listed in Supplemental Table 1), and preeclampsia (birth certificate and ICD-9 diagnosis code: 642.4, 642.5). We assessed numerous demographics as confounders such as maternal race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic Native American, or other/multiracial). Age was categorized as < 20, 20 to 34, and ≥ 35 years. Educational attainment was categorized as attendance at some college vs less than college, and insurance was categorized into public vs nonpublic insurance. In addition, gestational diabetes mellitus was assessed using birth certificates and ICD-9 codes (648.0, 648.8), and preterm delivery (< 34 weeks) was captured using gestational age.

### Coding update of the SMFM definition of low risk for cesarean delivery from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM [^9ece1f72]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2015, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine developed a low risk for cesarean delivery definition based on administrative claims-based diagnosis codes described by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition is a clinical enrichment of 2 available measures from the Joint Commission and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality measures. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine measure excludes diagnosis codes that represent clinically relevant risk factors that are absolute or relative contraindications to vaginal birth while retaining diagnosis codes such as labor disorders that are discretionary risk factors for cesarean delivery. The introduction of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification in October 2015 expanded the number of available diagnosis codes and enabled a greater depth and breadth of clinical description. These coding improvements further enhance the clinical validity of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition and its potential utility in tracking progress toward the goal of safely lowering the US cesarean delivery rate. This report updates the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition of low risk for cesarean delivery using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification coding.

### Long-term survival among children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 by cytogenetic status [^29aac61a]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Results

The final sample of eligible liveborn infants from the TBDR between 1999 and 2008 included 798 infants (463 female infants [58.0%]; 403 [51.0%] Hispanic, 114 [14.3%] non-Hispanic Black, 245 [30.7%] non-Hispanic White, and 32 [4.1%] other non-Hispanic; mean [SD] maternal age, 30.9 [8.0] years), including 295 infants with T13 and 503 infants with T18 (Table 1). Overall, 52 infants with T13 (17.6%) and 32 infants with T18 (6.4%) received a nonfull trisomy designation (mosaic or partial trisomy). For both groups, 558 infants (69.9%) had cytogenetic information (eg, karyotype) available, with the remaining 240 (30.1%) receiving a diagnosis of T13 or T18 based on review of their medical records by registry staff. Demographic characteristics among infants with T13 and T18 were tabulated (Table 1). Of note, 80 infants (27.9%) with T13 and 214 (43.5%) of those with T18 were born to women 35 years of age or older. Additionally, 144 infants (48.8%) with T13 and 263 (52.3%) with T18 were born to Hispanic women.

### Long-term survival among children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 by cytogenetic status [^eec3d036]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Data on infant and maternal characteristics (eg, demographic information) were obtained from medical records and/or vital records from the Center for Health Statistics at the Texas Department of State Health Services. Mortality status for eligible infants was determined through the use of Texas vital statistics data, which included the presence or absence of a linked death certificate, similar vital records from most other US states provided to the registry under state reciprocity agreements, and abstracted medical records. Survival time was calculated as the number of days alive (by subtracting the date of birth from the date of death). Deaths occurring outside Texas in states with which Texas had an interagency agreement were included in estimates (via the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems). Prior research in the TBDR has found that linking to additional resources, such as the National Death Index, to assess 5-year mortality, yielded few additional deaths beyond those already captured by the registry. All individuals lacking documented death in medical records or a connected death certificate were presumed to be living. Among those without death records, the date of birth was subtracted from the censoring date (ie, 10th birthday or December 31, 2018, the last available date for linked vital records during the analysis period).

### The transition to ICD-10-CM: challenges for pediatric practice [^51ad6a56]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Diagnostic codes are used widely within health care for billing, quality assessment, and to measure clinical outcomes. The US health care system will transition to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), in October 2015. Little is known about how this transition will affect pediatric practices. The objective of this study was to examine how the transition to ICD-10-CM may result in ambiguity of clinical information and financial disruption for pediatricians.

Methods

Using a statewide data set from Illinois Medicaid specified for pediatricians, 2708 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, diagnosis codes were identified. Diagnosis codes were categorized into 1 of 5 categories: identity, class-to-subclass, subclass-to-class, convoluted, and no translation. The convoluted and high-cost diagnostic codes (n = 636) were analyzed for accuracy and categorized into "information loss", "overlapping categories", "inconsistent", and "consistent". Finally, reimbursement by Medicaid was calculated for each category.

Results

Twenty-six percent of pediatric diagnosis codes are convoluted, which represents 21% of Illinois Medicaid pediatric patient encounters and 16% of reimbursement. The diagnosis codes represented by information loss (3.6%), overlapping categories (3.2%), and inconsistent (1.2%) represent 8% of Medicaid pediatric reimbursement.

Conclusions

The potential for financial disruption and administrative errors from 8% of reimbursement diagnosis codes necessitates special attention to these codes in preparing for the transition to ICD-10-CM for pediatric practices.

### Using patient-centered care after a prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 18 or trisomy 13: a review [^ccc51d59]. JAMA Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Patient-centered care (PCC) has been advocated by the Institute of Medicine to improve health care in the United States. Four concepts of PCC align with clinical ethics principles and are associated with enhanced patient/parent satisfaction. These concepts are dignity and respect, information sharing, participation, and collaboration. The objective of this article is to use the PCC approach as a framework for an extensive literature review evaluating the current status of counseling regarding prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 18 (T18) or trisomy 13 (T13) and to advocate PCC in the care of these infants.

Observations

Extensive availability of prenatal screening and diagnostic testing has led to increased detection of chromosomal anomalies early in pregnancy. After diagnosis of T18 or T13, counseling and care have traditionally been based on assumptions that these aneuploidies are lethal or associated with poor quality of life, a view that is now being challenged. Recent evidence suggests that there is variability in outcomes that may be improved by postnatal interventions, and that quality-of-life assumptions are subjective. Parental advocacy for their infant's best interest mimics this variability as requests for resuscitation, neonatal intensive care, and surgical intervention are becoming more frequent.

Conclusions and Relevance

With new knowledge and increased parental advocacy, physicians face ethical decisions in formulating recommendations including interruption vs continuation of pregnancy, interventions to prolong life, and choices to offer medical or surgical procedures. We advocate a PCC approach, which has the potential to reduce harm when inadequate care and counseling strategies create conflicting values and uncertain outcomes between parents and caregivers in the treatment of infants with T18 and T13.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Prevalence of microcephaly in Europe: population based study [^78a87154]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

All EUROCAT registries use multiple sources of information to ascertain cases among all live births, late fetal deaths (> 20 weeks' gestation), and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly at any gestation. Data sources, depending on registry, include maternity, neonatal, and paediatric records; fetal medicine, cytogenetic, pathology, and medical genetics records; specialist services including paediatric cardiology; and hospital discharge and child health records. The EUROCAT central database is hosted by the European Commission Joint Research Centre in Ispra, Italy, since 2015. Registries either submit individual anonymised records of cases of congenital anomalies (full members) or submit the same data in aggregate form (associate members). All cases are coded with ICD-9 or ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, ninth or 10th versions) with 1-digit British Paediatric Association (BPA) extension. In each case there can be one syndrome and up to eight malformation codes. All coding is standardised by using the EUROCAT guide (version 1.4) with isolated minor anomalies, such as skin tags, being excluded.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^6ab5f49e]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Cohort definitions

A total of 13,076,038 unique patients were included in the source data set selected. Of these, 11,036,263 subjects were identified and retained as a control for the pediatric population, and 1,148,695 subjects that met all birth and enrollment criteria were retained as controls for the newborn population (Table 1). Within each population (pediatric and critically-ill newborn), analysis cohorts were identified through a combination of diagnosis codes, procedure codes, and revenue codes, with combinations of these codes used to define three different cohorts with different levels of stringency: (1) a Broad cohort with clinical indicators suggestive of a genetic disease; (2) a more specific subset of clinical presentations that are broadly accepted indications for genetic testing [multiple congenital anomalies (MCA), moderate or severe intellectual disability (ID), developmental delay (DD), or epilepsy/seizures (E)]; and (3) a conservative cohort that had indicators of undiagnosed genetic disease as well as ≥ 1 genetic test (see Methods for additional details on cohort definitions and selection). Details of the sample selection and attrition are shown in Supplementary Table 1.

In the pediatric population, a total of 1,139,035 pediatric patients met the Broad cohort criteria as having one or more clinical features suggestive of an undiagnosed genetic disease, representing 9.4% of the total eligible population (n = 12,175,298). A total of 94,714 (0.8% of eligible patients) had ICD-9/10 codes for MCA/ID/DD/E. Finally, 28,348 (0.2% of eligible patients) met the Conservative cohort definition which required at least one genetic test (Table 1).

### Resource utilization in the first 2 years following operative correction for tetralogy of Fallot: study using data from the optum's De-identified clinformatics data mart insurance claims database [^3dc8af42]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Measures and Variables

Data were extracted directly from the Optum de‐identified Clinformatics DataMart and included age (measured in integer years), sex, race (white versus nonwhite), total household income, and highest household education level. Geographic regions were divided into the 4 United States Census Bureau regions: (Midwest, Northeast, South, and West). The following subject level covariates were also extracted (using [ICD‐9 and ICD‐10] codes): prematurity (gestational age < 37 weeks), genetic syndromes (including Alagille syndrome, CHARGE association, 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, Kabuki syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Williams syndrome, Turner syndrome, Trisomy 21, Trisomy 13, Trisomy 18, cri du chat, VATER association, and Holt‐Oram syndrome), and extracardiac malformations (including cleft palate, cleft lip, esophageal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula, duodenal atresia, anal atresia, biliary atresia, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, intestinal malrotation, gastroschisis, omphalocele, and renal agenesis). ICD‐10 codes were used to identify these covariates starting in October 1, 2015.

Data for the incident hospitalization and for subsequent health care were collected. Total standardized costs were calculated for each inpatient and outpatient visit. Adjustments for inflation were performed by correcting all costs to 2016 United States dollars (US$2016) using the consumer price index for medical care. To account for differences in pricing across health plans and provider contracts, Optum applies standard pricing algorithms to the claims data in the de‐identified Clinformatics DataMart. These algorithms are designed to create standard prices that reflect allowed payments for all provider services across regions. For example, professional service rates are standardized using a resource‐based relative value scale approach with prices standardized at ≈130% of Medicare Fee for Service amounts. Cases with costs listed as ≤ US$0 were excluded. Other component measures of resource utilization that were collected were total hospital LOS for the incident and subsequent hospitalizations, number of hospitalizations and number of cardiac surgeries following initial TOF operative correction, number of cardiac catheterizations, outpatient visits, emergency room visits, ECGs, and echocardiograms. The number of outpatient visits was defined as the sum of cardiac‐specific (defined as primary diagnosis of a cardiology‐related code) and noncardiac visits. Segregating costs during initial and subsequent inpatient admissions between cardiac and noncardiac admissions/services was not possible.

### Fever in pregnancy and the risk of congenital malformations: a cohort study [^d611b462]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Outcome

Denmark has a Civil Registration System where all citizens are registered with a unique 10-digit identification number used in all registries to identify the person. The identification numbers were used to link information from the Danish National Patient Registry, where pregnancy outcomes including information on congenital malformations were identified.

Congenital malformations in live-born children were diagnosed by physicians according to the International Classification of Disease 10th version (ICD-10), and all children diagnosed with ICD-codes Q00.0 to Q99.9 during the first three and a half year of life were identified.

The congenital malformations were divided into categories according to the classification criteria of the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) as seen in Table 3, where the ICD-10 codes are also specified. Isolated minor congenital malformations (n = 1692) were excluded as cases. According to EUROCAT, minor congenital malformations are characterized as malformations with lesser medical, functional or cosmetic importance.

A small group of infants with aneuploidy (n = 36) was not included as cases, as this chromosomal anomaly is a result of errors in mitosis or meiosis happening before conception.

Some of the congenital malformation categories were joined to form a broader group. The ear, face and neck subgroup was pooled with the eye subgroup and the musculo-skeletal- and limb categories were also united. Finally, in addition to the ICD-10 codes defined by EUROCAT, the category "Other" included the subgroups with abdominal malformations and the chromosomal malformations other than aneuploidies.

Children with more than one malformation were included in each appropriate anomaly subgroup, but were only counted once in the "Overall malformations" group.

### Medicaid enrollment and service use among adults with down syndrome [^5df0c271]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Down syndrome is the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability and automatically qualifies individuals for Social Security Insurance. Therefore, Medicaid is the major health insurance provider for a population at high risk for dementia, obesity, and premature mortality. Despite the importance of Medicaid for adults with Down syndrome, little is known about how this population uses Medicaid.

Objective

To describe enrollment in, health care use in, and cost to Medicaid for adults with Down syndrome compared with adults with intellectual disability and a random sample of adults enrolled in Medicaid.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this cohort study, the data are from a claims cohort of adults aged 18 years or older enrolled in Medicaid at any point between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2019. Participants were enrollees with 1 or more inpatient claim or 2 or more other claims with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code or an International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision code for Down syndrome or intellectual disability as well as a random sample of those without developmental disability. Analyses were conducted from June 2022 to February 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Data were linked across 2 data reporting systems. Main outcomes were enrollee demographic characteristics, enrollment characteristics, cost, and service use.

Results

This cohort study included 123 024 individuals with Down syndrome (820 273 person-years of coverage; mean [SD] age, 35 [14.7] years; median age, 33 years [IQR, 21–48 years]; 51.6% men; 14.1% Black individuals; 16.7% Hispanic individuals; and 74.6% White individuals), 1 182 246 individuals with intellectual disability (mean [SD] age, 37.1 [16.8] years; median age, 33 years [IQR, 22–50 years]; 56.5% men; 22.0% Black individuals; 11.7% Hispanic individuals; and 69.5% White individuals), and 3 176 371 individuals with no developmental disabilities (mean [SD] age, 38 [18.6] years; median age, 33 years [IQR, 21–52 years]; 43.8% men; 23.7% Black individuals; 20.7% Hispanic individuals; and 61.3% White individuals). Median enrollment in Medicaid for a person with Down syndrome was 8.0 years (IQR, 5.0–9.0 years; mean [SD], 6.6 [2.6] years). Costs were higher for the Down syndrome group (median, $26 278 per person-year [IQR, $11 145-$55 928 per person-year]) relative to the group with no developmental disabilities (median, $6173 per person-year [IQR, $868-$58 390 per person-year]). Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native American, and Pacific Islander adults with Down syndrome had fewer costs and claims per person-year compared with White adults with Down syndrome.

Conclusion and Relevance

This cohort study of individuals with Down syndrome enrolled in Medicaid found consistent enrollment and high use of health care in a population with high health care needs. Results were similar comparing individuals with Down syndrome and those with intellectual disability, with both groups differing from a sample of Medicaid enrollees with no developmental disabilities. Medicaid data are a useful tool for understanding the health and well-being of individuals with Down syndrome.

### Positive predictive value of, and, codes for identification of congenital heart defects [^5251385b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Differences in coding practices between administrative and clinical databases can lead to differences in case ascertainment and, subsequently, prevalence and outcome estimations. A hierarchal algorithm of 17 CHD subgroups found that the concordance statistic for the code hierarchy alone was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.77–0.80) and improved to 0.89 (95% CI, 0.88–0.90) after age, encounter type, and provider type were included in the algorithm. Therefore, algorithms and hierarchies, accounting for limitations of administrative coding are often applied to restrict a cohort to those individuals most likely to have the condition of interest, at the expense of unintentional exclusion of true cases from the data set.

Because of limitations in administrative data, restrictive case definitions may underestimate patients with CHD; however, unrestrictive case definitions that include the broader code groups 745.xx to 747.xx and Q20.x to Q26.x may overestimate patients with CHD. To understand limitations of and improve the quality of administrative data for CHD surveillance, we evaluated the PPV of select ICD‐9‐CM and ICD‐10‐CM CHD codes in 2 data sources and compared features associated with both true‐positive (TP) and FP cases.

### Risk estimates of recurrent congenital anomalies in the UK: a population-based register study [^3b9363fd]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Identification of recurrent cases

Mothers with recurrent pregnancies affected by congenital anomaly were identified from the NorCAS maternal index number, a unique number given to each new mother when first recorded on the database. The mother's National Health Service (NHS) number (complete from 2003 onwards), name, date of birth, postcode of residence and hospital of delivery, as well as the baby's details were used to cross-validate all recurrent pregnancies and identify duplicate records.

Definitions and classification of congenital anomalies

The NorCAS records text descriptions and WHO ICD-10 codes for up to six individual congenital anomalies per case. These were categorised into group (the organ system affected, e.g. 'cardiovascular'), subtype (the specific condition, e.g. 'coarctation of the aorta') and syndrome (e.g. 'DiGeorge syndrome') based on EUROCAT guidelines. Cases with more than one ICD code were assigned a primary diagnosis using a hierarchical approach with the highest allocated from: (1) chromosomal syndromes (anomalies of chromosomal number or structure, e.g. 'Down syndrome'); (2) genetic syndromes (patterns of anomalies arising from a single gene, e.g. 'DiGeorge syndrome'); (3) skeletal dysplasias (syndromes of skeletal development, e.g. 'osteogenesis imperfecta'); (4) other genetic anomalies (resulting from microdeletions or mutations, e.g. 'neurofibromatosis'); or (5) other syndromes of non-genetic origin (recognised patterns of anomalies, with or without a known cause, e.g. 'Noonan syndrome').

Isolated cases were allocated to their primary anomaly group and subtype. Cases with two or more structural anomalies were reviewed to identify a primary group or subtype or to assign a diagnosis of multiple anomalies (two or more unrelated structural anomalies across separate organs). More details of the classification principles are described elsewhere.

Congenital anomalies occurring in successive pregnancies of the same woman were considered 'similar' if they belonged to the same group (e.g. cardiovascular) or the same syndromic group (e.g. chromosomal syndromes), regardless of the specific subtypes, and 'dissimilar' if they belonged to different groups.

### Severity of anemia during pregnancy and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes [^20f3d377]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Definition of Variables

Exposure

Anemia during pregnancy (not puerperium), including mild anemia (hemoglobin concentration, 100–109 g/L), moderate anemia (hemoglobin concentration, 70–99 g/L), and severe anemia (hemoglobin concentration, < 70 g/L), was identified using the relevant ICD-10 codes (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Pregnant females with a diagnosis of anemia that could not be differentiated by severity with ICD-10 codes were classified separately as having anemia of unknown severity.

Maternal and Fetal Outcomes

The maternal outcomes identified using ICD-9-CM or ICD-10 codes included placental abruption, preterm birth (delivery before 37 weeks' gestation), cesarean delivery, severe postpartum hemorrhage (females with ICD-9-CM or ICD-10 codes of postpartum hemorrhage who were treated with blood transfusion or hysterectomy), shock, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and maternal death during hospital delivery. Fetal outcomes included growth restriction, malformation (congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities diagnosed during hospitalization), and stillbirth (death before or during delivery after 20 weeks of pregnancy) (eTable 4 in the Supplement).

Complications During Pregnancy

Complications during pregnancy for which the time sequence relative to onset of anemia was unknown but that might have been associated with outcomes were identified as confounding variables using ICD-9-CM or ICD-10 codes. These included in vitro fertilization, multiple pregnancies, hypertension disorders, diabetes, thyroid diseases, circulatory diseases, urinary diseases, respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, coagulation disorders, scarred uterus, placenta accreta spectrum, placenta previa, antepartum hemorrhage, intrauterine infection, abnormal amniotic fluid, cervical incompetence, and abnormal placenta.

### Environmental and socioeconomic factors influence the live-born incidence of congenital heart disease: a population-based study in California [^db2f1e36]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure. The California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development maintains a birth cohort database containing live births from the years 2007 to 2012. This database includes detailed information on linked maternal and infant clinical and demographic characteristics derived from hospital discharge records (maternal hospitalization, birth hospitalization, and readmissions) and birth and death certificates from 1 year prior to birth to an infant age of 1 year. The file provides diagnosis and procedure codes based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9‐CM). The same database has been used by our group to report on a variety of neonatal outcomes. 21, 22

Subjects

We included all live‐born infants with gestational ages 22 to 42 completed weeks with valid census tract information (Figure 1). Cases with significant CHD were identified by ICD‐9‐CM diagnostic and procedure codes present in the birth, transfer, or readmission records. Significant CHD was defined as a heart defect requiring or likely to require surgery within the first year of life and included ventricular septal defects with an accompanying procedure code for surgical closure, atrioventricular septal defects, conotruncal defects, transposition of the great arteries, pulmonary atresia/intact ventricular septum, and single ventricle lesions including heterotaxy. A pediatric cardiac intensivist and a pediatric cardiologist (A.M.G. M. A.S.) reviewed all cases according to an a priori framework based on morphogenetically similar developmental mechanisms to ensure correct classification of infants with multiple ICD‐9‐CM codes. 23, 24 All ICD‐9‐CM codes were used to determine the presence and type of CHD. Final diagnosis was reached by consensus. Chromosomal anomalies were defined by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD‐9) code 758 and included abnormalities detected by karyotype as well as pathogenic copy number variants detected by chromosomal microarray. The control group was defined as those without CHD.

### The natural history of pregnancies with a diagnosis of trisomy 18 or trisomy 13; a retrospective case series [^a09ab178]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

While few infants with trisomy 18 survive past one year of life, a review by Cereda et Carey reported that approximately half of affected babies live longer than one week. A study by Baty et al. reported a much greater one-year survival rate of 42% for T18 infants and 38% for T13 infants, however, this study was based on data collected from questionnaires completed by members of S.O.F.T. (Support Organisation for Trisomy 18, 13 and Related Disorders), which may have resulted in non-response bias. The median reported survival time of affected liveborn infants varies between 3 and 15 days for both trisomies. Case reports of T18 and T13 individuals surviving for much longer periods of time have also been published: Petek et al. described a nineteen year old girl with a full T18 karyotype, Smith et al. reported an eleven-year-old with T18, and in a survey by Bruns et al. survival times of 103.3 months were reported by mothers of 13 trisomy 18 newborns who were still alive at the time of participation in the study. Redheendran et al. reported an eleven and a nineteen year old with T13 karyotypes.

The prevalence of both T18 and T13 has increased in recent years. One United Kingdom-based study reported an increase in prevalence from 0.20 to 0.65 per 1,000 births for trisomy 18 and from 0.08 to 0.23 per 1,000 births for trisomy 13 between the years 1985 to 2007. This change has been attributed to increasing maternal age and increased prenatal screening for fetal aneuploidies, which is now recommended for all pregnancies by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. In contrast, in the Republic of Ireland, where our series is based, prenatal screening for fetal aneuploidy is not part of routine antenatal care. There is no national policy on the provision of prenatal screening for aneuploidy. In an Irish study, Lynch and Malone found that while 72% of healthcare professionals surveyed believed that detailed ultrasound scans should be performed for fetal anomaly, only 10% routinely discussed prenatal screening for fetal aneuploidy. This is in spite of findings that more than 73% of Irish pregnant woman would avail of fetal anomaly scans or biochemical testing if it was made available to them.

Sensitivity Analyses

Compared with our main findings, we found similar results when assessing use and spending trends among the (1) 13 measures that did not use any diagnosis codes to classify not wasteful services or used a similar number of ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes to classify not wasteful services, (2) 10 measures with no ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM codes used to classify not wasteful services, and (3) 8 measures that did not use any diagnosis codes for exclusions or for determining whether a service was not wasteful (eTable 2 in the Supplement). The analyses found decreases in use and claim line–level spending and no change in claim-level spending, with the exception that claim-level spending increased for the analysis including 8 measures.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^5e1c6ada]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^cd55411e]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

TABLE 2
Weighted national estimates of frequencies and mean costs of birth defect–associated hospitalizations * among persons aged < 65 years, by selected specific birth defect and age group — National Inpatient Sample, United States, 2019

Abbreviations: CNS = central nervous system; GI = gastrointestinal; ICD-10-CM = International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification; MS = musculoskeletal; USD = U.S. dollars.

* Identified by scanning up to 40 available diagnosis code fields for ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes Q00–Q99: congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities.

† Birth defects categories correspond to blocks of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes: cardiovascular (Q20–Q28), CNS (Q00–Q07), chromosomal (Q90–Q99), cleft lip/palate (Q35–Q37), ear (Q16–Q17), eye (Q10–Q15), GI (Q38–Q45), genitourinary (Q50–Q64), integumentary (Q80–Q85), MS (Q65–Q79), and other syndrome (Q87). "Other defect" includes birth defects of the face and neck (Q18), respiratory system (Q30–Q34), and other congenital malformations (Q86 and Q89). Critical cardiovascular defects were operationalized using the National Birth Defects Prevention Network Congenital Malformations Surveillance Report. The specific defects included are only those defined in the National Birth Defects Prevention Network Congenital Malformations Surveillance Report; birth defects not included here contribute to frequencies and costs aggregated by birth defect category and overall.
