## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an alternative lipid-lowering medication that won't cause cramps in a 68-year-old man with diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, LDL 103 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and TG 157 mg/dL, who developed muscle cramps on atorvastatin 20 mg daily and may be statin-intolerant. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true statin-associated muscle symptoms and excluding secondary causes. Then, I should consider statin-based mitigation strategies before abandoning statins. Next, I will evaluate non-statin options with proven LDL-lowering and outcomes data for statin intolerance. After that, I need to set LDL-C and non–HDL-C targets given his high ASCVD risk and decide on combination therapy if needed. Finally, I will outline safety monitoring, drug–drug interaction checks, and a prioritized, practical treatment recommendation with follow-up timing [^111Rja8b] [^113nJwhd].

> Let me first confirm whether his muscle cramps represent true statin-associated muscle symptoms rather than coincidental myalgias or another myopathy. I should confirm timing relative to statin initiation, distribution of symptoms, and whether symptoms abate on dechallenge and recur on rechallenge; I also need to check CK, TSH, vitamin D, renal and hepatic function, and review interacting drugs and excess grapefruit intake that can raise statin exposure, since many patients with reported SAMS have CK < 4× ULN and modifiable contributors are common [^111Rja8b] [^115D5UNj] [^114g4cT3] [^112KYfmn] [^112wcKPN].

> Wait, let me verify the nocebo effect contribution before I label him statin-intolerant, because blinded and N-of-1 trials show a substantial fraction of muscle symptoms are not pharmacologically caused by statins and many patients tolerate an alternative statin or a different regimen on rechallenge. This affects counseling and increases the chance of keeping a statin on board for outcomes benefit, so I should plan a structured rechallenge if CK is not markedly elevated [^111WJhXw] [^117Fy8kb] [^113nJwhd].

> Next, I should review statin-based strategies as first line if symptoms are mild to moderate and CK is normal or only mildly elevated. Options include lowering the dose of atorvastatin, switching to a different statin with lower CYP3A4 metabolism such as rosuvastatin or pitavastatin, or using low-frequency regimens (alternate-day or twice-weekly) with long half-life agents, which the EAS notes can still lower LDL-C by roughly 12–38% and are tolerated by many previously "intolerant" patients [^111Rja8b] [^111WJhXw].

> Hold on, I should confirm the pharmacologic rationale and expected efficacy if I switch. Rosuvastatin has minimal CYP3A4 metabolism, a long half-life, and at 5–10 mg daily generally produces greater LDL-C reduction than atorvastatin 10 mg; therefore, a small dose or intermittent dosing may achieve meaningful LDL lowering with less muscle exposure, which is clinically useful in SAMS [^113Y9hcm] [^111Rja8b].

> With that in mind, I will now examine a concrete rechallenge plan. A reasonable approach is rosuvastatin 5 mg twice weekly for 6–8 weeks with symptom tracking and a repeat lipid panel; if tolerated, I can cautiously titrate frequency or dose toward the lowest effective regimen. This leverages long half-life kinetics to preserve LDL reduction while minimizing cumulative muscle exposure, consistent with consensus guidance [^111Rja8b].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite careful rechallenge or if CK rises substantially? Then I need to move to non-statin therapy with proven LDL lowering and acceptable tolerability in statin-intolerant patients, prioritizing agents with outcome signals where available and good safety profiles for older adults with diabetes [^116zMyVJ] [^113nJwhd].

> Let me consider ezetimibe first as the standard non-statin option. Mechanistically it inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption, typically lowers LDL-C by about 15–20%, is dosed once daily at 10 mg, and is generally well tolerated; I should remain aware of rare hepatic enzyme elevations and rare myopathy reports, and check LFTs if clinically indicated or if combined with other LLTs [^111yEyfy] [^112vz2JC].

> Next, I should review bempedoic acid because it is activated in the liver but not in skeletal muscle, offering a mechanistic advantage in SAMS. It lowers LDL-C approximately 20% as monotherapy and more when combined with ezetimibe, and has shown favorable tolerability in statin-intolerant populations; I need to monitor uric acid and LFTs and recognize that CLEAR Outcomes was designed to test hard cardiovascular endpoints in this very population [^111i19Vu] [^1132wKbc].

> I will now examine PCSK9 inhibitors as the most potent non-statin option if oral therapy is insufficient or not tolerated. Monoclonal antibodies such as alirocumab or evolocumab reduce LDL-C by about 50–60% and have no known muscle toxicity or significant drug–drug interactions, though they require subcutaneous administration and payer authorization, which can be barriers in practice [^112Wg2FL].

> Let me think about LDL-C targets and when to combine therapies. Given his diabetes, hypertension, and severe obesity, his ASCVD risk is high; aiming for LDL-C < 70 mg/dL is reasonable, and if tolerated statin cannot be used, combination non-statin therapy may be necessary to reach target, such as ezetimibe plus bempedoic acid, which together can achieve roughly 35–45% LDL-C reduction from baseline [^113nJwhd] [^111i19Vu].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost suggested adding fenofibrate or niacin for additional LDL lowering in mixed dyslipidemia, but I should double-check guideline direction here. The 2023 AHA/ACC chronic coronary disease guideline advises against adding niacin or fenofibrate to statin therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk, and contemporary consensus discourages niacin given adverse effects and lack of outcome benefit; so I will avoid these as LDL-lowering adjuncts in this setting and instead favor bile acid sequestrants when triglycerides allow, with the added potential for improved glycemic parameters from colesevelam [^114JiuSr] [^111mbp1D].

> I need to ensure I address the entire lipid profile beyond LDL-C. His non–HDL-C is 133 mg/dL, and given moderate hypertriglyceridemia, I should reinforce weight loss, glycemic optimization, and management of secondary contributors, while prioritizing therapies that lower atherogenic lipoproteins toward non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL as a secondary goal in high-risk patients [^113nJwhd] [^111XGpnH].

> Next, I should review safety monitoring and follow-up. Before changes, I will obtain CK, hepatic panel, renal function, TSH, vitamin D, and document symptom severity; then reassess symptoms at 2–4 weeks, repeat a lipid panel at 6–8 weeks after regimen changes, and recheck LFTs if adding ezetimibe or if clinical concerns arise; for bempedoic acid I will check uric acid and LFTs periodically, while PCSK9 inhibitors do not require routine lab monitoring beyond lipids [^111Rja8b] [^111yEyfy] [^111i19Vu].

> Hold on, I should verify potential drug interactions and exacerbating exposures. I need to review concomitant medications and counsel on avoiding strong CYP3A4 inhibitors like clarithromycin and limiting grapefruit juice with atorvastatin, which can increase myopathy risk; if any macrolide is required, I should temporarily hold or reduce statin exposure or choose a non–CYP3A4 statin if rechallenging later [^115kxvrr] [^112KYfmn] [^112wcKPN].

> Let me reconsider one more common pitfall: recommending coenzyme Q10 for SAMS. The 2018 AHA/ACC guideline advises against routine CoQ10 use for statin-associated symptoms, so I should focus instead on diagnostic clarity, dose adjustment, statin switching, or intermittent dosing, and then non-statin therapy when intolerance is confirmed [^114e7QWE] [^111Rja8b].

> I will now synthesize a patient-specific plan. First, confirm SAMS with CK, TSH, vitamin D, renal and hepatic function, review drugs and diet, and temporarily stop atorvastatin if symptoms are moderate to severe or CK is > 5× ULN; if symptoms are mild with normal CK, proceed to a careful rechallenge using rosuvastatin 5 mg twice weekly for 6–8 weeks with symptom tracking and a follow-up lipid panel, titrating frequency or dose only if tolerated and needed for LDL lowering [^111Rja8b] [^113Y9hcm].

> If intolerance persists on rechallenge, I should initiate ezetimibe 10 mg daily and add bempedoic acid 180 mg daily if LDL-C remains above 70 mg/dL, targeting an expected combined 35–45% LDL reduction that should bring LDL into goal range; I will monitor uric acid and liver enzymes with bempedoic acid and consider bile acid sequestrant addition if further LDL reduction is needed and triglycerides remain acceptable [^111yEyfy] [^111i19Vu] [^111mbp1D].

> If LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL despite oral therapy or if oral agents are not tolerated, I should consider adding a PCSK9 inhibitor after shared decision-making and coverage confirmation, given their robust LDL-lowering potency and neutral muscle safety profile, with periodic lipid testing to document response [^112Wg2FL].

> Finally, I should confirm longitudinal follow-up with reassessment at 2–4 weeks for symptoms and at 6–8 weeks for lipids after any therapeutic change, reinforce weight reduction and glycemic control for additional atherogenic-lipoprotein benefits, and avoid adding fenofibrate, niacin, or over-the-counter omega-3 supplements for cardiovascular risk reduction in this context, as these do not provide incremental outcome benefit here and may add adverse effects [^113nJwhd] [^114JiuSr].

---

In this high-risk, statin-intolerant patient, **ezetimibe 10 mg daily is the preferred next step** because it lowers LDL by ~18–25% with a very low risk of muscle symptoms [^112vz2JC] [^111yEyfy] [^112Wg2FL]; if additional LDL lowering is needed, consider **bempedoic acid 180 mg daily** or a PCSK9 inhibitor, both with low muscle risk, with bempedoic acid providing an extra ~18% LDL reduction and good tolerability in statin-intolerant patients [^111i19Vu] and PCSK9 inhibitors (alirocumab or evolocumab) offering ~50–60% LDL reduction without muscle cramps but being injectable and more costly [^113nJwhd] [^115tCR39]. Avoid fibrates and niacin due to limited LDL benefit and higher adverse effects, and use omega-3s only for triglycerides > 500 mg/dL [^111mbp1D] [^111XGpnH] [^114JiuSr].

## Alternative lipid-lowering medications

### Ezetimibe

- **Mechanism of action**: Inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption, lowering LDL by ~18–25% [^111mbp1D].

- **Efficacy**: Reduces LDL by ~18–25% and is effective in statin-intolerant patients [^111yEyfy].

- **Muscle-related side effects**: Very low risk; suitable for patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms [^111yEyfy].

- **Clinical evidence**: IMPROVE-IT showed cardiovascular benefit when added to statins; effective as monotherapy in statin-intolerant patients [^111mbp1D] [^111yEyfy].

---

### Bempedoic acid

- **Mechanism of action**: Inhibits ATP citrate lyase upstream of HMG-CoA reductase, lowering LDL by ~18% [^1132wKbc].

- **Efficacy**: Reduces LDL by ~18% and is effective in statin-intolerant patients [^111i19Vu].

- **Muscle-related side effects**: Low risk; well tolerated in statin-intolerant patients [^1132wKbc].

- **Clinical evidence**: CLEAR Serenity demonstrated significant LDL reduction and good tolerability in statin-intolerant patients [^111i19Vu].

---

### PCSK9 inhibitors (alirocumab, evolocumab)

- **Mechanism of action**: Monoclonal antibodies that increase LDL receptor recycling, lowering LDL by ~50–60% [^113nJwhd] [^111Rja8b].

- **Efficacy**: Highly effective LDL reduction; suitable for high-risk patients [^112Wg2FL] [^111Rja8b].

- **Muscle-related side effects**: Very low risk; suitable for statin-intolerant patients [^111Rja8b].

- **Clinical evidence**: FOURIER and ODYSSEY OUTCOMES showed significant cardiovascular risk reduction [^115tCR39].

---

### Fibrates (fenofibrate, gemfibrozil)

Fibrates activate PPAR-alpha and **primarily lower triglycerides**, with only modest effects on LDL [^111XGpnH] [^114JiuSr]. Thus, they are used mainly for hypertriglyceridemia [^111XGpnH] [^114JiuSr]. They carry a higher risk of muscle-related adverse effects, especially with statins, and are **not preferred for LDL lowering** in statin-intolerant patients [^113XDyYa] [^114JiuSr].

---

### Niacin

Niacin reduces hepatic VLDL synthesis, lowering LDL and triglycerides [^114JiuSr]. However, **LDL reduction is modest** and cardiovascular benefit is limited [^111mbp1D] [^114JiuSr]. Adverse effects include flushing, hepatotoxicity, and insulin resistance; therefore, it is not preferred in statin-intolerant patients [^114JiuSr].

---

### Omega-3 fatty acids

Omega-3 fatty acids reduce hepatic triglyceride synthesis with minimal effect on LDL [^111XGpnH] [^114JiuSr]. They are **primarily used for hypertriglyceridemia** [^114JiuSr]. Muscle-related adverse effects are minimal, and these agents are generally well tolerated [^114JiuSr] [^111XGpnH].

---

## Recommended alternative therapy for the patient

Given the patient's profile and statin-associated muscle cramps, a stepwise approach is recommended, beginning with **ezetimibe 10 mg daily as first-line** for its efficacy, safety, and low muscle risk [^111yEyfy] [^111mbp1D]. If additional LDL lowering is needed, add bempedoic acid 180 mg daily, which also has low muscle risk [^111i19Vu]. If LDL targets remain unmet or cardiovascular risk is very high, consider PCSK9 inhibitors; they are highly effective with low muscle risk [^113nJwhd] [^111Rja8b].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor a **lipid panel** 4–12 weeks after therapy changes and then every 3–12 months [^113nJwhd]. Assess for recurrent muscle symptoms and reassess therapy if they recur. Check liver enzymes periodically, especially when using ezetimibe or bempedoic acid [^111yEyfy].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Emphasize Mediterranean or DASH dietary patterns, target at least 5–10% weight loss, and encourage **at least 150 minutes per week** of moderate exercise [^111XGpnH].

---

Ezetimibe is the **preferred alternative** for this patient due to its efficacy and low muscle risk; bempedoic acid or PCSK9 inhibitors can be added if needed [^111mbp1D] [^113nJwhd].

Therapy for patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms

Statin-based therapies are recommended for managing statin-associated muscle symptoms. If symptoms or creatine kinase (CK) abnormalities resolve after discontinuing statin therapy, either resuming treatment with the same statin at a lower dose or switching to an alternative statin should be considered. If tolerated, doses can be increased to achieve the LDL-C goal or the maximum LDL-C reduction possible with minimal muscle complaints.

- **Alternative dosing strategies**: If the above strategies are not tolerated, consider alternate day or twice-weekly dosing to achieve the LDL-C goal. Despite methodological limitations in studies (such as small size, retrospective nature, open-label design, or non-randomized design), it has been shown that alternate day or twice-weekly dosing strategies can reduce LDL-C by 12–38% and, importantly, are tolerated by approximately 70% of previously intolerant patients.

Generally, lower doses of high-intensity statins with a long half-life, such as atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin, are more appropriate.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Risks associated with combination treatment with a statin, fenofibrate, or other LDL-C lowering therapies. Refer to the prescribing information of these products for a description of their risks, including but not limited to the warnings and precautions.

- **Liver enzyme abnormalities and monitoring**: Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with the use of Zetia. Perform liver enzyme testing as clinically indicated and consider withdrawal of Zetia if increases in ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN persist.

- **Skeletal muscle effects (e.g. myopathy and rhabdomyolysis)**: Zetia may cause myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. In post-marketing reports, most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin or other agents known to be associated with an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibrates. If myopathy is suspected, discontinue Zetia and other concomitant medications as appropriate.

- **Risks associated with combination treatment with a statin, fenofibrate, or other LDL-C lowering therapies**: If Zetia is administered with a statin, fenofibrate, or other LDL-C lowering therapies, refer to the prescribing information of these products for a description of their risks, including but not limited to the warnings and precautions. See contraindications.

### Lipid-lowering agents in solid organ transplant recipients [^112Wg2FL]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

The first-line lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) in post-transplant patients is statins. Evidence shows that statins improve survival rates, reduce the incidence of graft rejection, and decrease the risk of primary graft dysfunction. In heart transplant (HTx) recipients, statins reduce the risk of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), and in kidney transplant (KTx) recipients, they lower the risk of interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA). In lung transplant (LTx) recipients, the use of statins may be associated with a decreased risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients may also be treated with ezetimibe. Limited data are available on the use of monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 (alirocumab, evolocumab), inclisiran, and lipoprotein apheresis.

Adherence to statin treatment remains an obstacle in achieving LDL-C goals. In the general population, only 20% of statin users continue the drug after one year. The main causes are statin-related adverse effects, particularly statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) and the elevation of liver enzymes. In SOT recipients, concerns related to the adjustment of immunosuppressants (IS) to avoid acute graft rejection, common polypharmacy, and drug-drug interactions with IS medications further impact statin use. Therefore, combination therapy with statin and ezetimibe, as well as novel agents like PCSK9 modulators, can provide safe and efficient LDL-C reduction. Long-term administration of parenteral evolocumab, alirocumab, and inclisiran can safely reduce LDL-C by 49–59%. Moreover, these medications have no pharmacokinetic interference with IS.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance [^111i19Vu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The CLEAR Serenity trial enrolled patients with either a primary or secondary indication for lipid-lowering therapy, which, if not for demonstrated intolerance, would typically include a statin. The high baseline mean LDL-C, frequent absence of any lipid-lowering therapy at baseline, and marked prevalence of cardiometabolic comorbidities reflect both the high cardiovascular risk of this population and the paucity of treatment options for these patients. The CLEAR Serenity study is notable for the large proportion of women, a group that is often underrepresented in clinical trials of pharmaceutical agents for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The greater percentage of women versus men in the study may be related to the observed increased risk for statin intolerance among women. Overall, the enrollment criteria of the study allowed for assessing bempedoic acid in the diversity of patients and background therapies encountered in clinical practice.

The efficacy and safety data presented herein must be interpreted with an understanding of the study's limitations, such as its comparatively short duration of 24 weeks. The durability of effect and safety of extended bempedoic acid use is currently being evaluated in a long-term, open-label extension study, during which all patients will receive bempedoic acid for up to 78 weeks.

The results from the CLEAR Serenity study demonstrate that bempedoic acid significantly reduces LDL-C and hsCRP in patients with statin intolerance, regardless of baseline LDL-C or concomitant lipid-lowering therapy.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^112vz2JC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ezetimibe was evaluated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trials involving 1719 patients with primary hyperlipidemia. The results showed that ezetimibe significantly lowered total cholesterol (-13%), LDL-C (-19%), Apo B (-14%), and triglycerides (-8%), while also increasing HDL-C (+3%) compared to placebo. These reductions in LDL-C were consistent across different ages, sexes, and baseline LDL-C levels.

For simvastatin, the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Trial and the Heart Protection Trial, which were large, placebo-controlled clinical trials, assessed the effects of simvastatin on patients at high risk of coronary events. This group included individuals with existing coronary heart disease, diabetes, peripheral vessel disease, and a history of stroke or other cerebrovascular diseases. Simvastatin was shown to effectively reduce the risk of total mortality by lowering coronary heart disease deaths, decrease the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarctions and strokes, and reduce the need for both coronary and non-coronary revascularization procedures.

No incremental benefit in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of the combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin over and above that demonstrated for simvastatin alone has been established.

- **Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) in pediatric patients**: The effects of ezetimibe co-administered with simvastatin (n = 126) compared to simvastatin monotherapy (n = 122) were evaluated in males and females with HeFH. This study was a multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial followed by an open-label phase that included 142 males and 106 postmenarchal females aged 10 to 17 years (mean age 14.2 years, 43% females, 82% White, 4% Asian, 2% Black or African American, 13% multiracial).

### Lipid profiles in patients with ulcerative colitis receiving tofacitinib-implications for cardiovascular risk and patient management [^11671hZK]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Evidence for effects of statin therapy in patients with IBD: Although there are no randomized clinical trials examining the impact of LDL-lowering with statin therapy in patients with IBD, LDL-lowering in the general population (irrespective of comorbidities) has been associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes. Atorvastatin 10 mg once daily concomitant with tofacitinib 10 mg BID has been investigated in a 12-week, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The study demonstrated rapid and significant reductions in LDL-c, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B with administration of atorvastatin at week 6 for 6 weeks, supporting the use of statin therapy as a feasible and well-tolerated approach to reducing global cardiovascular risk in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, further studies are needed to determine how lipid-lowering therapy should be used when stopping or interrupting tofacitinib treatment. In addition, it remains unclear what impact the lowering of lipid levels with statins has on cardiovascular risk over time in patients with IBD. The antiatherogenic effect of statins is also mediated through nonlipid mechanisms, including direct effects in the vascular wall that have an impact on endothelial function, vascular inflammation, smooth muscle cells, and plaque stability. Endothelial dysfunction, which occurs in the early, subclinical phase of atherosclerosis, has been identified in patients with UC regardless of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for dyslipidemia, specifically in monitoring for adverse effects of statins, the 2019 guidelines from AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA recommend avoiding routine use of coenzyme Q10 in patients treated with statins or for the treatment of statin-associated muscle symptoms.

### Optimizing cholesterol treatment in patients with muscle complaints [^116uPHLm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Statins are highly effective for preventing cardiovascular events by reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, many patients taking statins report muscle-related symptoms that prevent the use of guideline-recommended doses. Patients with reported intolerance to statins have a high risk of cardiovascular events. Clinical strategies that optimize cardiovascular risk reduction through LDL-C lowering need to be applied in patients experiencing intolerable side effects that they attribute to statins. In this paper, the authors review definitions of statin intolerance, propose algorithms to better define statin intolerance, and describe approaches to optimize cardiovascular risk reduction among individuals reporting statin-associated muscle symptoms.

### Statin use and myopathy. Not always guilty [^112TYvdE]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Statins are the cornerstone of the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease but have been associated with muscular side effects, among others. If patients are not properly evaluated, statin discontinuation may take place, leaving patients' symptoms unresolved and precluding effective cardiovascular treatment. This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics, diagnostic process, and final diagnosis of selected patients with suspected statin-induced myopathy, noting the differing alternative diagnoses.

- **Methods**: Among the 86 patients referred to our unit for evaluation since 2012, 6 patients with suspected statin-induced myopathy that was finally ruled out were selected for their illustrative value. All patients were evaluated in a Muscular Diseases Unit by myology experts, and additional testing was performed according to clinical suspicion.

- **Results**: Of the six selected patients with suspected statin-induced myopathy, three had a neurogenic etiology, two had vacuolar myopathies, and one had severe hypothyroidism. Statins were permanently discontinued in two cases, with one of these patients continuing treatment with a protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor.

- **Conclusion**: Not all patients taking statins who develop muscle complaints have statin-related myopathy. A thorough clinical evaluation and appropriate testing are warranted to avoid an unnecessary increase in cardiovascular risk.

### Efficacy of ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 and 10/40 mg compared with atorvastatin 20 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112YoEGn]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2007). High credibility.

This randomized, double-blind study evaluated the efficacy of switching from atorvastatin (ATV) 10 mg to ezetimibe/simvastatin (EZE/SIMVA) 10/20 mg, EZE/SIMVA 10/40 mg, or doubling the dose of ATV from 10 to 20 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

- **Methods**: Eligible patients had haemoglobin A(1C) and were aged 18 years or older. They had been on ATV 10 mg for at least 6 weeks before study entry. After a 4-week open-label ATV 10 mg run-in, patients were randomized to receive EZE/SIMVA 10/20 mg (n = 220), EZE/SIMVA 10/40 mg (n = 222), or ATV 20 mg (n = 219) daily for 6 weeks.

- **Results**: Greater (p ≤ 0.001) reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), the primary endpoint, were achieved by switching to EZE/SIMVA 10/20 mg (26.2%) or 10/40 mg (30.1%) than by doubling the dose of ATV to 20 mg (8.5%). EZE/SIMVA 10/20 mg and 10/40 mg also produced greater (p ≤ 0.001) reductions in total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and apolipoprotein B relative to ATV 20 mg. A reduction (p ≤ 0.050) in C-reactive protein was observed with EZE/SIMVA 10/40 mg vs. ATV 20 mg. Similar reductions in triglycerides were observed across the three groups, and none of the treatments produced a significant change in HDL-C. A greater (p ≤ 0.001) proportion of patients achieved LDL-C < 2.5 mmol/l with EZE/SIMVA 10/20 mg (90.5%) and 10/40 mg (87.0%) than with ATV 20 mg (70.4%). Both EZE/SIMVA doses were generally well tolerated, with an overall safety profile similar to ATV 20 mg.

- **Conclusions**: EZE/SIMVA 10/20 mg and 10/40 mg provided greater lipid-altering efficacy.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^111WJhXw]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Some of the muscle symptoms reported with statins may be due to a nocebo effect, suggested by the findings of N-of-1 statin trials and by the lack of a signal for statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) in blinded trials. Furthermore, most patients who are intolerant to one statin can successfully be switched to another statin.

Management of SAMS starts with a conversation with the individual patient about the indication for statin treatment and the expected benefit of continued therapy. Preference for continued statin therapy over alternatives should be stressed. For those patients with SAMS and elevation in creatine kinase (CK) 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) at initial assessment, options include rechallenge of the original statin at a lower dose, trial of a lower intensity statin (i.e. fluvastatin, pravastatin), or trial of a high-intensity statin with a longer half-life (i.e. rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin) with a modified dosing regimen (i.e. alternate days, once, twice, or three times weekly). Of the available statins, simvastatin may be most associated with SAMS, and fluvastatin the least.

### Effects of atorvastatin versus fenofibrate on lipoprotein profiles, low-density lipoprotein subfraction distribution, and hemorheologic parameters in type 2 diabetes mellitus with mixed hyperlipoproteinemia [^114KiEsE]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Diabetic dyslipoproteinemia, characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and often elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol with a predominance of small, dense LDL, is a strong risk factor for atherosclerosis. It is unclear whether fibrate or statin therapy is more effective in these patients. We compared atorvastatin (10 mg/day) with fenofibrate (200 mg/day), each for 6 weeks separated by a 6-week washout period, in 13 patients (5 men and 8 women; mean age 60.0 ± 6.8 years; body mass index 30.0 ± 3.0 kg/m²) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c 7.3 ± 1.1%) and mixed hyperlipoproteinemia (LDL cholesterol 164.0 ± 37.8 mg/dl, triglycerides 259.7 ± 107 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 48.7 ± 11.0 mg/dl) using a randomized, crossover design.

Lipid profiles, LDL subfraction distribution, fasting plasma viscosity, red cell aggregation, and fibrinogen concentrations were determined before and after each drug. Atorvastatin decreased all LDL subfractions (LDL cholesterol, -29%; p < 0.01) including small, dense LDL. Fenofibrate predominantly decreased triglyceride concentrations (triglycerides, -39%; p < 0.005) and induced a shift in LDL subtype distribution from small, dense LDL (-31%) to intermediate-dense LDL (+36%). The concentration of small, dense LDL was comparable during therapy with both drugs (atorvastatin 62.8 ± 19.5 mg/dl, fenofibrate 63.0 ± 18.1 mg/dl). Both drugs induced an increase in HDL cholesterol (atorvastatin +10%, p < 0.05; fenofibrate +11%, p = 0.06). Additionally, fenofibrate decreased fibrinogen concentration (-15%, p < 0.05).

### Statin therapy as primary prevention in exercising adults: Best evidence for avoiding myalgia [^111Btzk9]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This review aims to determine whether active adults who begin statins and develop myalgia reduce or stop activity to become less symptomatic. If this occurs, strategies to mitigate symptoms are explored. Should these strategies fail, the question of whether exercise is an adequate alternative to statin therapy is addressed.

- **Methods**: PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Database were searched with keywords designed to retrieve information on statin myopathy in exercising adults.

- **Results**: Statins are well tolerated by most people who exercise; however, caution is warranted in those who exercise at high levels, in the elderly, and in those receiving high-dose therapy. Several strategies improve statin tolerance while maintaining exercise levels, based on low-quality evidence. If statins are not tolerated, a continuing physical activity program can provide equivalent or superior cardiometabolic protection.

- **Conclusions**: Statins may occasionally present a barrier to physical activity. A number of strategies exist that can reduce the risk of myopathy. If a choice between exercise and statins becomes necessary, exercise provides equal benefit in terms of cardiovascular protection and superior mortality reduction, with improved quality of life.

### Dose-dependent action of atorvastatin in type IIB hyperlipidemia: preferential and progressive reduction of atherogenic apoB-containing lipoprotein subclasses (VLDL-2, IDL, small dense LDL) and stimulation of cellular cholesterol efflux [^117Dyoaw]. Atherosclerosis (2002). Low credibility.

Type IIB hyperlipidemia is associated with premature vascular disease and is characterized by an atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype. This phenotype includes elevated levels of triglyceride-rich VLDL and small dense LDL, along with subnormal levels of HDL. The effects of a potent HMGCoA reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, were evaluated at daily doses of 10 and 40 mg. This evaluation focused on the triglyceride-rich lipoprotein subclasses (VLDL-1, VLDL-2, and IDL), major LDL subclasses (light LDL, LDL-1+LDL-2, D: 1.019–1.029 g/ml; intermediate LDL, LDL-3, D: 1.029–1.039 g/ml; small dense LDL, LDL-4+LDL-5, D: 1.039–1.063 g/ml), CETP-mediated cholesteryl ester transfer from HDL to apoB-containing lipoproteins, phospholipid transfer protein activity, and plasma-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux in patients with type IIB hyperlipidemia.

Plasma concentrations of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein subclasses (TRL: VLDL-1, Sf 60–400; VLDL-2, Sf 20–60; and IDL, Sf 12–20) and LDL (D: 1.019–1.063 g/ml) significantly decreased after six weeks of statin treatment at 10 mg per day (-31 and -36%, respectively; P < 0.002) and by 42 and 51%, respectively at the 40 mg per day dose. Increasing doses of atorvastatin progressively normalized both the quantitative and qualitative features of the LDL subclass profile, where dense LDL predominated at baseline. Notably, dense LDL levels were reduced by up to 57% at the 40-mg dose, resulting in a shift in the peak of the density profile towards larger, buoyant LDL particles typical of normolipidemic subjects.

### Lipitor [^116Ge4dF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of Lipitor on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94% White, 2% Black, 2% South Asian, 1% other; 68% male), aged 40–75 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria. These subjects had no prior history of cardiovascular disease and had LDL ≤ 160 mg/dL and triglycerides (TG) ≤ 600 mg/dL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had one or more of the following risk factors: smoking (23%), hypertension (80%), retinopathy (30%), microalbuminuria (9%), or macroalbuminuria (3%). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the trial.

In this multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either Lipitor 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 1:1 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events: myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to the first occurrence of the primary endpoint.

Baseline characteristics of subjects were as follows: mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c of 7.7%, median LDL-C of 120 mg/dL, median total cholesterol (TC) of 207 mg/dL, median TG of 151 mg/dL, and median HDL-C of 52 mg/dL.

### Efficacy and safety of atorvastatin in hyperlipidemic, type 2 diabetic patients. A 34-week, multicenter, open-label study [^113dAuFd]. Atherosclerosis (2000). Low credibility.

Hyperlipidemia is common in type 2 diabetic patients and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily atorvastatin 10–80 mg for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in type 2 diabetics with plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels exceeding 3.4 mmol/l (130 mg/dl). One hundred and two patients met the study criteria and received 10 mg/day atorvastatin. Patients who reached the target LDL-C level of ≤ 2.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl) maintained the same dosage regimen until they had completed 16 weeks of treatment. Patients not reaching the target LDL-C underwent dose titration to atorvastatin 20, 40, and 80 mg/day at Weeks 4, 8, and 12, respectively. All 88 patients who completed the study attained target LDL-C levels, and 52 (59%) of patients achieved the target goal at the starting dose of atorvastatin 10 mg/day. In this group, the differences between baseline and post-treatment values for LDL-C were 4.3 ± 0.7 mmol/l (166 ± 26 mg/dl) versus 2.2 ± 0.4 mmol/l (87 ± 14 mg/dl) (P < 0.0001), respectively, a decrease of 47%. Similar trends were observed for total cholesterol, triglycerides, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels. The safety profile of atorvastatin in these patients was highly favorable and similar to those reported with other statins. Only one patient withdrew due to a possible drug-related adverse event. These data confirm the marked efficacy and safety of atorvastatin in type 2 diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: An individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^115WPayZ]. Lancet (2022). Low credibility.

Methods

- **Search strategy and selection criteria**: Methods and analyses were prespecified. Briefly, all trials of statin therapy with more than 1000 participants and a scheduled mean follow-up of 2 years or more were eligible if they involved a double-blind comparison of statin versus placebo or of more intensive versus less intensive statin regimens. Statin intensity (relative reduction in LDL cholesterol from baseline) for each statin regimen was defined according to the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology guidelines, with a low intensity classified as a less than 30% LDL cholesterol reduction, moderate intensity as a 30 to less than 50% reduction, and high intensity as a 50% or more reduction (appendix p 6). The main results were estimated separately for less intensive, moderate-intensity, and more intensive statin regimens. Analyses involved only unconfounded trials (i.e. those in which there were no protocol-mandated differences between randomly assigned groups other than those created by the random allocations). We requested individual participant data on all adverse events, including the timing of such events, the timing of and reasons for stopping study treatment, non-trial statin use, use of other (non-trial) medications, comorbidities, and laboratory results (including creatine kinase for those regarding muscle; appendix p 2). Data on the exclusion criteria of potential relevance to previous intolerance to a statin are shown in the appendix (p 3). Ethics approval was granted by the UK National Health Service Health Research Authority (21/SC/00).

### Current overview of statin-induced myopathy [^115AZV5z]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Statins are an efficacious and well-tolerated class of lipid-altering agents that have been shown to reduce the risk of initial and recurrent cardiovascular events. However, cerivastatin was withdrawn from the world market because of its potential for severe myotoxic effects. Since the benefits of statin treatment outweigh the small risk of adverse events, statins remain the first-line therapy for lipid lowering and preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.

The risk of myopathy may be minimized with the appropriate choice of agent and by identifying patients at risk of myotoxic effects. Elderly or female patients, or those with concomitant medications or impaired metabolic processes, may be at increased risk and should be monitored closely. The risk of myopathy may also be inferred from the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties of the statin used.

Since myotoxic events are more frequent at higher doses, statins that are effective in reducing cholesterol levels and helping patients reach target levels at start doses may be useful. The lipophilicity of a statin and its potential for drug-drug interactions may also help determine the likelihood of muscular effects. Drug-drug interactions may be avoided by selecting a statin that does not share the same metabolic pathway.

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^112KYfmn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Avoid drinking more than 1.2 liters of grapefruit juice each day while taking amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets.

- **Possible side effects of amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets**: These tablets can cause serious side effects including muscle pain, tenderness, and weakness (myopathy). Muscle problems, including muscle breakdown, can be severe and, rarely, cause kidney damage that can lead to death.

	- **Your chances of experiencing muscle problems are higher if you have**:
		- Unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, especially if accompanied by a fever or increased fatigue while taking amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets.
		- Muscle problems that do not resolve after stopping the tablets. Your doctor may conduct further tests to diagnose the cause.
		- Concurrent use of certain other medicines.
		- Consumption of large amounts of grapefruit juice.
		- Age of 65 years or older.
		- Uncontrolled thyroid problems (hypothyroidism).
		- Kidney problems.
		- Higher doses of amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets.

- **Liver problems**: Your healthcare provider should perform blood tests to check your liver before you start taking these tablets and if you exhibit symptoms of liver problems while on the medication. Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience symptoms such as feeling tired or weak, nausea or vomiting, or loss of appetite.

### Statin myopathy: An update [^111QZ7hZ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Statin therapy has become the mainstay of treatment for lipid lowering, demonstrating cardiovascular risk reduction. Statin popularity has led to misconceptions and fears of untoward side effects on muscle. This review clarifies the terminology relating to statin-related muscle disease, explores potential pathogenic mechanisms, reviews estimates of statin myopathy prevalence, and examines diagnosis and management.

The fundamental mechanism of statin myopathy remains elusive but is believed to be a class effect. The most common explanation for toxic muscle injury involves the deficiency of one of three main synthetic products in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase pathway. Recent studies have revealed several patients with statin-induced rhabdomyolysis who also have metabolic muscle defects, indicating that statin use may unmask presymptomatic metabolic myopathies. Although statin-related myotoxicity is believed to be a noninflammatory, toxic myopathy, experimental evidence suggests it may be triggered by an autoimmune reaction or, conversely, initiate an autoimmune process. The precise mechanism is uncertain.

Statins are generally safe and well-tolerated agents with an excellent risk-benefit profile. The etiology and pathogenesis of statin myopathy are poorly understood due to its relative rarity.

### Contemporary national patterns of eligibility and use of novel lipid-lowering therapies in the United States [^115tCR39]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Using the aforementioned eligibility criteria, we simulated eligibility populations for PCSK9i and IPE using the following two approaches:

1. **Assuming existing lipid-lowering therapy as the maximum tolerated before determining eligibility for novel therapies**: This approach involves assessing patients based on their current lipid-lowering therapy levels to determine if they qualify for novel therapies.

2. **Assessing eligibility after assuming initiation and maximal escalation of preexisting lipid-lowering therapies (i.e. statin and ezetimibe)**: This analysis accounts for their predicted lipid-lowering effects, using distributions of lipid profile changes extrapolated from previously published data. These assessments were designed to address the underuse of existing agents in patients with indications for their use and the recommendation that baseline lipid-lowering therapy be maximized before the use of novel agents.

In modeling the second approach for simulating eligibility for PCSK9i, we assumed a stepwise escalation of lipid-lowering therapy for those who were not already optimized on therapy. This involved adding or escalating statin therapy, then adding ezetimibe, and accounting for the predicted LDL-C lowering effects. In determining the simulated eligibility for IPE, we assumed maximal escalation of statin therapy and accounted for the predicted triglyceride-lowering and HDL-C increasing effects. These simulations were based on previously published distributions of lipid changes with varying statin intensities and ezetimibe. We assumed full toleration of the maximum dose of each agent without adverse effects.

### Biaxin [^115kxvrr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012).

- **HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors**: Concomitant use of clarithromycin with lovastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). As with other macrolides, clarithromycin has been reported to increase concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking these drugs concomitantly. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of myopathy.

Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have also been reported in patients taking atorvastatin or rosuvastatin concomitantly with clarithromycin. When used with clarithromycin, atorvastatin or rosuvastatin should be administered in the lowest possible doses. Adjustment of the statin dose or use of a statin that is not dependent on CYP3A metabolism (e.g. fluvastatin or pravastatin) should be considered.

### Cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibition by TA-8995 in patients with mild dyslipidaemia (TULIP): A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial [^112rxaPL]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

Dyslipidaemia remains a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and additional lipid-modifying treatments are warranted to further decrease the cardiovascular disease burden. We assessed the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a novel cholesterol esterase transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor, TA-8995, in patients with mild dyslipidaemia.

- **Methods**: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2 trial, we recruited patients (aged 18–75 years) from 17 sites in the Netherlands and Denmark, including hospitals and independent clinical research organisations. Eligible participants had fasting LDL cholesterol levels between 2.5 mmol/L and 4.5 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol levels between 0.8 and 1.8 mmol/L, and triglyceride levels below 4.5 mmol/L after washout of lipid-lowering treatments. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) by a computer-generated randomisation schedule to receive one of the following nine treatments: a once-a-day dose of 1 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg TA-8995 or matching placebo; 10 mg TA-8995 plus 20 mg atorvastatin; 10 mg TA-8995 plus 10 mg rosuvastatin; or 20 mg atorvastatin or 10 mg rosuvastatin alone. Statins were overencapsulated to achieve masking. The primary outcome was the percentage change in LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol from baseline at week 12, analysed by intention to treat.

- **Findings**: Between Aug 15, 2013, and Jan 10, 2014, 364 patients were enrolled. At week 12, LDL cholesterol levels were reduced by 27.4% in patients assigned to the 1 mg dose, 32.7% in patients given…

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^1173JFv5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets combine two drugs: a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (atorvastatin). The amlodipine component inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. The atorvastatin component is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol.

- **Amlodipine**: Amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle depend on the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine selectively inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro; however, such effects have not been observed in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Amlodipine does not affect serum calcium concentration. It is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle, causing a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and lowering blood pressure.

The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated, but are thought to include the following: Exertional angina. In patients with e

### Use of the thyroid hormone analogue eprotirome in statin-treated dyslipidemia [^1166Vxbp]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). High credibility.

Dyslipidemia increases the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and is incompletely reversed by statin therapy alone in many patients. Thyroid hormone lowers levels of serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and has other potentially favorable actions on lipoprotein metabolism. Consequently, thyromimetic drugs hold promise as lipid-lowering agents if adverse effects can be avoided.

- **Methods**: We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the thyromimetic compound eprotirome (KB2115) in lowering the level of serum LDL cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia who were already receiving simvastatin or atorvastatin. In addition to statin treatment, patients received either eprotirome (at a dose of 25, 50, or 100 micrograms per day) or placebo. Secondary outcomes were changes in levels of serum apolipoprotein B, triglycerides, and Lp(a) lipoprotein. Patients were monitored for potential adverse thyromimetic effects on the heart, bone, and pituitary.

- **Results**: The addition of placebo or eprotirome at a dose of 25, 50, or 100 micrograms daily to statin treatment for 12 weeks reduced the mean level of serum LDL cholesterol from 141 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter) to 127, 113, 99, and 94 mg per deciliter (3.3, 2.9, 2.6, and 2.4 mmol per liter), respectively, (mean reduction from baseline: 7%, 22%, 28%, and 32%). Similar reductions were seen in levels of serum apolipoprotein B, triglycerides, and Lp(a) lipoprotein. Eprotirome therapy was not associated with adverse effects on the heart, bone, and pituitary.

### Simvastatin [^116JH3Zp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The Heart Protection Study (Study HPS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center study with a mean duration of 5 years. It included 10,269 patients on simvastatin tablets 40 mg and 10,267 on placebo. Patients had a mean age of 64 years (ranging from 40 to 80 years old), and 97% were white. These patients were at high risk of developing a major coronary event due to existing coronary heart disease (65%), diabetes (Type 2: 26%; Type 1: 3%), history of stroke or other cerebrovascular disease (16%), peripheral vascular disease (33%), or hypertension in males aged ≥ 65 years (6%).

At baseline:

- 3,421 patients (17%) had LDL-C levels below 100 mg/dL, including 953 (5%) below 80 mg/dL; and
- 10,047 patients (49%) had levels greater than 130 mg/dL.

Patients were randomized to receive simvastatin tablets or placebo using a covariate adaptive method, which considered the distribution of 10 important baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled.

The Study HPS results showed that simvastatin tablets 40 mg/day significantly reduced total and CHD mortality, as well as non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization procedures (coronary and non-coronary).

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: Impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^115D5UNj]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Once secondary causes and predisposing factors have been excluded, this EAS Consensus Panel recommends a review of the need for ongoing statin therapy.

- **Management of statin-associated muscle symptoms**: Ensure that there is an indication for statin use and that the patient is fully aware of the expected benefit in cardiovascular disease risk reduction that can be achieved with this treatment. Ensure that there are no contraindications to statin use. Counsel patients regarding the risk of 'side effects' and the high probability that these can be dealt with successfully. Emphasize dietary and other lifestyle measures. Use statin-based strategies preferentially, notwithstanding the presence of statin-attributed muscle-related symptoms. If re-challenge does not work, use a low or intermittent dosing, preferably of a different (potent or efficacious) statin. Use non-statin therapies as adjuncts as needed to achieve the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal. Do not recommend supplements to alleviate muscle symptoms, as there is no good evidence to support their use.

- **Patients with muscle symptoms and serum creatine kinase < 4× upper limit of normal**: The majority of patients who complain of muscle symptoms have normal or mildly/moderately elevated CK levels (< 4× ULN). For patients at low CVD risk, their need for a statin should be reassessed, and the benefits of therapeutic lifestyle changes, such as cessation of cigarettes, should be considered.

### Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and relevance to different types of muscle symptom [^114g4cT3]. European Heart Journal (2020). Low credibility.

A better understanding of factors affecting the risk of myopathy due to statin therapy could help guide safer prescribing in people at higher risk of it (e.g. use of lower doses of more potent statins, perhaps in combination with other LDL-lowering agents) and support more regular monitoring strategies for those in higher-risk groups. When patients do report muscle-related symptoms, measurement of CK levels (particularly during the first year of therapy or after an increase in dose or the addition of interacting medications) is warranted not only to detect the rare cases of myopathy but also to identify individuals with moderately elevated levels who may be more likely to develop myopathy.

In addition, the much larger number of patients who do not have elevated CK levels can be reassured that their symptoms are not likely to be a pharmacologic consequence of their statin treatment; therefore, they should not stop their statin therapy and put themselves at increased risk of a heart attack or a stroke.

### Overcoming challenges with statin therapy [^116Ny64g]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The truly causal adverse effects of statins are likely related to the efficacy of HMG‐CoA reductase inhibition, making them entirely attributable to the intensity of statin therapy. Switching statins probably will not help reduce adverse effects unless weaker statins or lower doses are used. A useful approach may include alternate‐day low‐dose statins in combination with ezetimibe. This is illustrated in a case report.

### A new statin: A new standard [^117DWGra]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that treatments designed to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events in both primary and secondary prevention settings. The rationale for aggressively lowering LDL-C, supported by large observational studies, is based on the concept that no threshold exists below which reductions fail to provide additional benefit. Statins are widely considered first-line therapy for preventing CHD events because they yield the greatest reductions in LDL-C. However, many patients do not achieve target LDL-C levels with currently available statins.

Newer, more effective statins may extend the benefits of aggressive LDL-C reduction to larger patient populations. A novel, highly efficacious statin, rosuvastatin (Crestor, AstraZeneca group of companies), is currently undergoing clinical investigation. Dose-ranging studies in hypercholesterolemic patients have shown that rosuvastatin produces significant, dose-dependent decreases in LDL-C when compared with placebo, ranging from a 34% reduction at a dose of 1 mg/day to a 65% reduction at 80 mg/day. This agent has been well tolerated across the range of doses studied.

Phase III studies indicate that rosuvastatin is more effective than atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin in improving atherogenic lipid profiles in hypercholesterolemic patients, and more effective than atorvastatin in improving lipid profiles in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Overall, these findings suggest promising implications for rosuvastatin's role in lipid management.

### Lypqozet [^112gu9Xa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Myopathy/rhabdomyolysis**: Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with atorvastatin and other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects.

	- Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values more than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs, such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors), increases the risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis.

	- Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever, or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets. Ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.

	- The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with the concomitant administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C antiviral agents telaprevir, a combination of elbasvir plus grazoprevir, and combinations of HIV protease inhibitors.

### Approach to the patient who is intolerant of statin therapy [^114nQ5Aa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Myopathy occurs in approximately 10% of statin-treated patients and is most commonly manifested by myalgias with or without plasma creatine kinase (CK) elevations. Predisposition exists in patients treated with high doses of potent statins and those who are older, female, have a genetic predisposition, and when statins are coadministered with drugs that compete with or inhibit drug metabolism. In symptomatic patients, CK levels may assist in guiding management. If less than five times the upper limit of normal, the existing statin should be titrated to achieve cholesterol goals, and the CK should be repeated when symptoms appear or worsen. In patients with moderate to severe symptoms, and any patient with CK elevated to more than 5-fold the upper limit of normal, the statin should be stopped. Once asymptomatic and CK is reduced (if elevated previously), cholesterol goals can be approached by:

- **A different statin**: (e.g. fluvastatin or pravastatin), starting with a low dose and titrating up.
- **An alternate daily or weekly more potent statin**: (e.g. rosuvastatin or atorvastatin).
- **The combination of the lowest tolerated statin with a cholesterol absorption inhibitor**: (ezetimibe) and/or bile acid sequestrant.

Over-the-counter preparations, such as red yeast rice containing natural statin-like agents or plant sterols, can also lower cholesterol. These, however, have limited efficacy to achieve targeted cholesterol levels for most patients. In patients without CK elevations and symptoms, progress can be followed clinically, but in patients who show CK elevations, CK should be monitored.

### Rhabdomyolysis with simvastatin [^115dRJKJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

As 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors ('statins') are increasingly prescribed for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, this case report describes adverse effects of statin therapy, which can sometimes be fatal. It highlights the need for physicians to be aware of individual patient risk factors predisposing them to statin-induced myopathy. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for further research into cholesterol-lowering drugs that do not have such side effects. When prescribing statins for patients, we must also explain potential side effects following the initiation of therapy and with dose titrations.

### Rationale and design of the CLEAR-outcomes trial: Evaluating the effect of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular events in patients with statin intolerance [^1132wKbc]. American Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

Although statins play a pivotal role in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, many patients fail to achieve recommended lipid levels due to statin-associated muscle symptoms. Bempedoic acid is an oral pro-drug that is activated in the liver and inhibits cholesterol synthesis in hepatocytes, but is not activated in skeletal muscle, which has the potential to avoid muscle-related adverse events. Accordingly, this agent effectively lowers atherogenic lipoproteins in patients who experience statin-associated muscle symptoms. However, the effects of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have not been studied.

- **Study design**: Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic acid, an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Included patients must have all of the following: (i) established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or have a high risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, (ii) documented statin intolerance, and (iii) an LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally-tolerated lipid-lowering therapy. The study randomized 14,014 patients to treatment with bempedoic acid 180 mg daily or matching placebo on a background of guideline-directed medical therapy. The primary outcome is a composite of the time to first cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization. The trial will continue until 1,620 patients experience a primary endpoint, with a minimum of 810 hard ischemic events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke).

### Antioxidant and antiplatelet effects of atorvastatin by Nox2 inhibition [^112dqNsw]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In recent years, it has become evident that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the thrombotic process. Statins are lipid-lowering agents capable of reducing serum cholesterol levels and delaying atherosclerotic complications along with their clinical outcomes. Evidence suggests that, among statins, atorvastatin may exert antiplatelet effects by interfering with redox signaling. Recent studies have demonstrated that atorvastatin possesses antiplatelet activity via the inhibition of platelet formation of NADPH oxidase-derived ROS. This effect leads to the down-regulation of isoprostanes, which are pro-aggregating molecules, and the up-regulation of nitric oxide, a platelet inhibitor. These changes occur immediately after atorvastatin administration and are independent of its lipid-lowering properties.

Experimental and clinical studies have documented that statins possess antithrombotic effects, which may contribute to the reduction of thrombotic-related vascular outcomes. This has been evidenced in various cardiovascular clinical settings such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), myocardial infarction (MI), and venous thrombosis. Future studies should focus on analyzing whether the antiplatelet effect of atorvastatin may preferentially occur at high dosages. Interestingly, the antiplatelet effects of statins could be beneficial in clinical settings where the efficacy of aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs is still uncertain.

### Lovastatin [^112wcKPN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In a study including 16 elderly patients between 70 to 78 years of age who received lovastatin 80 mg/day, the mean plasma level of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity was increased approximately 45% compared with 18 patients between 18 to 30 years of age (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use).

Although the mechanism is not fully understood, cyclosporine has been shown to increase the AUC of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors; the increase in AUC for lovastatin and lovastatin acid is presumably due, in part, to inhibition of CYP3A4.

The risk of myopathy is increased by high levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma. Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 can raise the plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity and increase the risk of myopathy (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Lovastatin is a substrate for cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4 (CYP3A4) (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Grapefruit juice contains one or more components that inhibit CYP3A4 and can increase the plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4.

In one study, 10 subjects consumed 200 mL of double-strength grapefruit juice (one can of frozen concentrate diluted with one rather than 3 cans of water) three times daily for 2 days, and an additional 200 mL double-strength grapefruit juice together with and 30 and 90 minutes following a single dose of 80 mg lovastatin on the third day. This regimen of grapefruit juice resulted in a mean increase in the serum concentration of lovastatin and its β-hydroxyacid metabolite.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^111mbp1D]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Non-statin based lipid-lowering therapy explores alternative methods for managing LDL-C levels when statin therapy alone is insufficient.

If LDL-C remains above target despite maximally tolerated statin dosage, the addition of an alternative LDL-C lowering agent should be considered in patients at high CVD risk to improve LDL-C reduction. Ezetimibe reduces LDL-C by 15–20%, is easy to take with few side effects, and has been shown to reduce CVD events. In patients with SAMS, the combination of ezetimibe plus fluvastatin XL reduced LDL-C by 46% and was as well tolerated as ezetimibe alone. Bile acid sequestrants can reduce LDL-C levels by 15–25% depending on the type and dose used and may also improve glycaemia in patients with diabetes. Colesevelam is easier to take and better tolerated than earlier formulations. The combination of a bile acid sequestrant and ezetimibe can reduce LDL-C by approximately 30–35%.

Fenofibrate can lower LDL-C by 15–20% in patients with high baseline levels who do not have concomitant hypertriglyceridaemia. This fibrate is easy to take and has shown an excellent safety record in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes and Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes trials, although additional CVD benefit has not been demonstrated, and serum creatinine was reversibly increased during treatment. Unlike gemfibrozil, there is no increased risk of rhabdomyolysis when fenofibrate is added to a statin. Niacin also lowers LDL-C levels by 15–20%, but recent large randomized trials showed a significant excess of adverse effects and no significant CVD benefit when added to background statin treatment; therefore, niacin derivatives are no longer advised.

### Efficacy of rosuvastatin compared with other statins at selected starting doses in hypercholesterolemic patients and in special population groups [^113Y9hcm]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). High credibility.

A total of five randomized, double-blind trials in patients with hypercholesterolemia were prospectively designed to allow pooling of plasma lipid data after 12 weeks of treatment. The purpose was to do the following:

- **Compare rosuvastatin 5 and 10 mg with atorvastatin 10 mg**: Data from three of the five trials were used.

- **Compare rosuvastatin 5 and 10 mg with simvastatin 20 mg and pravastatin 20 mg**: Data from two of the five trials were used.

- **Summarize overall efficacy and subset analyses of rosuvastatin data from all five trials**.

Rosuvastatin 5 mg (n = 390) and 10 mg (n = 389) reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol significantly more than atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 393) (41.9% and 46.7% vs. 36.4%, both p < 0.001). Subset analyses based on age (≥ 65 years), female sex, postmenopausal status, hypertension, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and obesity showed that rosuvastatin had consistent efficacy across patient subpopulations.

### Advicor [^113XDyYa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). High credibility.

Gemfibrozil: The combined use of lovastatin with gemfibrozil should be avoided.

- **Other fibrates**: Caution should be used when prescribing other fibrates with lovastatin, as these agents can cause myopathy when given alone. The benefit of further alterations in lipid levels by the combined use of lovastatin with other fibrates should be carefully weighed against the potential risks of this combination.

- **Cyclosporine**: The use of lovastatin with cyclosporine should be avoided.

- **Danazol, diltiazem, or verapamil with higher doses of lovastatin**: In patients taking concomitant danazol, diltiazem, or verapamil, the dose of lovastatin should not exceed 20 mg (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), as the risk of myopathy increases at higher doses. The benefits of the use of lovastatin in patients receiving danazol, diltiazem, or verapamil should be carefully weighed against the risks of these combinations.

- **Amiodarone**: In patients taking concomitant amiodarone, the dose of lovastatin should not exceed 40 mg (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), as the risk of myopathy increases at higher doses.

- **Colchicine**: Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with lovastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing lovastatin with colchicine.

- **Ranolazine**: The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, may be increased by the concomitant administration of ranolazine. Dose adjustment of lovastatin may be considered during co-administration with ranolazine.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to monitoring for adverse effects of statins, the 2019 guidelines by AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA recommend carrying out a thorough assessment of symptoms and evaluating non-statin causes and predisposing factors in patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms.

### Efficacy of atorvastatin on renal function in patients with contrast-induced nephropathy after percutaneous coronary intervention [^115Kz3Ph]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The prognosis of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is poor, and patients with severe renal insufficiency often require dialysis. Treatment and prevention methods for CIN are limited. Clinical guidelines recommend measures such as intravenous infusion of normal saline, minimizing contrast medium use, reducing administration speed, and utilizing hypotonic or isotonic contrast media for prevention; however, these strategies are not highly effective. Prior to the application of contrast agents, it is crucial to evaluate the patient's basic condition and renal function, providing more effective preventive measures for high-risk patients.

For individuals with high-risk factors — such as existing renal insufficiency, advanced age, dehydration, diabetes, multiple myeloma, and hyperuricemia — contrast examinations should be avoided when possible. If alternative diagnostic methods are unavailable, saline should be administered before contrast exposure, and contrast examinations should only proceed after addressing dehydration, hypotension, and electrolyte disturbances. Prompt treatment is essential if acute kidney injury occurs.

Atorvastatin, a common drug used to lower blood cholesterol levels, is manufactured by Pfizer and belongs to the statin class. It helps lower blood cholesterol, stabilize blood plaque, inhibit platelet aggregation, and prevent strokes. The usage of atorvastatin in the domestic hospital market has surpassed that of simvastatin, maintaining a leading position as a prominent medication in the market.

### Statins research unfinished saga: Desirability versus feasibility [^115dQVSE]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2005). Low credibility.

Extensive evidence from intervention trials has demonstrated that "old" statin treatment results in reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. By contrast, statin treatment has not been consistently associated with a reduction in plasma RLP-C levels. In general, it can be concluded that RLP-C lowering by statins depends on their ability to reduce triglyceride levels. Therefore, among all currently clinically available statins, only atorvastatin and rosuvastatin have the potential to reduce RLP-C levels.

In addition, the concomitant use of fibrate and statin seems attractive in patients whose LDL-cholesterol is controlled by statin but whose HDL-cholesterol and/or triglyceride levels are still inappropriate. A combination statin/fibrate may be necessary to control all lipid abnormalities in patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Safety concerns about some fibrates, such as gemfibrozil, may lead to exaggerated precautions regarding fibrate administration and therefore diminish the use of these agents. However, other fibrates, such as bezafibrate and fenofibrate, appear to be safer and better tolerated.

The combination of fibrate with statins that are not primarily metabolized within the liver by the cytochrome P450 system (like pravastatin or fluvastatin) may be even less hazardous. We believe that proper coadministration of statins and fibrates in some cases, selected on the basis of their safety, could be more effective in achieving comprehensive lipid control compared to monotherapy. An alternative future combination may offer similar benefits.

### Statin treatment and muscle symptoms: Series of randomised, placebo controlled n-of-1 trials [^117Fy8kb]. BMJ (2021). High credibility.

Participant decisions about ongoing use of statins

Of the 114 participants who completed six treatment periods, 113 (57% of 200 randomised participants) received their results during an end-of-trial discussion. One participant did not attend. Of these 113 participants, 99 (88%) stated the trial had been helpful, and 74 (66%) indicated they had already resumed or intended to resume taking statins. Of the participants, 17 (15%) had a mean muscle symptom score at least one unit higher during the statin than the placebo periods and were informed that statins might be contributing to their muscle symptoms. Among these 17 patients, nine (53%) planned to restart treatment with statins. Of the remaining 96 participants, who had been informed that statins were unlikely to be contributing to their muscle symptoms, 65 (68%) planned to restart treatment with statins.

- **Withdrawals**: Of the 80 withdrawals, 34 (43%) occurred during a statin period, 39 (49%) during a placebo period, and 7 (9%) after randomisation but before the study drug was taken. Overall, few participants withdrew because of muscle symptoms. During statin periods, 18 (9%) participants withdrew because of intolerable symptoms compared with 13 (7%) during placebo periods. The appendix shows the mean symptom scores for those who withdrew versus those that did not withdraw. Among the 193 participants who had not withdrawn before the start of the trial, our multinomial models showed no evidence of a difference in the probability of withdrawal based on treatment periods.

### Lescol [^114LtnNc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

In 12 placebo-controlled studies involving patients with Type IIa or IIb hyperlipoproteinemia, Lescol® (fluvastatin sodium) was administered to 1,621 patients in daily dose regimens of 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg (40 mg twice daily) for at least 6 weeks. After 24 weeks of treatment, daily doses of 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg (40 mg twice daily) resulted in median LDL-C reductions of 22% (n = 747), 25% (n = 748), and 36% (n = 257), respectively. Lescol treatment resulted in dose-related reductions in Apo B and triglycerides, and increases in HDL-C.

- **Percent changes in HDL-C**: The median (25th, 75th percentile) percent changes from baseline in HDL-C after 12 weeks of treatment with Lescol at daily doses of 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg (40 mg twice daily) were +2% (-4%, +10%), +5% (-2%, +12%), and +4% (-3%, +12%), respectively.

- **Subgroup analysis**: In a subgroup of patients with primary mixed dyslipidemia, defined as baseline triglyceride levels greater than 200 mg/dL, treatment with Lescol led to significant decreases in Total-C, LDL-C, TG, and Apo B, with variable increases in HDL-C. The median (25th, 75th percentile) percent changes from baseline in HDL-C after 12 weeks of treatment with Lescol at daily doses of 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg (40 mg twice daily) in this population were +4% (-2%, +12%), +8% (+1%, +15%), and +4% (-3%, +13%), respectively.

### Nutraceuticals in the management of patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms, with a note on real-world experience [^1168EZwQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

There is considerable evidence for the role of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Although statin therapy remains the most frequently prescribed medication to reduce LDL-C and lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, a considerable number of patients develop muscle-related side effects. This review summarizes recent literature supporting the role of nutraceuticals as LDL-C-lowering therapy in statin-intolerant patients, with evidence from our own clinical practices.

### Policosanol: Clinical pharmacology and therapeutic significance of a new lipid-lowering agent [^111zP2jm]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Policosanol is a mixture of higher primary aliphatic alcohols isolated from sugar cane wax, whose main component is octacosanol. The mixture has been shown to lower cholesterol in animal models, healthy volunteers, and patients with type II hypercholesterolemia.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the literature on placebo-controlled lipid-lowering studies using policosanol published in peer-reviewed journals, as well as studies investigating its mechanism of action and its clinical pharmacology.

- **Results**: At doses of 10 to 20 mg per day, policosanol lowers total cholesterol by 17% to 21% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 21% to 29%, and raises high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 8% to 15%. Because higher doses have not been tested up to now, it cannot be excluded that effectiveness may be even greater. Daily doses of 10 mg of policosanol have been shown to be equally effective in lowering total or LDL cholesterol as the same dose of simvastatin or pravastatin. Triglyceride levels are not influenced by policosanol. At dosages of up to 20 mg per day, policosanol is safe and well tolerated, as studies of over 3 years of therapy indicate. There is evidence from in vitro studies that policosanol may inhibit hepatic cholesterol synthesis at a step before mevalonate generation, but direct inhibition of the hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase is unlikely. Animal studies suggest that LDL catabolism may be enhanced, possibly through receptor-mediated mechanisms, but the precise mechanism of action is not understood yet. Policosanol has additional beneficial properties but…

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, particularly in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, the 2019 guidelines from AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA recommend addressing and treating lifestyle factors such as obesity and metabolic syndrome. Additionally, they advise managing secondary factors, including diabetes mellitus, chronic liver or kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome, and hypothyroidism. Medications that increase triglycerides should also be considered in adults aged 20 years and older with moderate hypertriglyceridemia (fasting or non-fasting triglycerides of 175–499 mg/dL or 2.0–5.6 mmol/L).

### Zocor [^112xSukK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The Heart Protection Study (HPS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-centered study with a mean duration of 5 years. It involved 10,269 patients on Zocor 40 mg and 10,267 on placebo. Patients had a mean age of 64 years, with a range of 40–80 years. The demographic was 97% white and included individuals at high risk of major coronary events because of existing coronary heart disease (CHD) (65%); type 2 diabetes (26%) and type 1 diabetes (3%); a history of stroke or other cerebrovascular disease (16%); peripheral vascular disease (33%); or males aged 65 years or older with hypertension (6%).

At baseline:

- 3,421 patients (17%) had LDL-C levels below 100 mg/dL.
- Among them, 953 (5%) had LDL-C levels below 80 mg/dL.
- 10,047 patients (49%) had LDL-C levels greater than 130 mg/dL.

Patients were randomized to Zocor or placebo using a covariate adaptive method considering 10 important baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled.

The study results showed that Zocor 40 mg/day significantly reduced total and CHD mortality, and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and revascularization procedures (both coronary and non-coronary).

### Statin toxicity [^112ToQMH]. Circulation Research (2019). Low credibility.

There is now overwhelming evidence to support lowering LDL-c (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Statins, a class of drugs frequently prescribed to lower cholesterol, are widely used. However, discontinuation and nonadherence remain major gaps in both the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

The major reason for statin discontinuation is the development of statin-associated muscle symptoms, though a range of other statin-induced side effects also exist. Although the mechanisms behind these side effects have not been fully elucidated, there is an urgent need to identify those at increased risk of developing side effects and to provide alternative treatment strategies.

In this article, we review the mechanisms and clinical importance of statin toxicity, focusing on the evaluation and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms.

### Comparison of treatment of severe high-density lipoprotein cholesterol deficiency in men with daily atorvastatin (20 mg) versus fenofibrate (200 mg) versus extended-release niacin (2 g) [^115XYN1p]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

To determine whether available lipid-modifying medication can increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in well-defined genetic or familial HDL-deficiency states, we studied 19 men with HDL deficiency (HDL cholesterol < 5th percentile for age and gender), aged 55 ± 10 years. Concomitant risk factors included diabetes (n = 3) and hypertension (n = 7), and 8 patients had coronary artery disease. Molecular analysis revealed that 4 patients had a mutation in the ABCA1 gene. Patients were assigned to sequentially receive atorvastatin 20 mg/day, fenofibrate 200 mg/day, and extended-release niacin 2 g/day for 8 weeks, with a 4-week washout period between each treatment. Patients requiring a statin, according to treatment guidelines, were kept on atorvastatin throughout the study.

Baseline HDL cholesterol level was 0.63 ± 0.12 mmol/L (24 ± 5 mg/dl), triglycerides 2.01 ± 0.98 mmol/L (180 ± 86 mg/dl), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 2.29 ± 0.95 mmol/L (94 ± 39 mg/dl). Mean percent changes in HDL cholesterol with atorvastatin, fenofibrate, and niacin were -6% (p = NS), +6% (p = NS), and +22% (p < 0.05), respectively. Furthermore, niacin significantly increased the large alpha-1 apolipoprotein A-I-containing HDL subspecies (12 to 17 nm). In conclusion, niacin was the only effective drug to increase HDL cholesterol. The absolute increase in HDL cholesterol, approximately 0.10 mmol/L (3.9 mg/dl), is of uncertain clinical significance. Biomarkers of HDL-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux were not changed by niacin therapy.

Regarding medical management for statin-induced myopathy, more specifically with respect to treatment modifications, the 2019 guidelines recommend considering switching to non-statin therapy likely to provide net clinical benefit. This is particularly advised for patients at increased ASCVD risk with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms or those who experience symptoms despite appropriate statin rechallenge.

### Management of dyslipidemia in the high-risk patient [^1132yGJr]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Lipid-lowering agents have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), particularly in high-risk patients. The identification and treatment of these patients should, therefore, be a high priority for clinicians. Guidelines from medical organizations, such as the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA), suggest that patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels ≥ 130 mg/dL, and perhaps even those with levels ≥ 100 mg/dL, should receive drug therapy.

Optimal LDL-C levels have been set at < 100 mg/dL and < 115 mg/dL for high-risk patients by US and European guidelines, respectively. However, a recent survey shows that only about 20% of high-risk patients currently meet these goals.

To achieve therapeutic targets for LDL-C, statins are the foundation of treatment, as they are the most effective and best-tolerated form of lipid-lowering therapy. Other therapeutic options include bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and plant stanols, although these are seldom used as monotherapy. Combination therapy with a statin and one of these other lipid-lowering agents can be useful in patients who are unable to achieve target lipid levels through monotherapy.

There remains, however, a need for additional agents. Some of the new options for reducing LDL-C levels that may be available in the near future include two new statins, pitavastatin and rosuvastatin. In patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin, which is currently under development, may offer promising results.

### Statin-induced debilitating weakness and myopathy [^1164QtMa]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A large percentage of the US population is either receiving or should be considered for statin therapy. Whether through primary or secondary prevention for atherosclerotic disease, statins remain one of the mainstay options available to physicians. Myalgias are the most commonly reported side effects, though largely self-limited and subjective in nature. Here, we report a case of drug-related myonecrosis following long-term use of atorvastatin. Prompt recognition of the condition and initiation of treatment is paramount to control the disease's progression.

- **Treatment strategies**: While high-dose steroids are first line, quick escalation to methotrexate, IVIG, or rituximab should be considered in refractory cases. This decision is guided by monitoring serum markers such as CK and transaminases. The goal is the quick normalisation of these enzymes, signalling cessation of underlying muscle necrosis. Patients may never regain full function, and treatment can last months to years.

### Lypqozet [^112pL6SE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 [see also Dosage and Administration (2.3), Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Use with caution and with the lowest dose necessary**: Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets with colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7.11)].

- **Ezetimibe and atorvastatin administration**: Ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g. severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures).

- **Ezetimibe in clinical trials**: In clinical trials, there was no excess of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis associated with ezetimibe compared with the relevant control arm (placebo or statin alone). However, myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are known adverse reactions to statins and other lipid-lowering drugs. In clinical trials, the incidence of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) > 10 times ULN was 0.2% for ezetimibe vs. 0.1% for placebo, and 0.1% for ezetimibe coadministered with a statin vs. 0.4% for statins alone. Risk for skeletal muscle toxicity increases with higher doses of statin, advanced age (> 65), hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and depending on the statin used, concomitant use of other agents.
