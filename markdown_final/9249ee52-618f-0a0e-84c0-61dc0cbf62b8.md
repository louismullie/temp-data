## Question

A 58-year-old man with a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis undergoes routine upper endoscopy, which reveals large gastroesophageal varices type 2 (GOV2). He has never had a variceal bleed. He is asymptomatic and has no contraindications to beta-blocker therapy. The patient asks about options to prevent a first episode of variceal bleeding. The gastroenterology fellow suggests starting a nonselective beta-blocker and asks whether cyanoacrylate injection should be performed for primary prophylaxis.

Based on current guideline recommendations, what is the appropriate approach to primary prophylaxis for this patient, and should cyanoacrylate injection be offered outside of a clinical trial?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about primary prophylaxis for a 58-year-old man with alcohol-related cirrhosis and large GOV2 varices who has never bled, specifically whether nonselective beta-blockers are indicated and whether cyanoacrylate injection should be offered outside a clinical trial. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's bleeding risk and how GOV2 differs from esophageal varices. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about primary prophylaxis for GOV2. Next, I will examine the single randomized trial suggesting benefit with cyanoacrylate and weigh its limitations. After that, I need to check the safety and regulatory status of cyanoacrylate for prophylaxis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and monitoring plan, including when to consider exceptions or trials.

> Let me first confirm the risk profile. GOV2 varices are cardiofundal and carry a higher bleeding risk than esophageal varices, with contemporary series estimating roughly a 10% annual risk of first bleed, which places this patient in a high-risk category warranting primary prophylaxis rather than observation [^114vaKFE] [^113JYJez].

> Next, I should review guideline positions. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check multiple sources. The AASLD 2024 guidance states that for prevention of first hemorrhage from GOV2 or IGV1, NSBBs can be used, although the data are not as strong as for esophageal varices, and importantly, neither TIPS nor BRTO are recommended to prevent first hemorrhage in fundal varices that have not bled [^116EKEmN] [^116zs1jB]. The BSG 2015 guideline explicitly recommends not administering cyanoacrylate injections for primary prophylaxis outside clinical trials, while allowing consideration of NSBBs in selected high-risk patients with large GOV2 after shared decision-making [^114EPJkB] [^116PPPxR] [^111qJecp]. EASL 2018 similarly supports NSBBs for primary prophylaxis in GOV2/IGV1, again reflecting weaker evidence than for esophageal varices [^113jcP3T] [^116fgjEK].

> I will now examine the pivotal randomized trial. The 2011 Journal of Hepatology RCT in 89 patients with large GOV2/IGV1 showed that cyanoacrylate reduced first bleeding to 10% vs 38% with NSBB and 53% with observation, with improved survival vs observation but not vs NSBB; however, wait, let me verify the limitations — this was a small, single-center study with an unusually high NSBB failure rate and has not been replicated, which tempers its applicability to routine practice [^115PnVwv] [^111JzFRC].

> But wait, what about safety and regulatory issues. Cyanoacrylate injection carries risks including systemic embolization and ulceration, and in the U.S. it is not FDA-approved for gastric varices; even for acute bleeding, its use is reserved for centers with expertise, underscoring that routine prophylactic use is not supported outside trials [^1122vULD] [^112wLwob]. I should double-check that both AASLD and BSG align with this caution, which they do [^115PnVwv] [^114EPJkB].

> Let me consider emerging endoscopic approaches. EUS-guided coil/glue techniques show promising low bleeding rates in observational primary prophylaxis cohorts, but hold on, I should verify whether guidelines endorse this routinely — they do not, citing insufficient comparative data and the need for specialized expertise, so these remain investigational rather than standard of care [^116AWCdc] [^111XppYH].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the bottom line. The appropriate, guideline-concordant approach is to initiate NSBB therapy for primary prophylaxis in this patient with large GOV2 varices, given his lack of contraindications, while avoiding cyanoacrylate injection for primary prophylaxis outside a clinical trial due to limited, low-certainty evidence and safety concerns [^115PnVwv] [^114EPJkB] [^116zs1jB]. I need to ensure I specify practical details: start carvedilol 12.5 mg daily or propranolol 40 mg twice daily and titrate to a resting heart rate around 55 bpm or maximal tolerated dose, with counseling on side effects and adherence [^116BmY3F] [^115sneuJ].

> Next, I should review follow-up and contingencies. I should confirm that surveillance endoscopy is not mandated for GOV2 prophylaxis with NSBBs, but periodic clinical reassessment of tolerance and ongoing risk is prudent; if NSBBs are contraindicated or not tolerated, I need to check whether endoscopic therapy can be considered — AASLD 2024 allows that in selected high-risk patients with contraindications to NSBBs, cyanoacrylate may be considered, but again, this is not routine and should be individualized and ideally within a trial framework [^116EKEmN] [^116zs1jB].

> Final recommendation: Yes, start a nonselective beta-blocker for primary prophylaxis in this patient with large GOV2 varices. No, do not offer cyanoacrylate injection for primary prophylaxis outside of a clinical trial, given insufficient evidence, safety concerns, and lack of endorsement by major guidelines, reserving endoscopic therapy for acute bleeding or secondary prophylaxis in experienced centers [^115PnVwv] [^114EPJkB] [^116zs1jB].

---

For a 58-year-old man with alcohol-related cirrhosis and large GOV2 varices without prior bleeding, **NSBBs are first-line** for primary prophylaxis [^115PnVwv] because they reduce portal pressure and first-bleed risk [^116zs1jB]. Cyanoacrylate injection is **not recommended for primary prophylaxis** outside clinical trials due to limited evidence and potential complications [^114EPJkB] [^116PPPxR]; it should be reserved for acute bleeding or secondary prophylaxis in expert centers [^117JfenU] [^112V679D]. If NSBBs are contraindicated or not tolerated, consider carvedilol or endoscopic therapy in specialized centers, but routine cyanoacrylate for primary prophylaxis is not advised [^116EKEmN] [^116zs1jB].

## Evidence and guidelines for primary prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleeding

### Nonselective beta-blockers (NSBBs)

- **Mechanism of action**: NSBBs reduce portal pressure by blocking β1-adrenergic receptors (decreasing cardiac output) and β2-adrenergic receptors (causing splanchnic vasoconstriction), thereby reducing variceal blood flow and pressure [^notfound].

- **Clinical evidence**: NSBBs are effective in preventing first variceal bleeding in patients with medium to large esophageal varices [^1112i6th] and are recommended for primary prophylaxis in patients with high-risk gastric varices, including GOV2 [^115PnVwv] [^113jcP3T].

- **Guideline recommendations**: AASLD and EASL recommend NSBBs as first-line therapy for primary prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleeding, particularly in patients with large GOV2 varices [^115PnVwv] [^113jcP3T].

---

### Cyanoacrylate injection

- **Mechanism of action**: Cyanoacrylate glue injection achieves hemostasis by obliterating varices, but carries risks such as systemic embolization, infection, and mucosal injury [^112DEBEv].

- **Clinical evidence**: A single randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggested cyanoacrylate injection reduced first bleeding and improved survival compared to NSBBs and observation, but this study was small, single-center, and not replicated [^112Qky4r] [^111JzFRC].

- **Guideline recommendations**: Major guidelines (AASLD, BSG, EASL) do not recommend cyanoacrylate injection for primary prophylaxis outside clinical trials due to limited evidence and potential complications [^114EPJkB] [^116PPPxR] [^116zs1jB].

---

## Comparative effectiveness and safety

| **Attribute** | **Nsbb** | **Cyanoacrylate injection** |
|-|-|-|
| Effectiveness | Proven reduction in first variceal bleeding in multiple studies and meta-analyses [^1112i6th] [^11748oRz] | Limited evidence; single small RCT suggests benefit but not replicated [^112Qky4r] [^111JzFRC] |
| Safety | Generally well tolerated; adverse effects include fatigue, hypotension, and bronchospasm [^notfound] | Potential serious complications include systemic embolization, infection, and mucosal injury [^112DEBEv] |
| Guideline support | Strongly recommended by AASLD, BSG, and EASL for primary prophylaxis [^115PnVwv] [^113jcP3T] | Not recommended outside clinical trials by major guidelines [^114EPJkB] [^116PPPxR] |

---

## Clinical considerations and patient-specific factors

In this patient, **NSBBs are appropriate** because there are no contraindications and they offer proven benefit in reducing first bleed risk [^115PnVwv] [^113jcP3T]. Cyanoacrylate injection is **not advised** given the lack of robust evidence and potential complications; it should be reserved for acute bleeding or secondary prophylaxis in specialized centers [^114EPJkB] [^116PPPxR].

---

## Alternative therapies

If NSBBs are contraindicated or not tolerated, **carvedilol** is an alternative NSBB with additional alpha-1 blockade that may further reduce portal pressure [^115jXime]. Endoscopic therapy (e.g. band ligation) may be considered in specialized centers, but evidence for primary prophylaxis of gastric varices is limited [^116EKEmN].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

NSBBs are the **first-line therapy** for primary prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleeding in patients with large GOV2 varices. Cyanoacrylate injection is not recommended for primary prophylaxis outside clinical trials due to limited evidence and potential complications. The patient should be started on NSBBs, with close monitoring for adverse effects and adherence, and cyanoacrylate injection reserved for acute bleeding or secondary prophylaxis in specialized centers.

Background & Aims

Gastric variceal bleeding is severe and is associated with high mortality. We compared the efficacy of cyanoacrylate injection and beta-blockers in primary prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleeding.

Methods

Cirrhotics with large gastroesophageal varices type 2 with eradicated esophageal varices or large isolated gastric varix type 1, who had never bled from gastric varix, were randomised to cyanoacrylate injection (Group I, n = 30), beta-blockers (Group II, n = 29) or no treatment (Group III, n = 30). Primary end-points were bleeding from gastric varix or death.

Results

The actuarial probability of bleeding from gastric varices over a median follow-up of 26 months was 13% in Group I, 28% in Group II (p = 0.039), and 45% in Group III (p = 0.003). The actuarial probability of survival was higher in the cyanoacrylate compared to the no-treatment group (90% vs. 72%, p = 0.048). The median hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was increased in Group I (14–15 mm Hg, p = 0.001) and III (14–16 mm Hg, p = 0.001) but decreased in Group II (14 to 12 mm Hg, p = 0.001) during follow-up. Size of gastric varix > 20 mm, a MELD score ≥ 17, and presence of portal hypertensive gastropathy predicted 'high risk' of first bleeding from gastric varices.

Conclusions

Primary prophylaxis is recommended in patients with large and high risk gastric varices to reduce the risk of first bleeding and mortality. Cyanoacrylate injection is more effective than beta-blocker therapy in preventing first gastric variceal bleeding.

### Preventing initial bleeding in cirrhosis-induced varices… [^111PQeTC]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Esophagogastric varices accompanying cirrhosis are a significant cause of hemorrhagic morbidity and mortality. Primary prophylaxis of the initial bleeding episode would reduce the inpatient mortality rate. Nonselective beta blockers and isosorbide-5-mononitrate have been used to reduce bleeding episodes. Because pharmacotherapy does not significantly lower portal pressure and because of medication contraindications and adverse effects, many patients who might benefit cannot use these medications. Variceal band ligation has been used effectively during the acute bleed or to prevent rebleeding. Lui and associates used a prospective, randomized controlled trial to compare VBL with propranolol and ISMN therapy to prevent initial episodes of esophageal variceal bleeding. Patients with cirrhosis were screened by endoscopy for esophageal varices, and those with more than minimal variceal lesions were asked to enroll in the study.

Very sick patients, patients younger than 18 years or older than 75 years, patients who were already taking vasoactive agents, and patients with noncirrhotic portal hypertension, contraindications to the trial drugs, low blood pressure, or bradycardia were excluded. Researchers randomized 172 participants to repeated VBL via endoscopy until the varices disappeared, incremental twice-daily dosing of PPL, or incremental twice-daily dosing of ISMN. Patients who did not tolerate ISMN were offered PPL. Patients who could not take PPL did not receive additional treatment. The primary end point was esophageal variceal bleeding. VBL eradicated esophageal varices in 82 percent of the treated group. The most serious adverse event was perforation of a patient's upper esophagus. The mean dosage of PPL in the second group was 113. 5 mg per day.

Patients randomized to receive ISMN took a mean dosage of 55. 1 mg per day. Among participants in both medically treated groups, there was no significant blood pressure drop. More than 40 percent of patients reported side effects, that prompted high drop-out rates. Variceal bleeding occurred in 6. 8 percent of patients who received VBL, in
13. 8 percent of patients who took PPL, and in 22. 6 percent of patients who took ISMN. The risk for variceal bleeding was significantly different between the VBL and ISMN groups, but not between the VBL and PPL groups or between the PPL and ISMN groups. Deaths from all causes or associated with variceal bleeding were lower among patients who underwent VBL. The authors conclude that VBL is as effective as PPL and more effective than ISMN in decreasing the rate of first cirrhosis-induced variceal bleeding among persons with more than just minimal esophageal varices.

Side effects are more common among patients receiving medical therapy, which may limit regularity of treatment. Although combinations of beta blockers and ISMN have been shown to be more effective than either medication alone in preventing first bleeds, this study did not look at the efficacy of combination therapy.

### Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding [^1151B3ym]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal varices are present in almost half of patients with cirrhosis at the time of initial diagnosis. Variceal bleeding occurs in 25% to 35% of patients with cirrhosis. Effective and timely care can prevent variceal bleeding (primary prophylaxis). For example, clinical studies demonstrate that both beta-blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation are effective in preventing a first episode of variceal bleeding. The major challenge is to screen patients in a timely manner and institute a form of therapy that has the highest chance of success in terms of patient compliance and effectiveness.

Recommendations: management of active haemorrhage from gastric varices (Figure 3)
What is the optimal management of bleeding gastro-oesophageal varices? Gastro-oesophageal varices (GOV)-1: treat as for oesophageal varices (level 2b, grade B). GOV-2 and isolated gastric varices (IGV): We recommend initial endoscopic therapy with cyanoacrylate injection (level 1a, grade A). Thrombin may also be considered (level 4, grade C). TIPSS can be considered, depending on local resources and clinical judgement (level 3a, grade B).
If control of bleeding fails: Balloon tamponade is suggested for GOV and IGV-1 until definitive treatment is undertaken (level 2b, grade B). Salvage TIPSS is suggested as the first-line definite treatment, where feasible (level 3a, grade B). Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) or surgical shunting can be considered if TIPSS is not possible (eg, portal vein thrombosis present) and depending on local resources (level 3a, grade B).
What are the therapeutic options for prevention of rebleeding from gastric varices? We recommend that patients with GOV-1 are entered into a VBL surveillance programme (level 2b, grade B). We recommend endoscopic surveillance with cyanoacrylate injection as needed for GOV-2 and IGV (level 2b, grade B). Note the optimum endoscopic follow-up strategy remains unclear. Thrombin can also be considered (level 4, grade C). NSBB can be considered in certain circumstances after taking into account the patient's preferences and clinical judgement (level 1b, grade B). We suggest TIPSS if patients rebleed despite cyanoacrylate injection. TIPSS can also be considered in other selected patients (eg, those with large or multiple gastric varices) (level 1b, grade B). Shunt surgery may be used in selected patients with well-compensated cirrhosis and depending on local resources (level 3c, grade B).

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^116VMTMp]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

In a retrospective study, Kang et al suggested that cyanoacrylate injection may be an effective prophylactic treatment for higher-risk gastric varices.

A retrospective study evaluated the clinical outcomes of B-RTO for gastric varices, in which the procedure was performed as a primary prophylactic treatment in 40 patients. The procedure was successful in 79% of patients, although procedural complications were reported in 9%. Survival at 1 and 5 years was 92% and 73%, respectively.

### Endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection versus balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration for prevention of gastric variceal bleeding: a randomized controlled trial [^114ksfoD]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The optimal treatment for gastric varices (GVs) is a topic that remains open for study. This study compared the efficacy and safety of endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection and balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) to prevent rebleeding in patients with cirrhosis and GVs after primary hemostasis.

Approach and Results

Patients with cirrhosis and history of bleeding from gastroesophageal varices type 2 or isolated gastric varices type 1 were randomized to cyanoacrylate injection (n = 32) or BRTO treatment (n = 32). Primary outcomes were gastric variceal rebleeding or all-cause rebleeding. Patient characteristics were well balanced between two groups. Mean follow-up time was 27.1 ± 12.0 months in a cyanoacrylate injection group and 27.6 ± 14.3 months in a BRTO group. Probability of gastric variceal rebleeding was higher in the cyanoacrylate injection group than in the BRTO group (P = 0.024). Probability of remaining free of all-cause rebleeding at 1 and 2 years for cyanoacrylate injection versus BRTO was 77% versus 96.3% and 65.2% versus 92.6% (P = 0.004). Survival rates, frequency of complications, and worsening of esophageal varices were similar in both groups. BRTO resulted in fewer hospitalizations, inpatient stays, and lower medical costs.

Conclusions

BRTO is more effective than cyanoacrylate injection in preventing rebleeding from GVs, with similar frequencies of complications and mortalities.

### The role of endoscopy for primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding [^1144p9yw]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Cirrhosis is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. One of the most serious and unpredictable complication of cirrhosis, with a high mortality rate, is bleeding from esophagogastric varices. Endoscopic screening of varices followed by primary prophylactic treatment with beta blockers or band ligation in the presence of large esophageal varices will reduce the variceal bleeding rates and thereby reduce mortality risks in those with advanced cirrhosis. There is a paucity of data on primary prophylaxis of gastric varices but secondary prophylaxis includes glue injection, balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration, or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting with coil embolization.

Gastric varices — prevention of first hemorrhage: Only one randomized trial has been published on the primary prevention of gastric VH; this study included 89 patients with large (≥ 10 mm) GOV2 and IGV1, the number of patients with IGV1 was small (15%), and cyanoacrylate injection was associated with lower bleeding rates (10%) than NSBBs (38%) and observation (53%), while survival was higher in the cyanoacrylate group (93%) compared to observation (74%), but no different from those on NSBBs (83%). No studies have assessed primary prevention of bleeding from GOV1 varices; TIPS is not recommended in this setting and the efficacy of BRTO has not been studied and therefore cannot be recommended for primary prophylaxis. Guidance statements specify: For prevention of first VH from GOV2 or IGV1, NSBBs can be used, although the data are not as strong as for EV; Prevention of first bleeding from GOV1 varices may follow the recommendations for EV; Neither TIPS nor BRTO are recommended to prevent first hemorrhage in patients with fundal varices that have not bled.

### NCT05859009 | Primary prevention of gastric varices bleed… [^112vfECj]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary Prevention of Gastric Varices BleedClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Primary gastric varices are a condition that affects 17% of patients with liver cirrhosis who have not previously received treatment, either endoscopic or pharmacologic. Although the incidence of GV is lower than oesophageal varices and the bleeding rate is also less frequent, GV bleeding is more severe and is associated with higher re-bleeding and death rates when compared to EV. The management of acute GV bleeding is well established, but the primary prophylaxis for certain types of GV remains unclear. The management of GOV-1 is recommended as for EV, but for isolated gastric varices type 1 and gastroesophageal varices type 2, PP is not clearly defined.

Existing guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver do not provide strong recommendations for primary prophylaxis of IGV-1/GOV-2. While EASL suggests the use of nonselective beta-blockers for IGV-1/ GOV-2 based on one Randomized Controlled Trial from 2011 on 89 patients, comparing NSBB vs. endoscopic glue injection for primary prophylaxis in GOV-2/IGV-1. The Baveno consensus VII recommends NSBB in PP but emphasizes the need for further studies. However, no study compares NSBB vs. EUS-GV management in primary prophylaxis. Establishing primary prophylaxis for IGV-1/GOV-2 is even more important as the 2-year incidence of variceal bleeding from IGV1 and GOV-2 type of varices is more frequent and profuse than the lesser curve varices.

Clinical research has shown that the use of non-selective beta-blockers, such as propranolol and nadolol, can be effective in reducing the risk of developing gastric varices in patients with cirrhosis. These medications work by reducing blood flow to the dilated veins in the stomach, thereby reducing the pressure in these vessels. In addition to the use of beta-blockers, there have been other interventions studied for primary prophylaxis of gastric varices. These include the use of endoscopic techniques such as band ligation and injection sclerotherapy, and the use of the cyanoacrylate glue.

### Cyanoacrylate glue for gastrointestinal bleeding [^112DEBEv]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cyanoacrylate (CYA) therapy has become an important component of the therapeutic toolbox of the interventional endoscopists with direct endoscopic injection accepted as first-line therapy of gastric varices. However, its generalized use has been cautioned by its serious adverse event profile.

Recent Findings

Endoscopic ultrasound guided therapy has several conceptual advantages over free-hand injection, particularly as it ensures intravascular delivery of therapy. This has allowed innovation with the use of vascular coils with or without CYA therapy, and very encouraging long-term results are now published showing reduced serious adverse events and low rebleeding rates.

Summary

Direct endoscopic ultrasound guided intravascular injection of CYA is gaining widespread acceptance and offers reduced complication rates and significantly lower rebleeding rates. Data are supportive of CYA use both for primary and secondary prophylaxis of gastric varices.

### Gastric variceal bleeding [^117JvsXZ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There are no well-established guidelines for the management of gastric variceal bleeding. Endoscopic management of acute gastric variceal bleeding has been premised on the injection of sclerosants and synthetic glue. However, these therapies are associated with various complications including systemic embolization and recurrent bleeding. Recently, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided interventions including coil injection have emerged as promising modalities with high technical and clinical success rates and low rates of recurrence.

Recent Findings

In this review we discuss the classification, natural history, prognosis, and treatment options of gastric variceal. Discussion of treatment is further subdivided into primary and secondary prophylaxis and the management of acute gastric variceal bleeding with a focus on emerging endoscopic interventions.

Summary

Cyanoacrylate injection may have a role in the primary and secondary prophylaxis of gastric variceal. Endoscopic band ligation should be considered for GOV1. EUS-guided injection of synthetic glues like cyanoacrylate is superior to direct injection. However, EUS-guided coil injections with or without cyanoacrylate should be considered first-line endoscopic treatment in all bleeding gastric variceal except for GOV1. Balloon retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) remain important interventional radiologic therapeutic options as primary therapy in centers without EUS expertise or as salvage therapy.

Treatment

Primary prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleeding

In patients with GVs who have not bled, similar to the prevention of acute variceal bleeding from esophageal varices, the use of nonselective beta-blockers has been suggested. The role of endoscopic cyanoacrylate glue injection and endoscopic band ligation (EBL) as options for primary prophylaxis in gastroesophageal varices remain unclear. In a study conducted from a single center in India, endoscopic glue injection was found to be associated with lower bleeding and mortality compared to nonselective beta-blockers. Kang et al. demonstrated the long-term efficacy of prophylactic cyanoacrylate glue therapy in 27 patients with high-risk GVs with 6-months cumulative survival of 75%. The Baveno VI consensus and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommend the use of non-selective beta-blockers.

Bhat and colleagues studied the primary prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleeding using EUS guided glue injection and found that only 5% bled at 449 days follow up. Further studies on EUS based therapy for prevention of bleeding in GV are lacking. In the study by Koziel et al. on EUS-guided obliteration of GVs using vascular coils only or coils with CYA injections for primary and secondary prophylaxis for GV haemorrhage, technical success was 94% without serious complications. Nonetheless, this was a small series with retrospective methodology and inherent bias. Primary TIPS is not recommended for prevention of GV bleeding. Balloon-retrograde transvenous occlusion (BRTO) and it's variant techniques such as coil-assisted retrograde transvenous occlusion (CARTO), plug-assisted retrograde transvenous occlusion (PARTO), balloon antegrade transvenous occlusion (BATO) and our group described novel techniques such as the 'direct' (D)-PARTO or direct coil-assisted antegrade transvenous occlusion (CAATO) are not evaluated in high-quality randomized trials for prevention of first gastric variceal bleeding and hence cannot be recommended as primary prophylaxis.

### Factors impacting physicians' decisions to prevent variceal hemorrhage [^111Q7a91]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Both EVL and BBs are effective in the primary prevention of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding, and guidelines recommend the use of either of these therapies to prevent hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis with medium/large-sized varices. In this study, 39% of the physicians surveyed chose both BBs and EVL as their preferred choice for prevention of first variceal hemorrhage for a 60-year-old man with hepatitis C cirrhosis and large esophageal varices. Thus it appears that combination therapy may be commonly used in clinical practice despite practice guidelines recommending the use of either, but not both options, for primary prophylaxis.

Preference for using both options may be based on data demonstrating that combined therapy is superior to either monotherapy for prevention of recurrent bleeding from esophageal varices. While combination therapy is recommended for the prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage (where the risk of rebleeding is in the order of 60% in one year), a more conservative approach is recommended for primary prophylaxis (where the risk of hemorrhage is ~15% in one year). Failure to adhere to guideline recommendations, however, is well recognized across specialties, and may be due to multiple factors including the level of the guidelines trustworthiness, the perceived relevance of the guideline recommendations to the individual patient, and the strength of the evidence underlying each recommendation.

### Variceal rebleeding and recurrence after endoscopic injection sclerotherapy… [^1163XqYx]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Hypothesis Eradication of esophageal varices by repeated injection sclerotherapy and maintenance of eradication using continued surveillance endoscopy may reduce recurrent variceal bleeding and death from esophageal varices. Design A prospective study of consecutive adult patients with endoscopically proved esophageal variceal bleeding. Setting A tertiary care university hospital in a metropolitan area. Patients Two hundred four patients underwent 993 emergency and elective variceal endoscopic injection treatments with 5% ethanolamine oleate during 1992 endoscopy sessions. Most had cirrhosis, mainly due to alcohol abuse. Conclusions Repeated injection sclerotherapy eradicated esophageal varices in most long-term patients. Complications related to injection sclerotherapy were mostly minor. Complete eradication of varices reduced rebleeding and death from esophageal varices.

with actively bleeding esophageal varices. 5–12 Even though the initial bleed may effectively be controlled by sclerotherapy, the risk of subsequent rebleeding is substantial. 13–18 There is general consensus that patients surviving a bleeding episode should be treated to prevent rebleeding. 19–21 Considerable evidence has. supported the use of repeated IST to obliterate esophageal varices to prevent further variceal bleeding. 22–27 While undergoing IST before eradication, patients may continue to have variceal bleeds. 28 Repeated injections also increase the cumulative risk of developing complications in patients. 29, 30 The need for repeated. During the 66-month study period, 218 consecutive adult patients were treated for esophageal variceal bleeding. Two hundred four patients were examined.

Fourteen patients were excluded from the study analysis, 13 of whom underwent esophageal transection and gastric devascularization as part of a randomized trial after initial control of acute variceal bleeding by sclerotherapy and 1 who underwent liver transplantation. The sclerosant, 5% ethanolamine oleate, was injected using a combined intravariceal and paravariceal technique. 33 A maximum total volume of 25 mL of sclerosant was injected at any one endoscopy session for control of acute variceal bleeding or when large varices were encountered during elective sclerotherapy. Most had cirrhosis, mainly due to alcohol abuse. When assessed on first admission, 30 patients had Pugh-Child grade A; 91, grade B; and 83, grade C. (The modified Pugh-Child classification comprises ascites, encephalopathy, serum albumin and bilirubin levels, and prothrombin time. Sixty-one patients bled from varices, and 13 bled from nonvariceal sources.

The 61 patients had 86 variceal bleeds that were successfully treated with short-term emergency IST on 61 occasions. The remaining 25 patients with variceal bleeds were not treated by short-term sclerotherapy and were managed with esophageal balloon tamponade followed by subsequent IST. Thirteen patients had 26 bleeding episodes from nonvariceal causes. Nine bleeding episodes were due to bleeding from esophageal injection–induced ulceration and were settled with conservative treatment, which included blood transfusions, intravenous vasopressin, and oral sucralfate. The remaining 17 bleeding episodes were from gastric varices, 4 gastric erosions, 7 portal hypertensive gastropathy, 3 gastric ulceration, 2 or duodenal ulceration.

1. Varices were eradicated in 11 of the 13 patients with primary extrahepatic portal venous obstruction after a mean of 5 injections during a mean of 11 months in the eradicated patients.

### The role of a multidisciplinary team in the management of portal hypertension [^111ADJhR]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

According to the Baveno Consensus, primary prophylaxis for gastroesophageal varices include use of non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) or endoscopic band ligation (EBL), while cyanoacrylate injection should be considered in patients with concurrent or isolated gastric varices. The TIPS procedure may be recommended for patients at high risk of treatment failure. Although the guideline recommendations are based of highly credible clinical studies with promising evidential strength, clinical encounters may not always be straightforward. Patients often have comorbid conditions, which requires well-rounded consideration and prioritization, especially in a complicated disease such a portal hypertension.

To our knowledge, the present study is the first to assess the utility of MDT in the management of gastroesophageal varices secondary to portal hypertension. While many other specialties, especially oncology, have successfully adopted MDT as routine practice for disease management. Since the establishment of MDT clinic at our facility, we have included experts from gastroenterology, interventional radiology, general surgery, diagnostic radiology, diagnostic ultrasound, and consulting pathology to form a joint disease management team, with two scheduled discussion panels every month. Prior to the establishment of MDT, patients with gastroesophageal varices are managed with standardized care in different subspecialties.

The two study cohorts were compared with propensity score matching. Representative indexes were selected as matching indices. However, treatment modalities were not comparable between the two groups. This can be explained by the development and advancements in interventional radiology in recent years. For instance, the TIPS procedure was not routinely implemented in the past, due to technical challenges and high incidence of hepatic encephalopathy. However, in recent years, availability of self-expandable and drug-eluted stents has remarkably decreased procedure associated complications. Another explanation is that some patients were diverted from endoscopic treatment due to high HVPG measurements. Studies have also shown that splenectomy and devascularization surgery were associated with post-operative portal venous thrombosis, making it a less favorable choice for the treatment of portal hypertension. Therefore, an imbalance in treatment method was noted between non-MDT and MDT patients due to evolving medical techniques and a shift in clinical preference over the past decade (Fig. 3). Comparison between two groups showed no difference in overall survival. However, the rate of variceal bleeding was significantly higher in non-MDT patients before and after PSM. Further subgroup analysis showed the different rebleeding rates amongst patients who received different treatment methods, however study results warrants a larger sample size and longer follow-up.

### Safety and efficacy of EUS-guided coil and glue injection for the primary prophylaxis of gastric variceal hemorrhage [^116AWCdc]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Gastric variceal bleeding (GVB) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. EUS-guided coil and cyanoacrylate (CYA) injection (EUS-CCI) has been shown to be an effective therapy in acute bleeding and secondary prophylaxis; however, there is a paucity of data on primary prophylaxis.

Methods

In this single-center observational study, adult patients with high-risk gastric varices (GV; size > 10 mm or cherry red spot) without prior bleeding underwent EUS-CCI for the primary prophylaxis of GVB between June 2009 and December 2019. The primary outcome was post-treatment GVB.

Results

Eighty patients with a mean variceal size of 22.5 ± 9.4 mm and a mean length of follow-up of 3.0 ± 2.4 years were included. The etiology of portal hypertension was cirrhosis in 71 patients (88.7%) and noncirrhotic in 9 (11.3). The mean model for end-stage liver disease score was 12.3 ± 3.7 in patients with cirrhosis. The mean coil number was 1.5 (range, 1–3) and mean glue volume injected 2 mL (range, .5–5). Technical success was achieved in 100%, 96.7% had EUS confirmation of GV obliteration, and 67.7% were obliterated with 1 treatment session. Post-treatment GVB occurred in 2 patients (2.5%) and adverse events in 4 (4.9%). No deaths related to GVB occurred, and emergent transjugular intrahepatic shunts were not needed during the follow-up period.

Conclusions

In patients with high-risk GV, EUS-CCI for primary prophylaxis is highly effective at preventing GVB with a low rate of adverse events. Primary prophylaxis of high-risk GV with coil and CYA glue injection should be considered in centers with the appropriate expertise.

### Endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection versus β-blocker for secondary prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleed: a randomised controlled trial [^114RvSN8]. Gut (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Bleeding from gastric varices is often severe and difficult to manage. Endoscopic injection of gastric varices with cyanoacrylate is effective in prevention of rebleeding. The efficacy of beta-blockers in secondary prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleed has not been well studied. A comparison of the efficacy of beta-blocker treatment and cyanoacrylate injection for the prevention of gastric variceal rebleeding was carried out.

Methods

Patients with gastro-oesophageal varices type 2 (GOV2) with eradicated oesophageal varices or isolated gastric varices type 1 (IGV1) who had bled from gastric varices were randomised to cyanoacrylate injection (n = 33) or beta-blocker treatment (n = 34). Baseline and follow-up upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements were performed. Primary end points were gastric variceal rebleeding or death.

Results

The probability of gastric variceal rebleeding rate in the cyanoacrylate group was significantly lower than in the beta-blocker group (15% vs 55%, p = 0.004) and the mortality rate was lower (3% vs 25%, p = 0.026) during a median follow-up of 26 months. The median baseline and follow-up HVPG in the cyanoacrylate group were 15 (10–23) and 17 (11–24) mm Hg (p = 0.001) and for the beta-blocker group 14 (11–24) and 13 (8–25) mm Hg (p = 0.003). While no patient showed reduction of HVPG in the cyanoacrylate group, in the beta-blocker group 12 of 28 (42%) patients were responders, of which 5 (41% of responders) bled. On multivariate analysis, treatment method, portal hypertensive gastropathy and size of the gastric varix > 20 mm independently correlated with gastric variceal rebleeding. Gastric variceal rebleeding independently correlated with mortality.

Conclusions

Cyanoacrylate injection is more effective than beta-blocker treatment for the prevention of gastric variceal rebleeding and improving survival.

### Endoscopic treatment for gastroesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis: a survey comparing between developed and developing countries [^113t1ySU]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our survey was aimed at exploring the differences between developed and developing countries in terms of their practices for GOV in cirrhosis, which we believe have not been explored before. To our knowledge, this study is the first step in investigating the best approach of primary or secondary prophylaxis for the bleeding of GOV in cirrhosis patients with different geographical, economic, and cultural backgrounds. Despite the existence of endoscopic therapy for several decades, our study identified that further improvements are needed in both the understanding of the indications for this therapy and the technical proficiency required in its clinical practice. It is our contention that the most pressing issue currently is the need to enhance the proficiency of endoscopists and to further improve the medical equipment related to endoscopic therapy, particularly in developing countries. In addition, the findings of the present study showed that while most physicians in developing countries (94.4%) selected tissue adhesive injection as the primary prevention strategy for fundal varices, endoscopists in developed countries made more varied choices. We believe that this difference may be attributed to economic factors and medical resources. This study had several limitations. (1) The research questionnaire was distributed via email and did not encompass a sufficiently large number of countries and subjects, which may have resulted in nonrepresentative data. (2) Given that the capabilities of each center in terms of treatment options vary, some hospitals did not have access to cyanoacrylate or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt/balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration therapy, and the endoscopist's choice of treatment may also be significantly influenced by these technical factors. Taken together, it is not possible to exclude the possible influence of differences in healthcare resources on the results of the study. (3) Individual patient data were not collected in this study, and thus, it was not possible to count the proportion of patients who received different treatment modalities or to evaluate the impact of treatment measures on patient prognosis. (4) Unfortunately, due to the lack of information about the management policies of governments in different regions, we are unable to understand the regional variability in government management and how this informs global health strategies. (5) The selection of countries to participate in the study was not done in a way that would avoid bias resulting from geographical concentration or imbalance of medical resources. Overall, endoscopists in developing and developed countries were found to have different practice patterns. We speculate that these different practice patterns may affect the costs, management of primary bleeding, and chances of rebleeding in GOV. Conversely, continuing education is important for all endoscopists, which can decrease the differences in terms of the preference for endoscopic treatment, which typically result from the differences in training, local practice patterns, and specific equipment in developed and developing countries. However, more clinical research is needed to better explore these differences in the future. We believe that this information will be useful to your readers, endoscopy educators, and researchers around the world.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^117TF9Cu]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Management of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding — NSBBs may be used for primary or secondary variceal bleeding prophylaxis, with propranolol favored in pregnancy, and EVL is preferred for medium or large esophageal varices and should continue until obliteration of varices. For active variceal hemorrhage, immediate resuscitation and stabilization of the mother and emergent endoscopic therapy are required; octreotide or somatostatin should also be initiated, but terlipressin should be avoided because it can cause uterine contractions and reduce uterine blood flow. For antibiotic prophylaxis in acute variceal bleeding, cephalosporins are preferred due to favorable pregnancy and lactation safety data. Options for recurrent or gastric variceal bleeding include cyanoacrylate with or without coiling depending on center expertise, and a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt has been used with success as rescue therapy for uncontrolled GEV bleeding and for decompression of abdominal wall varices before cesarean section when vaginal delivery was contraindicated. Secondary prophylaxis for variceal bleeding includes use of NSBBs and EVL, with the combination preferred.

### Primary prophylaxis against variceal bleeding: β-blockers, endoscopic ligation, or both? [^115jUTbN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is one of the complications of cirrhosis that leads to significant morbidity and mortality. It is recommended that all patients with cirrhosis be screened for gastroesophageal varices and those with large varices should be offered primary prophylaxis. Nonselective beta-blockers (nadolol or propranolol) are the treatment of choice for primary prophylaxis but there are a number of limitations to their use. A number of studies have evaluated the efficacy of variceal band ligation (VBL) in providing primary prophylaxis, either in comparison to no treatment or to beta-blockers. VBL is very effective in preventing the initial bleed when compared to no treatment, but it is not superior to beta-blockers. In this issue of the journal the effect of beta-blockers on bleeding in patients undergoing VBL is examined and no benefit compared to VBL alone is shown. Thus, patients with large varices should be treated with beta-blockers and VBL should be offered to those cirrhotics who are unable to take beta-blockers. Further study is required to determine if VBL in combination with beta-blockers is more effective than the beta-blockers alone.

### Ligation or propranolol for esophageal varices?… [^113SwSG4]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Esophageal varices often spontaneously bleed; this condition is associated with mortality rates of 30 to 70 percent. Consequently, various therapies have been used to treat patients with bleeding from hepatic cirrhosis and large esophageal varices. The most effective medical therapy is use of a nonselective beta blocker, which has been shown to reduce the incidence of first bleeding episodes and bleeding-related mortality. However, side effects often limit the use of these drugs. More aggressive therapies include endoscopic sclerotherapy and variceal ligation. Because of conflicting results in some studies, sclerotherapy is no longer recommended. Sarin and colleagues performed a prospective randomized trial that compared the safety and efficacy of endoscopic ligation and propranolol therapy in the primary prevention of variceal bleeding. Eligible patients included those with portal hypertension and grade 3 or grade 4 varices diagnosed by endoscopy.

None of the patients had a prior history of variceal bleeding. After application of exclusion criteria, patients were randomly assigned at the time of the first endoscopic examination to undergo ligation or receive propranolol. Baseline electrocardiography and cardiac evaluation were performed after 15 minutes of rest. Propranolol was administered in a dose of 40 mg, with monitoring of the heart rate and blood pressure 12 hours and 24 hours after dosing. The dosage of the beta blocker was increased in increments of 20 to 40 mg per day until a 25 percent decrease in baseline heart rate was attained. Treatment was stopped if the heart rate dropped below 55 beats per minute or if the systolic blood pressure was less than 80 mm Hg. Patients assigned to the ligation group underwent ligation at the first endoscopy session or within 24 hours, with as many bands as possible placed in the distal 5 to 7 cm of all variceal columns.

Endoscopic ligation was performed weekly until varices were obliterated or reduced to grade 1 size. After ligation was complete, patients underwent endoscopy monthly for three months, then once every three months until the 18-month end point. Any varices that recurred and became grade 2 or more were treated with repeat ligation. The principle end point of the study, bleeding from the varices, was diagnosed by endoscopy. Serious bleeding was considered to be a volume greater than 1, 500 mL, hemorrhage resulting in a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute, a systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg and the patient's requiring more than 4 units of blood in six hours. Ninety patients were enrolled in the study, with 46 assigned to receive ligation and 44 to propranolol therapy. The mean dose of propranolol was 70 mg per day. In patients receiving ligation, the mean number of endoscopy sessions was 3. 2, which were performed over an average of
4. 1 weeks.

During the study period, four patients in the ligation group and 12 patients in the medication group experienced variceal bleeding. In three of the four patients from the ligation group, the bleeding occurred within the first six weeks, before all of the varices could be eradicated. After 18 months of follow-up, the cumulative risk of bleeding was 43 percent in the propanolol group and 15 percent in the ligation group. Each group had five deaths, all related to liver disorders. The number of deaths related to bleeding was similar between the two groups: three patients in the ligation group and four patients in the propranolol group. No serious complications occurred in the ligation group and, although 16 patients receiving a beta blocker experienced adverse effects, only two patients stopped this therapy. The authors conclude that in patients with significant grade 3 or grade 4 esophageal varices, rubber band ligation is superior to propranolol therapy in preventing primary bleeding.

### Primary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage in children with portal hypertension: a framework for future research [^113n5t42]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Nonselective β-blocker therapy and endoscopic variceal ligation reduce the incidence of variceal hemorrhage in cirrhotic adults, but their use in children is controversial. There are no evidence-based recommendations for the prophylactic management of children at risk of variceal hemorrhage due to the lack of appropriate randomized controlled trials. In a recent gathering of experts at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases annual meeting, significant challenges were identified in attempting to design and implement a clinical trial of primary prophylaxis in children using either of these therapies. These challenges render such a trial unfeasible, primarily due to the large sample size required, inadequate knowledge of appropriate dosing of β-blockers, and difficulty in recruiting to a trial of endoscopic variceal ligation. Pediatric research should focus on addressing questions of natural history and diagnosis of varices, prediction of variceal bleeding, optimal approaches to β-blocker and ligation therapy, and alternative study designs to explore therapeutic efficacy in children.

Surgery

Surgery for portal hypertension should be performed by experienced surgeons in lower-risk patients, ideally in specialist units. Because of the increasing use of simpler endoscopic and radiological procedures as described above, the need for such an intervention has reduced dramatically, and is mainly confined to splenectomy or splenic artery embolisation in patients with splenic vein thrombosis.

Under-running of gastric varices has been shown to control active bleeding but is followed by recurrence of bleeding in 50% of patients and is associated with a perioperative mortality of > 40%. Complete devascularisation of the cardia, stomach and distal oesophagus for bleeding from gastric varices is associated with good control of bleeding but is followed by rebleeding in > 40% of patients and early mortality in about 50%. The use of distal splenorenal shunting for bleeding from gastric varices in patients with cirrhosis was reported in six patients with Child class A or B cirrhosis. Although good control of bleeding was attained, two patients died in the postoperative period. Orloff et al reported that a portal-systemic shunt can be an effective treatment for bleeding varices in patients with portal vein thrombosis and preserved liver function.

Primary prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleeding

A randomised study of 89 patients compared β blockers, cyanoacrylate injection and no active treatment in the primary prevention of bleeding from larger (> 10 mm) GOV-2 and IGV-1. Over a 26-month follow-up period, bleeding occurred in 38%, 10% and 53% of patients in the β blocker, cyanoacrylate and no-treatment groups, respectively. The cyanoacrylate group had significantly lower bleeding rates than the other groups for GOV-2, but not for IGV-1 patients. Mortality was lower in the group treated with cyanoacrylate (7%) than in those given no treatment (26%) but was similar to that in the β blocker group (17%). However, this was a small, single-centre study with an unusually high failure rate for NSBB. Many clinicians have significant concerns about the safety of cyanoacrylate injection in the context of primary prophylaxis.

### Primary prevention of variceal bleeding in people with oesophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^11748oRz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 40% to 95% of people with cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed in about one to three years. There are several different treatments to prevent bleeding, including: beta-blockers, endoscopic sclerotherapy, and variceal band ligation. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their individual and relative benefits and harms.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices in adults with liver cirrhosis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers to December 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previous bleeding from oesophageal varices and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation or previously received prophylactic treatment for oesophageal varices.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. We performed the direct comparisons from randomised clinical trials using the same codes and the same technical details.

Main Results

We included 66 randomised clinical trials (6653 participants) in the review. Sixty trials (6212 participants) provided data for one or more comparisons in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies and those at high risk of bleeding from oesophageal varices. The follow-up in the trials that reported outcomes ranged from 6 months to 60 months. All but one of the trials were at high risk of bias. The interventions compared included beta-blockers, no active intervention, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus nitrates, nitrates, beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy, and portocaval shunt. Overall, 21.2% of participants who received non-selective beta-blockers ('beta-blockers') - the reference treatment (chosen because this was the most common treatment compared in the trials) - died during 8-month to 60-month follow-up. Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and beta-blockers plus nitrates all had lower mortality versus no active intervention (beta-blockers: HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.36 to 0.67; direct comparison HR: 0.59, 95% CrI 0.42 to 0.83; 10 trials, 1200 participants; variceal band ligation: HR 0.51, 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.74; direct comparison HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.12 to 2.14; 3 trials, 355 participants; sclerotherapy: HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.51 to 0.85; direct comparison HR 0.61, 95% CrI 0.41 to 0.90; 18 trials, 1666 participants; beta-blockers plus nitrates: HR 0.41, 95% CrI 0.20 to 0.85; no direct comparison). No trials reported health-related quality of life. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation had a higher number of serious adverse events (number of events) than beta-blockers (rate ratio 10.49, 95% CrI 2.83 to 60.64; 1 trial, 168 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers plus nitrates had a higher number of 'any adverse events (number of participants)' than beta-blockers alone (OR 3.41, 95% CrI 1.11 to 11.28; 1 trial, 57 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, adverse events (number of events) were higher in sclerotherapy than in beta-blockers (rate ratio 2.49, 95% CrI 1.53 to 4.22; direct comparison rate ratio 2.47, 95% CrI 1.27 to 5.06; 2 trials, 90 participants), and in beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation than in beta-blockers (direct comparison rate ratio 1.72, 95% CrI 1.08 to 2.76; 1 trial, 140 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, any variceal bleed was lower in beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation than in beta-blockers (direct comparison HR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.04 to 0.71; 1 trial, 173 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, any variceal bleed was higher in nitrates than beta-blockers (direct comparison HR 6.40, 95% CrI 1.58 to 47.42; 1 trial, 52 participants). The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and beta-blockers plus nitrates may decrease mortality compared to no intervention in people with high-risk oesophageal varices in people with cirrhosis and no previous history of bleeding. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation may result in a higher number of serious adverse events than beta-blockers. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of beta-blockers versus variceal band ligation on variceal bleeding. The evidence also indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in most of the remaining comparisons.

Endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection (ECI) for gastric varices — operator requirements and EUS-guided approach — should only be performed by trained endoscopists with interventional radiology backup; EUS-guided techniques place coils and/or glue but lack direct comparative trials and require further outcomes before routine use can be recommended.

### Variceal bleeding and portal hypertension: still a therapeutic challenge? [^115yFoxT]. Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

In the primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage, beta-blockers continue to be the first-line treatment. Newer nonselective beta-blockers with anti-alpha1-adrenergic activity, such as carvedilol, appear to have a better impact on reducing the hepatic venous pressure gradient than propranolol. The addition of isosorbide mononitrate appears to improve the effectiveness of beta-blockers in primary prophylaxis, but not that of somatostatin in the treatment of acute variceal hemorrhage. The use of vasoactive drugs alone in acute variceal bleeding has not proved to be more effective than endoscopic treatment. The advent of endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) has strengthened the role of endoscopy in the management of bleeding esophageal varices. EVL has improved the results, particularly in terms of lowering the treatment-related morbidity, compared with endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS). However, the variceal recurrence rate after initial eradication with EVL is relatively high. In contrast to synchronous combined therapy with EVL plus EVS, metachronous combination of EVL and low-dose EVS may improve the results of EVL alone. For bleeding fundic varices, obliteration using cyanoacrylate is currently the treatment of choice. Endosonography (EUS) is coming into more widespread use in the assessment of variceal eradication and in further attempts to improve the results of endoscopic injection therapy. According to two meta-analysis studies, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is not yet capable of replacing endoscopic treatment in the secondary prevention of variceal bleeding.

### Diagnosis and management of cirrhosis and its complications… [^116BmY3F]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

The presence of cirrhosis is associated with an increased risk of complications such as liver cancer and decompensation including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal hemorrhage. It is important to evaluate for the presence of cirrhosis in people with risk factors or any diagnosed chronic liver disease. While physical examination findings may be suggestive, it is recommended to stratify risk for all using the FIB-4 followed by elastography for at-risk patients. After identifying patients with cirrhosis, optimal care may involve referral to a hepatologist, liver cancer screening, and consideration of endoscopy for varices screening and/or initiation of nonselective β-blockers. BMI indicates body mass index. Prevention of bleeding: carvedilol, 12.

Prophylactic antibiotics: associated with reduced mortality to 18. 5% vs
22. 2% with placebo in a meta-analysis of randomized trials Secondary prophylaxis with preemptive TIPS: in a randomized trial of 63 patients with acute variceal bleeding, preemptive TIPS within 72 h improved 1-y survival to 86% vs 61% for the control group.

5g/kg, on day 1 and 1 g/kg on day 2 Meropenem and daptomycin for nosocomial SBP Albumin: compared with antibiotics alone, reduces 3-mo mortality in RCT of 126 patients from 41% to 22%; kidney injury occurred in 33% vs 6%. Observational study of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: compared with no treatment, antiviral therapy was associated with a lower risk of HCC, decompensation, and death in people with cirrhosis from Hong Kong, South Korea, and California. Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with cirrhosis develop hepatocellular carcinoma each year, which is associated with a 5-year survival of approximately 20%. In a 3-year randomized clinical trial of 201 patients with portal hypertension, nonselective β-blockers reduced the risk of decompensation or death compared with placebo.

Compared with sequential initiation, combination aldosterone antagonist and loop diuretics were more likely to resolve ascites with lower rates of hyperkalemia. In meta-analyses of randomized trials, lactulose was associated with reduced mortality relative to placebo in randomized trials involving 705 patients and reduced risk of recurrent overt hepatic encephalopathy in randomized trials involving 1415 patients. Outcomes for patients with cirrhosis can be improved with evidence-based therapies directed toward both the etiology of cirrhosis6-12 and its complications. 13–21 Recent innovations include noninvasive risk stratification of cirrhosis22, 23 as well as interventions that improve survival by preventing or reducing the complications of cirrhosis. 24 Such complications include variceal hemorrhage, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. What can be done to improve survival among patients with compensated cirrhosis.

Gastric variceal bleeding — transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and acute endoscopic management — is detailed as follows: TIPS is very effective for bleeding GV with "more than a 90% success rate for initial hemostasis", and in centers with cyanoacrylate expertise "it would be reasonable to reserve TIPS for failures of medical (intravenous vasoconstrictors) plus endoscopic (glue) therapy", although for fundal varices with higher early rebleeding rates TIPS "should be considered earlier than for other types of varices". For acute management, patients who are at acute bleeding from GV "should receive the same treatment as those bleeding from EV (using a restrictive transfusion policy, vasoactive drug infusion, and antibiotic prophylaxis)". In bleeding from GOV1 varices, either endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) if technically feasible or cyanoacrylate glue injection if available "are the recommended endoscopic treatments". "TIPS is the treatment of choice in the control of bleeding from cardiofundal varices (GOV2 or IGV1)". Cyanoacrylate glue injection is an option when TIPS is not technically feasible, but "it is not approved for treatment of GV in the United States and should be performed only in centers where the expertise is available".

Prevention of rebleeding in gastric varices — endoscopic therapy, nonselective beta-blockers (NSBBs), and TIPS — includes the following: In one RCT, "repeated cyanoacrylate injection was superior to NSBB in the prevention of rebleeding and mortality in patients with cardiofundal varices", while in another trial in cardiofundal varices, "addition of NSBBs to cyanoacrylate injection did not improve the rebleeding or mortality rates compared to cyanoacrylate alone". For GOV1 and GOV2 varices, a single randomized trial showed that TIPS "is more effective than glue injection in preventing rebleeding, but with higher rate of encephalopathy and without differences in survival". Guidance states that after a GOV1 hemorrhage, "the combination of NSBBs and endoscopic variceal therapy (EVL or cyanoacrylate injection) is the first-line therapy to prevent rebleeding", and after GOV2 or IGV1 hemorrhage, "TIPS or BRTO are first-line treatments in the prevention of rebleeding", with cyanoacrylate an option when TIPS or BRTO are not technically feasible but "it is not approved for the treatment of GV in the United States and should be performed only in centers where the expertise is available".

### Management of gastric varices [^113JYJez]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

According to their location, gastric varices (GV) are classified as gastroesophageal varices and isolated gastric varices. This review will mainly focus on those GV located in the fundus of the stomach (isolated gastric varices 1 and gastroesophageal varices 2). The 1-year risk of GV bleeding has been reported to be around 10%-16%. Size of GV, presence of red signs, and the degree of liver dysfunction are independent predictors of bleeding. Limited data suggest that tissue adhesives, mainly cyanoacrylate (CA), may be effective and better than propranolol in preventing bleeding from GV. General management of acute GV bleeding must be similar to that of esophageal variceal bleeding, including prophylactic antibiotics, a careful replacement of volemia, and early administration of vasoactive drugs. Small sample-sized randomized controlled trials have shown that tissue adhesives are the therapy of choice for acute GV bleeding. In treatment failures, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is considered the treatment of choice. After initial hemostasis, repeated sessions with CA injections along with nonselective beta-blockers are recommended as secondary prophylaxis; whether CA is superior to TIPS in this scenario is not completely clear. Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) has been introduced as a new method to treat GV. BRTO is also effective and has the potential benefit of increasing portal hepatic blood flow and therefore may be an alternative for patients who may not tolerate TIPS. However, BRTO obliterates spontaneous portosystemic shunts, potentially aggravating portal hypertension and its related complications. The role of BRTO in the management of acute GV bleeding is promising but merits further evaluation.

### PTFE-covered TIPS is an effective treatment for secondary preventing variceal rebleeding in cirrhotic patients with high risks [^111eQfYd]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gasroesophageal variceal bleeding (GEVB) is a major and severe complication of portal hypertension. Patients who survived the first episode of GEVB had a high rebleeding rate (60% in the first year), with a mortality of up to 33%. Therefore, implementation of effective measures to prevent variceal rebleeding should be actively performed in patients with a history of GEVB. According to the clinical practice guidelines, the first-line treatment to prevent recurrent GEVB is endoscopic therapy plus nonselective β-blockers (NSBBs). Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is recommended for patients who failed endoscopic therapy plus NSBBs. However, even with appropriate secondary prophylactic therapy, the rate of gastroesophageal variceal rebleeding remains at a concerning 42–43%. Nowadays, risk stratification, individual management, and multidisciplinary cooperation are gradually becoming the mainstream approaches for treating portal hypertensive bleeding. A previous study had shown that acute GEVB patient with high risk factors of treatment failure can benefit from the early use of TIPS. However, it remains unclear whether patients with high-risk factors of treatment failure for endoscopic therapy plus NSBBs would benefit from using TIPS as the first-line treatment to prevent recurrent GEVB?

Measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is a useful tool to predict prognosis and survival of cirrhotic patients. One-year incidence rate of rebleeding and mortality of acute GEVB in patients with HVPG ≥ 20 mmHg is higher compared with those with a lower HVPG. Prevalence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in cirrhotic patients is about 10–23%. The patient with PVT undergoing endoscopic therapy may need longer time to achieve complete variceal eradication. In addition, NSBBs treatment may induce thrombus formation by reducing splanchnic blood flow and cause further portal vein stasis. The incidence of gastric varices accompanied by gastrorenal shunt (GRS) is up to 65–85%. Endoscopic injection of n -butyl-2-cyanoacrylate or isobutyl-2-cyanoacrylate is used as the standard treatment for gastric varices bleeding. However, due to the coexistence of high flow GRS, severe embolization complications of aberrant organs have raised concerns for the safety of endoscopic glue injection. Extraluminal para-gastric veins (ep-GVs) detected by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) were reported to be associated with a higher variceal rebleeding rate and poor response to endoscopic therapy.

Figure 5
Placement of a total of 11 coils under EUS and fluoroscopic guidance, followed by injection of 12 mL cyanoacrylate glue.

Endoscopic views after intervention demonstrated no active bleeding and a few coils that had partially migrated into the gastric lumen (Fig. 6). The patient's postprocedure hospital course was uneventful, with no clinical evidence of recurrent bleeding. Four days later, repeated EGD and EUS were performed to evaluate the response to therapy and demonstrated stable findings of recent coiling and glue injection. On EUS, postacoustic shadowing from the coils and glue injection were visible, and little to no flow was identified within the treated gastric varices, indicating adequate treatment (Fig. 7). The patient remained in stable condition for the remainder of the hospital course. She was deemed to be in medically stable condition and was transferred back to the local hospital the following day for ongoing care, with the ultimate plan that she would then go home for hospice care.

Figure 6

Figure 7
EUS view showing postacoustic shadowing from coils and glue injection; little to no flow identified within the treated gastric varices, indicating adequate treatment, with the caveat that coil and glue artifact could potentially obscure some areas of vascular flow.

In summary, endoscopic variceal obturation appears to be highly promising in achieving hemostasis in active bleeding and prophylaxis of primary and secondary bleeding. Nonetheless, gastric fundic varices are challenging to manage, and a multidisciplinary approach with careful, extensive discussion must be taken in determining the best treatment option.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^115sneuJ]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Primary prophylaxis to prevent variceal hemorrhage in cACLD: Patients who have decompensated cirrhosis by definition have CSPH, and patients with high-risk varices (moderate/large varices or any size varices with red wale marks or in a patient with CTP C) should undergo primary prophylaxis to prevent variceal bleeding; if the high-risk varices are small, the only method that is technically feasible is the administration of nonselective beta-blocker (NSBB), whereas if the high-risk varices are large, both NSBB as well as EVL are possible approaches; a recent systematic review with network meta-analysis showed a lower risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and a trend for mortality reduction, and administration of carvedilol in patients with high-risk varices and ascites has been associated to improved survival in a prospective study (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.19–0.96) and a retrospective study (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46–0.81).

### Gastric varices: an updated review of management [^113LhK3X]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Gastric varices are less prevalent than esophageal varices, but are associated with an increased mortality with each bleeding episode. This review describes the portal hemodynamics, classification, and management of gastric varices. Management options are outlined based on the most recent literature and according to the clinical presentation of acutely bleeding gastric varices, secondary prophylaxis after bleeding, and primary prophylaxis against an initial bleed. The optimal treatment remains controversial because of the lack of data from large controlled trials. We suggest an algorithm for the management based on the etiology of the gastric varices, severity of the underlying liver disease, and local availability and expertise.

### Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided hemostasis techniques [^115v5yut]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided hemostasis is an evolving technique that has the potential to improve the care of patients with refractory variceal and nonvariceal gastrointestinal bleeding. EUS-guided treatment of fundal varices with coil and/or cyanoacrylate seems to be highly effective in active bleeding, as well as for primary and secondary bleeding prophylaxis. Reports of EUS-guided treatment of refractory nonvariceal sources of bleeding are more scarce, but show high success rates. The procedures involve a medium to high technical difficulty level, and this has been replicated worldwide.

### Endoscopic injection of cyanoacrylate glue versus other endoscopic procedures for acute bleeding gastric varices in people with portal hypertension [^111EXvpT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In people with portal hypertension, gastric varices are less prevalent than oesophageal varices. The risk of bleeding from gastric varices seems to be lower than from oesophageal varices; however, when gastric varices bleed, it is often severe and associated with higher mortality. Endoscopic sclerotherapy of bleeding gastric varices with N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate glue (cyanoacrylate) is considered the best haemostasis with a lower risk of re-bleeding compared with other endoscopic methods. However, there are some inconsistencies between trials regarding mortality, incidence of re-bleeding, and adverse effects.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of sclerotherapy using cyanoacrylate compared with other endoscopic sclerotherapy procedures or with variceal band ligation for treating acute gastric variceal bleeding with or without vasoactive drugs in people with portal hypertension and to assess the best dosage of cyanoacrylate.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded from inception to September 2014 and reference lists of articles. We included trials irrespective of trial setting, language, publication status, or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing sclerotherapy using cyanoacrylate versus other endoscopic methods (sclerotherapy using alcohol-based compounds or endoscopy band ligation) for acute gastric variceal bleeding in people with portal hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed the review following the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Module. We presented results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), with I(2) statistic values as a measure of intertrial heterogeneity. We analysed data with both fixed-effect and random-effects models, and reported the results with random-effects models. We performed subgroup, sensitivity, and trial sequential analyses to evaluate the robustness of the overall results, risk of bias, sources of intertrial heterogeneity, and risk of random errors.

Main Results

We included six randomised clinical trials with three different comparisons: one trial compared two different doses of cyanoacrylate in 91 adults, bleeding actively from all types of gastric varices; one trial compared cyanoacrylate versus alcohol-based compounds in 37 adults with active or acute bleeding from isolated gastric varices only; and four trials compared cyanoacrylate versus endoscopic band ligation in 365 adults, with active or acute bleeding from all types of gastric varices. Main outcomes in the included trials were bleeding-related mortality, failure of intervention, re-bleeding, adverse events, and control of bleeding. Follow-up varied from six to 26 months. The participants included in these trials had chronic liver disease of different severities, were predominantly men, and most were from Eastern countries. We judged all trials at high risk of bias. Application of quality criteria for all outcomes yielded very low quality grade of the evidence in the three analyses, except for the low quality evidence rated for the re-bleeding outcome in the cyanoacrylate versus endoscopic band ligation comparison. Two different doses of cyanoacrylate: we found very low quality evidence from one trial for the effect of 0.5 mL compared with 1.0 mL of cyanoacrylate on all-cause mortality (20/44 (45.5%) with 0.5 mL versus 21/47 (45%) with 1.0 mL; RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.60), 30-day mortality (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.41 to 2.80), failure of intervention (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.56 to 2.05), prevention of re-bleeding (RR 1.30; 95% CI 0.73 to 2.31), adverse events reported as fever (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.98), and control of bleeding (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.38). Cyanoacrylate versus alcohol-based compounds: we found very low quality evidence from one trial for the effect of cyanoacrylate versus alcohol-based compounds on 30-day mortality (2/20 (10%) with cyanoacrylate versus 4/17 (23.5%) with alcohol-based compound; RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.09 to 2.04), failure of intervention (RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.09 to 1.35), prevention of re-bleeding (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.30 to 2.45), adverse events reported as fever (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.80), and control of bleeding (RR 1.79; 95% CI 1.13 to 2.84). Cyanoacrylate versus endoscopic band ligation: we found very low quality evidence for the effect of cyanoacrylate versus endoscopic band ligation on bleeding-related mortality (44/185 (23.7%) with cyanoacrylate versus 50/181 (27.6%) with endoscopic band ligation; RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.31), failure of intervention (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.23 to 5.69), complications (RR 2.81; 95% CI 0.69 to 11.49), and control of bleeding (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.27). There was low quality evidence for the prevention of re-bleeding (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.88). Trial sequential analysis showed that the analyses were underpowered (diversity-adjusted required information size was 5290 participants for bleeding-related mortality).

Authors' Conclusions

This review suggests that endoscopic sclerotherapy using cyanoacrylate may be more effective than endoscopic band ligation in terms of preventing re-bleeding from gastric varices. However, due to the very low quality of the evidence, we are very uncertain about our estimates on all-cause and bleeding-related mortality, failure of intervention, adverse events, and control of bleeding. The trials were at high risk of bias; the number of the included randomised clinical trials and number of participants included in each trial was small; and there was evidence of internal heterogeneity across trials, indirectness of evidence in terms of population, and possible publication bias. The effectiveness of different doses of cyanoacrylate and the comparison of cyanoacrylate versus alcohol compounds to treat variceal bleeding in people with portal hypertension is uncertain due to the very low quality of the evidence. The shortcomings mentioned call for more evidence from larger trials that need to be conducted according to the SPIRIT statement and reported according to CONSORT guidelines.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^113wM4r4]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Gastric and ectopic varices — secondary prophylaxis and comparative interventions: Overall rebleeding rates range from < 10% to as high as 54%. A combination of a local therapy (endoscopic or endovascular) and portal pressure reduction with nonselective beta blockers (NSBB) are recommended, although the beneficial effects of NSBB in secondary prophylaxis of gastric variceal rebleeding have not been specifically studied, and NSBB are not required after TIPS if the portosystemic gradient is reduced to under 12 mm Hg. Endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection (ECI), with or without endoscopic ultrasound guidance and with or without concomitant coils, has been shown to be effective on prevention of rebleeding. In a randomized clinical trial of transvenous obliteration techniques (balloon‑occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration [BRTO] and variants) versus ECI, BRTO showed lower rebleeding, lower hospitalizations, and lower cost compared with ECI in 64 patients with cirrhosis, although no survival benefit was observed. Observational meta‑analysis suggested that BRTO is associated with lower rebleeding than TIPS, and patients who underwent transvenous obliteration had significantly less encephalopathy than those with TIPS. TIPS creation is associated with comparable or lower rebleeding than ECI but with higher rates of hepatic encephalopathy and similar survival, and concurrent variceal obliteration at the time of TIPS further reduces rebleeding and decreases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy.

### Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in cirrhosis [^111RQE44]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is the result of portal hypertension, which is a major complication of liver cirrhosis and carries a high mortality rate. Because of the mortality associated with variceal bleeding, strategies for prevention of the first bleed is important. Risk stratification is important in determining those at risk of bleeding from varices and current data suggest that patients with large varices with red signs, severe underlying liver disease and those who have a hepatic venous pressure gradient of greater than 12 mmHg are at high risk of bleeding. Surveillance for varices in patients with cirrhosis is therefore important. The current review evaluates the role of various treatments in the primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. The current first choice treatment is non-selective beta-blockers; which is cheap, easy to administer, and reduces the risk of first variceal haemorrhage significantly. Combination of beta-blockers and nitrates looks promising but needs further evaluation. Endoscopic variceal band ligation compares favourably with non-selective beta-blockers in preventing the first bleeding episode in cirrhotic patients and may be an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate, or have contraindications to beta-blockers. The role of monitoring the hepatic venous pressure gradient in those being treated with pharmacological agents, the role of newer drugs such as non-selective beta-blockers with intrinsic alpha-adrenergic activity and angiotensin receptor blockers require further evaluation.

### A meta-analysis of endoscopic variceal ligation for primary prophylaxis of esophageal variceal bleeding [^1113TSz7]. Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Despite publication of several randomized trials of prophylactic variceal ligation, the effect on bleeding-related outcomes is unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of the trials, as identified by electronic database searching and cross-referencing. Both investigators independently applied inclusion and exclusion criteria, and abstracted data from each trial. Standard meta-analytic techniques were used to compute relative risks and the number needed to treat (NNT) for first variceal bleed, bleed-related mortality, and all-cause mortality. Among 601 patients in 5 homogeneous trials comparing prophylactic ligation with untreated controls, relative risks of first variceal bleed, bleed-related mortality, and all-cause mortality were 0.36 (0.26–0.50), 0.20 (0.11–0.39), and 0.55 (0.43–0.71), with respective NNTs of 4.1, 6.7, and 5.3. Among 283 subjects from 4 trials comparing ligation with beta-blocker therapy, the relative risk of first variceal bleed was 0.48 (0.24–0.96), with NNT of 13; however, there was no effect on either bleed-related mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.61; confidence interval [CI] 0.20–1.88) or all-cause mortality (RR, 0.95; CI, 0.56–1.62). In conclusion, compared with untreated controls, prophylactic ligation reduces the risks of variceal bleeding and mortality. Compared with beta-blockers, ligation reduces the risk for first variceal bleed but has no effect on mortality. Prophylactic ligation should be considered for patients with large esophageal varices who cannot tolerate beta-blockers. Subsequent research should further compare ligation and beta-blockers to determine the effect on mortality, and measure ligation's cost-effectiveness.

Variceal hemorrhage from gastro-fundal varices (GOV2/IGV1) — after stabilization, patients with uncontrolled bleeding are directed to endovascular treatments; if "RTO not possible or contraindicated", proceed to "TIPS + consideration of embolization", when "Both TIPS and RTO feasible", factors that "Favors TIPS" include "Good liver function", "Large esophageal varices", "Significant ascites", and "Portal vein thrombosis", whereas "Favors RTO" include "Previous HE", "Poor liver function", and "Local experience", and if "TIPS contraindicated", use "RTO". For controlled bleeding, endoscopic/medical therapy with "Repeated cyanoacrylate injection with or without beta-blockers" is used, and "Patients with rebleeding after endoscopic/medical therapy should undergo TIPS or RTO"; initial care notes "General management aimed at stabilization of the patient (endoscopic therapy can be considered in centers with experience)", and selection "depends on the anatomy, clinical profile of the patient, and local expertise".

### A pilot study of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate injection for treatment of gastric fundal varices in humans [^115yiQop]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

N-butyl cyanoacrylate injection has been shown to be effective and safe for the endoscopic treatment of gastric varices. N-butyl cyanoacrylate is not available in the United States, but use of a similar agent, 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, recently was approved for skin closure. This pilot study prospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate injection for treatment of gastric fundal varices.

Methods

Twenty-five patients with large gastric fundal varices with either stigmata of recent hemorrhage, a history of bleeding, or high-risk varices underwent intravariceal injection of undiluted 2-octyl cyanoacrylate. The end points for this study were cessation of active bleeding, successful obliteration of visible varices, and prevention of bleeding.

Results

Within 2 weeks of treatment, 52% of patients had a history of significant variceal bleeding, and 12% had active gastric variceal bleeding at the time of injection. The rate of immediate hemostasis was 100%. Gastric variceal bleeding recurred in 4% of patients (mean follow-up 11 months). The overall mortality rate was 12%; the bleeding-related mortality rate was 4%.

Conclusions

Injection of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate appears to be efficacious and safe for both prevention and control of gastric variceal hemorrhage. Larger studies are required to further establish the use of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate for treatment of gastric fundal varices.

### Secondary prevention of variceal bleeding in adults with previous oesophageal variceal bleeding due to decompensated liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^115BJRLq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 40% to 95% of people with cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed in about one to three years of diagnosis. Several different treatments are available, which include endoscopic sclerotherapy, variceal band ligation, beta-blockers, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and surgical portocaval shunts, among others. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their individual and relative benefits and harms.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different initial treatments for secondary prevention of variceal bleeding in adults with previous oesophageal variceal bleeding due to decompensated liver cirrhosis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for secondary prevention according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until December 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and a previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had no previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices, previous history of bleeding only from gastric varices, those who failed previous treatment (refractory bleeding), those who had acute bleeding at the time of treatment, and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR) and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance.

Main Results

We included a total of 48 randomised clinical trials (3526 participants) in the review. Forty-six trials (3442 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies. The follow-up ranged from two months to 61 months. All the trials were at high risk of bias. A total of 12 interventions were compared in these trials (sclerotherapy, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy, no active intervention, TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt), beta-blockers plus nitrates, portocaval shunt, sclerotherapy plus variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus nitrates plus variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy plus nitrates). Overall, 22.5% of the trial participants who received the reference treatment (chosen because this was the commonest treatment compared in the trials) of sclerotherapy died during the follow-up period ranging from two months to 61 months. There was considerable uncertainty in the effects of interventions on mortality. Accordingly, none of the interventions showed superiority over another. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation may result in fewer serious adverse events (number of people) than sclerotherapy (OR 0.19; 95% CrI 0.06 to 0.54; 1 trial; 100 participants). Based on low or very low-certainty evidence, the adverse events (number of participants) and adverse events (number of events) may be different across many comparisons; however, these differences are due to very small trials at high risk of bias showing large differences in some comparisons leading to many differences despite absence of direct evidence. Based on low-certainty evidence, TIPS may result in large decrease in symptomatic rebleed than variceal band ligation (HR 0.12; 95% CrI 0.03 to 0.41; 1 trial; 58 participants). Based on moderate-certainty evidence, any variceal rebleed was probably lower in sclerotherapy than in no active intervention (HR 0.62; 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.99, direct comparison HR 0.66; 95% CrI 0.11 to 3.13; 3 trials; 296 participants), beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy than sclerotherapy alone (HR 0.60; 95% CrI 0.37 to 0.95; direct comparison HR 0.50; 95% CrI 0.07 to 2.96; 4 trials; 231 participants); TIPS than sclerotherapy (HR 0.18; 95% CrI 0.08 to 0.38; direct comparison HR 0.22; 95% CrI 0.01 to 7.51; 2 trials; 109 participants), and in portocaval shunt than sclerotherapy (HR 0.21; 95% CrI 0.05 to 0.77; no direct comparison) groups. Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers alone and TIPS might result in more, other compensation, events than sclerotherapy (rate ratio 2.37; 95% CrI 1.35 to 4.67; 1 trial; 65 participants and rate ratio 2.30; 95% CrI 1.20 to 4.65; 2 trials; 109 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions including those related to beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation in the remaining comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions on mortality. Variceal band ligation might result in fewer serious adverse events than sclerotherapy. TIPS might result in a large decrease in symptomatic rebleed than variceal band ligation. Sclerotherapy probably results in fewer 'any' variceal rebleeding than no active intervention. Beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy and TIPS probably result in fewer 'any' variceal rebleeding than sclerotherapy. Beta-blockers alone and TIPS might result in more other compensation events than sclerotherapy. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons. Accordingly, high-quality randomised comparative clinical trials are needed.

### Endoscopy management algorithms: role of cyanoacrylate glue injection and self-expanding metal stents in acute variceal haemorrhage [^115w62JU]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Evidence for cyanoacrylate in GVB

There has been a number of small non-randomised studies, mainly case series, of GVB treated with cyanoacrylate glue therapy. Collectively, in over 1000 reported cases, active variceal bleeding was arrested in 93–100%, with rates of recurrent bleeding around 10%.

In a case series of 34 (n = 34) patients receiving primary glue therapy for AVB, 93.8% achieved immediate haemostasis with variceal obliteration in 84%. Only 11.8% (n = 4) re-bled within 48 h, and a superior mesenteric vein thrombosis complicated one case. There was a treatment failure-related mortality of only 2.1% (n = 1), with 82.4% (n = 28) of patients alive at the end of follow-up.

Similarly, Jaber Al-Ali et al reported 95% primary haemostasis with cyanoacrylate glue injection in 37 (n = 37) cases of GVB. Early or late rebleeding occurred in only 8% (n = 3) and 28% (n = 10), respectively, and all 'non-life-threatening'. Over 14 months follow-up (achieved in 79%), all-cause mortality rate was 28.6% (n = 11), with no significant cyanoacrylate injection-related complications.

Rajoriya et al, reported 100% primary haemostasis with cyanoacrylate glue injection in 31 (n = 31) GVB patients with more advanced disease (CPS B/C) and active bleeding (58% periprocedure). Over the 35-month mean follow-up (57 months for survivors), rebleeding rate was 10% at 1 year and 16% in total. Thirteen per cent required subsequent TIPS, with 1 and 2-year mortality of 23% and 35%, respectively.

### Carvedilol for prevention of variceal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115jXime]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, carvedilol is a safe and efficacious treatment option for the primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. In addition, it may also delay variceal progression. However, our confidence in these conclusions is very low, given the imprecision, heterogeneity and potential risk of bias of the available evidence. This underlines the need for adequately powered, high-quality clinical trials.

Carvedilol's efficacy in the context of secondary prevention of variceal bleeding is under consideration
Randomized controlled trials present data regarding its efficacy and safety

What the new findings are:

Carvedilol is equally efficacious to endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL), for both primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding
Very low-quality evidence indicates that carvedilol reduces all-cause mortality compared to EVL in patients with a previous history of variceal bleeding
Very low-quality evidence suggests that carvedilol is as efficacious as propranolol for the prevention of variceal rebleeding after variceal eradication
