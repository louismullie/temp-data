## Question

is tms contraindicated following a stroke

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), including repetitive TMS (rTMS), is contraindicated after stroke and, if not absolutely, what the key relative contraindications and safety considerations are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between absolute versus relative contraindications in post-stroke populations. Then, I should verify safety data across acute, subacute, and chronic phases of stroke. Next, I will examine common trial exclusion criteria that function as de facto relative contraindications. After that, I need to check seizure risk and monitoring requirements. Finally, I will integrate protocol considerations and practical screening steps to guide patient selection and risk mitigation, and I will reconcile any conflicting efficacy and safety signals from the literature.

> Let me first confirm the definitional frame, because if I misclassify "absolute" versus "relative", I might draw the wrong clinical conclusion. An absolute contraindication would preclude TMS under any circumstance, whereas a relative contraindication would allow TMS when benefits outweigh risks with appropriate precautions, and in stroke populations the published safety literature generally treats risk amplifiers as relative rather than absolute, with adverse events like seizures being rare but possible and typically protocol dependent, aligning with general TMS safety discussions in neurologic rehabilitation contexts and disorders of consciousness work that emphasizes screening for seizure propensity before rTMS use [^117VoQEd].

> Now, to the bottom line answer, but I should not jump ahead without checking stroke-specific data. The aggregate stroke literature does not support an absolute contraindication to TMS after stroke; rather, it supports feasibility and acceptable safety under controlled protocols across subacute and chronic phases, with signals of potential benefit in some domains and neutral findings in others, and with monitoring for adverse events as standard practice [^111ju2co] [^11177n5i] [^114aiCYz] [^116XpMuB].

> Wait, let me verify the de facto "relative contraindications" reflected by exclusion criteria in stroke studies, because those often guide real-world screening. In a subacute ischemic stroke cohort treated with ipsilesional high-frequency rTMS within days of onset, investigators excluded cortical infarctions, disturbances of consciousness, and age over 80 years, operationalizing these as safety-related constraints while observing no seizures or NIHSS worsening under the applied protocol, which argues for feasibility in carefully selected subcortical and clinically stable patients rather than a blanket prohibition after stroke [^111ju2co]. Separately, a TMS–EEG study of chronic ischemic stroke excluded individuals with a history of seizures, severe systemic impairment, age over 80, and those taking benzodiazepines, baclofen, or antidepressants, again underscoring relative cautions around seizure risk, frailty, and medications that alter cortical excitability rather than an absolute ban [^111J3kXg].

> Seizure risk is the pivotal safety concern, so I should double-check how often seizures occur and under what circumstances. Broad neurorehabilitation safety summaries note that rTMS adverse effects are generally mild and that seizures are very rare but warrant pre-treatment screening for overt or subclinical epileptiform tendencies, which is especially salient after brain injury and guides conservative dosing and supervised early sessions, a principle that reasonably extends to stroke safety paradigms even though the evidence base is heterogeneous [^117VoQEd]. Importantly, stroke-specific reports in subacute and chronic phases repeatedly observed no seizures under standard protocols, though sample sizes were modest, so the absence of events should be interpreted as low observed risk rather than zero risk, with one practical implication being to conduct initial treatments in supervised settings where the first-exposure seizure risk, if present, would be most likely to manifest and be managed, a strategy echoed in device safety discussions of supervised initial dosing [^111ju2co] [^11177n5i] [^116uMW77].

> Hold on, I should verify safety signals across stroke phases rather than assume uniformity. In the subacute period, ipsilesional high-frequency rTMS initiated around day 9 showed no epilepsy events and no NIHSS exacerbations, supporting feasibility with careful selection and monitoring in early recovery, albeit with exclusions that limit generalizability to older adults and cortical infarcts [^111ju2co]. Early post-stroke low-frequency contralesional rTMS in a pilot randomized trial was feasible with high compliance and produced no serious intervention-related adverse events, further supporting early-phase safety under controlled conditions, though again with small samples and protocolized dosing [^112qxk8h]. In chronic stroke, high-frequency ipsilesional protocols were well tolerated without new neurologic symptoms in small series, with only minor physiological changes such as a small, transient systolic blood pressure increase, reinforcing that adverse effects are typically mild and manageable under study conditions [^11177n5i].

> Next, I should review efficacy heterogeneity alongside safety so I do not conflate "safe" with "effective". Large multicenter work with 1 Hz contralesional stimulation combined with therapy showed no superiority over sham on the primary motor outcome despite overall gains in both groups, yet safety was acceptable across 199 randomized participants, indicating that neutral efficacy does not equate to safety concerns under standardized protocols [^114aiCYz]. Conversely, smaller randomized and pilot trials suggested motor improvements with both ipsilesional excitatory and contralesional inhibitory strategies, again with no significant safety red flags in selected cohorts, which supports the notion that TMS can be used safely while efficacy remains variable and mechanism- and phenotype-dependent [^116XpMuB] [^114cfiSZ].

> I need to ensure we consider domain-specific applications beyond upper limb motor outcomes, since safety considerations might vary with target and protocol. Systematic reviews and network meta-analyses suggest rTMS combined with rehabilitation is associated with improvements in gait speed, cadence, and balance without consistent safety concerns above background rates, though trial quality varies and protocols are heterogeneous, reinforcing that safety is acceptable in aggregate while benefit is modest and protocol-dependent [^114rQmpw]. For aphasia, meta-analyses indicate low-frequency rTMS may improve language measures with reports of safety across included trials, but the overall quality of evidence is low, so treatment should proceed within structured programs that track adverse events and functional gains explicitly [^116apqRv] [^111KjUUU].

> But wait, what about diagnostic and biomarker uses of TMS and TMS–EEG after stroke; do those alter safety calculus. TMS and TMS–EEG have been used to phenotype corticospinal integrity and interhemispheric dynamics in acute and chronic stroke, including in patients without recordable MEPs, offering mechanistic insights without identifying a prohibitive safety signal when standard precautions are followed, which further supports that TMS exposure per se is not absolutely contraindicated after stroke when appropriately applied and monitored [^116d1Ps7] [^111Cjyyi] [^112HoUuz].

> I should also acknowledge a potential pitfall in interpretation, and correct it explicitly. Initially, one might read the subacute exclusion of cortical infarctions as implying an absolute contraindication to TMS in cortical strokes, but hold on, that was a trial-specific safety boundary within days of onset and does not establish a universal absolute ban; rather, it signals higher theoretical seizure risk and the need for additional caution and evidence before generalizing to this subgroup, keeping such cortical presentations in the realm of relative contraindication where individualized risk–benefit and protocol tailoring are needed [^111ju2co]. This aligns with broader neuromodulation perspectives emphasizing personalized dosing, target selection, and timing to improve safety and effectiveness post-stroke [^115gJTY7].

> Let me now synthesize practical screening and monitoring steps while staying reference-aware. I should confirm absence of uncontrolled or recent seizures and consider EEG or neurologist input when risk is unclear, given the centrality of seizure screening in brain-injured populations receiving rTMS, and I should favor supervised initial sessions because early exposures appear to carry the highest relative seizure risk in broader device experience, even though overall risk is low with guideline-concordant dosing [^117VoQEd] [^116uMW77]. I need to check for factors commonly excluded in studies such as advanced age over 80, significant disturbances of consciousness, and medications that substantially alter cortical excitability, recognizing these as relative risk enhancers that warrant individualized judgment rather than automatic exclusion, and I should monitor for transient autonomic changes such as small blood pressure increases and track neurologic status with simple scales like NIHSS during early treatment blocks [^111ju2co] [^111J3kXg] [^11177n5i].

> In closing, I should double-check that my conclusion matches the evidence trail. TMS is not absolutely contraindicated after stroke; instead, it has a generally acceptable safety profile under controlled protocols across subacute and chronic phases, with seizure risk being low but nonzero and with relative contraindications stemming from seizure history, early cortical infarction, reduced consciousness, advanced age, and medications affecting cortical excitability that were often excluded from studies, all of which call for careful screening, supervised initiation, and individualized parameter selection rather than categorical avoidance [^111ju2co] [^111J3kXg] [^117VoQEd] [^114aiCYz].

No, TMS is **not absolutely contraindicated** after stroke [^115gJTY7], but it should be used with caution and only after careful screening for seizure risk, unstable medical conditions, or intracranial metal. The main concern is **seizure risk**, which is low but higher in stroke patients than the general population. TMS is generally safe and well tolerated in stroke rehabilitation [^111ju2co], with most adverse events being mild and transient [^11177n5i]; however, it should be avoided in patients with a history of seizures, unstable cardiovascular status, or intracranial metal implants. Clinical judgment and individualized risk assessment are essential before initiating TMS in stroke patients [^116vrifA].

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

TMS is generally considered safe for stroke patients, but certain **risks and adverse events** have been reported:

- **Seizures**: The most significant risk associated with TMS is seizure induction. Although rare, the risk is slightly elevated in stroke patients due to underlying brain injury and potential cortical hyperexcitability.

- **Headaches and scalp discomfort**: Mild headaches and scalp discomfort are common but typically transient and manageable [^115gJTY7].

- **Transient neurological symptoms**: Temporary neurological symptoms, such as mild cognitive or motor disturbances, have been reported but are generally short-lived [^113dVZgo].

- **Cardiovascular considerations**: Stroke patients with unstable cardiovascular conditions may be at increased risk during TMS sessions due to potential autonomic fluctuations [^11177n5i].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

While TMS is not absolutely contraindicated after stroke, certain conditions require caution or may preclude its use. A history of seizures or epilepsy is a **relative contraindication** requiring careful risk assessment; unstable cardiovascular conditions are contraindications until stabilized. Intracranial metal implants are contraindicated due to the risk of heating or movement. Severe cognitive impairment warrants caution, as symptoms may be exacerbated [^115gJTY7]. In the acute phase of stroke (within 48 hours), TMS is generally avoided until the patient is stabilized.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements provide the following **recommendations** for TMS after stroke:

- **Patient selection**: Careful patient selection and individualized risk assessment are essential before initiating TMS therapy [^113dVZgo].

- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of neurological and cardiovascular status during TMS sessions is recommended.

- **Protocol selection**: Low-frequency TMS protocols (≤ 1 Hz) are generally considered safer and may be preferred in stroke patients, particularly in the subacute phase.

- **Combination with rehabilitation**: TMS is often combined with conventional rehabilitation therapies to enhance functional recovery [^114rQmpw].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Several clinical studies have investigated the **safety and efficacy** of TMS in stroke patients:

- **Motor recovery**: TMS has been shown to improve motor function and reduce disability in stroke patients [^116XpMuB], with minimal adverse events reported [^117LCCD3].

- **Aphasia**: TMS has demonstrated beneficial effects in improving language function in post-stroke aphasia patients [^116apqRv], with no significant adverse events reported.

- **Depression**: TMS has been effective in treating post-stroke depression, with transient and minor adverse events reported [^113KSEhf].

---

## Summary of evidence

TMS demonstrates **favorable safety and efficacy** across applications, including motor recovery, aphasia, and depression.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

TMS is **not absolutely contraindicated** after stroke [^115gJTY7], but **careful patient selection, an individualized risk assessment, and adherence to clinical guidelines** are essential [^113dVZgo]. The primary concern is **seizure risk**, which is low but slightly higher in stroke patients than in the general population. TMS is generally safe and well tolerated, with most adverse events being mild and transient [^111ju2co]. Clinicians should exercise caution in patients with a history of seizures, unstable cardiovascular conditions, or intracranial metal implants.

### Effects and safety of high-frequency rTMS in subacute ischemic stroke patients [^111ju2co]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2024). High credibility.

Although high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) has shown benefits in chronic stroke, its application in subacute ischemic stroke remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate the effects and safety of lesion-side HF-rTMS in subacute ischemic stroke patients.

- **Methods**: Prospective lesion-side HF-rTMS was conducted on consecutive ischemic stroke patients within 3 days of onset from February 2019 to June 2022. Inclusion criteria required persistent paralysis (NIHSS score ≥ 1 for at least 7 days). Exclusion criteria comprised cortical infarction, disturbance of consciousness, and age over 80 years. A conventional rehabilitation group meeting the same criteria from June 2015 to January 2019 served as a comparison. We compared the two groups regarding clinical background and outcome. We also evaluated the incidence of epilepsy and exacerbation of the NIHSS score in the rTMS group.

- **Results**: Seventy-eight patients participated, with 50% in the HF-rTMS group. Median time from onset to HF-rTMS initiation was 9 (IQR 7–12) days. A favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0–2) at 3 months was more frequent in the rTMS group (80% vs. 44%, p = 0.002). HF-rTMS was independently associated with a favorable outcome at 3 months (OR = 5.60, 95% CI = 1.53–20.50, p = 0.009). No cases of epilepsy or exacerbation of NIHSS score were observed.

HF-rTMS demonstrates potential effectiveness and safety in subacute ischemic stroke patients.

### Safety and behavioral effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in stroke [^11177n5i]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Electromagnetic brain stimulation might have value to reduce motor deficits after stroke. The safety and behavioral effects of higher frequencies of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) require detailed assessment.

- **Methods**: Using an active treatment-only, unblinded, two-center study design, patients with chronic stroke received 20 minutes of 20 Hz rTMS to the ipsilesional primary motor cortex hand area. Patients were assessed before, during the hour after, and one week after rTMS.

- **Results**: The 12 patients were 4.7 ± 4.9 years post-stroke (mean ± SD) with moderate-severe arm motor deficits. In terms of safety, rTMS was well tolerated and did not cause new symptoms. Systolic blood pressure increased from pre- to immediately post-rTMS by 7 mm Hg (P = 0.043); none of the behavioral measures showed a decrement. In terms of behavioral effects, modest improvements were seen in grip strength, range of motion, and pegboard performance, up to one week after rTMS. The strongest predictor of these motor gains was lower patient age.

- **Conclusions**: A single session of high-frequency rTMS to the motor cortex was safe. These results require verification with the addition of a placebo group, thus necessitating blinded assessments across a wide spectrum of post-stroke deficits and with larger doses of 20 Hz rTMS.

### Randomized sham-controlled trial of navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for motor recovery in stroke [^114aiCYz]. Stroke (2018). High credibility.

We aimed to determine whether low-frequency, electric field-navigated, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to the non-injured motor cortex versus sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, avoiding the motor cortex, could improve arm motor function in hemiplegic stroke patients when combined with motor training.

Twelve outpatient US rehabilitation centers enrolled participants between May 2014 and December 2015. We delivered 1 Hz active or sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to the non-injured motor cortex before each of eighteen 60-minute therapy sessions over a 6-week period, with outcomes measured at 1 week, and 1, 3, and 6 months after the end of treatment.

- **Primary end point**: The primary endpoint was the percentage of participants improving ≥ 5 points on the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer score 6 months after the end of treatment.

- **Secondary analyses**: Secondary analyses assessed changes on the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer, the Action Research Arm Test, and the Wolf Motor Function Test, alongside safety.

Results showed that of 199 participants, 167 completed treatment and follow-up due to the early discontinuation of data collection. Upper extremity Fugl-Meyer gains were significant for both the experimental (P < 0.001) and sham groups (P < 0.001). Sixty-seven percent of the experimental group (95% CI, 58%-75%) and 65% of the sham group (95% CI, 52%-76%) improved by ≥ 5 points on the 6-month upper extremity Fugl-Meyer (P = 0.76). There was also no difference between experimental and sham groups in the Action Research Arm Test (P = 0.80) or the Wolf Motor Function Test (P = 0.55). A total of 26 serious adverse events occurred in 18 participants.

### Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on walking and balance function after stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113gL6SP]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on walking and balance function in patients with stroke.

- **Design**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database were comprehensively searched for randomized controlled trials published through March 2017 that investigated the effects of rTMS on lower limb function. Main outcomes included walking speed, balance function, motor function, and cortical excitability.

- **Results**: Nine studies were included. The meta-analysis revealed a significant effect of rTMS on walking speed (standardized mean difference, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.32–0.95), particularly ipsilesional stimulation (standardized mean difference, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.36–1.24). No significant effects were found for balance function (standardized mean difference, 0.10; 95% CI, -0.26 to 0.45), motor function (mean difference, 0.50; 95% CI, -0.68 to 1.68), or cortical excitability (motor-evoked potentials of the affected hemisphere: mean difference, 0.21 mV; 95% CI, -0.11 to 0.54; motor-evoked potentials of the unaffected hemisphere: mean difference, 0.09 mV; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.02).

- **Conclusion**: These results suggest that rTMS, particularly ipsilesional stimulation, significantly improves walking speed. Future studies with larger sample sizes and an adequate follow-up period are required to further understand the effects of rTMS on lower limb function and its relationship with changes in cortical excitability.

### Does repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation have a beneficial effect on improving unilateral spatial neglect caused by stroke? A meta-analysis [^111s56rG]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Data extraction was managed using Endnote version 21. The extracted data included the first author, publication year, number of participants, mean age, sex, nature of lesion, stroke duration, treatment protocol, combined intervention, class of studies, outcome measures, pre- and post-treatment means, mean change score, and standard deviations for outcome measures.

All included studies were classified into four classes based on the criteria used in the clinical guideline by Lefaucheur et al. If the mean and standard deviation were not provided in the study, but the median and range of the score were available, the mean was calculated using the formula: mean = (a + 2m + b)/4 (where a is the smallest value, b is the largest value, and m is the median); the standard deviation was calculated using the interquartile range/4.

- **Quality and risk-of-bias assessment**: The PEDro scale was used to evaluate the reporting quality of the methodology. The scale consists of 11 items, with the first item assessing the external validity of a study and the remaining items assessing internal validity. The PEDro Scale was scored from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher research quality. A total score falling within the range of zero to three indicates low methodological quality, while a score of four-to-five accounts for moderate quality. When the score is between six and eight, the quality is considered good. A score of nine or ten suggests excellent quality. Two authors (RL and LZ) independently rated the PEDro scores for each study, and any disagreements were resolved through discussion with a senior reviewer.

### Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for improving activities of daily living, and physical and cognitive functioning, in people after stroke [^115UB7qs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Functional impairment, resulting in poor performance in activities of daily living (ADLs) among stroke survivors, is common. Rehabilitation approaches have limited effectiveness in improving ADL performance, function, muscle strength, and cognitive abilities (including spatial neglect) after stroke. However, a possible adjunct to stroke rehabilitation might be non-invasive brain stimulation by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate cortical excitability and, hence, improve ADL performance, arm and leg function, muscle strength, and cognitive abilities (including spatial neglect), as well as manage dropouts and adverse events in people after stroke.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of tDCS on ADLs, arm and leg function, muscle strength, and cognitive abilities (including spatial neglect), as well as manage dropouts and adverse events in people after stroke.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (February 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library; 2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to February 2015), EMBASE (1980 to February 2015), CINAHL (1982 to February 2015), AMED (1985 to February 2015), Science Citation Index (1899 to February 2015), and four additional databases. In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials, we searched trials registers and reference lists, handsearched conference proceedings, and contacted authors and equipment manufacturers.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute ischemic stroke, particularly thrombectomy within 0–6 hours from onset, the AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend considering mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever. This is specifically for carefully selected patients with AIS with causative occlusion of the anterior cerebral arteries, vertebral arteries, basilar artery, or posterior cerebral arteries, provided that treatment can be initiated (groin puncture) within 6 hours of symptom onset.

### Evidence for interhemispheric imbalance in stroke patients as revealed by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography [^116d1Ps7]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Low credibility.

The study examines the local and global transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked cortical responses after stimulating the affected hemisphere (AH) and unaffected hemisphere (UH) in stroke patients.

- **Local cortical response**: TMS-evoked activity and cortical oscillations are evoked over primary motor cortices (M1).
- **Global cortical response**: TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) are recorded over the entire scalp, with the scalp voltage distribution observed at the three main peaks of activity (20–40 ms, 40–70 ms, and 70–150 ms).

For healthy controls (HC), both the local and global TMS-evoked cortical responses are also examined after stimulation of the two hemispheres.

- **Local cortical response**: Displays TMS-evoked activity and cortical oscillations over M1.
- **Global cortical response**: TEPs are recorded over the scalp with voltage distribution at the three main peaks of activity (20–40 ms, 40–70 ms, and 70–150 ms).

### A sham-controlled trial of a 5-day course of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the unaffected hemisphere in stroke patients [^113yrmMi]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

It has been recently shown that a single session of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the unaffected hemisphere can improve motor function in stroke patients; however, this improvement is short-lasting. We therefore conducted a randomized, sham-controlled, phase II trial to evaluate whether five sessions of low-frequency rTMS can increase the magnitude and duration of these effects and whether this approach is safe.

- **Methods**: Fifteen patients with chronic stroke were randomized to receive active or sham rTMS of the unaffected hemisphere. A blinded rater assessed motor function and corticospinal excitability at baseline, during, and after 2 weeks of treatment. Safety was assessed using a neuropsychologic battery and electroencephalogram.

- **Results**: Active rTMS resulted in a significant improvement of the motor function performance in the affected hand that lasted for 2 weeks. These effects were not observed in the sham rTMS group (affected and unaffected hand) or in the unaffected hand in the active rTMS group. Corticospinal excitability decreased in the stimulated, unaffected hemisphere and increased in the affected hemisphere. There was a significant correlation between motor function improvement and corticospinal excitability change in the affected hemisphere. Cognitive performance and electroencephalogram were not changed significantly throughout the trial in both groups of treatment.

- **Conclusions**: These results support and extend the findings of previous studies on rTMS in stroke patients because five consecutive sessions of rTMS led to sustained improvement in motor function.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to indications for thrombectomy (0–6 hours from onset), AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend considering mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever in carefully selected patients. These are patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery segment 2 (M2) or middle cerebral artery segment 3 (M3), if treatment can be initiated (groin puncture) within 6 hours of symptom onset.

### Reliability of transcranial magnetic stimulation induced corticomotor excitability measurements for a hand muscle in healthy and chronic stroke subjects [^112HoUuz]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used to evaluate neuroplastic changes in the brain in clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to establish the test-retest reliability of four TMS measures of corticomotor excitability for the corticospinal projections to the first dorsal interosseous of the contralateral hand. The measures include:

- **Resting motor threshold**
- **Slope of input-output curve**
- **Peak motor evoked potential amplitude**
- **Cortical silent period duration**:

Fourteen healthy subjects (mean age 27.4 years) and 27 subjects with stroke-induced upper limb hemiparesis (mean age 61.3 years) completed two repeated assessment sessions one week apart. The stroke subjects demonstrated good to excellent test-retest reliability of the TMS measurements for both hemispheres, with ICC ≥ 0.88. In healthy subjects, measurement reliability was good (ICC ≥ 0.75) for all four outcome measures. Interestingly, while the standard error of measurements for outcome measures (1) to (3) was similar in both hemispheres for stroke subjects, the cortical silent period duration was notably larger in magnitude in the lesioned hemisphere. The test-retest reliability coefficients determined for the four corticomotor excitability measurements facilitated the estimation of 95% minimal detectable changes of these outcome variables for the respective subject group in future clinical trials.

### Priming with 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over contralesional leg motor cortex does not increase the rate of regaining ambulation within 3 months of stroke: A randomized controlled trial [^111PA6mL]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2018). High credibility.

The potential benefits of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), applied either alone or as a combination treatment, on recovery of lower limbs after stroke have been insufficiently studied.

- **Objective**: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of priming with 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the contralesional leg motor area using a double-cone coil before physical therapy on regaining ambulation.

- **Methods**: Thirty-eight subacute stroke patients with significant leg disabilities were randomly assigned into the experimental group or control group to receive a 15-minute real or sham 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, respectively, over the contralesional motor cortex representing the quadriceps muscle followed by 45-minute physical therapy for 15 sessions over 3 weeks. Functional measures, motor evoked potentials, and quality of life were assessed.

- **Results**: There was no significant difference between the experimental group and control group regarding recovery in ambulation, balance, motor functions, and activity of daily living. No significant difference was found in other functional measures and the quality of life. Only the control group displayed significantly increased cortical excitability of the contralesional hemisphere after the intervention.

- **Conclusions**: The present study found insufficient evidence that contralesional priming with 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation improves ambulatory and other motor functions among patients with severe leg dysfunction in subacute stroke.

### Assessment of inter-hemispheric imbalance using imaging and noninvasive brain stimulation in patients with chronic stroke [^115FC3JQ]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

To determine how interhemispheric balance in stroke, measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), relates to balance defined using neuroimaging — functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) — and how these metrics of balance are associated with clinical measures of upper-limb function and disability.

The study utilized a cross-sectional design within a laboratory setting, involving patients with chronic stroke (N = 10; age, 63 ± 9 years) in a population-based sample displaying unilateral upper-limb paresis.

Interhemispheric balance was explored using TMS, fMRI, and DTI:

- **TMS**: Defined interhemispheric differences in corticospinal output recruitment, corticomotor output maps, and mutual transcallosal inhibition.
- **fMRI**: Examined lateralization of cortical activation during paretic hand movements to the ipsilesional or contralesional primary motor cortex (M1), premotor cortex (PMC), and supplementary motor cortex (SMA).
- **DTI**: Assessed interhemispheric differences in the integrity of corticospinal tracts projecting from M1.

Clinical outcomes measured included upper extremity function using the Fugl-Meyer assessment (UEFM) and perceived disability with the Motor Activity Log (MAL) amount score.

Results indicated that interhemispheric balance assessed with TMS showed different relationships to fMRI and DTI metrics. Specifically, patients with high fMRI lateralization to the ipsilesional hemisphere possessed stronger ipsilesional corticomotor output maps (M1: r = .831).

### Noninvasive neuromodulation combined with rehabilitation therapy improves balance and gait speed in patients with stroke: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114rQmpw]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2024). High credibility.

This study aimed to determine how repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct stimulation, and cranial nerve noninvasive neuromodulation affect functional balance, gait speed, and walking cadence in stroke patients.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus (June 22, 2022) for randomized controlled trials. Three reviewers independently performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias. Network and pairwise meta-analyses were conducted to assess indirect and direct comparisons.

- **Results**: We included 34 studies (N = 915 patients), with sixty percent exhibiting moderate-to-high methodological quality. The meta-analyses demonstrated positive effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with rehabilitation therapy compared to sham on gait speed, walking cadence, and balance function. The weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were 0.08 (0.03 to 0.13), 7.16 (3.217 to 11.103), and 3.05 (0.52 to 5.57), respectively. Transcranial direct stimulation showed improvement on the time up and go test (-0.88 [-1.68 to -0.08]). In the surface under the cumulative ranking analyses, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is the best-ranked treatment for gait speed and functional balance improvement compared with transcranial direct stimulation and sham interventions. There were not enough studies to include cranial nerve noninvasive neuromodulation in the meta-analysis.

- **Conclusions**: Walking cadence, speed, and functional balance significantly improved after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation at 1Hz and 5Hz produces sustained improvement in motor function and disability after ischaemic stroke [^116XpMuB]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). High credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a simple and non-invasive method of augmenting motor recovery after stroke, probably mediated by restoring inter-hemispheric activation balance. This placebo-controlled pilot study examined the possible benefit of stimulating the lesioned hemisphere (5-Hz rTMS) or inhibiting the contra-lesional hemisphere (1-Hz rTMS) on clinical recovery of motor function in patients with ischaemic stroke and assessed the sustainability of the response.

- **Methods**: Sixty patients with ischaemic stroke (> 1 month from onset) with mild-to-moderate hemiparesis were randomized to receive 10 daily sessions of either sham rTMS, 5-Hz ipsi-lesional rTMS, or 1-Hz contra-lesional rTMS, in addition to a standard physical therapy protocol. Serial assessments were made over a period of 12 weeks using the thumb-index finger tapping test (FT), Activity Index (AI) score, and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).

- **Results**: In contrast to control patients, those receiving active rTMS as ipsi-lesional 5-Hz stimulation or 1-Hz contra-lesional stimulation showed statistically significant improvement on the FT test, AI scores, and mRS score at 2 weeks, and the effect was sustained over the 12-week observation period. No significant adverse events were observed during treatment in either group.

- **Conclusions**: Repetitive TMS has beneficial effects on motor recovery that can be translated to clinically meaningful improvement in disability in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis, with a well-sustained effect.

### Exploring research trends and focal points in the application of transcranial magnetic stimulation for enhancing motor function in post-stroke patients: A bibliometric and content analytical approach [^115cK7G3]. Injury (2023). Low credibility.

Motor impairment is a significant health concern among post-stroke patients. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is considered an emerging rehabilitation therapy for various neurological conditions, and the effects of excitatory TMS on post-stroke recovery have received much attention in the past decade. However, future hotspots and a comprehensive analysis of growth trends have not been studied. This bibliometric and content analysis aimed to study the global developmental history and status of TMS for motor function in post-stroke patients from January 2004 to July 2023.

- **Methods**: Literature published in the Scopus database from January 2004 to July 2023 was searched. The extracted data was analyzed using R Studio and VOS Viewer for author publications, institutions, sources, keyword co-occurrence, and world network analysis. Keyword cluster analysis, co-citation analysis for references, and content analysis were also performed. The top 10 most cited or collaborative areas for publications, institutions, and sources associated with TMS and motor function in post-stroke patients were screened.

- **Results**: A comprehensive analysis of 267 publications was conducted, revealing a substantial surge in research output throughout 2022. China emerged as the leading contributor, with 409 publications, followed by the United States with 211 publications. Notably, Harvard Medical School stood out as one of the most prolific institutions, accounting for 34 publications (13.12%). Among researchers, Abo M garnered the highest publication count, with 9 articles (14.5%).

### Evidence for interhemispheric imbalance in stroke patients as revealed by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography [^112qNfpj]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Low credibility.

So far, TMS studies investigating interhemispheric dynamics following a stroke event have succeeded in testing only a minority of patients with recordable MEPs, leading to variable results [Borich et al, 2015; Bütefisch et al, 2008; Cassidy et al, 2015; Dimyan et al, 2014; Stinear et al, 2015]. In our corticospinal evaluation, more than 70% of our sample of patients did not show a stable and sufficiently large MEP for the evaluation of IHI nor for the intracortical circuits from the AH. Although this might seem surprising, such a high percentage of cases with no recordable MEPs is due to our recruitment of patients with hemiparesis caused by subcortical or cortical lesions in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. Previously, TMS studies focused mostly on milder subcortical stroke patients with a recordable MEP [Borich et al, 2015; Bütefisch et al, 2008; Cassidy et al, 2015; Dimyan et al, 2014; Stinear et al, 2015]. On the other hand, by using TMS–EEG, we were able to collect stable measures from both hemispheres of all patients. Importantly, although a statistical trend can be observed (p = 0.07), the cortical activation of the AH and UH, when directly stimulated, did not differ, in agreement with previous studies [Koch et al, 2019; Pellicciari et al, 2018]. On the other hand, as previously observed, cortical activity in both hemispheres of stroke patients was generally lower compared to HC, likely due to altered excitability in the stimulated neuronal populations and in their cortico‐cortical connections [Pellicciari et al, 2018].

### Therapeutic trial of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation after acute ischemic stroke [^111UbG2s]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or sham stimulation was administered over the motor cortex daily for 10 days to two randomly assigned groups of 26 patients with acute ischemic stroke. Patients continued their normal treatment regimen otherwise. Disability scales measured before rTMS, at the end of the last rTMS session, and again 10 days later showed that real rTMS improved patients' scores more than sham.

### Using transcranial magnetic stimulation of the undamaged brain to identify lesion sites that predict language outcome after stroke [^111JEsMD]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Regions of interest from data-driven analyses

Four types of regions were generated to best account for the presence or absence of phonological impairments according to the presence or absence of damage:

- **TMS-guided regions**: The TMS-guided regions were based on two different LOMs (from patients in Sample 1). One for those who had phonological impairments following above-threshold damage (see below for critical damage thresholds) to the 0.5 cm³ TMS SMG region and one for those who had phonological impairments following above-threshold damage to the 0.5 cm³ TMS pOp region. The new TMS-guided regions included the grey and white matter around the original TMS sites that was most consistently damaged in the LOMs. For pOp, the new region extended to 20.6 cm³ and was 100% damaged in 12/13 of the patients with lesions to the original TMS pOp region and phonological impairments. For SMG, the new region extended to 24.9 cm³ and was at least 85% damaged in 11/12 of the patients with lesions to the original TMS SMG region and phonological impairments.

- **Functional MRI-guided regions**: These were identified in the same way as the TMS-guided regions, with the only exception that patients (from Sample 1) with damage to spherical regions of interest centred on the mean functional MRI coordinates (−52, 6, 20 for pOp and −51, −32, 42 for SMG) were used.

### Pharmacological, psychological, and non-invasive brain stimulation interventions for treating depression after stroke [^1161s9fm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Depression is an important morbidity associated with stroke that impacts recovery, yet it is often undetected or inadequately treated. This document is an update and expansion of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004 and updated in 2008.

- **Primary objective**: To determine whether pharmacological therapy, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or combinations of these interventions reduce the prevalence of diagnosable depression after stroke.

- **Secondary objectives**: To determine whether pharmacological therapy, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or combinations of these interventions reduce levels of depressive symptoms, improve physical and neurological function and health-related quality of life, and reduce dependency after stroke. Furthermore, to assess the safety of and adherence to such treatments.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Stroke and Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis (last searched August 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1966 to August 2018), Embase (1980 to August 2018), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to August 2018), PsycINFO (1967 to August 2018), and Web of Science (2002 to August 2018). We also searched reference lists, clinical trial registers (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) to August 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov to August 2018), conference proceedings, and contacted study authors.

### Brain responsivity provides an individual readout for motor recovery after stroke [^113AjnyH]. Brain (2020). High credibility.

TMS-EEG enriches the methodological repertoire in the assessment of stroke patients as it relies less on the participant's ability to understand and comply with instructions, nor does it involve the processing of sensory stimuli or performing an action, which is necessary in particular for task functional MRI studies. TMS-EEG, therefore, allows for a standardized assessment of stroke patients and holds the potential to provide novel markers of stroke pathophysiology with practical implications concerning the assessment, monitoring, and potentially also the enhancement of rehabilitation. In this vein, it may also offer a personalized readout for targeting and titrating interventions such as neuromodulation that aim at restoring connectivity and complex patterns of activity.

### Interrogating cortical function with transcranial magnetic stimulation: Insights from neurodegenerative disease and stroke [^115aVd9S]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an accessible, non-invasive technique to study cortical function in vivo. TMS studies have provided important pathophysiological insights across a range of neurodegenerative disorders and enhanced our understanding of brain reorganisation after stroke.

In neurodegenerative disease, TMS has offered novel insights into the function of cortical output cells and the related intracortical interneuronal networks. Key examples where TMS has advanced understanding include the characterization of cortical hyperexcitability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, altered motor cortical function in frontotemporal dementia, and demonstration of cholinergic deficits in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. These insights hold potential for diagnostic applications by elucidating disease pathophysiology and potential mechanisms of propagation.

In stroke, TMS methodology has facilitated understanding of the cortical reorganisation underlying functional recovery. These insights are crucial for developing effective and targeted rehabilitation strategies post-stroke.

The present review provides an overview of cortical function measures obtained using TMS and how these measures may inform brain function. By enhancing our understanding of cortical function across neurodegenerative disorders and identifying neural structure and function changes associated with stroke that underlie clinical recovery, more targeted therapeutic approaches can now be developed in the evolving era of precision medicine.

### Evidence of rTMS for motor or cognitive stroke recovery: Hype or hope [^113dVZgo]. Stroke (2023). Low credibility.

Evidence of the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for stroke recovery is hampered by unexplained variability of reported effect sizes and an insufficient understanding of mechanisms of action. We aimed to briefly summarize evidence of efficacy, identify critical factors to explain the reported variation in effects, and provide mechanism-based recommendations for future trials.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review of the literature according to Cochrane and PRISMA protocols. Trials with ≥ 10 patients per treatment group were included. Outcome measures were classified according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. Meta-analysis was conducted when at least three trials reported on the same construct. In cases of significant summary effect sizes with significant heterogeneity, sensitivity analyses were used to test for correlations and differences between found individual effect sizes and possible effect modifiers such as patient characteristics, rTMS characteristics, and trial characteristics.

- **Results**: We included 57 articles (N = 2595). Funnel plots showed no publication bias. Significant effect sizes were found at the level of body function (upper limb synergies, muscle strength, language functioning, global cognitive functioning, visual/spatial inattention) with rTMS within or beyond 3 months after stroke. Significant effect sizes were also found at the level of activities. No subgroup differences or significant correlations between individual effect sizes and possible effect modifiers were found.

### Hand function improvement with low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the unaffected hemisphere in a severe case of stroke [^1177QHXn]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Previous research has shown that low-frequency rTMS of the unaffected hemisphere can improve motor function in acute and chronic stroke patients. However, these studies only investigated patients with mild or moderate motor deficits. We report a case of a stroke patient with a severe motor impairment who underwent sham and active repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the unaffected hemisphere and had significantly improved motor function after active, but not after sham, stimulation of the unaffected primary motor cortex. In an additional session of active rTMS, this patient maintained and further enhanced the initial motor improvement. This case report shows that inhibitory rTMS of the unaffected hemisphere can also be beneficial for stroke patients with severe motor deficits and suggests that this approach of noninvasive brain stimulation should be further investigated in this population of patients.

### Invasive cortical stimulation to promote recovery of function after stroke: A critical appraisal [^112GvsmZ]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Residual motor deficits frequently linger following a stroke; thus, the search for newer effective strategies to promote functional recovery is ongoing. Brain stimulation, used to direct adaptive plasticity, is an appealing approach. Animal studies and Phase I and II trials in humans have demonstrated the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of combining rehabilitation with invasive cortical stimulation. However, a recent Phase III trial showed no advantage of this combination. We critically review results from various trials and discuss factors that may have contributed to the distinctive outcome.

- **Summary of review**: Regarding cortical stimulation, it is critical to determine (1) the location of peri-infarct representations by integrating multiple neuroanatomical and physiological techniques, (2) the role of other mechanisms in stroke recovery, (3) the viability of peri-infarct tissue and descending pathways, (4) lesion geometry to ensure no alteration or displacement of density, and (5) the applicability of lessons from noninvasive brain stimulation studies in humans. In terms of combining stimulation with rehabilitation, it is essential to understand (1) the principle of homeostatic plasticity, (2) the effect of ongoing cortical activity and phases of learning, and (3) the necessity of subject-specific interventions.

Future cortical stimulation trials should consider the factors that may have contributed to the peculiar results of the Phase III trial and address those factors in future study designs.

### A systematic review of noninvasive brain stimulation for post-stroke depression [^113orBUg]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Post-stroke depression (PSD) is among the most frequent neuropsychiatric consequences of stroke, negatively affecting the patient's functional recovery and quality of life. While pharmacological therapy has limited efficacy and important side effects, new appropriate treatments based on specific physiological mechanisms for PSD remain to be developed. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, modulating brain plasticity, might offer valid, alternative strategies.

- **Methods**: We systematically searched four databases — MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, and Web of Science — up to December 2017, using definite keywords, to identify studies on TMS and tDCS treatment for PSD.

- **Results**: Seven studies met the inclusion criteria, and the results indicate that both tDCS and rTMS are safe and have very low side effects. The reported positive results, suggesting that these methods can be considered effective therapeutic options, are questionable, and a general statement about their efficacy for PSD is premature due to small sample sizes, heterogeneous methodologies, lack of uniform diagnostic criteria, and divergent data.

- **Limitations**: The selected articles lack information about quality of life and daily living performance measures; in addition, the number of randomized controlled trials is small.

- **Conclusion**: The aim of this review was to analyze research in the clinical use of noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) in PSD treatment in order to verify whether there are alternative perspectives in the treatment of PSD. Given the present evidence, additional research is needed to establish the efficacy of NIBS for PSD.

### Inhibition of ipsilesional M1 β oscillations by contralesional M1 following acute ischemic stroke: A TMS-EEG study [^113pu5f7]. Stroke (2025). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate neurophysiological mechanisms underlying functional impairment and recovery after acute ischemic stroke using transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography, focusing on interhemispheric interactions and oscillatory dynamics.

- **Methods**: This single-center case-control study (December 2022 to May 2024) included 19 ischemic stroke patients within 14 days of symptom onset (mean age, 47.95 ± 12.41 years; 15 [79%] men) with 3-month poststroke follow-up. Sixteen age-matched healthy controls (53.56 ± 9.83 years; 12 [80%] men) were included. Transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked electroencephalography potentials, local mean field power during 25 ms and 35 ms (local mean field power 25–35 ms), and power spectral density of the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (ilM1) were calculated when single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation was sequentially applied to the contralesional M1 (clM1) and ilM1. Spearman correlation analysis evaluated associations between transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography parameters and clinical outcomes: Fugl-Meyer assessment, Fugl-Meyer assessment-upper extremity subscale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale changes from baseline to 3 months poststroke.

- **Results**: Stroke patients exhibited simplified transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked electroencephalography potential waveforms with reduced amplitudes compared with healthy controls. The contralesional resting motor threshold of stroke patients was s

### Preliminary guidelines for safe and effective use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury [^111PTY8N]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation has generated extensive interest within the traumatic brain injury (TBI) rehabilitation community, but little work has been done with repetitive protocols, which can produce prolonged changes in behavior. This is partly because of concerns about the safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in subjects with TBI, particularly the risk of seizures. These risks can be minimized by careful selection of the rTMS protocol and exclusion criteria.

In this article, we identify guidelines for safe use of rTMS in subjects with TBI based on a review of the literature and illustrate their application with a case study: Our subject is a 48-year-old man who sustained a severe TBI 5 years prior to beginning rTMS for the treatment of post-TBI depression. After a 4-week baseline period, we administered daily sessions of low-frequency stimulation to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 6 weeks. After stimulation, we performed monthly assessments for 3 months. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was our primary outcome measure. The stimulation was well tolerated, and the patient reported no side effects. After 6 weeks of stimulation, the patient's depression was slightly improved, and these improvements continued through follow-up. At the end of follow-up, the patient's HAMD score was 49% of the average baseline score.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation in mild to severe hemiparesis early after stroke: a proof of principle and novel approach to improve motor function [^112qxk8h]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the unaffected hemisphere can enhance the function of the paretic hand in patients with mild motor impairment. However, the effects of low-frequency rTMS to the contralesional motor cortex at an early stage of mild to severe hemiparesis after stroke are unknown. In this pilot, randomized, double-blind clinical trial, we compared the effects of low-frequency rTMS or sham rTMS as add-on therapies to customary outpatient rehabilitation in 30 patients, within 5–45 days after ischemic stroke, and with mild to severe hand paresis.

- **Primary feasibility outcome**: Compliance with the interventions was the primary feasibility outcome. Compliance was 100% in the active group and 94% in the sham group.

- **Primary safety outcome**: The proportion of intervention-related adverse events was the primary safety outcome. There were no serious intervention-related adverse events.

- **Secondary outcomes**: Performance of the paretic hand in the Jebsen-Taylor test and pinch strength were secondary outcomes. Significant improvements were observed in the active group in the Jebsen-Taylor test (mean improvement of 12.3%, 1 month after treatment) and pinch force (mean improvement of 0.5 Newtons), but not in the sham group.

Outcomes were assessed at baseline, after ten treatment sessions administered over two weeks, and at one month post-treatment. Baseline clinical features were comparable across groups. Low-frequency rTMS to the contralesional motor cortex early after stroke is feasible, safe, and potentially effective for improving the function of the paretic hand in patients with mild to severe hemiparesis.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex after stroke: a focused review [^1155cQ7B]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2012). Low credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is known to modulate cortical excitability and has been suggested as a therapeutic approach to improve the efficacy of rehabilitation for motor recovery after stroke. Stroke not only affects cortical excitability but may also alter the balance of transcallosal inhibitory pathways between motor primary areas in both hemispheres. The affected hemisphere (AH) may be disrupted by the infarct itself and by asymmetric inhibition from the unaffected hemisphere, further reducing the excitability of the AH. Conceptually, rTMS could be used therapeutically to restore the balance of interhemispheric inhibition after stroke.

rTMS has been employed in two main ways: low-frequency stimulation (≤ 1 Hz) to the motor cortex of the unaffected hemisphere to reduce excitability of the contralesional hemisphere, and high-frequency stimulation (> 1 Hz) to the motor cortex of the AH to increase excitability of the ipsilesional hemisphere. This systematic review aims to collate evidence on the safety and efficacy of high-frequency rTMS to the motor cortex of the AH. The studies included investigated the effects of rTMS on the excitability of corticospinal pathways and upper-limb motor function in adults after stroke.

This review suggests that rTMS applied to the AH is a safe technique and could be considered an effective approach for modulating brain function and contributing to motor recovery after stroke. Although the studies included in this review provide important insights, further research is warranted to confirm these findings.

- **Results**

- **Recruitment and retention**: We screened 97 potential participants for eligibility between May 2021 and May 2023, with follow-up completed in August 2023. Of those, 44 eligible participants consented to the trial and were randomized (Figure 1). One participant in the rTMS group withdrew before starting the intervention, and one participant from each group was lost to follow-up at the 15-week interval.

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The average age at intervention was 63.4 years (SD = 12.3), and the mean time since stroke was 4.0 years (SD = 3.7). Groups were broadly similar at baseline, although the rTMS group was more fluent compared with sham, as measured by the WAB bedside test. In addition, lesion volumes and locations were similar between groups (Figure 2).

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation for post-operative neurorehabilitation in neuro-oncology: A review of the literature and future directions [^117EdfKn]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a neuromodulation technology capable of targeted stimulation and inhibition of cortical areas. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders, and novel uses of rTMS for neurorehabilitation in patients with acute and chronic neurologic deficits are being investigated. However, studies at the time of writing have primarily focused on neurorehabilitation in stroke patients, with little data supporting its use for neurorehabilitation in brain tumor patients.

- **Methods**: We performed a review of the available literature regarding uses of rTMS for neurorehabilitation in post-operative neuro-oncologic patients.

- **Results**: Data have demonstrated that rTMS is safe in the post-operative neuro-oncologic patient population, with minimal adverse effects and no documented seizures. The evidence also demonstrates potential effectiveness in terms of neurorehabilitation of motor and language deficits.

- **Conclusions**: Although data are overall limited, both safety and effectiveness have been demonstrated for the use of rTMS for neurorehabilitation in the neuro-oncologic population. More randomized controlled trials and specific comparisons of contralateral versus ipsilateral rTMS protocols should be explored. Further work may also focus on individualized, patient-specific TMS treatment protocols for optimal functional recovery.

### Can transcranial direct current stimulation enhance poststroke motor recovery? Development of a theoretical patient-tailored model [^115UG7go]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

New treatments that can facilitate neural repair and reduce persistent impairments have significant value in promoting recovery following stroke. One technique that has gained interest is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), as early research suggested it could enhance plasticity and enable greater behavioral recovery. However, several studies have now identified substantial intersubject variability in response to tDCS, and clinical trials revealed insufficient evidence of treatment effectiveness. A possible explanation for the varied and negative findings is that the physiologic model of stroke recovery that researchers have used to guide the application of tDCS-based treatments is overly simplistic and does not account for stroke heterogeneity or known determinants that affect the tDCS response.

We propose that tDCS could have a more clearly beneficial role in enhancing stroke recovery if greater consideration is given to individualizing treatment. By critically reviewing the proposed mechanisms of tDCS, stroke physiology across the recovery continuum, and known determinants of tDCS response, we propose a new, theoretical, patient-tailored approach to delivering tDCS after stroke. The proposed model includes a step-by-step principled selection strategy for identifying optimal neuromodulation targets and outlines key areas for further investigation. Tailoring tDCS treatment to individual neuroanatomy and physiology is likely our best chance at producing robust and meaningful clinical benefit for individuals with stroke.

### Cortical activation changes underlying stimulation-induced behavioural gains in chronic stroke [^111fpenF]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Transcranial direct stimulation, a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, is showing increasing promise as an adjunct therapy in rehabilitation following stroke. However, although significant behavioural improvements have been reported in proof-of-principle studies, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The rationale for transcranial direct stimulation as therapy for stroke is that therapeutic stimulation paradigms increase activity in ipsilesional motor cortical areas, but this has not previously been directly tested for conventional electrode placements.

This study was performed to test directly whether increases in ipsilesional cortical activation with transcranial direct stimulation are associated with behavioural improvements in chronic stroke patients. Patients at least six months post-first stroke participated in a behavioural experiment (n = 13) or a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment (n = 11), each investigating the effects of three stimulation conditions in separate sessions: anodal stimulation to the ipsilesional hemisphere, cathodal stimulation to the contralesional hemisphere, and sham stimulation.

Anodal (facilitatory) stimulation to the ipsilesional hemisphere led to significant improvements (5–10%) in response times with the affected hand in both experiments. This improvement was associated with an increase in movement-related cortical activity in the stimulated primary motor cortex and functionally interconnected regions. Cathodal (inhibitory) stimulation to the contralesional hemisphere led to a functional improvement.

### Absence of a transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced lower limb corticomotor response does not affect walking speed in chronic stroke survivors [^116K4ZtR]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation is used to measure the functional integrity of the corticomotor system via motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in stroke. The association between corticomotor mechanisms and walking recovery is still not completely understood. This study determined the association between transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced MEPs and walking outcomes and examined the contribution of the contralesional hemisphere to walking recovery.

- **Methods**: Contralateral and ipsilateral transcranial magnetic stimulation responses from the contralesional and ipsilesional hemispheres were collected from 61 chronic stroke survivors. Clinical assessments included gait speeds, 6-minute walk distance, Timed Up and Go test, Fugl Meyer lower extremity scale, and strength measurements.

- **Results**: Stroke participants were classified based on the presence (MEP+ [n = 28]) or absence (MEP- [n = 33]) of MEPs in the paretic tibialis anterior and rectus femoris muscles. Between-group analyses showed no significant differences for any gait variable. The MEP+ group showed significantly higher Fugl Meyer lower extremity and ankle dorsiflexor strength. Ipsilateral conductivity was not significantly different between groups. Finally, in the MEP+ group, MEP parameters did not predict gait recovery.

- **Conclusions**: Our study investigated the association between walking outcomes and neurophysiological parameters of lower limb function in a large cohort of stroke survivors. We did not find associations between transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced tibialis anterior and rectus femoris muscle response and walking recovery.

### Therapies to restore consciousness in patients with severe brain injuries: A gap analysis and future directions [^117VoQEd]. Neurocritical Care (2021). High credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation consists of oscillating currents passed through a metal coil, creating a fluctuating magnetic field at the surface of the skull which induces an electric field in a volume of brain tissue. Like other means of electrically stimulating the CNS, a wide range of stimulation parameters can be adjusted, with some patterns modeled after neural oscillations, such as theta burst stimulation. TMS has been applied over multiple cortical regions, including prefrontal, parietal, motor, and occipital cortices.

Evidence of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) efficacy has been demonstrated for the following disorders: neuropathic pain, depression, stroke, fibromyalgia, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and posttraumatic stress disorder. For patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC), a few randomized controlled trials using 20-Hz stimulation over the motor cortex have been conducted, without significant evidence of neurobehavioral improvements. Other stimulation sites, including the prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus, have not yet been tested with control groups. TMS can also be used in conjunction with EEG as a diagnostic tool to measure brain complexity, an approach that holds potential as a neurophysiologic biomarker of treatment effect in patients with DoC.

The most common adverse effects of rTMS are transient headaches, local discomfort in the targeted area, dizziness, and, very rarely, seizures. It is important to screen for potential (subclinical) seizures in patients with DoC prior to rTMS treatment.

### Using transcranial magnetic stimulation of the undamaged brain to identify lesion sites that predict language outcome after stroke [^11616kqL]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

By additionally including a second sample of patients (those who were > 5 years post-stroke), we were also able to show that lesions to the TMS-guided regions explained phonological impairments in a new sample better than lesions to the original TMS regions. This indicates that phonological impairments were, in part, caused by damage to the white matter underlying the original TMS regions, and it raises the possibility that the effect of TMS in healthy participants might also be emerging from disruption to much more extensive areas than the recorded site of stimulation. Indeed, prior studies have already claimed that the effect of TMS is not limited to the cortical mantle but spreads through the network. Further analyses of lesion sites are needed to determine whether phonological impairments result from damage to the cortex only, underlying white matter only, or both. The results might also offer new insights into how TMS affects phonological processing in healthy participants.

In summary, prior TMS studies have shown that pOp and SMG contribute to the speed of phonological processing but were not able to test whether these regions are essential for generating accurate responses. The novel contribution of the study is to identify the extent of pOp and SMG damage that impairs accurate phonological processing, even years after stroke. Our findings demonstrate that the pOp and SMG regions we have identified play a unique role in phonological processing that cannot typically be subsumed by other brain areas.

### Bilateral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation improves lower-limb motor function in subjects with chronic stroke: A randomized controlled trial [^113NMESj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). High credibility.

Clinical studies have consistently demonstrated that bilateral motor training is beneficial and superior to unilateral or conventional training for the recovery of motor control, muscle strength, the kinematics of upper limb movement, hand dexterity, and upper-limb function after stroke. In addition, Sasaki and colleagues reported that high-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation over the cortical motor areas that represent both legs led to significantly greater improvement in the Brunnstrom Recovery Stage score than sham stimulation in subjects with acute stroke.

The mechanisms mediating the effects of bilateral intervention in subjects with stroke include:

- **Rebalancing interhemispheric inhibition**
- **Activating homologous neural networks in both hemispheres**
- **Recruiting neural networks of the contralesional hemisphere**

Use of transcranial magnetic stimulation in subjects with stroke, where the maximum voluntary contraction of the nonparetic hand is combined with a less-forceful contraction of the paretic hand, increased the cortical excitability of the ipsilesional motor representation area of the hand compared with contraction of the paretic hand alone. Grefkes and colleagues used functional magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic causal modeling to demonstrate positive neural coupling between the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1) and the contralesional motor-related areas during bilateral synchronized hand movements in subjects with stroke.

### Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on aphasia in stroke patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116apqRv]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effects and safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on aphasia in stroke patients, we searched databases from inception to January 28, 2021. Randomized control trials investigating the effects and safety of rTMS for aphasia patients after stroke were included. Study screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.3 software, and the quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE).

Twenty-eight studies with 1,287 patients were included. All studies were assessed with a low or unclear risk of bias in one or more domains. The meta-analysis demonstrated that rTMS was more effective than sham rTMS and conventional rehabilitation in language recovery. Specifically, low-frequency rTMS showed greater improvement in language recovery, except for comprehension, when compared to sham rTMS. Both low-frequency and bilateral rTMS were superior to conventional rehabilitation in enhancing language recovery. High-frequency rTMS did not show superiority over sham rTMS and conventional rehabilitation for improving aphasia. Notably, rTMS had better effects in naming, comprehension, and aphasia quotient at 20 sessions. Eleven studies reported that rTMS was safe for aphasia patients after stroke. However, the quality of evidence for all outcomes was low or very low, and publication bias may exist.

In conclusion, rTMS may be relatively effective and safe for aphasia patients after stroke. However, these findings should be treated with caution due to high potential bias and low quality of evidence.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for improving function after stroke [^116vrifA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

It had been assumed that suppressing the undamaged contralesional motor cortex by repetitive low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), or increasing the excitability of the damaged hemisphere cortex by high-frequency rTMS, will promote function recovery after stroke.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of rTMS for improving function in people with stroke.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (April 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 4), the Chinese Stroke Trials Register (April 2012), MEDLINE (1950 to May 2012), EMBASE (1980 to May 2012), Science Citation Index (1981 to April 2012), Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (1990 to April 2012), CINAHL (1982 to May 2012), AMED (1985 to May 2012), PEDro (April 2012), REHABDATA (April 2012), and CIRRIE Database of International Rehabilitation Research (April 2012). In addition, we searched five Chinese databases, ongoing trials registers, and relevant reference lists.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials comparing rTMS therapy with sham therapy or no therapy. We excluded trials that reported only laboratory parameters.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality, and extracted the data. We resolved disagreements by discussion.

- **Main results**: We included 19 trials involving a total of 588 participants in this review. Two heterogenous trials with a total of 183 participants showed that rTMS treatment was not a…

### Brain responsivity provides an individual readout for motor recovery after stroke [^111Cjyyi]. Brain (2020). Low credibility.

Evaluating the TMS-evoked EEG responses in stroke patients within the first 2 weeks post-stroke revealed mainly two starkly different natures of response morphologies triggered by TMS (Fig. 1). In the majority of patients, i.e. 21, TMS elicited a differentiated and sustained EEG response with a sequence of positive and negative deflections in both hemispheres, which persisted up to 300 ms post-stimulus and was associated with rapidly changing patterns of bi-hemispheric activation, comparable to the response observed in the healthy comparison group.

By contrast, in a subgroup of seven severely affected patients, TMS over the affected M1 evoked a slow, strongly simplified, and biphasic response with high amplitudes. This large wave lasted approximately 100 ms, and further TMS-locked activity was almost absent. Additionally, evoked activity remained local under the site of stimulation over ipsilesional M1. In this case, the complete elimination of the characteristic TEP components of healthy subjects hindered the classification of specific components. Hereafter, we do not refer to TEP components but to an early response lasting 100 ms and a later response phase.

These different patterns of TMS-EEG responses, such as simple biphasic and more differentiated patterns, could also be identified in the subgroup of patients with no evocable MEPs (Fig. 2). Hence, TMS-EEG is capable of disclosing differential motor cortex properties in patients with no residual motor function and severely disrupted corticospinal integrity.

### Reliability of TMS motor evoked potentials in quadriceps of subjects with chronic hemiparesis after stroke [^1149V35c]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) non-invasively measures the excitability of central motor pathways in humans and is used to characterize neuroplasticity after stroke. Using TMS to index lower extremity neuroplasticity following gait rehabilitation requires test-retest reliability. This study assesses the reliability of TMS-derived variables measured at the bilateral quadriceps of chronic hemiparetic stroke survivors. Results support using measures of both paretic and nonparetic motor threshold, motor evoked potential (MEP) latencies, and nonparetic MEP amplitudes. Implications for longitudinal research are discussed.

### The test-retest reliability of non-navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures of corticospinal pathway excitability early after stroke [^1173FcBY]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2024). High credibility.

Motor evoked potential (MEP) characteristics are potential biomarkers for determining whether rehabilitation interventions drive motor recovery after stroke. The test-retest reliability of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measurements in sub-acute stroke remains unclear. This study aims to determine the test-retest reliability of upper limb MEP measures elicited by non-neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation in sub-acute stroke.

In two identical data collection sessions, 1–3 days apart, TMS measures assessed motor threshold (MT), amplitude, latency (MEP-L), silent period (SP), and recruitment curve slope in the biceps brachii (BB), extensor carpi radialis (ECR), and abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles of paretic and non-paretic upper limbs. Test-retest reliability was calculated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Acceptable reliability was set at a lower 95% CI of 0.70 or above. The limits of agreement (LOA) and smallest detectable change (SDC) were also calculated.

Thirty participants with sub-acute stroke were included (average 36 days post-stroke). Reliability was variable, ranging from poor to good for different MEP characteristics. The SDC values differed across muscles and MEP characteristics in both paretic and less paretic limbs.

The present findings indicate there is limited evidence for acceptable test-retest reliability of non-navigated TMS outcomes when using the appropriate 95% CI for ICC, SDC, and LOA values.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of contralesional primary motor cortex improves hand function after stroke [^114cfiSZ]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

A recent report has demonstrated that the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) inhibits the ipsilesional M1 via an abnormal transcallosal inhibition (TCI) in stroke patients. We studied whether decreased excitability of the contralesional M1, induced by 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), improves motor performance of the affected hand in stroke patients by releasing the TCI.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind study of real versus sham rTMS in stroke patients. To minimize the influence of motor training during motor measurement, patients had already performed well in motor training. They were then randomly assigned to receive either subthreshold rTMS at the contralesional M1 (1 Hz, 25 minutes) or sham stimulation.

- **Results**: Compared with sham stimulation, rTMS reduced the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials in contralesional M1 and the TCI duration. rTMS immediately induced an improvement in pinch acceleration of the affected hand, although a plateau in motor performance had been reached by the previous motor training. This improvement in motor function after rTMS significantly correlated with a reduced TCI duration.

- **Conclusions**: We have demonstrated that a disruption of the TCI by the contralesional M1 virtual lesion results in a paradoxical functional facilitation of the affected hand in stroke patients. This suggests a new neurorehabilitative strategy for stroke patients.

### A wearable repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation device [^116uMW77]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

For medical safety, we have taken the following measures:

1. Patients are not allowed to change the stimulation parameters of the rTMS-tiny by themselves. These parameters, including pulse intensity, pulse frequency, and number of pulses, are set through software permission settings, and one device is bound to one patient (via fingerprint, password, etc), allowing only the physician to set it based on that patient's resting state motor threshold RMT, according to the latest IFCN rTMS safety guidelines.

2. For patients without a history of epilepsy, the probability of seizures is extremely low when rTMS is modulated using the IFCN-recommended dosages, and the technology can largely be considered safe. Over 62% of seizures occurred on the first exposure to TMS, and 75% occurred within the first three exposures. Therefore, we will set the parameters in-hospital and perform the first treatment to expose seizure-prone patients, dramatically reducing the probability of developing seizures outside the hospital.

3. An adult with proper training must be present for rTMS treatment, and to avert emergency, we have incorporated a "one-button alarm" feature in the device's companion software, enabling patients to swiftly reach the local emergency medical service team via a single action.

The future success of wearable rTMS devices will depend on collaborative efforts between clinicians, engineers, and regulatory agencies to establish standardized protocols and ensure safe, effective, and user-friendly designs. These considerations underscore the importance of balancing technology development and regulatory compliance.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute ischemic stroke, specifically concerning indications for thrombectomy (0–6 hours from onset), the AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend performing direct aspiration thrombectomy as the first-pass mechanical thrombectomy. This approach is considered noninferior to stent retriever methodology in patients meeting all the specified criteria.

### Evidence for interhemispheric imbalance in stroke patients as revealed by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography [^111J3kXg]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Patients and procedure**: Fifty-six patients with a history of first-ever unilateral ischemic stroke, admitted to the Santa Lucia Foundation for standard rehabilitation, were screened for inclusion in this study. Nineteen patients (7 females; age 61.26 ± 9.8 years) were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included a first-ever chronic ischemic stroke, defined as at least six months post-stroke, and hemiparesis due to an ischemic left or right subcortical or cortical lesion in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. Exclusion criteria included a history of seizures, severe general impairment or concomitant disease, age over 80 years, and treatment with benzodiazepines, baclofen, and antidepressants.

Each patient underwent two experimental sessions, each comprising a clinical evaluation, a corticospinal evaluation using TMS–EMG, a cortical evaluation via TMS–EEG, and a structural evaluation with an MRI scan. These evaluations were conducted at baseline and again after three weeks to assess the reliability of the measures. Fourteen right-handed healthy controls were recruited to be compared with the stroke patients in the cortical evaluation (8 females; age 63.79 ± 12.87 years). The study was approved by the local ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from each participant.

### Evidence for interhemispheric imbalance in stroke patients as revealed by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography [^117E2Fbm]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Low credibility.

Analysis of local transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked cortical activity was conducted from affected (AH) and unaffected (UH) M1 areas in stroke patients (brown lines) and left and right M1 in healthy controls (green lines). The plots depict the amplitude of the TMS-evoked cortical activity in the stimulated hemisphere and in the contralateral hemisphere for each subject.

- **Analysis of ISP**: Figure 4a depicts this analysis. A group × stimulation interaction was revealed (F (1,31) = 8.242; p = .007; ε = .210). Post hoc analysis showed a higher ISP (i.e. lower interhemispheric inhibition [IHI]) when stimulating the AH in stroke patients compared to healthy controls (HC) (1.18 ± 0.96 vs. 0.49 ± 0.26; p = .014), while no difference was observable when stimulating the UH (0.55 ± 0.22 vs. 0.59 ± 0.38; p = .703). When comparing the two stimulated hemispheres, stroke patients exhibited a higher ISP (i.e. lower IHI) when stimulating the AH compared to the UH (p = .001), whereas HC showed no significant difference between the two stimulations (p = .6).

### Neurotechnology-aided interventions for upper limb motor rehabilitation in severe chronic stroke [^111pK1dr]. Brain (2019). Low credibility.

Brain stimulation uses local magnetic fields or electric currents to facilitate or inhibit targeted brain areas. Among non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are the most adopted. Non-invasive brain stimulation is used to modulate the excitability of the stimulated neuropil.

The mentioned techniques act on different specific central mechanisms: TMS most likely stimulates axons at their bends and can induce action potentials; tDCS polarizes neuronal elements (somas, dendrites, axons) based on the orientation and polarity of the induced electric field. Both can produce changes in cortical excitability in healthy subjects and stroke patients. They can stimulate or inhibit according to the applied parameters, for instance, pulse frequency, stimulation-train timing, or stimulus intensity for TMS, and polarity, intensity, and stimulation duration for tDCS.

When net effects are measured via TMS-induced motor-evoked potentials, anodal tDCS increases, whereas cathodal tDCS decreases cortical excitability. It is important to note that this simple dichotomy oversimplifies the complex interactions within the brain, especially of non-motor areas. More complex inhibition and excitation patterns have been identified via investigations of cortical gyration, microstructural properties of neurons (e.g. orientation of the somato-dendritic axis), or higher-order behavioral functions.

### Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: 2019 update to the 2018 guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke: A guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^114wr6ee]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute ischemic stroke, and more specifically with respect to indications for thrombectomy (0–6 hours from onset), the AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend considering performing mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever in patients with AIS who meet the following criteria:

- **Pre-stroke mRS score**: Greater than 1
- **Causative occlusion**: Internal carotid artery or proximal middle cerebral artery (M1)
- **NIHSS score**: Less than 6
- **ASPECTS**: Less than 6
- **Treatment initiation**: Groin puncture within 6 hours of symptom onset

These guidelines highlight the importance of quick decision-making and timely intervention to improve patient outcomes in acute ischemic stroke cases.

### Neurostimulation for treatment of post-stroke impairments [^115gJTY7]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Neurostimulation, the use of electrical stimulation to modulate the activity of the nervous system, is now commonly used for the treatment of chronic pain, movement disorders, and epilepsy. Many neurostimulation techniques have now shown promise for the treatment of physical impairments in people with stroke. In 2021, vagus nerve stimulation was approved by the FDA as an adjunct to intensive rehabilitation therapy for the treatment of chronic upper extremity deficits after ischemic stroke. In 2024, pharyngeal electrical stimulation was conditionally approved by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for neurogenic dysphagia in people with stroke who have a tracheostomy. Many other approaches have also been tested in pivotal device trials, and a number of approaches are in early-phase study. Typically, neurostimulation techniques aim to increase neuroplasticity in response to training and rehabilitation, although the putative mechanisms of action differ and are not fully understood. Neurostimulation techniques offer a number of practical advantages for use after stroke, such as precise dosing and timing, but can be invasive and costly to implement. This review focuses on neurostimulation techniques that are now in clinical use or that have reached the stage of pivotal trials and show considerable promise for the treatment of post-stroke impairments.

### The therapeutic effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation on post-stroke aphasia and the optimal treatment parameters: A meta-analysis [^111KjUUU]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2024). High credibility.

This meta-analysis aimed to examine the overall effectiveness of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on post-stroke aphasia using a meta-analysis approach, as well as to examine the effect of moderating variables (e.g. study design, TMS protocol) on the effectiveness of TMS.

- **Data sources**: A keyword search was conducted in five databases: ERIC, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and ProQuest (01/1985–12/2022). The search algorithm included all possible combinations of relevant keywords. Full-text articles were thoroughly examined using forward/backward search methods.

- **Study selection**: Studies were thoroughly screened using the following inclusion criteria: patients were diagnosed with post-stroke aphasia; studies focused on the effect of TMS on post-stroke aphasia; language assessments were conducted at pretest and posttest for TMS treatment, and data were reported. Studies included both an experimental group (i.e. a group with TMS treatment) and a control group (i.e. a group without TMS treatment).

- **Data extraction**: Information was extracted from each study, including authors, publication year, first language of participants, study design, stroke duration, demographics of participants, TMS protocol, stimulation site, targeting, and statistical data of language performance pre- and post-TMS treatment.

- **Data synthesis**: A total of 17 studies were included in the final review, involving 682 patients with post-stroke aphasia (348 in the experimental group and 334 in the control group). The results showed that TMS treatment has significant immediate (Hedges' g = 0.37) and maintenance (Hedges' g = 0.34) effects on post-stroke aphasia.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for post-stroke depression: A randomised trial with neurophysiological insight [^113KSEhf]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Despite the high incidence of depression after stroke, few trials have investigated the therapeutic efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). This study aimed to evaluate the clinical benefits of delivering a higher dose of rTMS compared to previous stroke trials. A secondary aim was to document adverse effects and investigate the role of functional connectivity as a potential mechanism of clinical response to rTMS treatment.

Eleven chronic stroke survivors were recruited for a double-blind, sham-controlled, randomized trial to investigate ten sessions of high-frequency rTMS for depression. Clinical assessments were obtained at baseline, after treatment, and at a 1-month follow-up. Adverse events were documented at the completion of the treatment. Resting electroencephalography recordings were performed at baseline and after treatment to estimate functional connectivity.

There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the groups (all p ≥ 0.42). Beck Depression Inventory scores decreased for the active rTMS group from baseline to 1-month follow-up (p = 0.04), but did not change for the sham group at post-treatment or follow-up (p ≥ 0.17). Stronger theta frequency functional connectivity between the left frontal cortex and right parietal cortex was associated with lower baseline depression (r = -0.71, p = 0.05). This network strength increased following active rTMS, with the change in connectivity associated with improvement in BDI scores (r = 0.98, p = 0.001). Adverse events were transient and minor, with no statistically significant differences between the groups.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on motor recovery for patients with stroke: A PRISMA compliant systematic review and meta-analysis [^117LCCD3]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to determine the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in recovering motor function in patients with stroke. A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify studies published before September 20, 2018. Electronic databases were searched. Standard mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The stability and sensitivity of the results and sources of heterogeneity were also analyzed. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to determine the quality of the studies.

Twenty randomized controlled trials (N = 841 patients) were included. The results showed that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is beneficial to patients with poststroke hemiplegia, as demonstrated by the following four scales: the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (standard mean difference = 0.635, 95% confidence interval = 0.421 to 0.848); grip strength (standard mean difference = 1.147, 95% confidence interval = 0.761 to 1.534); Barthel Index (standard mean difference = 0.580, 95% confidence interval = 0.377 to 0.783); and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (standard mean difference = -0.555, 95% confidence interval = -0.813 to -0.298). Few adverse events were observed.

The analysis showed that low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has a positive effect on grip strength and lower limb function as assessed by FMA.
