## Question

Inclusion body myositis treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the current treatment landscape for inclusion body myositis, including what works, what doesn't, and what's on the horizon. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease context and why it's hard to treat. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for pharmacologic therapies, including immunosuppressants, IVIG, and targeted agents. Next, I will examine non-pharmacologic management, especially exercise and dysphagia care. After that, I should review emerging therapies and ongoing trials. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, multidisciplinary care plan and highlight key research gaps and caveats for clinical decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the disease context and therapeutic challenge. IBM is the most common acquired myopathy after age 50, characterized by slowly progressive, asymmetric weakness of finger flexors and quadriceps, with frequent dysphagia and a median time to wheelchair dependence around 10–15 years. Importantly, it is largely refractory to conventional immunosuppression, which distinguishes it from other inflammatory myopathies and complicates treatment planning [^111RYbj2] [^1141kVDM] [^112QDqMW].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiologic rationale for treatment resistance before concluding anything about immunotherapy. IBM exhibits a dual process of highly differentiated cytotoxic T-cell–mediated autoimmunity and a degenerative program with protein aggregation, autophagy dysfunction, and mitochondrial abnormalities; this biology likely explains why broad immunosuppressants often fail and why combination strategies targeting both arms are being explored [^112VQvrH] [^11724iRA] [^116mrh2n].

> I will now examine the evidence for immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies. Hold on, I should double-check the highest-quality syntheses: the Cochrane review and subsequent systematic reviews consistently show no benefit for methotrexate, interferon beta-1a, azathioprine, or IVIG on primary strength outcomes. IVIG may show transient, low-quality signals for dysphagia in small studies, but this is not sufficient to recommend routine use, and expert consensus advises against immunosuppression in IBM outside trials [^115QRj8i] [^1159Lx5a] [^112M62K4] [^111KnFsr].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there might be a role for high-dose steroids given the inflammatory infiltrates, but I should correct that. Observational cohorts and controlled data indicate that corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants do not slow progression and may be associated with worse functional outcomes, reinforcing that routine immunosuppression should be avoided in IBM [^116LBF6a] [^115QRj8i].

> Next, I should review targeted pharmacologic approaches. Let me consider sirolimus carefully: a phase 2b RCT showed no benefit on the primary knee-extension strength endpoint, but exploratory outcomes suggested possible improvements in function and lung function. A larger phase 2b/3 trial using IBMFRS as the primary endpoint is ongoing, so definitive conclusions await, and clinicians should not prescribe sirolimus off-label for IBM outside trials at this time [^114ups3K] [^115vfzbS] [^112ZQjTC].

> I need to check other targeted agents. Arimoclomol, a heat-shock response co-inducer, failed to meet its primary functional endpoint in a large multicenter RCT but had an acceptable safety profile; similarly, bimagrumab (myostatin pathway inhibition) and other anabolic strategies have not shown consistent benefit to date, underscoring the need for better biomarkers and outcome measures to enrich for responders [^113kwoPb] [^1159Lx5a] [^117NH5F4].

> Let me now examine non-pharmacologic management, because this is where we can meaningfully help patients. Supervised, progressive resistance and aerobic exercise programs are the most consistently beneficial interventions, with improvements in strength, endurance, and function without clear safety signals when appropriately prescribed; blood-flow–restricted training has emerging supportive data, and assistive devices such as ankle-foot orthoses and hybrid assistive systems can preserve mobility and reduce falls [^111n5bL8] [^116nac95] [^114YNs7T].

> I should confirm dysphagia management next, given its morbidity. Regular screening with targeted questions and videofluoroscopic swallow studies when indicated is essential; dietary modification, swallowing therapy, and respiratory muscle training are foundational. For refractory cases with cricopharyngeal dysfunction, cricopharyngeal myotomy or dilation can provide symptomatic relief in selected patients, though benefits are often transient and evidence quality is limited; botulinum toxin has mixed results and should be used cautiously in expert hands [^111KnFsr] [^112tKAFP] [^112fpdjV] [^111hTCbZ].

> Hold on, I should verify respiratory care recommendations. Screening for respiratory muscle weakness with pulmonary function tests and sleep-disordered breathing is warranted, with timely initiation of noninvasive ventilation as needed; this is particularly important because respiratory complications and aspiration pneumonia are leading drivers of mortality in advanced IBM [^112QDqMW] [^111izC8J].

> Next, I should review emerging therapies and ongoing trials. Highly differentiated cytotoxic T cells expressing KLRG1 are a key therapeutic target. ABC008, a monoclonal antibody against KLRG1, is in phase 2/3 and aims to selectively deplete senescent cytotoxic T cells while sparing Tregs, offering a mechanistically compelling approach. JAK inhibition with ruxolitinib is being tested based on a strong type I interferon signature in IBM muscle, and other strategies targeting autophagy, mitochondrial function, and protein homeostasis are in early development [^1165De69] [^115CJmj4] [^112ZQjTC] [^116nac95].

> I need to ensure we address trial design and outcome measurement issues, because these constrain progress. Heterogeneity in endpoints, short durations, and small sample sizes have limited interpretability; recent work quantifying placebo decline and advocating for core outcome sets (e.g. IBMFRS, 6-minute walk distance, quantitative muscle testing) and longer follow-up should improve future trials and regulatory readiness [^113K4Aka] [^117NH5F4] [^113KQXtv].

> Let me synthesize a practical, multidisciplinary care plan. There is no disease-modifying drug approved for IBM; management should prioritize exercise-based rehabilitation, fall prevention, orthotic and mobility aids, nutritional optimization, and proactive screening and management of dysphagia and respiratory compromise. Immunosuppression should generally be avoided outside clinical trials, and patients should be counseled about prognosis, advance care planning, and opportunities to participate in research [^111izC8J] [^111e9hDu] [^112QDqMW].

> But wait, what about clinical heterogeneity and prognosis counseling. I should confirm that patients are counseled on typical trajectories: median time to cane about 5 years and to wheelchair about 10–15 years, with dysphagia emerging around year 6 and strongly influencing survival; anti-CN1A seropositivity may track with more severe phenotypes, though this requires validation for prognostic use in trials and clinics [^112QDqMW] [^116q8sg9].

> Finally, I should double-check key caveats. Case reports of sirolimus benefit exist, but they do not override randomized data. Until phase 3 results are available, sirolimus should not be used off-label for IBM. Likewise, small open-label signals for IVIG in dysphagia should not prompt routine IVIG use given the weight of negative RCTs and guideline recommendations [^111QcNTR] [^112M62K4] [^115QRj8i].

> In summary, I need to emphasize that supportive, exercise-centered, multidisciplinary care remains the evidence-based cornerstone while we await robust disease-modifying therapies. Targeted immunotherapies like ABC008 and metabolic interventions such as ruxolitinib represent the most promising near-term directions, and their success will hinge on rigorous trials with harmonized outcomes and adequate duration [^111n5bL8] [^1165De69] [^115CJmj4] [^113K4Aka].

There is **no proven disease-modifying therapy** for inclusion body myositis (IBM) [^116nac95]; current management is supportive and multidisciplinary, emphasizing exercise, fall prevention, and dysphagia/respiratory care [^111n5bL8] [^114r2rjg]. Immunosuppressive drugs are **not effective** [^115QRj8i] and may worsen outcomes [^116LBF6a]; IVIG shows only transient, limited benefit for dysphagia and is not recommended for routine use [^112M62K4] [^114kufKQ]. Recent trials of sirolimus [^114ups3K] and arimoclomol [^113kwoPb] failed to meet primary endpoints, though sirolimus showed signals in secondary outcomes and is being studied further [^115vfzbS]. Promising approaches include myostatin inhibition, autophagy modulation, and selective depletion of senescent T cells [^116nac95] [^113g2FBZ] [^1165De69]. Management should include regular exercise, assistive devices, dietary modification, and surveillance for dysphagia and respiratory decline, with enrollment in clinical trials encouraged [^111n5bL8] [^114r2rjg].

---

## Current standard of care

Given the absence of effective disease-modifying therapies, management focuses on **supportive care**:

- **Exercise therapy**: Regular, supervised resistance and aerobic exercise improves strength, function, and quality of life [^111n5bL8] [^116ZQeRR].

- **Fall prevention**: Balance training, assistive devices, and home modifications reduce falls and maintain mobility [^111n5bL8].

- **Dysphagia management**: Speech therapy, dietary modification, and selective use of cricopharyngeal myotomy or botulinum toxin for severe cases [^111KnFsr] [^115u1jkx].

- **Respiratory care**: Regular screening and non-invasive ventilation for respiratory muscle weakness [^111izC8J].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

Multiple pharmacological agents have been tested, but **none have proven effective** in modifying disease progression:

| **Intervention** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| Immunosuppressive agents (methotrexate, azathioprine, corticosteroids) | No benefit; may worsen outcomes [^115QRj8i] [^116LBF6a] |
| Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) | Transient, limited benefit for dysphagia; not recommended routinely [^112M62K4] [^112tKAFP] |
| Sirolimus (rapamycin) | Phase 2b trial showed no primary benefit; secondary signals under further study [^114ups3K] [^115vfzbS] |
| Arimoclomol | Large RCT showed no significant benefit [^113kwoPb] |
| Bimagrumab (myostatin inhibition) | Under investigation; mixed results [^117NH5F4] |

---

## Emerging therapies and ongoing clinical trials

Several **promising approaches** are under investigation:

- **Myostatin inhibition**: Bimagrumab and related agents aim to enhance muscle growth and counter atrophy [^114kufKQ].

- **Autophagy modulation**: Sirolimus and arimoclomol target protein aggregation and cellular stress pathways [^111izC8J].

- **Selective T-cell depletion**: ABC008 targets senescent cytotoxic T cells implicated in IBM pathogenesis [^112ZQjTC].

- **JAK inhibition**: Ruxolitinib is being studied for its potential to modulate immune-mediated muscle damage [^115CJmj4].

---

## Multidisciplinary care and quality of life

Given the progressive nature of IBM, **multidisciplinary care is essential** [^111izC8J]. Regular exercise, nutritional support, psychological counseling, and social services help maintain function and quality of life [^111n5bL8]. Patient education and support groups are also critical [^111n5bL8].

---

## Future directions and research priorities

Key priorities include developing **validated outcome measures** and biomarkers to enable earlier detection and monitor treatment response [^113K4Aka] [^116q8sg9]. Larger, longer-duration trials with standardized endpoints are needed to overcome heterogeneity and detect modest effects [^1159Lx5a]. Combination therapies targeting both inflammatory and degenerative pathways may be necessary [^112ZQjTC].

---

There is **no proven disease-modifying therapy** for IBM; management is supportive, with exercise, fall prevention, and dysphagia/respiratory care as cornerstones [^114r2rjg]. Immunosuppressants are ineffective and may worsen outcomes; IVIG has limited, transient benefit and is not routine [^116LBF6a] [^112M62K4]. Sirolimus and arimoclomol failed primary endpoints, but myostatin inhibition, autophagy modulation, and selective T-cell depletion are promising avenues under study [^114ups3K] [^113kwoPb] [^116nac95].

### Management of dysphagia in inclusion body myositis… [^115u1jkx]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Inclusion body myositis is an inflammatory myopathy in which dysphagia has been considered a rare finding. However, recent literature finds dysphagia an increasingly common symptom as more cases of inclusion body myositis are identified. Unlike some inflammatory myopathic disorders, inclusion body myositis is resistant to treatment with corticosteroids, and therefore, the otolaryngologist may be consulted regarding surgical options for relief of dysphagia. A patient is described in whom severe progressive dysphagia associated with inclusion body myositis developed. Impaired pharyngeal wall motion and cricopharyngeal achalasia were demonstrated by videofluoroscopic evaluation, and the patient was successfully treated by cricopharyngeal myotomy. The pathophysiologic nature of inclusion body myositis and the mechanisms of cervical dysphagia in the inflammatory myopathies are reviewed. Darrow DH, Hoffman HT, Barnes GJ, Wiley CA.

### A protocol to develop clinical guidelines for inclusion-body myositis [^1113XHdq]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

The financial implications of clinical guidelines can be a major barrier to their implementation, yet they are often ignored by guideline producers. 23 The scope of these clinical guidelines is to consider potential costs where possible. However, as international guidelines, the costing for implementing recommendation statements is expected to vary with the health care systems of each country. We have therefore taken the decision to not incorporate a health economic analysis into the current guideline protocol, although subsequent economic evaluation would be recommended to account for local variations in health‐care systems and resource expenditure. Any deviations from the protocol will be detailed and explained in the published guidelines.

### Phenotypic spectrum of inclusion body myositis [^1141kVDM]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a progressive, debilitating muscle disease commonly encountered in patients over the age of 50. IBM typically presents with asymmetric, painless, progressive weakness and atrophy of deep finger flexors and/or quadriceps muscle. Many patients with IBM develop dysphagia. However, atypical presentations of IBM with isolated dysphagia, asymptomatic hyper-CKemia, foot drop, proximal weakness, axial weakness, and facial diplegia have been reported. Other acquired and some inherited disorders may present similar to IBM, and this list gets more expansive when considering atypical presentations. In general, disease progression of IBM leads to loss of hand function and impaired ambulation, and most IBM patients become wheelchair dependent within 13–15 years of disease onset. Hence, IBM impacts negatively patients' quality of life and reduces longevity compared to the general population. Acknowledging the complete clinical spectrum of IBM presentation and excluding mimics would shorten the time to diagnosis, lead to prompt initiation of supportive management and avoid unproven therapy. Ongoing advanced phase studies in IBM provide hope that a therapy may soon be available. Therefore, an added potential benefit of early diagnosis would be prompt initiation of disease-modifying therapy once available.

### Inclusion body myositis: an update [^114YNs7T]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review recent advances in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of inclusion body myositis (IBM).

Recent Findings

Recent epidemiologic studies have highlighted the morbidity and mortality associated with IBM, including the impact of dysphagia. Multiomic analyses of IBM tissues have identified new pathogenic pathways and biomarkers for use in clinical trials. New diagnostic criteria and outcome measures have been proposed to improve clinical trial design. Ongoing clinical trials are targeting T cells and autophagy.

Summary

Improvements in our understanding of IBM pathogenesis are identifying new pathways and biomarkers that need validation in larger cohorts. Exercise remains the primary therapeutic modality available, and new treatment targets are needed.

### Inflammatory myopathies: management of steroid resistance [^117FcPMM]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The inflammatory myopathies include polymyositis, dermatomyositis, necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (NAM), and inclusion body myositis (IBM). On the basis of clinical experience, most patients respond to corticosterioids to some degree or for a time period. For patients insufficiently responding or for steroid-sparing, the treatment options vary among practitioners, generating a genuine uncertainty. This timely review highlights emerging new therapies and provides practical therapeutic algorithms.

Recent Findings

For patients insufficiently responding to corticosteroids, the commonly used immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine, mycophenolate, methotrexate, or cyclosporine, may exert a nonevidence-based 'steroid-sparing' effect but provide minimal benefit on their own. The second line therapy is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) based on a controlled study conducted in dermatomyositis; the drug is also effective in many patients with polymyositis and NAM. Rituximab and tacrolimus may offer additional benefit. Anti-TNF agents are disappointing. IBM remains difficult to treat; although early on some patients may partially respond to steroids or IVIg, they soon become unresponsive and the disease progresses. Emerging agents against T cells, B cells, and transmigration molecules are discussed as promising therapeutic options.

Summary

New biological agents are in the offing for control trials. Appropriate outcome measures are however needed to assess and monitor responses.

### Deciphering the clinical presentations, pathogenesis, and treatment of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^111RWvvA]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies or myositis syndromes (the most common forms are polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and inclusion body myositis) are systemic autoimmune diseases defined by chronic muscle weakness and inflammation of unknown etiology and result in significant morbidity and mortality. Research suggests that categorizing heterogeneous myositis syndromes into mutually exclusive and stable phenotypes by using clinical and immune response features is useful for predicting clinical signs and symptoms, associated genetic and environmental risk factors, and responses to therapy and prognosis. Knowledge of myositis phenotypes should enhance clinicians' ability to recognize and manage these rare disorders.

### Therapeutic options in autoimmune inflammatory myopathies (dermatomyositis, polymyositis, inclusion body myositis) [^116CKPse]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and inclusion body myositis are idiopathic inflammatory myopathies of unknown etiology with autoimmune pathogenesis. For choosing an individual and efficient therapy, diagnostic assignment is an important factor. Therapeutic options in dermatomyositis and polymyositis include corticosteroids and immunosuppressives. Intravenous immunoglobulins are only needed in special cases. In inclusion body myositis, corticosteroids and immunosuppressives are not successful. At the moment intravenous immunoglobulins are the only therapeutic possibility.

LONG-TERM OUTCOMES AND SURVIVAL

IBM is associated with both increased morbidity and mortality. The median time to using a cane is about 5 years and to using a wheelchair is about 10.5 years. Over time, all patients eventually require the use of a wheelchair. An annual decline of 3–5% in grip strength, 3.7% in overall strength, and 6.3% in IBM functional rating scale (IBMFRS) have been reported. The median time to onset of dysphagia has been cited as approximately 6 years and can be seen in approximately two thirds of patients. Patients with IBM are also shown to have an increased mortality. IBM patients had a 10 year survival rate of 36% of index compared to 50% in control patients. The most common cause of death in IBM arises from respiratory compromise and dysphagia (aspiration pneumonia). Furthermore, patients with IBM are more likely to have a superimposed peripheral neuropathy, Sjogren's syndrome, or T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia than the general population. The slow progressive course and survival would be challenging to capture in a clinical trial.

### Interventions for dysphagia in long-term, progressive muscle disease [^112tKAFP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Normal swallowing function is divided into oral, pharyngeal, and oesophageal phases. The anatomy and physiology of the oral cavity facilitates an oral preparatory phase of swallowing, in which food and liquid are pushed towards the pharynx by the tongue. During pharyngeal and oesophageal phases of swallowing, food and liquid are moved from the pharynx to the stomach via the oesophagus. Our understanding of swallowing function in health and disease has informed our understanding of how muscle weakness can disrupt swallowing in people with muscle disease. As a common complication of long-term, progressive muscle disease, there is a clear need to evaluate the current interventions for managing swallowing difficulties (dysphagia). This is an update of a review first published in 2004.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for dysphagia in people with long-term, progressive muscle disease.

Search Methods

On 11 January 2016, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, LILACS, and CINAHL. We checked references in the identified trials for additional randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 12 January 2016 for ongoing or completed but unpublished clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that assessed the effect of interventions for managing dysphagia in adults and children with long-term, progressive muscle disease, compared to other interventions, placebo, no intervention, or standard care. Quasi-randomised controlled trials are trials that used a quasi-random method of allocation, such as date of birth, alternation, or case record number. Review authors previously excluded trials involving people with muscle conditions of a known inflammatory or toxic aetiology. In this review update, we decided to include trials of people with sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) on the basis that it presents as a long-term, progressive muscle disease with uncertain degenerative and inflammatory aetiology and is typically refractory to treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We applied standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

There were no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported results in terms of the review's primary outcome of interest, weight gain or maintenance. However, we identified one RCT that assessed the effect of intravenous immunoglobulin on swallowing function in people with IBM. The trial authors did not specify the number of study participants who had dysphagia. There was also incomplete reporting of findings from videofluoroscopic investigations, which was one of the review's secondary outcome measures. The study did report reductions in the time taken to swallow, as measured using ultrasound. No serious adverse events occurred during the study, although data for the follow-up period were lacking. It was also unclear whether the non-serious adverse events reported occurred in the treatment group or the placebo group. We assessed this study as having a high risk of bias and uncertain confidence intervals for the review outcomes, which limited the overall quality of the evidence. Using GRADE criteria, we downgraded the quality of the evidence from this RCT to 'low' for efficacy in treating dysphagia, due to limitations in study design and implementation, and indirectness in terms of the population and outcome measures. Similarly, we assessed the quality of the evidence for adverse events as 'low'. From our search for RCTs, we identified two other non-randomised studies, which reported the effects of long-term intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in adults with IBM and lip-strengthening exercises in children with myotonic dystrophy type 1. Headaches affected two participants treated with long-term intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, who received a tailored dose reduction; there were no adverse events associated with lip-strengthening exercises. Both non-randomised studies identified improved outcomes for some participants following the intervention, but neither study specified the number of participants with dysphagia or demonstrated any group-level treatment effect for swallowing function using the outcomes prespecified in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient and low-quality RCT evidence to determine the effect of interventions for dysphagia in long-term, progressive muscle disease. Clinically relevant effects of intravenous immunoglobulin for dysphagia in inclusion body myositis can neither be confirmed or excluded using the evidence presented in this review. Standardised, validated, and reliable outcome measures are needed to assess dysphagia and any possible treatment effect. Clinically meaningful outcomes for dysphagia may require a shift in focus from measures of impairment to disability associated with oral feeding difficulties.

### Treatment guidelines for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies in adults: a comparative review [^113oUCuR]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Challenges in developing standardized treatment guidelines

The management of myositis is complex due to the systemic nature of the disease with multi-organ involvement and overlapping CTDs posing a significant challenge while developing consensus-based treatment guidelines. Currently used therapies are generally approved for other inflammatory conditions and therefore aim for symptom control without targeting specific underlying disease mechanisms. Although multiple RCTs are currently ongoing with molecules targeting distinct mechanisms that are thought to drive myositis, there are unique challenges in designing clinical trials in myositis. These include presence of various disease subtypes, insufficient patient enrolment, misdiagnosis due to overlapping symptoms with other inflammatory diseases, ambiguous disease classification criteria, under-representation of minority groups and limited data on patient-reported outcomes. Nevertheless, the explosion of clinical trials in myositis is promising and may inform future treatment guidelines.

The heterogeneity in recommendations from currently available treatment guidelines developed by diverse, international organizations in the field of rheumatology, dermatology and neurology necessitate the development of multidisciplinary and internationally aligned consensus treatment guidelines. Such a consensus will be crucial to ensure that patients receive the most effective treatment to manage the disease. The availability and access to myositis treatment options varies geographically, underscoring the need for strong international collaboration to develop consensus treatment guidelines that are evidence-based and informed by global clinical experience.

### Inclusion body myositis treatment with celution processed adipose derived regenerative cells… [^115E13rL]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Inclusion Body Myositis is the most common progressive and debilitating muscle disease beginning in persons over age 50 years, with an annual incidence estimated at 2. 2 to
7. 9 per million. IBM causes both proximal and distal muscle weakness, characteristically most prominent in the quadriceps and finger flexors. Over time it can lead to severe disability, including loss of hand function, falls due to quadriceps muscle weakness and foot drop, dysphagia, and eventually respiratory muscle weakness. There is no effective therapy for IBM. This study, "Inclusion Body Myositis Treatment with Celution Processed Adipose Derived Regenerative Cells" evaluates the safety and efficacy of the Celution System in the processing of an autologous graft consisting of adipose-derived regenerative cells in the treatment of inclusion body myositis.

Specifically, the overall objective is for the proposed clinical trial to serve as a safety trial for Inclusion Body Myositis. This is an open-label, single arm study evaluating the safety for patients with Inclusion Body Myositis. A total of 9 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be randomized to Part 1 or Part 2 of the study in blocks of 3 every 3 months. Enrollment is anticipated to be staggered into 3 groups. The nine subjects will be randomized 2: 1 in groups of 3 to early injections versus late.
- Meet any of the European Neuromuscular Centre Inclusion Body Myositis research diagnostic criteria 2011 categories for IBM.
- Demonstrate being able to arise from a chair without support from another person or device. Subjects may use their arms to push up.
- Able to ambulate at least 20 ft/6 meters with or without assistive device. Once arisen from the chair, participant may use any walking device, i.e.

walker/frame, cane, crutches, or braces. They cannot be supported by another person and cannot use furniture or wall for support.
- Age at onset of weakness > 45 years
- Able to give informed consent
- Muscle strength graded between 6 and 9 for finger flexion and knee extension unilaterally on one side of the body using the Kandell 0–10 scale. A subject may meet this criterion bilaterally and still be included in the study.

### Autoimmune myopathies: updates on evaluation and treatment [^112gzmX1]. Neurotherapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

The major forms of autoimmune myopathies include dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), myositis associated with antisynthetase syndrome (ASS), immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), and inclusion body myositis (IBM). While each of these conditions has unique clinical and histopathological features, they all share an immune-mediated component. These conditions can occur in isolation or can be associated with systemic malignancies or connective tissue disorders (overlap syndromes). As more has been learned about these conditions, it has become clear that traditional classification schemes do not adequately group patients according to shared clinical features and prognosis. Newer classifications are now utilizing myositis-specific autoantibodies which correlate with clinical and histopathological phenotypes and risk of malignancy, and help in offering prognostic information with regard to treatment response. Based on observational data and expert opinion, corticosteroids are considered first-line therapy for DM, PM, ASS, and IMNM, although intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is increasingly being used as initial therapy in IMNM related to statin use. Second-line agents are often required, but further prospective investigation is required regarding the optimal choice and timing of these agents.

### Consensus statement: the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of neuromuscular conditions report of the AANEM ad hoc committee [^112M62K4]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Medium credibility.

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) — across two Class I and one Class II studies, IVIG showed no significant benefit on primary strength outcomes and is not recommended. In a Class I crossover study, 19 patients received a monthly 2 gm/kg IVIG dose for 3 mo or placebo, and there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of overall muscle strength between groups at study end (p < .1). In another Class I study testing combination therapy, 36 patients were randomized to 2 gm/kg/month IVIG plus high dose prednisone (60 mg every other day) for 3 mo versus prednisone alone; all initially received 60 mg prednisone daily for 4 weeks then tapered to 60 mg every other day during the 3 mo treatment, and at 4 mo no significant change in primary muscle strength was seen between groups. In a Class II crossover trial, 22 patients were randomized to monthly IVIG 2 gm/kg or placebo for 6 mo followed by the other treatment; at the end of 1 y there was no change in muscle strength or NSS versus baseline although a significant transient NSS improvement occurred during the IVIG phase. The page concludes: Based on Class I and II studies, IVIG is not recommended for treating IBM, and there is also no evidence to recommend combination therapy with IVIG and corticosteroids.

### A protocol to develop clinical guidelines for inclusion-body myositis [^111gLe8o]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

Inclusion‐body myositis (IBM) is a late‐onset and progressive idiopathic inflammatory myopathy that is currently estimated to affect up to 14.9 people per million and 51.3 per million population aged > 50 years of age. 1 IBM has preferential involvement of certain muscle groups, including the quadriceps and extrinsic finger flexors. 2, 3 As a consequence of muscle weakness, many people with IBM experience difficulties with managing everyday activities. 4, 5 A subgroup of patients also experience dysphagia. 6 Due to its uncertain etiology and lack of definitive treatment, 7 there continues to be variation in both the diagnosis and management of IBM, even among specialists. Agreed‐upon diagnostic and management guidelines could optimize and streamline the care given to IBM patients; they could also form the basis for national and international standards of care.

The rarity of IBM, combined with limited access to specialists, means that much of the management of patients with the disease may be delivered by health professionals who are unfamiliar with the condition. Access to clinical guidelines for IBM could be invaluable for non‐specialists. It was for such reasons that a meeting of specialist clinicians at the 188th European Neuromuscular Center (ENMC) International Workshop agreed on the need and scope for establishing clinical guidelines in IBM. 8

Currently, there are neuromuscular disease‐specific guidelines available for conditions including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, 9 spinal muscular atrophy, 10, 11 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 11, 12 and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. 13 Also, various organizations promote and author guidelines, such as the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK. For many, guideline construction starts with a search of the literature, followed by evidence ranking and formation of recommendations that are graded accordingly. This approach assumes the existence of an evidence base that will cover the issues the clinical guidelines aim to address. Furthermore, there are a number of different classification systems for evidence ranking. Hierarchical ranking of the knowledge base often categorizes expert opinion separately within such classification systems, placing a bias in favor of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and meta‐analyses, even though these approaches may be inappropriate to address certain clinical practice questions. As a result of such hierarchical ranking, guideline recommendations may appear to be weakly supported when they are based on expert opinion only. In developing a guideline protocol, we considered these challenges and decided to adopt a mixed methods approach to constructing clinical guidelines for IBM.

### Inclusion body myositis: diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment options [^115pv3if]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most common acquired myopathy in people older than 50 years. IBM typically presents with distal upper extremity weakness accompanied by proximal lower extremity muscle weakness. Associated clinical findings include asymmetric weakness, foot drop, and dysphagia. The pathogenesis of IBM is not clear. In this article the authors briefly discuss postulated pathogenic mechanisms. Although no proven pharmacotherapy exists, some promising candidates are discussed.

### Diagnosis, pathogenesis and treatment of myositis: recent advances [^111PJAYC]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), necrotizing myopathy (NM) and inclusion body myositis (IBM) are four distinct subtypes of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies - in short myositis. Recent studies have shed some light on the unique pathogenesis of each entity. Some of the clinical features are distinct, but muscle biopsy is indispensable for making a reliable diagnosis. The use of magnetic resonance imaging of skeletal muscles and detection of myositis-specific autoantibodies have become useful additions to our diagnostic repertoire. Only few controlled trials are available to substantiate current treatment approaches for myositis and hopes are high that novel modalities will become available within the next few years. In this review we provide an up-to-date overview of the pathogenesis and diagnostic approach of myositis. We aim to present a guide towards therapeutic and general management.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of paediatric, adolescent and adult patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy [^114A3Z9J]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Literature search — scope and search strategy

Using key questions as a basis, a literature search was undertaken using Ovid (see 'Search terms' in Supplementary Material S1, available at Rheumatology online). Search results and additional manually identified references up to October 2020 were included. Evidence published after October 2020 was not included as this was the cut-off for eligibility. A potential limitation of this guideline is that relevant literature may have been published since October 2020; data or information from these studies could not be included in the recommendation formation process.

Eligibility criteria

Published peer reviewed clinical studies relating to any IIM subtype except inclusion body myositis were included. Case reports/series were limited to those describing outcomes for three or more subjects. Review articles, editorials, conference proceedings, and existing clinical guidelines were excluded. Non-English language papers were excluded unless a translation was published. Basic science studies without clear clinical applicability were excluded. Abstracts of papers were reviewed by two authors to determine eligibility against these criteria (PRISMA flow diagram shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, available at Rheumatology online).

Methods used to formulate recommendations

The full text of each eligible paper was reviewed by two assessors using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. Each reference was categorized as high (A), moderate (B) or low/very low (C) quality. A third assessor resolved disagreements.

A total of 213 papers were used to form recommendations. See Supplementary Table S1 (available at Rheumatology online) for details of evidence base contributing to recommendations.

Draft recommendations were created and categorized as applicable to all patients, adult-specific or paediatric-specific. The process outlined by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) was used to summarize the quality of body of evidence for each recommendation: high (A), moderate (B), low (C) or very low (D), according to GRADE methodology.

Content, wording, strength of recommendation (strong = 1, conditional = 2), and quality of supporting evidence for each recommendation were subjected to a formal consensus building process using a combination of face-to-face meetings and online surveys. Strength of agreement (SoA) for finalized recommendations was determined using a simple binary voting system for each voter and is presented as a percentage. Authors were free to abstain from voting on areas where they did not feel clinically competent, with the percentage reflecting voters. Only recommendations with a SoA > 80% were included in the guideline.

### Diagnosing and managing dysphagia in inclusion body myositis: a systematic review [^111KnFsr]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Dysphagia is a common debilitating clinical feature of IBM. However, the impact of dysphagia in IBM has been historically overlooked. This study aimed to identify, evaluate and summarize the evidence regarding the assessment and management of dysphagia in persons with IBM undergoing treatment.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted using a multiengine search following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines. Eligible studies had to employ an intervention for persons with IBM, report a swallowing outcome and be published in English. Quality assessments of the eligible studies were performed.

Results

Of 239 studies found, 19 met the inclusion criteria. One study was rated as 'fair' and the rest as 'poor' quality, particularly due to the lack of published and validated swallowing assessment procedures and outcome measures. Cricopharyngeal (CP) dysfunction (12/19) was the most commonly reported swallowing abnormality. Interventions for disease management included pharmacological agents (10/19), followed by surgical (3/19), behavioral (1/19) and combined approaches (5/19). Interventions with immunosuppressants, botulinum toxin injection, balloon dilation and/or CP myotomy led to mixed and transient benefits. Few studies examining statins or behavioral therapies (primarily focused on respiratory function) showed no effects for dysphagia.

Conclusion

Various interventions have been reported to temporarily improve dysphagia in persons with IBM. However, these findings are based on limited and overall low-quality evidence. This study cautions against the generalization of these findings and emphasizes the need for further systematic research to improve the diagnosis and management of dysphagia in IBM.

### Sirolimus for treatment of patients with inclusion body myositis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept, phase 2b trial [^114ups3K]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Inclusion body myositis is the most frequent myositis in patients older than 50 years. Classical immunosuppressants are ineffective in treating inclusion body myositis, and to date there are no recommendations for pharmacological approaches to treatment. When used after organ transplantation, sirolimus can block the proliferation of effector T cells, while preserving T regulatory cells, and induce autophagy, all of which are processes that are impaired in inclusion body myositis. In this pilot study, we aimed to test the efficacy of sirolimus in patients with inclusion body myositis.

Methods

This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept, phase 2b trial was done at a single hospital in Paris, France. The study included men and women (aged 45–80 years) who had a defined diagnosis of inclusion body myositis according to established criteria. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive once-daily oral sirolimus 2 mg or placebo. Centralised balanced block randomisation (blocks of four) was computer generated without stratification. The study comprised a 15-day screening period (days -15 to 0) and a 52-week treatment period (day 0 to month 12). The primary endpoint was the relative percentage change from baseline to month 12 in maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength. Secondary endpoints included the following assessments at months 6 and 12: 6-min walking distance, isometric muscle strength for hand grip (finger flexors), knee flexion and elbow flexion and extension, forced vital capacity, muscle replacement with fat measured by quantitative nuclear MRI, Inclusion Body Myositis Weakness Composite Index (IBMWCI), Inclusion Body Myositis Functional Rating Scale (IBMFRS), Health Assessment Questionnaire without Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and analyses of T-cell subpopulations by mass cytometry. The primary analysis was done on the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02481453.

Findings

Between July 15, 2015, and May 13, 2016, we screened 285 patients, 44 of whom were randomly allocated to sirolimus (22 patients) or placebo (22 patients). We observed no difference in the primary outcome of relative percentage change from baseline to month 12 of the maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (median difference 3·78, 95% CI -10·61 to 17·31; p = 0·85). For secondary outcomes, differences between the groups were not significant for changes in strength of other muscle groups (grip, elbow flexion and extension, or knee flexion), IBMWCI, IBMFRS, and lower limb muscle fat fraction. However, we observed significant differences in favour of sirolimus between the study groups for HAQ-DI, forced vital capacity, thigh fat fraction, and 6-min walking distance. Ten (45%) of 22 patients in the sirolimus group had a serious adverse event compared with six (27%) of 22 patients in the placebo group. Four (18%) patients in the sirolimus group stopped their treatment because of adverse events (severe mouth ulcers, aseptic pneumonia, renal insufficiency, and peripheral lower limb oedema), which resolved after treatment discontinuation. Canker sores were the most frequent side-effect and were mainly mild or moderate in ten patients.

Interpretation

We found no evidence for efficacy of sirolimus for treating inclusion body myositis based on maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength and other muscle strength measures, and the side-effects of treatment were substantial for some patients. However, we believe there was enough evidence of benefit in certain secondary outcomes to pursue a multicentre phase 3 trial to further assess the safety and efficacy of sirolimus.

### Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: definition and management of refractory disease [^116HrhEJ]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Adult idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, commonly referred to as myositis, are a heterogeneous group of diseases with an autoimmune etiology. In this review, the authors are going to focus on myositis excluding inclusion body myositis. They will review the prognostic factors (for mortality and response to steroids), define refractory disease, introduce a new concept (presumed refractory disease), analyze definitions of active disease, damage and improvement criteria, and summarize therapeutic alternatives for refractory patients, based on different disease phenotypes.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments in inclusion body myositis: a systematic review [^116eicxD]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This SR was conducted according to the Cochrane Handbookand reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

As this is an update of a Cochrane SR, the research team followed the same protocol as the previous Cochrane SR. The review was not registered in PROSPERO.

The outlined research questions were:

Which pharmacological interventions are efficacious in improving outcomes in people with IBM?
Which pharmacological interventions are safe in improving outcomes in people with IBM?

We only focused on pharmacological interventions because new clinical trials have emerged in this area. We did not include trials of exercise or management of dysphagia, as these are subjects of other Cochrane reviews with no significant updates expected since the last review.

These questions were framed and structured using the 'Patients, Intervention, Comparator or Control, Outcome, Type of study' format, as follows:

Participants

A study was eligible for inclusion if the included participants were adults (aged 18 years or over) with a diagnosis of IBM fulfilling any internationally accepted IBM classification criteria. We specifically excluded people with familial IBM and hereditary inclusion body myopathy, but we included people who had connective tissue and autoimmune diseases associated with IBM, which may or may not have been described in trials. Studies describing information regarding people with IBM associated with other concomitant diseases were summarised separately and by subgroups, whenever possible.

Interventions

Regarding the eligible interventions, all pharmacological interventions were included. Pharmacological interventions were classified as medicinal products in accordance with the EU Directive 2001/83/EEC (EU 2001), which states: 'any substance or combination of substances which may be used in or administered to human beings either with a view to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action, or to making a medical diagnosis'. This may include interventions such as immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents including glucocorticoids, azathioprine, methotrexate (MTX), ciclosporin, cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulin, leukapheresis, plasma exchange and targeted therapies such as those using monoclonal antibodies, among others.

Comparator or control

The comparator was placebo or usual care (standard care). Studies without a comparator were excluded.

Context

There were no contextual constraints.

### Sporadic inclusion body myositis: new insights and potential therapy [^113svXGB]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of The Review

To describe new insights and developments in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM).

Recent Findings

Various hypothesis about the pathogenesis of IBM continue to be investigated, including autoimmune factors, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein dyshomeostasis, altered nucleic acid metabolism, myonuclear degeneration and the role of the myostatin pathway. Serum autoantibodies against cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1A have been identified in IBM showing moderate diagnostic performance. The differential diagnostic value of histopathological features, including different protein aggregates, continues to be evaluated. MRI may also be of monitoring value in IBM. New therapeutic strategies are being tested in IBM patients, namely the upregulation of the heat shock response and the antagonism of myostatin.

Summary

Recent important advances have occurred in IBM. These advances, including recent and ongoing clinical trials, may lead to earlier diagnosis and improved understanding and treatment of the disease. Despite improved knowledge, IBM continues to be a puzzling disease and the pathogenesis remains to be clarified. An interdisciplinary, bench to bedside translational research approach is crucial for the successful identification of novel treatments for this debilitating, currently untreatable disorder.

### Inflammatory muscle diseases [^116Wf699]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Dermatomyositis and polymyositis are treatable disorders of skeletal muscle. Despite their clinical similarities, they appear to have fundamentally different autoimmune origins. Inclusion body myositis, from its origins 30 years ago, has emerged as the commonest acquired myopathy of the elderly. Despite inflammatory changes, it is unclear whether it should be considered a primary inflammatory myopathy, and it generally responds poorly to the same treatments that are effective in other inflammatory myopathies.

### Optimism in inclusion body myositis: a double-blind randomised controlled phase III trial investigating the effect of sirolimus on disease progression in patients with IBM as measured by the IBM functional rating scale [^115vfzbS]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a complex inflammatory muscle disease in adults over 40, with histological features of autoinflammation, cell stress and autophagic abnormalities, and marked clinically by relentless progression with no effective disease-modifying therapy. Sirolimus (rapamycin) may help maintain function by inhibiting T effector cells, preserving T regulatory cells, inducing autophagy, and improving mitochondrial function. This international trial follows a phase II pilot study.

Methods

This phase IIb/III double-blind, randomised, controlled trial (RCT) of sirolimus involves 140 IBM patients randomly assigned with equal allocation to sirolimus (2 mg) or matching placebo. This RCT aims to assess the efficacy of sirolimus compared to placebo in slowing or stabilising IBM progression, as measured by the mean change in patient function using the IBM Functional Rating Scale (IBM-FRS) from Baseline to Week 84. Secondary outcomes will evaluate efficacy and safety to inform future clinical trial design.

Results

Ethical approval has been granted in Australia (St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne HREC-D 311/20) and the USA (University of Kansas Medical Center Human Research Protection Program FWA no. 00003411), with European approval pending. The protocol is version 3.0 (02-Dec-2022).

Trial Registration

ANZCTR: ACTRN12620001226998p, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04789070, UTN: U1111–1258–1354, and EU CT 2024–514575–17–00.

Conclusions

This phase IIb/III trial builds on prior findings to assess sirolimus's potential in slowing or halting IBM progression, preserving patient function and independence, and advancing IBM therapeutic strategies and trial design.

### Demographic and clinical features of inclusion body myositis in north America [^116ZQeRR]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Few studies of the demographics, natural history, and clinical management of inclusion body myositis (IBM) have been performed in a large patient population. To more accurately define these characteristics, we developed and distributed a questionnaire to patients with IBM.

Methods

A cross-sectional, self-reporting survey was conducted.

Results

The mean age of the 916 participants was 70.4 years, the male-to-female ratio was 2:1, and the majority reported difficulty with ambulation and activities of daily living. The earliest symptoms included impaired use and weakness of arms and legs. The mean time from first symptoms to diagnosis was 4.7 years. Half reported that IBM was their initial diagnosis. A composite functional index negatively associated with age and disease duration, and positively associated with participation in exercise.

Conclusions

These data are valuable for informing patients how IBM manifestations are expected to impair daily living and indicate that self-reporting could be used to establish outcome measures in clinical trials.

### Inclusion body myositis: new insights into pathogenesis [^111wjAG7]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The pathogenesis of sporadic inclusion body myositis is complex and the disease has a relentless course. Recent observations regarding possible mechanisms of disease may provide targets for therapy.

Recent Findings

Evidence is strengthening that specific T-cell and B-cell responses are ongoing in skeletal muscle in sporadic inclusion body myositis and that cytokines and chemokines generated by an autoimmune response are likely to influence antigen presentation by intramuscular dendritic cells and muscle cells, expression of amyloid precursor protein and the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Early beta-amyloid expression and perhaps aberrant expression of protein processing enzymes, such as E3 ligases, seem to be involved in the myopathic process. NF-kappaB activation by endoplasmic reticulum stress and cytokine action further stimulates amyloid precursor protein production, exacerbates endoplasmic reticulum stress and increases myostatin content in muscle contributing to muscle atrophy.

Summary

Understanding the paradoxes in sporadic inclusion body myositis is important in determining rational therapy for the disease. Amyloid precursor protein is expressed in muscle in other inflammatory muscle diseases but the cellular distribution differs and inclusions do not form so that other metabolic defects seem to be important. Intramuscular immune cells influence muscle function and viability in inclusion body myositis but immunotherapy is ineffective. A useful target for therapy may be restoration of muscle regenerating capacity.

### Novel therapeutic approaches for inclusion body myositis [^113g2FBZ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review will highlight recent advances in developing strategies to accelerate muscle regeneration and to slow muscle degeneration in myositis, focusing primarily on inclusion body myositis (IBM).

Recent Findings

Therapies for accelerating muscle regeneration, primarily through inhibition of myostatin, have shown promise in the laboratory and are now entering clinical trials. Recent studies have implicated autophagy, a key cellular process involved in clearance of ubiquitinated aggregates, in the pathogenesis of familial and sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM). IBM has joined a growing list of diseases known as TDP-43 proteinopathies, in which this protein becomes mislocalized to the cytoplasm; however, it is unclear whether these protein aggregates or others are pathogenic in this disease.

Summary

New discoveries of biomarkers in sIBM and new insights into the pathogenesis of familial IBM are opening novel therapeutic pathways for these disorders. In particular, drugs that stimulate autophagy, already in development for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, are candidates for clinical trials. These disease-specific therapies combined with novel therapies to accelerate muscle regeneration hold promise for future therapy for this devastating disease.

### Exploring challenges in the management and treatment of inclusion body myositis [^113KQXtv]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

From a clinical trial design perspective, a balance between cost and having a long enough trial is needed to avoid type II errors. While the main reason for failed trials could solely be the lack of effectiveness of the investigated drug, the duration of several trials was 6 month or less which is suboptimal in such a chronic, slowly progressive disease. Furthermore, given the rarity of IBM, stratifying groups by variables of interest (sex, race, distribution of weakness, disease severity etc.) would make such trials not feasible as stratification should be accounted for during sample size calculation as it requires penalization of the p-value. Platform trials offer the advantage of sharing a placebo arm and testing several investigational medicine products simultaneously, which improves recruitment and saves costs. On the downside, any design flaw would impact several trials.

Additional limitations of clinical trials exist. Evaluation of the outcome measures used in clinical trials is often based on averaged estimates, such as mean difference and standard deviations, which may not fully capture the individual-level effect. Furthermore, the clinical trial setting is different from real life scenarios, and the placebo group's rate of decline may not align with natural history studies. Innovative designs to address these limitations have been proposed, including pragmatic trials and n-of-1 trials, both of which have their challenges not addressed in this article. The intervention in pragmatic trials is embedded in healthcare system workflow, and data are collected from electronic health records in routine clinical visits. The n-of-1 clinical trial design is the closest to the concept of individualized medicine. It uses the same methodology of parallel group trials to ensure scientific rigor while generating clinically relevant treatment outcomes tailored to the patient involved.

### Evaluation and treatment of inflammatory myopathies [^114Wfbip]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The major types of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy include dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), inclusion body myositis (IBM) and immune mediated necrotising myopathy (NM). These myositides appear clinically, histologically and pathogenically distinct. DM, PM and immune mediated NM are responsive to immunosuppressive therapy, in contrast with IBM which is generally refractory to therapy. Greater understanding of the pathogenic bases of these disorders should hopefully lead to better treatment. We need well designed, prospective, double blind, placebo controlled trials in order to determine the best therapeutic options for these different disorders.

### Ruxolitinib treatment in inclusion body myositis… [^115CJmj4]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Overview A Phase II/III Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multicenter Study to Determine the Efficacy and Safety of Ruxolitinib in the Treatment of Subjects with Inclusion Body Myositis IBM is the most frequent idiopathic immune myopathy over age 45, pathologically characterized by the combination of intramuscular inflammation and degenerative features. It differs from other IIMs by its chronic evolution and refractoriness to common immunomodulatory drugs leading to marked disability and poor quality of life. Histological and molecular analyses of muscle biopsies from IBM patients showed intense muscular type II interferon signature, stronger than observed in other IIMs. In vitro and in vivo experimental studies showed that IFNγ exerts myosuppressive effects through JAK/STAT pathway activation mimicking the degenerative features observed in IBM, and that these effects can be prevented by JAK-inhibitor ruxolitinib.

Hypothesis/Objective: Ruxolitinib could be an effective therapy for IBM. Objective is to evaluate its therapeutic effects in IBM. Method: Comparative, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, superiority, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2 trial. 60 IBM patients able to walk during at least 6mn will be randomized in two groups and received either ruxolitinib 15mgx2/d or placebo during 1 yr. Evaluation includes 6MWT, muscle strength quantification, functional scales, respiratory functional test and muscle MRI.

### Exploring challenges in the management and treatment of inclusion body myositis [^115Hd4Du]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose of review

This review provides an overview of the management and treatment landscape of inclusion body myositis (IBM), while highlighting the current challenges and future directions.

Recent findings

IBM is a slowly progressive myopathy that predominantly affects patients over the age of 40, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, a definitive cure for IBM remains elusive. Various clinical trials targeting inflammatory and some of the noninflammatory pathways have failed. The search for effective disease-modifying treatments faces numerous hurdles including variability in presentation, diagnostic challenges, poor understanding of pathogenesis, scarcity of disease models, a lack of validated outcome measures, and challenges related to clinical trial design. Close monitoring of swallowing and respiratory function, adapting an exercise routine, and addressing mobility issues are the mainstay of management at this time.

Summary

Addressing the obstacles encountered by patients with IBM and the medical community presents a multitude of challenges. Effectively surmounting these hurdles requires embracing cutting-edge research strategies aimed at enhancing the management and treatment of IBM, while elevating the quality of life for those affected.

### Exploring challenges in the management and treatment of inclusion body myositis [^116mrh2n]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

LIMITED THERAPEUTIC TARGETS

Another challenge facing the development of a disease-modifying treatment of IBM is the lack of detailed understanding of its pathogenesis. Regardless of which is the cause versus the consequence, once the disease manifests clinically, the vast majority of patients display complex histopathological findings featuring inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupted autophagy, and protein aggregation. Review of disease mechanisms is beyond the scope of this article and is nicely summarized in several articles. Most clinical trials targeted various aspects of the inflammatory or immune response as detailed below in the treatment landscape section. However, the highly differentiated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, displaying markers of senescence such as KLRG1, are thought to evade conventional immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. Current phase 1 and phase 2/3 trials (clinical trial NCT05721573) targeting these KLRG1 positive T cells are ongoing. However, detailed knowledge of the noninflammatory pathways is lagging behind posing a major challenge to identifying therapeutic targets. Drugs with broad rather than targeted mechanisms of action have been tried as detailed below.

### Treatment for inclusion body myositis [^115QRj8i]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a late-onset inflammatory muscle disease (myopathy) associated with progressive proximal and distal limb muscle atrophy and weakness. Treatment options have attempted to target inflammatory and atrophic features of this condition (for example with immunosuppressive and immunomodulating drugs, anabolic steroids, and antioxidant treatments), although as yet there is no known effective treatment for reversing or minimising the progression of inclusion body myositis. In this review we have considered the benefits, adverse effects, and costs of treatment in targeting cardinal effects of the condition, namely muscle atrophy, weakness, and functional impairment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of treatment for IBM.

Search Methods

On 7 October 2014 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Additionally in November 2014 we searched clinical trials registries for ongoing or completed but unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised or quasi-randomised trials, including cross-over trials, of treatment for IBM in adults compared to placebo or any other treatment for inclusion in the review. We specifically excluded people with familial IBM and hereditary inclusion body myopathy, but we included people who had connective tissue and autoimmune diseases associated with IBM, which may or may not be identified in trials. We did not include studies of exercise therapy or dysphagia management, which are topics of other Cochrane systematic reviews.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

The review included 10 trials (249 participants) using different treatment regimens. Seven of the 10 trials assessed single agents, and 3 assessed combined agents. Many of the studies did not present adequate data for the reporting of the primary outcome of the review, which was the percentage change in muscle strength score at six months. Pooled data from two trials of interferon beta-1a (n = 58) identified no important difference in normalised manual muscle strength sum scores from baseline to six months (mean difference (MD) -0.06, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.03) between IFN beta-1a and placebo (moderate-quality evidence). A single trial of methotrexate (MTX) (n = 44) provided moderate-quality evidence that MTX did not arrest or slow disease progression, based on reported percentage change in manual muscle strength sum scores at 12 months. None of the fully published trials were adequately powered to detect a treatment effect. We assessed six of the nine fully published trials as providing very low-quality evidence in relation to the primary outcome measure. Three trials (n = 78) compared intravenous immunoglobulin (combined in one trial with prednisone) to a placebo, but we were unable to perform meta-analysis because of variations in study analysis and presentation of trial data, with no access to the primary data for re-analysis. Other comparisons were also reported in single trials. An open trial of anti-T lymphocyte immunoglobulin (ATG) combined with MTX versus MTX provided very low-quality evidence in favour of the combined therapy, based on percentage change in quantitative muscle strength sum scores at 12 months (MD 12.50%, 95% CI 2.43 to 22.57). Data from trials of oxandrolone versus placebo, azathioprine (AZA) combined with MTX versus MTX, and arimoclomol versus placebo did not allow us to report either normalised or percentage change in muscle strength sum scores. A complete analysis of the effects of arimoclomol is pending data publication. Studies of simvastatin and bimagrumab (BYM338) are ongoing. All analysed trials reported adverse events. Only 1 of the 10 trials interpreted these for statistical significance. None of the trials included prespecified criteria for significant adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Trials of interferon beta-1a and MTX provided moderate-quality evidence of having no effect on the progression of IBM. Overall trial design limitations including risk of bias, low numbers of participants, and short duration make it difficult to say whether or not any of the drug treatments included in this review were effective. An open trial of ATG combined with MTX versus MTX provided very low-quality evidence in favour of the combined therapy based on the percentage change data given. We were unable to draw conclusions from trials of IVIg, oxandrolone, and AZA plus MTX versus MTX. We need more randomised controlled trials that are larger, of longer duration, and that use fully validated, standardised, and responsive outcome measures.

### Inclusion body myositis: current pathogenetic concepts and diagnostic and therapeutic approaches [^111RYbj2]. The Lancet: Neurology (2007). Medium credibility.

Inclusion body myositis is the most common acquired muscle disease in older individuals, and its prevalence varies among countries and ethnic groups. The aetiology and pathogenesis of sporadic inclusion body myositis are still poorly understood; however genetic factors, ageing, and environmental triggers might all have a role. Unlike other inflammatory myopathies, sporadic inclusion body myositis causes slowly progressing muscular weakness and atrophy, it has a distinctive pattern of muscle involvement, and is unresponsive to conventional forms of immunotherapy. This review covers the clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and the latest information on genetic susceptibility and pathogenesis of sporadic inclusion body myositis.

### Treatment guidelines for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies in adults: a comparative review [^113qVnSE]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Myositis, or idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, encompasses a group of autoimmune diseases with broad-spectrum clinical presentations, with a common presentation of muscle weakness and inflammation. The management of myositis presents significant challenges due to the rarity and variability of the disease and lack of large-scale, randomized controlled trials. Due to limited evidence available from smaller studies as well as variation in treatment practices across geographical regions and disease subtypes, available published treatment recommendations vary significantly. There is a need, therefore, to develop multidisciplinary consensus-driven guidelines that appropriately reflect the diverse and complex nature of the disease. This comparative review presents an in-depth analysis of existing myositis treatment guidelines from diverse organizations, highlighting similarities and key differences in diagnoses, treatment and management recommendations. We propose that there is a need for developing globally unified, consensus-driven standardized set of guidelines for effective myositis management.

### Immunotherapies for immune-mediated myopathies: a current perspective [^11455GQD]. Neurotherapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Until recently, the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory myopathies has largely been empirical with glucocorticoids, steroid-sparing immunosuppressive drugs, and intravenous immunoglobulin. However, a proportion of patients are only partially responsive to these therapies, and there has been a need to consider alternative treatment approaches. In particular, patients with inclusion body myositis are resistant to conventional immunotherapies or show only a transient response, and remain a major challenge. With increasing recognition of the different subtypes of immune-mediated inflammatory myopathies, and improved understanding of their pathogenesis, more targeted treatments are now being trialled. The overall approach to treatment, and novel therapies targeting B cells, T cells, and specific cytokines are discussed in this review.

### A prospective natural history study of inclusion body myositis: implications for clinical trials [^113fLZSP]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Eleven patients with untreated inclusion body myositis (IBM) were prospectively studied during a 6-month period that included muscle strength, lean body mass, and muscle mass measurements. There was an overall quantifiable mean decline in percent of predicted normal muscle strength of 4% from baseline in a 6-month period, but one third of patients showed no change or slight improvements in strength. Short-term treatment trials in IBM will require large numbers of patients to detect slowing, arrest, or even slight improvement in muscle strength.

### Clinical subgroups and factors associated with progression in patients with inclusion body myositis [^115Bg7Xk]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most common acquired myopathy in individuals older than 50 years. The disorder is slowly progressive, and although many therapies have been investigated, response has generally been poor. Clinical heterogeneity may influence treatment responsiveness; however, data regarding heterogeneity in IBM are limited and often conflicting. We aim to identify clinically distinct subgroups within a large IBM cohort and prognostic factors for disease progression.

Methods

Clinical, histologic, radiologic, and electrophysiologic data were analyzed for all patients with IBM and other forms of myositis enrolled in a longitudinal cohort from The Johns Hopkins Myositis Center from 2003 to 2018. Patients with IBM were included if they met at least one of the following criteria: Griggs possible, European Neuromuscular Centre 2011 probable, or Lloyd-Greenberg data-derived criteria for IBM. Univariate, multivariate, and graphical analyses were used to identify prognostic factors in patients with IBM. Thus, linear and logistic regressions were used to adjust for potential confounding variables. The evolution of creatine kinase and muscle strength was studied using multilevel linear regression models. Nonmodifiable risk factors (sex, race, disease duration, and age at the onset of first symptoms) were used as adjusting covariates for the regression analyses.

Results

Among the 335 patients meeting the inclusion criteria for IBM, 64% were male with an average age of disease onset of 58.7 years and delay to diagnosis of 5.2 years. Initial misdiagnosis (52%) and immunosuppressant treatment (42%) were common. Less than half (43%) of muscle biopsies demonstrated all 3 pathologic hallmarks: endomysial inflammation, mononuclear cell invasion, and rimmed vacuoles. Black patients had significantly weaker arm abductors, hip flexors, and knee flexors compared with non-Black patients. Female patients had stronger finger flexors and knee extensors compared with their male counterparts. Younger age (< 50 years) at onset was not associated with increased weakness.

Discussion

Our study demonstrates that female and Black patients have distinct clinical phenotypes and trajectories within the overarching IBM clinical phenotype. These subgroups may have different responses to therapies, which may influence the design of future clinical trials in IBM.

### Challenges in international investigator-led rare disease clinical trials and the case for optimism in inclusion body myositis [^112Bo6bg]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This paper aims to provide insight into the challenges and opportunities of conducting an investigator-led, international, multicentre clinical trial for Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), a rare inflammatory myopathy.

Methods

An international, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial of a repurposed drug (sirolimus) was initiated based on promising results from a mono-centric pilot study. The progress of the trial was analysed to identify key challenges encountered and solutions developed.

Results

This large, collaborative study has presented a mosaic of challenges and opportunities, many ubiquitous with investigator-led trials. Key challenges have included securing adequate funding, coordinating manufacture of placebo, negotiating international contracts, managing limited study budgets and delays linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Alongside these challenges, the study team have found opportunities for creative and effective solutions, including the flexibility of building study databases, optimising digital data capture and harnessing patient involvement.

Conclusions

Instrumental to the progress of the trial has been the collaboration between site teams, patient partnership and adaptability.

### Exploring challenges in the management and treatment of inclusion body myositis [^114r2rjg]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review provides an overview of the management and treatment landscape of inclusion body myositis (IBM), while highlighting the current challenges and future directions.

Recent Findings

IBM is a slowly progressive myopathy that predominantly affects patients over the age of 40, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, a definitive cure for IBM remains elusive. Various clinical trials targeting inflammatory and some of the noninflammatory pathways have failed. The search for effective disease-modifying treatments faces numerous hurdles including variability in presentation, diagnostic challenges, poor understanding of pathogenesis, scarcity of disease models, a lack of validated outcome measures, and challenges related to clinical trial design. Close monitoring of swallowing and respiratory function, adapting an exercise routine, and addressing mobility issues are the mainstay of management at this time.

Summary

Addressing the obstacles encountered by patients with IBM and the medical community presents a multitude of challenges. Effectively surmounting these hurdles requires embracing cutting-edge research strategies aimed at enhancing the management and treatment of IBM, while elevating the quality of life for those affected.

### Emerging treatment options for inclusion body myositis [^116nac95]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a disabling and progressive muscle disease with no effective disease-modifying therapies. This article summarizes recent advances in IBM therapeutics, analysing the reasons for historic trial failures and highlighting more promising contemporary approaches. Improved understanding of IBM's multifaceted pathogenesis has led to development of targeted approaches-including agents modulating autophagy, myostatin inhibition, and T-cell dysregulation. In addition to pharmacologic interventions, exercise-based strategies, robotics, and surgical procedures are being explored for symptom management. Dysphagia, a major contributor to morbidity, is receiving increased attention through both conservative and interventional approaches.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments in inclusion body myositis: a systematic review [^112ZQjTC]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Given IBM's slow progression, determining the optimal time to assess treatment efficacy and the overall follow-up duration is critical, though no consensus exists. The follow-up periods in studies included in this review varied from 3to 20months, with 12 months being the most common follow-up period.

The pathogenesis of IBM remains poorly understood, but recent advances have led to trials of new treatment strategies targeting various pathways. Interventions in this review have targeted immunosuppression, muscle protein degradation, and muscle wasting and atrophy. These results provide a foundation for future studies with more clearly defined endpoints and treatment targets. Additionally, investigating alternative pathways (eg, mitochondrial changes) or using combination therapies targeting multiple pathwayscould be explored in the future.

Following the Sirolimus (Rapamycin) phase 2 clinical trial in IBM with some promising secondary outcome results, a phase 3 clinical trial with the same drug is ongoing (NCT04789070). Sirolimus inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway which has various effects on cell metabolism, including promoting autophagy. Furthermore, it has a role in immunomodulation by upregulating Tregs and the suppression of effector CD8/CD4+T cells. Therefore, the drug may have a multifaceted effect on IBM.

The clonal expansion and replacement of naïve or early effector memory T cells (T EM1 and T EM2 cells) in both the blood and muscle tissue of IBM patients not only provide evidence of chronic antigen-driven T cell activationbut also represent immunosenescence. While the specific antigen responsible for triggering autoreactivity of CD8+and CD4+ T cells remains elusive, the enduring presence of the highly differentiated effector memory and cytotoxic CD4+ (CD4+CD28-) and CD8+T cells (CD8+CD28-, CD8+CD244+, CD8+CD57+, CD8+Killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1)+) infiltrating the muscles suggests evasion from the regulatory immune mechanisms that typically control autoimmunity. Currently, a phase 2/3 (NCT05721573) study in IBM is evaluating ABC008/Ulviprubart, a humanised monoclonal antibody against KLRG1, which selectively depletes highly differentiated T cells. Early data from a pilot study in three IBM patients demonstrated that ABC008 can selectively lower the proportion of circulating KLRG1+CD8+ T cells and T-LGLs. Circulating Tregs were not depleted with the drug. Some improvement in functional measures was noted in these patients.

### Pathogenesis of inclusion body myositis [^112VQvrH]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the pathogenesis of inclusion body myositis (IBM).

Recent Findings

IBM is an autoimmune disease. Multiple arms of the immune system are activated, but a direct attack on muscle fibers by highly differentiated T cells drives muscle destruction.

Summary

Further understanding of the pathogenesis of IBM guides rational approaches to developing therapeutic strategies.

### Inflammatory myopathies: clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects [^113W1gxS]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

The three major forms of immune-mediated inflammatory myopathy are dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), and inclusion-body myositis (IBM). They each have distinctive clinical and histopathologic features that allow the clinician to reach a specific diagnosis in most cases. Magnetic resonance imaging is sometimes helpful, particularly if the diagnosis of IBM is suspected but has not been formally evaluated. Myositis-specific antibodies are not helpful diagnostically but may be of prognostic value; most antibodies have low sensitivity. Muscle biopsy is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis of an inflammatory myopathy and to allow unusual varieties such as eosinophilic, granulomatous, and parasitic myositis, and macrophagic myofasciitis, to be recognized. The treatment of the inflammatory myopathies remains largely empirical and relies upon the use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and intravenous immunoglobulin, all of which have nonselective effects on the immune system. Further controlled clinical trials are required to evaluate the relative efficacy of the available therapeutic modalities particularly in combinations, and of newer immunosuppressive agents (mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus) and cytokine-based therapies for the treatment of resistant cases of DM, PM, and IBM. Improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of muscle injury in the inflammatory myopathies should lead to the development of more specific forms of immunotherapy for these conditions.

### Inclusion body myositis: from genetics to clinical trials [^117N6x89]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) belongs to the group of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and is characterized by a slowly progressive disease course with asymmetric muscle weakness of predominantly the finger flexors and knee extensors. The disease leads to severe disability and most patients lose ambulation due to lack of curative or disease-modifying treatment options. Despite some genes reported to be associated with hereditary IBM (a distinct group of conditions), data on the genetic susceptibility of sporadic IBM are very limited. This review gives an overview of the disease and focuses on the current genetic knowledge and potential therapeutic implications.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments in inclusion body myositis: a systematic review [^113MLP2W]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Meta-analysis and narrative synthesis

Meta-analysis of results to assess the efficacy of the different pharmacological interventions was only possible in two RCTs (for interferon beta-1a vs placebo comparison) due to the marked differences between the included RCTs (different interventions, different modes of administration, different dosages and different follow-ups, among others; resulting in a highly irreconcilable clinical heterogeneity). The results of the meta-analyses were carried out for four outcomes (average grip strength, composite MVICT score, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) LBM and MMT) but none revealed statistically significant differences (figure 3; p > 0.05). In addition, we carried out meta-analyses to determine the OR of serious adverse events of the different pharmacological interventions. The summary of the meta-analyses was grouped into a single forest plot (figure 4). The results of the meta-analyses and the narrative summary (online supplemental material S3) show that the pharmacological interventions were well tolerated or similar to placebo in terms of adverse events and serious adverse events. Only one exception was observed for sirolimus (OR 2.16, 95% Cl 0.64 to 7.26).

### Dysphagia in inclusion body myositis: clinical features, management, and clinical outcome [^112fpdjV]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical features, treatment strategies, and outcome of dysphagia in patients with inclusion body myositis.

Design

Retrospective review of all 26 patients (20 women, 6 men, mean age of 72.2 yrs) with inclusion body myositis-associated dysphagia seen in 1997–2001 at our institution.

Results

Twenty-four patients (92%) had a dysphagia evaluation. Cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction was noted in all nine patients who had barium swallow studies. Eighteen patients (69%) underwent one or more interventional procedures: cricopharyngeal myotomy (10), pharyngoesophageal dilation (6), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (6), and botulinum injection of the upper esophageal sphincter (2). Dysphagia tended to worsen with time. Symptomatic improvement was noted with cricopharyngeal myotomy (63%) and pharyngoesophageal dilation (33%). The Mendelsohn maneuver seemed helpful in maintaining oral intake in the three patients in whom it was recommended. Thirteen patients died during follow-up at a mean age of 81 yrs. The cause of death was identified in eight and in all cases was because of the respiratory complications of aspiration.

Conclusions

Dysphagia is a progressive condition in patients with inclusion body myositis and often leads to death from aspiration pneumonia. Treatment targeting cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction, such as the Mendelsohn maneuver, will benefit from further investigation.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments in inclusion body myositis: a systematic review [^116FDMwJ]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment options have attempted to target inflammatory, degenerative, and atrophic features of IBM, with large clinical trials having been recently conductedsince the last systematic review (SR) took place. Since there was no recent SR investigating the efficacy of treatment interventions for IBM, and considering the need to expand the body of knowledge in light of new and large clinical trials, we performed an SR that aimed to identify the best evidence on the efficacy of treatment interventions for IBM and to describe their safety, if reported, in the included studies.

### Inclusion-body myositis, a multifactorial muscle disease associated with aging: current concepts of pathogenesis [^117Kn7uK]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Sporadic inclusion-body myositis, the most common muscle disease of older persons, has no known cause or persistently beneficial treatment. The unfolding pathogenesis could lead to new treatment strategies and it is now of growing interest among clinicians and basic scientists. About 100 papers related to the subject were published in 2006 and the first part of 2007 (we cite only articles most relevant to this review).

Recent Findings

This review focuses on the current concepts of the pathogenesis of sporadic inclusion-body myositis. Both degeneration and mononuclear-cell inflammation are components of the pathology, but how each relates to the pathogenesis remains unclear. We suggest that an intramuscle fiber degenerative component is primary, leading to muscle-fiber destruction, while the lymphocytic inflammatory component may only slightly contribute to sporadic inclusion-body myositis muscle-fiber damage. Intracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta precursor protein, amyloid-beta, and amyloid-beta oligomers in an aging muscle-fiber cellular milieu, and other abnormalities, appear to be key pathogenic factors. We summarize intracellular molecular events and their consequences, and correlate findings in sporadic inclusion-body myositis muscle biopsies with inclusion-body myositis experimental models in tissue culture and in transgenic mice.

Summary

Treatment of sporadic inclusion-body myositis remains a challenge. Antiinflammatory approaches used so far are without major or enduring benefit. Possible new treatment avenues are suggested.

### Safety and efficacy of arimoclomol for inclusion body myositis: a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113kwoPb]. The Lancet: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Background

Inclusion body myositis is the most common progressive muscle wasting disease in people older than 50 years, with no effective drug treatment. Arimoclomol is an oral co-inducer of the cellular heat shock response that was safe and well-tolerated in a pilot study of inclusion body myositis, reduced key pathological markers of inclusion body myositis in two in-vitro models representing degenerative and inflammatory components of this disease, and improved disease pathology and muscle function in mutant valosin-containing protein mice. In the current study, we aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of arimoclomol in people with inclusion body myositis.

Methods

This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled adults in specialist neuromuscular centres in the USA (11 centres) and UK (one centre). Eligible participants had a diagnosis of inclusion body myositis fulfilling the European Neuromuscular Centre research diagnostic criteria 2011. Participants were randomised (1:1) to receive either oral arimoclomol 400 mg or matching placebo three times daily (1200 mg/day) for 20 months. The randomisation sequence was computer generated centrally using a permuted block algorithm with randomisation numbers masked to participants and trial staff, including those assessing outcomes. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to month 20 in the Inclusion Body Myositis Functional Rating Scale (IBMFRS) total score, assessed in all randomly assigned participants, except for those who were randomised in error and did not receive any study medication, and those who did not meet inclusion criteria. Safety analyses included all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02753530, and is completed.

Findings

Between Aug 16, 2017 and May 22, 2019, 152 participants with inclusion body myositis were randomly assigned to arimoclomol (n = 74) or placebo (n = 78). One participant was randomised in error (to arimoclomol) but not treated, and another (assigned to placebo) did not meet inclusion criteria. 150 participants (114 [76%] male and 36 [24%] female) were included in the efficacy analyses, 73 in the arimoclomol group and 77 in the placebo group. 126 completed the trial on treatment (56 [77%] and 70 [90%], respectively) and the most common reason for treatment discontinuation was adverse events. At month 20, mean IBMFRS change from baseline was not statistically significantly different between arimoclomol and placebo (-3·26, 95% CI -4·15 to -2·36 in the arimoclomol group vs -2·26, -3·11 to -1·41 in the placebo group; mean difference -0·99 [95% CI -2·23 to 0·24]; p = 0·12). Adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred in 13 (18%) of 73 participants in the arimoclomol group and four (5%) of 78 participants in the placebo group. Serious adverse events occurred in 11 (15%) participants in the arimoclomol group and 18 (23%) in the placebo group. Elevated transaminases three times or more of the upper limit of normal occurred in five (7%) participants in the arimoclomol group and one (1%) in the placebo group. Tubulointerstitial nephritis was observed in one (1%) participant in the arimoclomol group and none in the placebo group.

Interpretation

Arimoclomol did not improve efficacy outcomes, relative to placebo, but had an acceptable safety profile in individuals with inclusion body myositis. This is one of the largest trials done in people with inclusion body myositis, providing data on disease progression that might be used for subsequent clinical trial design.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments in inclusion body myositis: a systematic review [^117NH5F4]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This SR provides evidence that pharmacological interventions are largely ineffective for most outcomes of interest and disease progression in people with IBM. However, a few studies indicated some beneficial effects for certain interventions, including intravenous immunoglobulin, anti-T-lymphocyte immunoglobulin plus MTX, bimagrumaband sirolimus, on some assessed outcomes. These findings, however, have not been consistently replicated, nor was there uniformity across the outcome measures. Regarding safety, most trials reported that the interventions were well tolerated, with adverse events generally mild and similar to those observed with placebo.

Due to the lack of an agreed-on core outcome set in IBM, a wide range of different assessments — including muscle strength, endurance, physical function and quality of life assessments — have been evaluated as primary or secondary measures in studies, making integration into meta-analyses challenging. Meta-analyses were only possible in two RCTs and found no significant differences in primary or secondary outcomes, including mean grip strength, MVICT composite score, DEXA LBM and MMT. In most studies, muscle strength was the primary outcome, but in two recent RCTs of high quality with the highest number of patients, endurance (6MWD)and physical function (IBMFRS)were the primary outcomes. Overall, muscle strength testing, such as QMTand MMT, and safety and tolerability, were the most common primary outcome measures. These were followed by laboratory tests, NSS, open muscle biopsy findings, assessment of activities of daily living, TMV measured by MRI, and the already mentioned 6MWDand IBMFRS score, each used in one study. These discrepancies in primary outcome measures highlight the need for a core set to assess treatment efficacy in IBM.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments in inclusion body myositis: a systematic review [^1159Lx5a]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To identify the best evidence on the efficacy of treatment interventions for inclusion body myositis (IBM) and to describe their safety.

Methods

Systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological treatments of adults with IBM, conducted according to the Cochrane Handbook, updating a previous Cochrane review. The search strategy was run on Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Assessment of risk of bias, data extraction and synthesis were performed independently by two reviewers. Data pooled in statistical meta-analyses, if possible.

Results

From a total of 487 records, 48 were selected for full-text review, 14 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, but only 2 RCTs were included in meta-analyses due to clinical heterogeneity (different drug interventions or dosages). Treatments included various immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents, alongside interventions modulating muscle growth and protein homoeostasis. Efficacy was assessed across multiple outcomes, namely muscle strength, physical function, mobility and muscle trophicity. Trials of methotrexate (MTX), intravenous immunoglobulin, interferon beta-1a and MTX, MTX and anti-T-lymphocyte immunoglobulin, oxandrolone, MTX and azathioprine, bimagrumab, arimoclomol, and sirolimus provided low-quality to high-quality evidence of having no effect on the progression of IBM.

Conclusions

Drug interventions for IBM were not effective for most of the outcomes of interest. We observed inconsistency of outcome measures across trials. More RCTs are needed, of adequate size and duration, and using a standardised set of outcome measures.

### Recent clinical trials in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^11545aG4]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are complex multisystemic autoimmune diseases. Glucocorticoids remain the cornerstone of treatment in IIM, and the benefit of additional immunosuppressors is still debated. A limited number of controlled clinical trials have been available to support treatment guidelines, but in the last year, several clinical trials have been published. In this review, the highlights of recently published and on-going clinical trials in IIM will be summarized and discussed.

Recent Findings

Post hoc analyses of a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggested new predictive factors of response to rituximab in refractory IIM individuals. An international collaboration enabled the completion of a large RCT in early juvenile dermatomyositis that will orient first-line treatment in that population. New approaches are showing encouraging results in inclusion body myositis.

Summary

Recent advances in molecular mechanisms underlying IIM pathogenesis and the development of novel targeted therapies have influenced recent and on-going clinical research.

### Exploring challenges in the management and treatment of inclusion body myositis [^111e9hDu]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a chronic progressive muscle disease with an unclear underlying cause. Despite its significant impact on patient morbidity and mortality, there is currently no recognized cure or disease-modifying therapy available for IBM. Clinicians, patients, and scientists face numerous challenges in the treatment of this disease including the variable clinical phenotypes at presentation and difficulties in early-stage diagnosis. A major obstacle in addressing IBM lies in the limited understanding of its pathogenesis, which in turn limits the development of targeted treatment therapies. Additionally, innovative trial outcome measures and designs are likely needed to facilitate the development of more effective treatments.

### Sirolimus leads to rapid and sustained clinical improvement of motor deficits in a patient with inclusion body myositis [^111QcNTR]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

To provide further evidence for sirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, as a treatment strategy for patients with inclusion body myositis (IBM).

Methods

We acquired longitudinal clinical data and immunological assessments of CD8 + T-cell subsets in peripheral blood for evaluation of potential anti-inflammatory treatment effects of sirolimus.

Results

Therapy with sirolimus 2 mg/day by mouth led to rapid and sustained clinical improvement of motor symptoms for an observation period of more than 1 year. Treatment was well tolerated, with no occurrence of adverse effects. We did not observe a meaningful alteration of CD8 + T-cell subsets in our patient after 9 and 12 months compared to baseline.

Conclusions

The significant and persistent clinical improvement highlights the use of sirolimus as a potential treatment option in patients with IBM. In light of the lack of immunological treatment effects observed for cytotoxic CD8 + T cells, further studies should investigate the potential myoprotective effects of sirolimus.

LIMITED DISEASE MODELS

The availability of validated disease models to understand pathogenesis and develop treatments is an important aspect in translational research. Modeling monogenic inherited diseases via gene editing is more straightforward compared to diseases such as IBM. Models for hereditary multisystem proteinopathies (MSP), mainly VCP mouse models, have been used in IBM. Although also known as hereditary inclusion body myopathies, VCP and other MSP disorders are distinct entities with different clinical features and populations at risk compared to IBM. A MCK-βAPP model has been reported. Furthermore, cholesterol-fed rabbits and nematode C. elegans have also been proposed. More recently, a xenograft animal model was developed where human muscle from IBM patients was transplanted into immunodeficient mice. The xenograft recapitulated the canonical histopathological features of IBM. However, given the nature of these models, functional and behavioral evaluations cannot be performed.

Modeling the inflammatory component is also challenging. There are reported animal models for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies but not IBM. Existing models encompass infection-related models of myositis [virus models such as Ross River virus (RRV) infection and Coxsackie virus B], antigen-induced, and myosin and C protein induced myositis models. Although these models result in muscle inflammation mimicking human inflammatory myopathies, they are unlikely to recapitulate IBM features which involve CD8+- T-cell driven endomysial inflammation and noninflammatory findings.

### Inclusion body myositis: update on pathogenesis and treatment [^11724iRA]. Neurotherapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Inclusion body myositis is the most common acquired myopathy after the age of 50. It is characterized by progressive asymmetric weakness predominantly affecting the quadriceps and/or finger flexors. Loss of ambulation and dysphagia are major complications of the disease. Inclusion body myositis can be associated with cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1A antibodies. Muscle biopsy usually shows inflammatory cells surrounding and invading non-necrotic muscle fibers, rimmed vacuoles, congophilic inclusions, and protein aggregates. Disease pathogenesis remains poorly understood and consists of an interplay between inflammatory and degenerative pathways. Antigen-driven, clonally restricted, cytotoxic T cells represent a main feature of the inflammatory component, whereas abnormal protein homeostasis with protein misfolding, aggregation, and dysfunctional protein disposal is the hallmark of the degenerative component. Inclusion body myositis remains refractory to treatment. Better understanding of the disease pathogenesis led to the identification of novel therapeutic targets, addressing both the inflammatory and degenerative pathways.

Characteristics of included studies and interventions

Study characteristics are detailed in online supplemental material S3. Pharmacological interventions included various immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents alongside interventions aimed at modulating muscle growth or protein homoeostasis, namely MTX alone, intravenous immunoglobulin, interferon beta-1a and MTX, anti-T-lymphocyte immunoglobulin and MTX, azathioprine and MTX, oxandrolone, bimagrumab, arimoclomoland sirolimus. The summary of findings, integrating all included RCTs, along with the interventions and their impact on outcomes, is presented in table 1. The follow-up periods varied from 3to 20months, with 12 months being the most common follow-up period. Overall, we found that pharmacological interventions were not effective for most of the outcomes of interest and had no effect on the progression of IBM.

Summary of findings

Regarding the safety of pharmacological interventions, most studies reported that they were well tolerated or similar to placebo.

### Inclusion body myositis: advancements in diagnosis, pathomechanisms, and treatment [^111tAGhp]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review new advances in inclusion body myositis (IBM) and discuss them in light of current knowledge on diagnosis, pathomechanisms, and treatment perspectives.

Recent Findings

IBM is a treatment refractory inflammatory myopathy in middle-aged patients that leads to a slow, relentlessly progressive muscle weakness, and atrophy. Recent data collections suggest that mortality in IBM patients is somewhat elevated compared with the general population. One major risk factor for death is severe dysphagia, which can now be determined by a novel real-time MRI technique. Recently, proposed diagnostic criteria with a combination of clinical and histopathological features have improved sensitivity and specificity. cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1A antibodies have been characterized in IBM patients and their pathophysiologic role has recently been studied. New inflammatory pathomechanisms have been identified in IBM muscle and may help to design novel treatment strategies. A broad spectrum of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory trials have been conducted, but - so far- no effective treatment is available. Current therapeutic attempts aim to block the myostatin pathway or restore the protein homeostasis.

Summary

The expanding knowledge of the complex disease, the refinement of diagnostic criteria, and developments in diagnostic procedures are expected to foster the much needed design of new treatment approaches for future clinical trials.

Results

Out of a total of 487 records, 48 were selected for full-text review, and 14 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in this SR. Of these, only two RCTs were included in the meta-analysis due to clinical heterogeneity of the remaining studies (different drug interventions or dosages). There was no need to contact the authors of the papers to request additional information. The results of the searches are shown in a flow diagram (figure 1).

Figure 1
Flow chart of the study selection and inclusion process.

Methodological quality

The critical appraisal results for each study are summarised in figure 2 and online supplemental material S2. There was agreement among the reviewers to include all the studies that were appraised. The more recent RCTs included in this SR update were of high quality. Five RCTs were of moderate quality. Finally, four RCTs were of low quality, indicating a high risk of bias. All but two of the RCTs complied with a random sequence generation and allocation concealment. There was an unclear risk of bias or high bias in ~57% of the RCTs, for blinding of participants and personnel and blinding of outcome assessment. For incomplete outcome data and selective reporting, an unclear risk of bias or high bias was observed in ~43% of the RCTs. For other biases, an unclear risk of bias or high bias was observed in ~64% of the RCTs. Overall, the included RCTs provide low to high-quality evidence, with notable improvement observed in the more recent studies.

### Immunotherapy of myositis: issues, concerns and future prospects [^114y3Ajy]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

The main inflammatory myopathies within the myositis group include polymyositis, dermatomyositis and inclusion-body myositis (IBM). Although potentially treatable, various practical issues have an impact on the response of these conditions to therapy. The most common reason for therapeutic failure is that the treatment targets the wrong disease, often owing to poor distinction of polymyositis from difficult-to-treat mimics such as sporadic IBM, necrotizing myopathies and inflammatory dystrophies. Evidence from uncontrolled studies suggests that polymyositis and dermatomyositis respond to treatment with prednisone at least to some degree. Empirically, adding an immunosuppressive drug might offer a 'steroid-sparing' effect or perhaps additional benefit. Intravenous immunoglobulin is proven effective as a second-line agent in patients with dermatomyositis and also seems to be effective for those with polymyositis, but offers only minimal and transient benefit to a small proportion of patients with IBM. Small, uncontrolled series suggest other agents such as rituximab or tacrolimus might offer some benefit in disease refractory to the aforementioned therapies, although IBM is resistant to most therapies. Novel agents are emerging as potential treatment options for all forms of myositis. This Review highlights common pitfalls in therapy, discusses emerging new therapies, and provides a practical therapeutic algorithm.

In contrast, while pharmacologic therapies have had little to no benefit in IBM, several nonpharmacologic strategies have had successes. Blood flow restricted resistance training for 12 weeks in IBM patients increased muscle strength on testing indicating specific strength training exercises may be beneficial for this group of patients. Other exercises programs including community exercise and home exercise programs have also increased patient exercise capacity and preserved muscle function in IBM. Medical devices such as cyborg hybrid assistive limb therapy and selective ankle foot orthoses have also improved ambulatory function in IBM. An expiratory muscle strength training device to improve swallowing has also been considered. Additionally, self-management training and shared medical appointments have improved social endurance and healthcare quality of life. However, current standard-of-care guidelines in IBM are lacking.

TREATMENT

Evidence-based treatment recommendations cannot be made in IBM and the limited studies so far have shown that the disease is resistant to immunosuppressive drugs. A recent retrospective study in 16 IBM patients suggested short-term benefit of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment on muscle strength and dysphagia. However, this benefit was only temporary and limited to a small proportion of patients. The role of IVIg in the treatment of IBM is yet to be clarified in an adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT).

The effects of exercise in patients with inflammatory myopathies, including IBM, have been recently reviewed. There are promising data from open-label studies, but larger RCTs are needed to evaluate the possible effect of exercise in IBM. A randomized cross-over trial (n = 30) aimed at investigating the effect of aerobic training in IBM is currently recruiting patients.

Other potential new therapeutic agents are being investigated in early phase studies. Modulating the cytoprotective heat shock response (HSR) represents a therapeutic strategy through which the detrimental aspects of both inflammation and degeneration could be dampened. A placebo-controlled trial with arimoclomol (16 active drug, eight placebo), an orally administered pharmacological agent that can upregulate the HSR by amplifying heat shock protein expression, was recently reported in abstract format. Arimoclomol was well tolerated and demonstrated a preliminary signal for potential therapeutic benefit in patients with IBM, supporting further research of arimoclomol in this disease.

Antagonists of myostatin could potentially be used as therapeutic agents in IBM. Myostatin is a protein that negatively regulates skeletal muscle growth, and myostatin antagonists have shown promise for increasing muscle mass and strength in animal studies. The myostatin pathway is currently being investigated in two studies. A placebo-controlled trial (11 active, three placebo) with BYM338, an intravenously administered mAb that binds competitively to activin receptor type IIB with greater affinity than myostatin, was recently completed and results are awaited. Intramuscular follistatin gene transfer (follistatin is a naturally occurring antagonist of myostatin) is also being tested in an open-trial enrolling nine IBM patients.

Etanercept, a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist administered subcutaneously, is currently being tested in a placebo-controlled study with 30 patients. Results from one open-label study evaluating 20 patients treated with lithium are also expected; animal studies have shown that lithium can modulate tau phosphorylation via suppression of glycogen synthase kinase-3β.

Sample size, outcome measures and power analysis

Clinical changes were evaluated on the basis of the total muscle strength scores obtained at baseline (pre-treatment) to scores obtained after treatment, as determined at 2-month intervals. Assessment of clinical improvement was based on the difference in the total muscle strength scores from three sequential time periods; 12 months natural history (pre-treatment, baseline, period), 6 months after CAMPATH (treatment period) and 6 months without treatment after completion of CAMPATH (post-treatment period). The percentage of change in the summed muscle strength scores obtained from each of the three periods was compared using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVA results were used to determine how the treatment periods differed from the baseline measurements. All data were checked for sphericity assumptions and Tukey's Least Significant Difference procedure was used for the post hoc analyses. A change in the muscle strength at 6 months by ≥ 10% was considered an improvement. Based on our previous assessments of muscle strength in inclusion-body myositis patients (Dalakas et al.) and a 0.12 (or 12%) standard deviation of difference, a power analysis of a two-sided paired t -test, 13 patients were needed to provide 80% power to detect a change by 10% at 6 months (test significance level, α 0.050 with a two-sided t -test). Power analysis was not performed for detecting changes in disease progression, as the percentage of strength decline was not known at the time the protocol began.

### The current status of treatment for inclusion-body myositis [^113AqPgu]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

There is no established treatment that improves, arrests, or slows the progression of inclusion-body myositis (IBM). Many anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant, or immunomodulating agents have been administered to patients with IBM but the design of clinical trials was such that it can only be concluded that none produced rapid improvement. The natural history of the disease is for stabilization or improvement in a third of patients for 6 months or more. Thus some agents that did not produce dramatic benefit may have been prematurely abandoned. However, because high-dose prednisone worsens strength while decreasing inflammation but increases amyloid accumulation, alternative targets for intervention and novel treatment strategies are needed.

### Long-term observational study of sporadic inclusion body myositis [^116LBF6a]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

We describe a long-term observational study of a large cohort of patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis and propose a sporadic inclusion body myositis weakness composite index that is easy to perform during a clinic. Data collection from two groups of patients (Paris and Oxford) was completed either during a clinic visit (52%), or by extraction from previous medical records (48%). One hundred and thirty-six patients [57% males, 61 (interquartile range 55–69) years at onset] were included. At the last visit all patients had muscle weakness (proximal British Medical Research Council scale < 3/5 in 48%, distal British Medical Research Council scale < 3/5 in 40%, swallowing problems in 46%). During their follow-up, 75% of patients had significant walking difficulties and 37% used a wheelchair (after a median duration from onset of 14 years). The sporadic inclusion body myositis weakness composite index, which correlated with grip strength (correlation coefficient: 0.47; P < 0.001) and Rivermead Mobility Index (correlation coefficient: 0.85; P < 0.001), decreased significantly with disease duration (correlation coefficient: -0.47; P < 0.001). The risk of death was only influenced by older age at onset of first symptoms. Seventy-one (52%) patients received immunosuppressive treatments [prednisone in 91.5%, associated (in 64.8%) with other immunomodulatory drugs (intravenous immunoglobulins, methotrexate or azathioprine) for a median duration of 40.8 months]. At the last assessment, patients who had been treated were more severely affected on disability scales (Walton P = 0.007, Rivermead Mobility Index P = 0.004) and on the sporadic inclusion body myositis weakness composite index (P = 0.04). The first stage of disease progression towards handicap for walking was more rapid among patients receiving immunosuppressive treatments (hazard ratio = 2.0, P = 0.002). This study confirms that sporadic inclusion body myositis is slowly progressive but not lethal and that immunosuppressive treatments do not ameliorate its natural course, thus confirming findings from smaller studies. Furthermore, our findings suggest that immunosuppressant drug therapy could have modestly exacerbated progression of disability. The sporadic inclusion body myositis weakness composite index might be a valuable outcome measure for future clinical trials, but requires further assessment and validation.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the response to placebo in clinical trials of inclusion body myositis [^113K4Aka]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness making it challenging to detect weakness changes during a clinical trial. Trial participants receiving placebo may behave differently than in natural history studies. We aimed to quantify the decline in muscle strength and IBM functional rating scale (IBMFRS) of IBM patients receiving placebo during clinical trials.

Methods

Several databases were searched. Randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trials without treatment intervention on the placebo group were included. Standardized mean differences (SMD) for change in muscle strength and mean differences for IBMFRS were used to calculate pooled effects, using DerSimonian-Laird continuous random effect models. Meta-regression determined change in muscle strength. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 indicator.

Results

Eleven eligible trials were identified with 257 participants receiving placebo and a low risk of bias (RoB) per the Cochrane Collaboration RoB 2 tool. Participants receiving placebo on average had a measurable decline in muscle strength with a mean effect size of-0.398 [-0.652,-0.144] (p = 0.002). SMD changed by -0.009 [-0.016,-0.002] points per week (p = 0.015). Manual muscle testing was associated with higher heterogeneity (I2 = 67.68%) compared with quantitative muscle testing (I2 = 0%). Only 3 studies reported IBMFRS results. The pooled change in IBMFRS at 12months was -2.189 points [-3.893,-0.485] on this 0–40 scale (p = 0.012), with relatively high heterogeneity.

Conclusion

Participants with IBM displayed a measurable decline in their muscle strength and IBMFRS during clinical trials, in keeping with the disease's slowly progressive nature. These estimates can inform sample size calculations in future studies.

### Treatment and prevention of the amyloidoses: can the lessons learned be applied to sporadic inclusion-body myositis? [^114iSZTR]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The amyloid fibril represents a final common pathologic pathway for a variety of human proteins, all of which have a propensity to misfold. Each seems to require a predisposing event to realize its fibrillogenic potential. It may be mutation, inappropriate or incomplete cleavage, overproduction, or the availability of a template for misfolding. Therapies have been based on decreasing the stimulus (inflammation in the case of AA) reducing the number of producing cells (AL) and a variety of approaches to removing the extracellular aggregates. Sporadic inclusion-body myositis (sIBM), while physically resembling the extracellular amyloidoses, is an intracellular disease, hence imposes the additional requirement of developing a therapy that can access and function inside the affected or potentially affected, cell. Current approaches to the treatment of other forms of amyloidosis are discussed in the context of their applicability, or lack thereof, to sIBM.

Discussion

This proof-of-principle study showed that a long-lasting reduction of peripheral T cells, as caused by CAMPATH, results in reduction of endomysial T cells and has the potential to arrest disease progression or improve strength of some patients with inclusion-body myositis (IBM). The study, designed to capture changes in the natural history of IBM, supports the view that aggressive immunotherapy may slowdown the course of the disease, at least for some patients, and opens the opportunity to explore long-term benefits with follow-up infusions.

In spite of the association of IBM with other autoimmune disorders and viruses and the prominent clonal expansion of endomysial cytotoxic T cells (Koffman et al; Muntzing et al; Badrising et al; Dalakas; Salajegheh et al; Chanin and Engel,), conventional immunotherapies, including IVIg (Dalakas et al.), have failed to provide significant benefits. The resistance of IBM to most immunotherapies has generated dilemmas about its pathogenesis, prompting the suggestion that it might be a primary neurodegenerative disorder (Askanas and Engel). The present study, powered to detect a > 10% change in strength, demonstrated improvement in some patient's strength and a slowdown in the overall disease progression based on the natural history data, for up to 6 months. Although the study was unblinded, the results are unbiased because: (i) the evaluators performing the QMT examinations were not participating in the day-to-day activity of the patients; (ii) the data were obtained simultaneously with the other patients participating in the natural history study that involved a large cohort of IBM patients; (iii) the QMT data were collected by the same evaluators who had performed the natural history study in the same patients; (iv) the MRC measurements, which usually display less variability than the QMT scales, independently provided convincing support for a more prominent stability or improvement; (v) IBM has not improved with any intervention in a 6-month period and, as shown from the natural history, it has a steady decline; and (vi) the gains in strength lasted ∼6 months, coinciding with the effect of CAMPATH on T cell depletion, reverting thereafter almost to baseline level. Most importantly, the noted strength changes in the improved patients were meaningful to their daily activities, although some placebo effect cannot be excluded.

### Inclusion body myositis and immunosenescence: current evidence and future perspectives [^116gWasq]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

IBM remains an enigmatic and complex muscle disorder where a deeper understanding of disease pathomechanisms and the identification of potential genetic contributors represent an unmet need. The absence of effective treatments has spurred endeavours to reassess the interplay between degeneration, including autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction and proteasomal dysregulation, and autoimmunity. IBM is unique among the other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies owing to its molecular signature involving highly differentiated cytotoxic T cells that evade immune regulation. This has led to a resurgence of interest in the development of immunomodulatory therapy. This review discusses the potential role of cellular immunosenescence in sustaining inflammation and/or fibrotic remodelling observed in IBM and appraises the rationale for some potential therapeutic approaches to mitigate disease progression.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments in inclusion body myositis: a systematic review [^116YbG3K]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Another challenge in assessing intervention efficacy is the heterogeneity of the disease. IBM presents with varying rates of progression, different symptom profiles (eg, dysphagia, upper or lower limb predominance, asymmetry) and comorbidities, especially given the advanced age of most patients. Other factors, such as fatigue, social support, and exercise type, intensity and duration, must be optimised to minimise their influence on outcomes. Although challenging, controlling these variables will facilitate more reliable outcome assessments in future studies.

Meta-analyses of serious adverse events suggest that most pharmacological interventions were well tolerated, with the exception of a slightly higher adverse event rate associated with sirolimus. Generally, adverse events were mild, and discontinuation due to serious side effects ranged from 0%to 33%of patients. Two studies lacked sufficient information on serious adverse events, while rates were reported as 18% in two studies,7%in one, and 6%in another. Immunosuppressive treatments were associated with a higher incidence of adverse effects, whereas IVIg studies reported fewer adverse events.

Our study has limitations. It is important to note that this SR focused on RCTs, limiting the scope to high-level evidence and excluding observational studies. Moreover, only 2 of the 14 RCTs were included in meta-analyses due to the small number of trials, lack of sufficient data and small sample sizes.

In conclusion, this review summarises existing evidence on the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for IBM. While most interventions were not effective, they had favourable safety profiles. To advance treatment options, optimising outcome measures, agreeing on a core outcome set and follow-up duration, and accounting for disease-specific and individual factors are crucial. The development of new treatments, alongside advances in understanding IBM pathogenesis, is vital. Further studies are necessary to identify effective treatments for IBM.

Immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatments in IBM: a plethora of failed trials

Although certain treatments have shown promising results, with efficacy being suggested, these findings have not been consistently replicated in other studies. Moreover, these studies were often small, lacked appropriate sample size calculations, did not demonstrate consistency across the outcome measures assessed, and involved confounding factors that must be considered, such as open-label designs, concomitant pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatments, and comparisons with historical groups of patients not matched for the interventions.

While autoimmunity has long been recognized as a potential pathogenic factor, the paucity of successful treatment (Table 1) has prompted the consideration of an alternative perspective: that other mechanisms might be accountable for IBM. The limited effectiveness of treatment methods employing broad non-selective lymphocyte depletion with alemtuzumab and anti-thymocyte globulin, or the inhibition of proliferating cells with steroids and methotrexate indicates that the autoimmunity observed in IBM muscle differs notably from that seen in other forms of IIM.

NATURAL HISTORY STUDIES

Recent studies investigating the natural history of IBM have confirmed the typical early disease phenotype and highlighted that IBM is often initially misdiagnosed, polymyositis being the most common incorrect initial diagnosis. They have also shown that survival in patients with IBM seems to be similar to the general population, but late-stage disease can cause very significant morbidity, including disability and reduced quality of life. Death in IBM is related to malnutrition, cachexia, aspiration, respiratory infection and respiratory failure, as a consequence of dysphagia, severe global weakness and weakness of the respiratory muscles. In a Dutch cohort, euthanasia or continuous deep sedation was used by 13% of patients with IBM, in comparison with 20% of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These data highlight the morbidity experienced by IBM patients and the importance of supportive and palliative care in IBM.

Regarding prognostic factors, Benveniste et al. found that male sex [hazard ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.5–3.9], older age (> 60 years) (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% CI 1.3–3.1) and immunosuppressive treatment (hazard ratio 2.1, 95% CI 1.3–3.3) were predictive of progression of disease towards handicap for walking. However, once a walking aid was needed, progression towards the use of a wheelchair was not associated with these variables.

Cortese et al. also found that older age (> 55 years) at disease onset was predictive of a shorter time to requirement of a walking stick (hazard ratio 4.1, 95% CI 1.7–9.8), but not sex or treatment.

Prospective data in IBM are scarce and limited to small numbers of patients. Mean decline in muscle strength by manual muscle testing was 3.5 ± 1.6% per year in the study by Cox et al. and 5.2 ± 5.9% over 1 year in the study by Cortese et al. Quantitative muscle testing of quadriceps extensors and the IBM functional rating scale may be sensitive tools to monitor disease progression.

### Sporadic inclusion body myositis: pathogenic considerations [^111UTVA4]. Annals of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Sporadic inclusion body myositis is the commonest acquired disease of skeletal muscles after 50 years of age, and as such it has commanded a great deal of attention of investigators over the past 25 years. As a result, a large amount of information has accumulated concerning its clinical profile, myopathology, and immunopathology. In the myopathology and immunopathology, there is general agreement that the characteristic features could be divided into a degenerative and an inflammatory group. However, there has been controversy about the possible role of these changes in the pathogenesis of muscle fiber damage. In particular, there is no agreement whether a cause-and-effect relationship exists between these two groups of changes, and if so, which is the primary one. In this brief overview, we examine the validity of the various controversial observations and critically review the justification for the two major hypotheses for the primary role of inflammation versus degeneration.

### Detecting dysphagia in inclusion body myositis [^111hTCbZ]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is an important yet inconsistently recognized symptom of inclusion body myositis (IBM). It can be disabling and potentially life-threatening. We studied the prevalence and symptom-sign correlation of dysphagia. Fifty-seven IBM patients were interviewed using a standard questionnaire for dysphagia and 43 of these underwent swallowing videofluoroscopy (VFS). Symptoms of dysphagia were present in 37 of 57 patients (65%). Nevertheless, only 17 of these patients (46%) had previously and spontaneously complained about swallowing to their physicians. Both symptoms of impaired propulsion (IP) (59%) and aspiration-related symptoms (52%) were frequently mentioned. Swallowing abnormalities on VFS were present in 34 of 43 patients (79%) with IP of the bolus in 77% of this group. The reported feeling of IP was confirmed by VFS in 92% of these patients. Dysphagia in IBM is common but underreported by the vast majority of patients if not specifically asked for. In practice, two questions reliably predict the presence of IP on VFS: 'Does food get stuck in your throat' and 'Do you have to swallow repeatedly in order to get rid of food'. These questions are an appropriate means in selecting IBM patients for further investigation through VFS and eventual treatment.

### Update in inclusion body myositis [^111YB31F]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

IBM is still an enigmatic and often misdiagnosed disease. The pathogenesis of the disease is not fully understood and pharmacological treatments have failed to show efficacy. However, recent advances and the increasing efforts of the scientific community to disentangle the disease mechanisms allow us to be optimistic about the future. New diagnostic criteria have been proposed by the ENMC, reflecting the knowledge that typical pathological findings may be absent in patients with clinically typical IBM. The new anti-cN1A antibody represents an important advance that may help early diagnosis in clinical practice. The role of MRI in IBM is expanding, not only as a diagnostic tool but also as a potential outcome measure in clinical trials. New therapeutic avenues are being explored and some of these may progress into efficacy trials. Future research should focus on increasing understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease and on the identification of reliable and sensitive outcome measures for clinical trials. International collaboration will be particularly important to translate research advances into tangible patient benefits and improved patient outcomes.

### A protocol to develop clinical guidelines for inclusion-body myositis [^1162sETC]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

As with systematic reviews, preparing guidelines involves many judgments. 14 Guideline construction is not standardized, and the methods used may not be detailed fully beforehand, increasing the risk of author bias. However, the impact of guideline authors' biases can be reduced by having a defined protocol for guideline development, as with clinical trials. A transparent and robust guideline protocol can also help to achieve recognition from relevant professional organizations. In this study we describe the protocol for the construction of internationally agreed‐upon guidelines for the diagnosis and management of IBM. In this work we aim to: (1) identify and navigate the practical challenges of producing evidence‐based guidance, informing future clinical guideline construction; and (2) provide a transparent guideline development process that minimizes methodological bias.

### Exploring challenges in the management and treatment of inclusion body myositis [^114wVtmi]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most prevalent muscle disease primarily affecting individuals above the age of 40. The disease has a male predominance occurring nearly twice as frequently in males compared to females. Although variability in presentation exists, IBM most commonly presents with muscle weakness predominantly affecting deep finger flexors and/or knee extensors. IBM is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Pharmacologic treatments tried to date have been relatively unsuccessful in modifying disease course without a currently recognized cure. The lack of treatment can be attributed to various challenges spanning from diagnostic challenges to the development of targeted therapies based on a comprehensive understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms. This article examines the diagnostic and management challenges faced by patients with IBM and provides an overview of the current treatment landscape.

Conclusions and future perspectives

Available treatment guidelines for myositis are based on limited evidence and are heterogeneous. There is an unmet need to develop rigorous evidence-based consensus treatment guidelines with clear treatment algorithms for different myositis subtypes. While more research is needed, non-pharmacological treatment options including diet and QoL should be addressed in future guidelines to achieve holistic disease management strategies. Furthermore, future guidelines involving multidisciplinary groups or patients may help to personalize treatment decisions based on patients' specific condition and response to therapy, likely resulting in improved prognosis and QoL outcomes in patients with myositis.

### Pathogenesis and therapy of inclusion body myositis [^1155Yxgv]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a poorly understood progressive muscle disease of middle and later life. Its dual pathologies of autoimmunity and unexplained myofiber degeneration and loss have been enigmatic since its earliest descriptions over 40 years ago. No reliable effective therapy currently exists for IBM. This review provides an update of current issues in the pathogenesis and therapy of IBM.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have further defined the clinical features of IBM, including natural history, pattern of muscle involvement, and role of MRI imaging. Further potential immune mediators have been identified. An autoantibody directed against a muscle antigen appears to have high specificity for IBM among muscle diseases. Further evidence for myonuclear degeneration has been reported.

Summary

IBM remains a poorly understood muscle disease, although understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms continues to expand and is supporting new therapeutic approaches.

1 INTRODUCTION

Sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a rare muscle disorder usually affecting those over age 50 years, characterized by slowly progressive weakness of the distal upper limbs and proximal lower limbs.

Unlike other idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) subtypes, patients with IBM do not respond clinically to immunosuppressive therapy and several factors conspire to make translational research endeavors challenging. The rarity of IBM and slow rate of disease progression make conduct of well‐powered clinical studies difficult. The usefulness of IBM clinical trial outcome measures is limited due to their inability to detect early improvement or stabilization of function that might reduce the required trial duration. Finally, our incomplete understanding of disease etiopathogenesis means that optimal drug targets are unknown.

In IBM, disease heterogeneity makes prognostication in clinical practice difficult and can affect interpretation of clinical trial results. The rate of disease progression can vary between IBM patients, although explanations for this are unclear. Of note, positivity for the autoantibody against anti‐cytosolic‐5′‐nucleotidase 1A (anti‐CN1A) is associated with a more severe disease phenotype. In one cross‐sectional study, anti‐CN1A antibody positivity was associated with increasing levels of weakness as measured by clinical examination, but not by dynamometry (grip and pinch). However, clinical trials to date in IBM have not stratified participants according to anti‐CN1A serotype and longitudinal data examining the rate of change relative to anti‐CN1A serotype are not available.

Dynamometry is a simple technique for quantifying muscle strength and has been used extensively to monitor patients with neuromuscular disorders, and as a clinical trial outcome measure. Measurements can easily be performed in the clinical setting, and the selective pattern of weakness in IBM lends itself to the use of dynamometry, as relatively few muscle groups require testing to capture disease severity. Several studies have attempted to capture longitudinal muscle strength data in IBM, although included numbers are usually small with short follow‐up.,

It remains unclear whether dynamometry can reliably monitor disease progression in IBM, how data could be used in clinical practice to individualize patient care or in research studies as a trial outcome measure, and how these changes correlate with other measures of IBM disease severity, particularly those assessing functional impact.

This study aimed to: (a) quantify the yearly rate of dynamometry‐measured strength loss across multiple muscle groups in a large IBM cohort, and (b) identify distinct trajectories of strength and functional change over time, with the aim of individualizing patient care and providing useful data for future clinical trial design.

### A protocol to develop clinical guidelines for inclusion-body myositis [^113gjD9P]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

ABSTRACT

Introduction

Inclusion‐body myositis (IBM) is a late‐onset idiopathic inflammatory myopathy associated with selective and progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Current clinical management of IBM is largely supportive due to its uncertain etiology and lack of effective treatment. Establishing a consensus of opinion on questions relating to diagnosis and management of IBM is expected to help reduce inconsistencies in the care and resources allocated to those living with this condition.

Methods

A protocol has been developed to produce best practice clinical guidelines for IBM based on a combination of published research and expert consensus.

Conclusions

In this study we describe the proposed protocol for developing methods for producing robust and transparent clinical guidance on aspects of diagnosis, drug treatment, physical and practical management, respiration, nutrition and cardiac management, psychosocial management, and multidisciplinary care. Muscle Nerve 53: 503–507, 2016

METHODS

Guideline Scope

Clinical guidelines will be developed (Table 1) for the diagnosis and management of sporadic IBM, excluding the unrelated group of conditions known as hereditary inclusion‐body myopathies (sometimes abbreviated to h‐IBM). This guidance is intended to be internationally applicable and will identify potential cost implications where appropriate. However, the guidance will not involve health economic analysis, which may be subject to variations in different health‐care systems.

Table 1
Stages of clinical guideline development, adapted from the NICE guidelines manual. 21

The Guideline Development Group

We will establish a multidisciplinary Guideline Development Group (GDG) composed of physicians, allied health‐care professionals, and patient representatives from different countries. Signed declaration of interest forms will be collected from all collaborators. The GDG members will then be assigned to 1 of 5 sectional themes on: (1) diagnosis; (2) drug treatment; (3) physical and practical management; (4) respiration, nutrition, and cardiac management; and (5) living with IBM, which will cover aspects of psychosocial management and multidisciplinary care. Each section steering committee will have a nominated section lead and between 7 and 9 other members, provisionally identified through the ENMC International Workshop. 8 The "Living with IBM" section will specifically include patient representation.

Clinical Questions

All 5 sections will discuss and agree on clinical questions for the guidelines to address, which will help to frame the content of the literature review and provide a context for formation of recommendation statements. The agreed‐upon questions will use a Patient/Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) format and will relate to the broad sectional themes, encompassing therapeutic, diagnostic, prognostic, population screening, and causation categories. 15 It is anticipated that some questions may be identified as unanswerable on review and will encourage further research. We also expect new questions to arise during guideline development, which could be explored in future guideline updates.

Literature Search

Our literature search will include randomized and non‐randomized studies. We will complete an initial overarching search of CINAHL (January 1981 to present), EMBASE (January 1980 to present), MEDLINE (1946 to present), and PsychINFO (1806 to present), with filters for English language and human studies. Ongoing trials will be identified through and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Databases will be searched again before guideline publication, allowing the section steering committees to reference any new studies.

### Immunosuppressant and immunomodulatory treatment for dermatomyositis and polymyositis [^113WFuyq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are chronic diseases with significant mortality and morbidity. Whilst immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies are frequently used, the optimal therapeutic regimen remains unclear. This is an update of a review first published in 2005.

Objectives

To assess the effects of immunosuppressants and immunomodulatory treatments for dermatomyositis and polymyositis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (August 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 3 2011), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2011) and clinicaltrials.gov (August 2011). We checked the bibliographies of identified trials and wrote to disease experts.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs involving participants with probable or definite dermatomyositis and polymyositis as defined by the criteria of Bohan and Peter, or definite, probable or mild/early by the criteria of Dalakas. In participants without a classical rash of dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis should have been excluded by muscle biopsy. We considered any immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory treatment. The two primary outcomes were the change in a function or disability scale measured as the proportion of participants improving one grade, two grades etc, predefined based on the scales used in the studies after at least six months, and a 15% or greater improvement in muscle strength compared with baseline after at least six months. Other outcomes were: the International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies Group (IMACS) definition of improvement, number of relapses and time to relapse, remission and time-to-remission, cumulative corticosteroid dose and serious adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected papers, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in included studies. They collected adverse event data from the included studies.

Main Results

The review authors identified fourteen 14 relevant RCTs. They excluded four trials. The 10 included studies, four of which have been added in this update, included a total of 258 participants. Six studies compared an immunosuppressant or immunomodulator with placebo control, and four studies compared two immunosuppressant regimes with each other. Most of the studies were small (the largest had 62 participants) and many of the reports contained insufficient information to assess risk of bias. Amongst the six studies comparing immunosuppressant with placebo, one study, investigating intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), showed statistically significant improvement in scores of muscle strength in the IVIg group over three months. Another study investigating etanercept showed some evidence of a steroid sparing effect, a secondary outcome in this review, but no improvement in other assessed outcomes. The other four randomised placebo-controlled trials assessed either plasma exchange and leukapheresis, eculizumab, infliximab or azathioprine against placebo and all produced negative results. Three of the four studies comparing two immunosuppressant regimes (azathioprine with methotrexate, ciclosporin with methotrexate, and intramuscular methotrexate with oral methotrexate plus azathioprine) showed no statistically significant difference in efficacy between the treatment regimes. The fourth study comparing pulsed oral dexamethasone with daily oral prednisolone and found that the dexamethasone regime had a shorter median time to relapse but fewer side effects. Immunosuppressants were associated with significant side effects.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review highlights the lack of high quality RCTs that assess the efficacy and toxicity of immunosuppressants in inflammatory myositis.

### Imaging swallowing function and the mechanisms driving dysphagia in inclusion body myositis [^115Nmf1G]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a progressive condition which commonly affects patients aged above 40. IBM does not respond to immunosuppression and no proven treatments are available. Up to 80% of patients develop some degree of swallowing impairment during the disease course. Dysphagia is a source of marked morbidity in IBM and predisposes patients to life-threatening complications such as aspiration pneumonia. The pathophysiology behind dysphagia in IBM is not fully understood. Evidence from imaging demonstrates that impaired swallowing is predominantly underpinned by oropharyngeal deficits. Changes in cricopharyngeal physiology is thought to be an important factor influencing dysphagia in IBM. However, it is unclear whether this is secondary to structural changes within the cricopharyngeus itself or driven by impairment of the muscles promoting pharyngeal clearance. The approach to dysphagia in IBM patients is limited by a lack of validated instruments to reliably assess swallowing function and an absence of effective therapeutic interventions derived from controlled trials targeting dysphagia. Imaging modalities such as the video fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) are commonly used to evaluate dysphagia in IBM. Whilst VFSS is a commonly used technique in clinical practice; cumulative radiation exposure with repeated testing can be a limitation. Alternative imaging techniques could be developed further as outcome measures for assessing swallowing. In this review, we provide an overview of imaging techniques used to assess swallowing and the insight provided from such investigations into the mechanisms behind dysphagia in IBM. We suggest future directions for evaluation and outcome measurement of dysphagia in this population.

### Proposed pathogenetic cascade of inclusion-body myositis: importance of amyloid-beta, misfolded proteins, predisposing genes, and aging [^1173e8F4]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Sporadic inclusion-body myositis, the most common muscle disease of older persons, is of unknown cause, and there is no successful treatment. Interest in sporadic inclusion-body myositis has been enhanced by the recent identification within the sporadic inclusion-body myositis muscle fibers of several abnormally accumulated proteins, which provides novel and important clues to the pathogenesis of sporadic inclusion-body myositis.

Recent Findings

This article summarizes the most recent findings leading to better understanding of the players in the pathogenetic cascade. It is suggested that lymphocytic inflammatory component is probably secondary, and it may contribute only slightly to muscle fiber damage in sporadic inclusion-body myositis. However, it is proposed that the identified abnormal accumulation, aggregation, and misfolding of proteins, combined with and perhaps provoked by an aging intracellular milieu, more essentially lead to the vacuolar degeneration and atrophy of the muscle fibers that are specific to sporadic inclusion-body myositis. Abnormal accumulations of the amyloid-beta precursor protein and of its proteolytic fragment, amyloid-beta, associated with the aging cellular muscle fiber environment, appear to be key pathogenic events.

Summary

In conceptualizing a treatment for sporadic inclusion-body myositis, the accumulations of amyloid-beta42 and other unfolded proteins are now phenomena to be reckoned with. One would like to stop intracellular increase of the unfolded/misfolded proteins by reducing their formation and/or increasing their disposal. In addition, the identification of factors that would decrease intra-muscle fiber expressions of beta- and gamma-secretases might lead to decreased production of putatively myotoxic oligomeric amyloid-beta42. Better understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of genes that predispose to sporadic inclusion-body myositis, and of human muscle fiber aging, could also provide new avenues toward the therapy of sporadic inclusion-body myositis. How to therapeutically capitalize on the new findings is now the challenge.

### Treatment of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^116cwXhz]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article reviews the results of recent therapeutic trials in dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and inclusion body myositis and suggests an approach to treating patients with inflammatory myopathy.

Recent Findings

We reviewed 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled therapeutic trials in patients with inflammatory myopathy. Only one, using intravenous immunoglobulin in refractory dermatomyositis, indicated benefit. A brief trial of azathioprine in polymyositis and eight studies using various treatments in inclusion body myositis did not show benefit.

Summary

There have been no adequate double-blind, placebo-controlled therapeutic trials of dermatomyositis and polymyositis. It is generally accepted, however, that these disorders respond to immunosuppressive agents. Prednisone is usually the initial treatment. There is no agreement on how prednisone should be administered and even less agreement about other agents. Inclusion body myositis, which now appears to be the most common (in adults), is unresponsive to immunosuppressive and immunomodulating therapies. There are candidate treatments for inclusion body myositis and a need for additional double-blind, placebo-controlled therapeutic trials in all patients with inflammatory myopathy.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments in inclusion body myositis: a systematic review [^111xXGtA]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

Regarding outcomes, the core concepts were change in muscle strength (eg, Manual Muscle Testing (MMT), Quantitative Muscle Testing (QMT) using Maximal Voluntary Isometric Contraction Testing (MVICT) or hand-held dynamometry) and muscle trophicity (eg, Thigh Muscle Volume (TMV), lean body mass (LBM)). Based on the impact of the condition, we additionally included changes in measures of mobility, endurance or physical function, such as the 6 min Walking Distance (6MWD), Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) or its modified version (mTUG) and Inclusion Body Myositis Functional Rating Scale (IBMFRS), among others. To analyse the safety of interventions, the absolute number of adverse events was considered.

Type of study

Only SRs and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials were eligible because they are considered the most robust study designs and represent the strongest evidence. The studies integrating SRs were extracted for joint analysis with the remaining primary studies. This was done to provide additional reassurance that no relevant articles were overlooked. In this regard, the SRs themselves were not included and evaluated.

Search strategy and study selection

A search strategy was run in Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, from 1 September 2014 (end date of the search strategy of the last SR)to 31 January 2023. Studies published in English, French, Portuguese, Spanish and Turkish language were considered for inclusion. Details on complete search strategies are provided in online supplemental material S1.

All identified citations were uploaded into an EndNote V.X9 (Clarivate Analytics, PA, USA) library and the duplicates were removed. Titles and abstracts were screened by two independent reviewers (EJFS and BF) to assess eligibility criteria. The full articles were retrieved for all studies that met or had insufficient information to assess the inclusion criteria, and two reviewers (EJFS and BF) independently examined them in detail. Any disagreements between the reviewers were resolved through discussion or adjudication by a third reviewer (PMM). The study selection was performed using Rayyan.

### Exploring challenges in the management and treatment of inclusion body myositis [^114iYsav]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND ASSOCIATED CHALLENGES

IBM is clinically characterized by chronic, slowly progressive weakness, often asymmetric, presenting with predominant finger flexor and/or knee extensor involvement. However, less common presentations of this disease can occur in approximately 14% of patients including isolated dysphagia, foot drop, proximal upper limb weakness, axial weakness with head drop, and facial diplegia. Furthermore, IBM may be diagnosed even at a preclinical stage manifesting with elevated creatine kinase levels. The lingering course, the variable presentations, and the distal asymmetric weakness, mimicking a mononeuropathy (e.g. ulnar) or a motor neuron disorder, can be challenging for providers to recognize and result in diagnostic delay with time from symptom onset to diagnosis ranging from 4 to 9 years on average.

### Update in inclusion body myositis [^115UyeeZ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose of review

The purpose of this study is to review recent scientific advances relating to the natural history, cause, treatment and serum and imaging biomarkers of inclusion body myositis (IBM).

Recent findings

Several theories regarding the aetiopathogenesis of IBM are being explored and new therapeutic approaches are being investigated. New diagnostic criteria have been proposed, reflecting the knowledge that the diagnostic pathological findings may be absent in patients with clinically typical IBM. The role of MRI in IBM is expanding and knowledge about pathological biomarkers is increasing. The recent description of autoantibodies to cytosolic 5′ nucleotidase 1A in patients with IBM is a potentially important advance that may aid early diagnosis and provides new evidence regarding the role of autoimmunity in IBM.

Summary

IBM remains an enigmatic and often misdiagnosed disease. The pathogenesis of the disease is still not fully understood. To date, pharmacological treatment trials have failed to show clear efficacy. Future research should continue to focus on improving understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease and on the identification of reliable and sensitive outcome measures for clinical trials. IBM is a rare disease and international multicentre collaboration for trials is important to translate research advances into improved patient outcomes.

TREATMENT LANDSCAPE

Although, there is currently no pharmacologic cure for IBM, current treatment strategies primarily revolve around implementing supportive measures to address symptoms such as dysphagia, respiratory compromise, muscle weakness, and limited mobility.

Dysphagia is a common symptom in IBM patients and can be debilitating. Dysphagia-targeted interventions may provide temporary relief, such as myotomy or dilation of a cricopharyngeal bar when patients have a significant obstructive components. Botox injections remain controversial and may pose some safety concerns. There is anecdotal evidence for IVIG improving dysphagia in IBM. Most importantly, regular evaluation by a speech and swallow therapist would ensure proper dietary modification to avoid aspiration.

Neuromuscular respiratory insufficiency usually occurs at advanced disease stages. Screening for and managing respiratory involvement is crucial. Patients often need referral to pulmonary and/or sleep medicine specialists who can assist with initiation and management of noninvasive ventilation in the appropriate setting.

The biggest challenge facing treatment of IBM to date is the lack of disease-modifying therapy. Over 20 unique drug therapies or combinations have been studied in IBM as summarized in Table 2 and further detailed below.

Table 2
Pharmacologic clinical trials in inclusion body myositis (IBM)

Immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapies included azathioprine, methotrexate, IVIG, IVIG + prednisone, interferon beta 1a, etanercept, infliximab, anakinra, natalizumab, alemtuzumab, and canakimumab. Drugs with pleiomorphic mechanism of action, including an anti-inflammatory effects, such as sirolimus, oxandrolone, simvastatin, and more recently testosterone in tandem with exercise training have also been tried. Sirolimus inhibits mTOR and has pleiotropic effects on cell metabolism, autophagy, and mitochondrial function. Additional investigational treatments included drugs to increase muscle mass such as follistatin gene therapy and bimagrumab, and arimoclomol addressed protein homeostasis by prolonging the activation of Heat Shock Factor-1 augmenting heat shock protein levels. Currently, randomized controlled trials for sirolimus (clinical trial NCT04789070) and ABC008 a monoclonal antibody that selectively depletes cytotoxic T cells (clinical trial NCT05721573) are underway with highly anticipated results.
