## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anesthesia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and taxonomy of anesthesia. Then, I should verify the comparative risks and benefits of general versus regional anesthesia across populations. Next, I will examine special populations and contexts, including pediatrics, older adults, obstetrics, and patients with comorbidities. After that, I need to review emerging controversies and evidence gaps, such as neurotoxicity, EEG guidance, and environmental considerations. Finally, I will synthesize practical, patient-centered recommendations and highlight areas of uncertainty that require shared decision-making and ongoing research.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't build on a shaky premise. General anesthesia is a medically induced, reversible state of unconsciousness with complete loss of awareness, distinct from natural sleep, and typically produced by intravenous agents like propofol, benzodiazepines, opioids, and volatile inhalational agents, with the goals of analgesia, amnesia, and immobility to facilitate surgery and procedures [^6af1241e] [^bdd65b04]. Regional anesthesia encompasses neuraxial techniques (spinal, epidural) and peripheral nerve blocks that achieve targeted loss of sensation and motor function while preserving consciousness, often combined with sedation when needed [^12821e24]. I should double-check that these definitions align with authoritative sources, and yes, they do, including FDA labeling and peer-reviewed summaries [^6af1241e] [^2609e24b].

> Next, I should review the comparative safety and outcomes of general versus regional anesthesia, but I need to be careful not to overgeneralize. Historically, regional anesthesia has been associated with superior postoperative analgesia and potential reductions in some complications, yet high-quality evidence for broad, durable outcome benefits is mixed and often limited by confounding and heterogeneity [^5559308d] [^adc2e827]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of any differences; pooled randomized data in older adults show no consistent advantage of neuraxial over general anesthesia for major cardiovascular events, stroke, or renal outcomes, though pneumonia risk may be lower in some analyses, and the strength of evidence is generally low to moderate [^98d180e2]. I should also confirm that contemporary guidelines for noncardiac surgery conclude either neuraxial or general anesthesia is acceptable when neuraxial is feasible, with no clear difference in perioperative cardiovascular events, which supports individualized selection rather than a one-size-fits-all rule [^d30a337c].

> I will now examine pediatric anesthesia, where neurodevelopmental concerns dominate the risk discourse. The FDA warns that repeated or prolonged exposure to general anesthetics in children under 3 years may affect brain development, based largely on animal data and observational human studies with substantial limitations; no specific agent has been proven safer than others in this context [^f92ff989] [^2751a7d6]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; human data are heterogeneous, with some studies showing no measurable deficit after single, brief exposures, whereas others suggest modest neurodevelopmental risks with multiple or prolonged exposures, so counseling should balance necessity of surgery against uncertain long-term risks and consider deferring elective procedures when reasonable [^63cf9008]. I should confirm that ongoing randomized work, such as the GAS trial, has shown no difference in cognitive outcomes at 2 years between awake-spinal and sevoflurane anesthesia, though longer-term follow-up remains important [^63cf9008].

> For older adults, I need to check the strength of evidence for delirium and cognitive outcomes by anesthetic technique. Expanded preoperative cognitive and frailty screening is recommended to mitigate postoperative delirium, but evidence that neuraxial anesthesia consistently reduces delirium or postoperative cognitive dysfunction is limited and inconsistent across studies [^d9e4982f]. Let me reconsider whether any technique is clearly superior; current practice advisories indicate either neuraxial or general anesthesia is acceptable, with attention to minimizing CNS-depressant polypharmacy and considering dexmedetomidine in selected patients to reduce delirium risk, albeit with hemodynamic trade-offs [^d9e4982f]. I should confirm that meta-analytic comparisons of general versus non-general anesthesia have not shown a significant difference in POCD, reinforcing individualized decision-making rather than defaulting to regional anesthesia solely for cognitive protection [^56a112e2].

> In obstetrics, I should confirm that neuraxial anesthesia is preferred for most cesarean deliveries and labor analgesia when feasible, given better maternal and neonatal safety profiles compared with general anesthesia. Avoidable general anesthesia is associated with higher odds of anesthesia complications, severe complications, surgical site infection, and venous thromboembolism, and neuraxial techniques also facilitate early bonding and breastfeeding [^ad566413] [^013ff770]. But wait, what if neuraxial is contraindicated or fails? In such cases, general anesthesia remains necessary, and patients should be counseled about the increased risks and the plan for rapid sequence induction and airway management, especially in obstetric patients with higher aspiration risk [^013ff770].

> For patients with obstructive sleep apnea, I should verify whether regional anesthesia meaningfully improves outcomes. Observational data suggest neuraxial anesthesia is associated with fewer postoperative complications, less mechanical ventilation, and shorter length of stay compared with general anesthesia, likely related to reduced airway manipulation and opioid requirements; guidelines favor regional techniques when applicable, though evidence quality is moderate and largely observational [^3eb93e70]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with broader perioperative guidance; yes, contemporary anesthesia advisories endorse considering regional anesthesia in OSA when feasible, integrated with multimodal analgesia to minimize opioid-related respiratory depression [^3eb93e70].

> I need to ensure I address medication-specific risks that can sway the choice of agents. Etomidate suppresses adrenal function and is not intended for prolonged infusion; it may still be appropriate for rapid sequence intubation in unstable patients when used as a single bolus, with post-induction steroid coverage as indicated [^2751a7d6]. Propofol is widely used for induction and maintenance, but I should remember its hemodynamic liabilities, especially in older or frail adults, and counsel patients about transient cognitive effects after exposure [^8ac9f813] [^8cc4ca10]. Midazolam requires dose reduction in the elderly and can precipitate delirium; benzodiazepines should generally be avoided in older adults unless there is a compelling indication, reinforcing the need to tailor sedative choices to patient risk and procedure context [^8b00d709] [^d9e4982f].

> Next, I should review emerging controversies and evidence gaps so I don't overstate certainty. EEG-guided anesthesia has been proposed to reduce postoperative delirium, but results are mixed, with some studies and meta-analyses suggesting benefit while large trials like ENGAGES did not show a reduction; thus, routine EEG guidance is not yet standard, though it may be reasonable in high-risk patients after shared decision-making and with attention to avoiding excessively light anesthesia that risks awareness [^1b53866e]. I should double-check the balance of evidence; yes, the signal remains uncertain and technique-dependent, so institutional protocols and patient-specific risk should guide use [^1b53866e].

> Environmental considerations are increasingly relevant, so I need to check the comparative impact of volatile agents versus TIVA. Volatile anesthetics contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and occupational exposure, whereas TIVA with propofol reduces these concerns but introduces pharmaceutical waste and disposal challenges; lifecycle assessments suggest propofol has a lower environmental hazard score, though real-world disposal practices vary and can offset benefits if unused drug is not incinerated [^b98803ca]. Hold on, I should verify that this does not imply abandoning volatiles; rather, it supports judicious use, leak-minimizing practices, and consideration of regional or multimodal strategies when appropriate [^b98803ca].

> I should confirm aspiration risk and fasting guidance, especially with evolving sedation practices. Traditional NPO rules from general anesthesia have been extrapolated to procedural sedation, but emerging consensus supports graded fasting for sedation based on aspiration risk, noting that sedation generally preserves protective airway reflexes and involves fewer high-risk airway maneuvers than general anesthesia; nonetheless, shared decision-making and local policy alignment remain essential [^ff7cdfe2] [^1621f71b]. But wait, what if the patient is on agents that delay gastric emptying, like GLP-1 agonists? Recent FDA labeling highlights aspiration risk despite fasting, so I need to ensure proactive planning, including considering delayed emptying and coordinating with prescribers when feasible [^03f7354d].

> Let me synthesize practical, patient-centered recommendations while acknowledging uncertainty. For most adults undergoing noncardiac surgery, either neuraxial or general anesthesia is acceptable; the choice should be individualized to patient comorbidities, procedural factors, and patient preferences, with attention to opioid-sparing strategies and delirium mitigation in older adults [^d30a337c] [^d9e4982f]. In pediatrics, avoid elective general anesthesia under age 3 when possible, but do not delay necessary surgery; use the lowest effective dose and shortest duration, and discuss uncertainties with caregivers [^f92ff989] [^63cf9008]. In obstetrics, prioritize neuraxial techniques for labor and cesarean delivery when feasible, and minimize avoidable general anesthesia to reduce maternal complications [^ad566413] [^013ff770]. In OSA, favor regional anesthesia and multimodal analgesia to reduce respiratory complications, and plan for enhanced postoperative monitoring [^3eb93e70]. Across settings, implement medication safety practices, minimize high-risk polypharmacy in older adults, and engage in shared decision-making that incorporates patient values and evolving evidence [^434811c7] [^d9e4982f].

> Finally, I should double-check key uncertainties and future directions so counseling is honest. We still need higher-quality randomized trials to clarify whether neuraxial anesthesia improves hard outcomes beyond analgesia, to define the optimal EEG targets that reduce delirium without increasing awareness, and to quantify the long-term neurodevelopmental impact of single versus repeated anesthetic exposures in children, including the role of agent selection and duration thresholds [^98d180e2] [^1b53866e] [^63cf9008]. Until such data emerge, best practice remains dynamic, evidence-informed, and individualized, with continuous re-evaluation as new guidance and technologies become available [^d9e4982f].

Anesthesia is a **medically induced, reversible state** of unconsciousness, analgesia, and muscle relaxation that enables painless surgery and procedures [^6af1241e]. It is delivered by trained professionals using intravenous and inhaled agents, with risks including nausea, respiratory depression, allergic reactions, and rare awareness; modern monitoring and protocols have made anesthesia very safe, with mortality around 1 per 100,000 in healthy patients [^8735639b]. Regional anesthesia offers **targeted pain control** and may reduce some complications, but the choice depends on patient factors, procedure, and preferences [^d30a337c] [^a22880e4]. Special caution applies in children under 3 years due to potential neurotoxicity with prolonged or repeated exposures, so elective procedures should be timed and minimized when possible [^f92ff989] [^63cf9008].

## Types of anesthesia

Anesthesia is broadly categorized into **three main types**:

| **Type** | **Description** | **Common applications** |
|-|-|-|
| General anesthesia | Induces complete unconsciousness, analgesia, and muscle relaxation | Major surgeries, complex procedures |
| Regional anesthesia | Numbs a specific region of the body; patient may remain conscious | - Childbirth (epidural/spinal) <br/> - Limb surgeries <br/> - Hernia repairs |
| Local anesthesia | Numbs a small, localized area | - Minor procedures <br/> - Dental work <br/> - Skin biopsies |

---

## Mechanisms of action

Anesthetic agents work by **altering neural activity** in the central nervous system:

- **General anesthetics**: Enhance inhibitory neurotransmission (GABA) and inhibit excitatory transmission (NMDA), producing unconsciousness and immobility [^fa934340].
- **Regional/local anesthetics**: Block sodium channels, preventing action potential propagation and producing localized numbness [^notfound].

---

## Common anesthetic agents

| **Category** | **Examples** | **Route of administration** |
|-|-|-|
| General anesthetics | - Propofol <br/> - Sevoflurane <br/> - Isoflurane <br/> - Midazolam <br/> - Fentanyl | - Intravenous <br/> - Inhalational |
| Regional/local anesthetics | - Lidocaine <br/> - Bupivacaine <br/> - Ropivacaine | - Injection <br/> - Topical |

---

## Risks and complications

While anesthesia is generally safe, **potential risks and complications** include:

- **Common side effects**: Nausea, vomiting, sore throat, drowsiness, shivering [^6af1241e].
- **Serious complications**: Allergic reactions, respiratory depression, cardiovascular instability, awareness under anesthesia, postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) [^6af1241e] [^56a112e2].
- **Rare complications**: Malignant hyperthermia, nerve damage, aspiration pneumonia [^6af1241e] [^720ec63d].

---

## Safety measures and monitoring

Modern anesthesia practice employs **rigorous safety measures**, including:

- **Preoperative assessment**: Medical history, physical examination, and risk stratification [^52aa15c8].
- **Intraoperative monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, end-tidal CO2, and depth of anesthesia [^notfound].
- **Postoperative care**: Recovery monitoring, pain management, and observation for complications [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

### Pediatric anesthesia

Children have unique physiological considerations, and there is ongoing research regarding the **potential neurotoxic effects** of repeated or prolonged exposure to general anesthesia in early childhood [^63cf9008]. The FDA has issued warnings about possible neurodevelopmental risks, particularly with repeated or prolonged exposures in children under 3 years [^f92ff989].

---

### Obstetric anesthesia

Regional anesthesia (epidural or spinal) is commonly used during childbirth, providing effective pain relief with minimal fetal exposure. General anesthesia is reserved for emergencies or when regional anesthesia is contraindicated [^d42386bb].

---

### Geriatric anesthesia

Older adults are at **increased risk** of postoperative delirium, cognitive decline, and cardiovascular complications. Anesthetic plans are tailored to minimize these risks, often favoring regional techniques and minimizing opioid use [^d9e4982f].

---

## Recent advancements

Recent advancements in anesthesia include:

- **Targeted drug delivery**: Improved precision and reduced side effects.
- **Enhanced monitoring**: Advanced brain function monitoring to reduce awareness and optimize depth of anesthesia [^9f1d8fd8].
- **Pharmacological innovations**: Development of new agents with faster onset, shorter duration, and fewer side effects [^976d5b80].

---

## Conclusion

Anesthesia is a **cornerstone of modern medicine**, enabling painless surgery and procedures. It is highly safe when administered by trained professionals, with risks minimized through careful patient assessment, monitoring, and individualized care plans. Ongoing research and technological advancements continue to improve safety and efficacy, ensuring optimal patient outcomes.

### Benefits, risks, and best practice in regional anesthesia: do we have the evidence we need? [^5559308d]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

For more than 25 years, regional anesthesia has challenged anesthesiologists to determine whether it offers real benefits in terms of patient outcome from major surgery, compared with general anesthesia. Although there is good evidence that regional analgesia offers superior pain relief to systemic opioid analgesia, evidence to support improved outcome from surgery remains elusive. Although many publications appear to support the hypothesis, others show no benefit, and the lack of properly conducted, large studies makes it difficult to draw any evidence-based conclusions in favor of regional anesthesia. Given that all major regional techniques have the potential to cause significant risks to patient outcome, it is incumbent on all anesthesiologists to balance the intended benefits against the significant adverse events associated with regional techniques. We are beginning to develop an evidence base for both the benefits and risks of regional anesthesia, when used for specific patient groups and for specific surgical procedures. This presentation looks at some of the evidence and examines how it can be used to develop guidelines for best practice.

### Behind the black box: the evidence for the U.S. food and drug administration warning about the risk of general anesthesia in children younger than 3 years [^f92ff989]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

On December 14, 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a Drug Safety Communication warning "that repeated or lengthy use of general anesthetic and sedation drugs during surgeries or procedures in children younger than 3 years or in pregnant women during their third trimester may affect the development of children's brains". Health care professionals were urged to "balance the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in young children and pregnant women against the potential risks, especially for procedures that may last more than 3 hours or if multiple procedures are required in children under 3 years". Surgeons must have an understanding of the evidence that led to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warning and recommendations to appropriately weigh these risks and counsel their patients. In this article, the authors summarize the preclinical and clinical data that led to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warning, discuss ongoing clinical studies, and provide strategies to reduce the risk of general anesthesia in patients younger than 3 years.

### Risk of dementia in older patients with different anesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^da87482a]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Several attempts have been made to integrate the evidence from a wide range of epidemiological studies, however, the meta-analyses present inconsistencies and warrant further investigation. One suggesting a notable link between exposure to general anesthetic (GA) and the development of AD, while others have reported minimal or no association. These two meta-analyses encompassed both case–control studies and cohort studies, whereas another meta-analysis solely included case–control studies, which are more susceptible to bias. Moreover, casec–ontrol studies alone cannot fully establish causality. Additionally, these previous studies focused exclusively on the association between general anesthesia and dementia risk, without considering regional anesthesia. Therefore, it is necessary not only to update the prior meta-analyses but also to explore whether general or regional anesthesia administration serves as a potential risk factors for dementia in older patients. To this end, this study aimed to assess the risk of dementia, AD and ADRD in older patients who underwent general or regional anesthesia.

### The economic burden of anesthetic-related adverse events: a systematic review and empirical analysis [^f0ce7a9f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In modern medical practice, anesthetic agents for procedural sedation and general anesthesia are extensively used across a spectrum of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, ensuring patient comfort and procedural efficacy. However, they do not come without risk, and, during a procedure, an anesthesiologist might encounter several complications, including apnea and hypoxemia, airway obstruction, arterial hypotension, bradycardia, and aspiration. The frequency and severity of these adverse events (AEs) not only affect patient outcomes but also lead to increased healthcare services utilization and costs. They can result in extended hospital stays, additional medical interventions, and, in severe cases, legal implications due to patient harm. Much is known about anesthetic-related AEs from the clinical standpoint. However, a critical gap in the literature remains on the economic impacts of anesthetic-related complications.

This study aims to fill this gap by reviewing the existing literature to outline the current understanding on the clinical and economic burden associated with AEs of the anesthetic agents used in procedural sedation and general anesthesia. By identifying under-researched issues and synthesizing available data, this study seeks to enhance the knowledge base, guiding future research and policy decisions to optimize patient care and resource allocation through selection of the most appropriate anesthetic agents, also considering AEs and their costs.

### Assessing long-term neurodevelopmental outcome following general anesthesia in early childhood: challenges and opportunities [^63cf9008]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

General anesthesia has long been considered a safe means of enabling pediatric surgery, unpleasant procedures, or medical imaging. However, concerns have accumulated that fetuses, babies, and young children exposed to general anesthesia may experience long-lasting neurotoxic effects. Approximately 200,000of the 4 millionchildren below 6 years of age in the United Kingdom undergo general anesthesia annually (5%), making the risk of anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity a critical public health issue.

Preclinical studies demonstrate that exposure to all commonly used IV and inhalational anesthetic agents is associated with altered brain development in immature animals including nonhuman primates. Single long exposuresand multiple exposuresadversely affect neurodevelopment. The duration and timing of exposure influence the neurotoxic potential of general anesthetic agents. The brain is thought to be particularly vulnerable during the period of synaptogenesis. In humans, this "vulnerable time window" is reportedly between the third trimester and 2–3 years of age.–

Human observational studies of anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity are heterogeneous in their methodologies and offer contrary conclusions. Studies of single brief general anesthesia for minor procedures are generally reassuring, but worse long-term neurodevelopmental outcome has been reported following prolonged/repeated exposure. Pooled effect estimates from observational studies indicate at least a modest risk of impaired neurodevelopment following general anesthesia for surgery in childhood. To date, only 1 ongoing randomized controlled trial of awake-spinal versus sevoflurane general anesthesia for herniorrhaphy before 60 weeks postmenstrual age has reported secondary outcomes. The General Anesthesia compared to Spinal trial reassuringly finds equivalent cognitive scores between groups at 2 years of age. However, more comprehensive cognitive assessment in later childhood could still detect anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity.

Increasing numbers of original studies and an exponential increase in review articles on pediatric anesthetic neurotoxicity over the past 10 years (Figure 1) have prompted regulatory and professional bodies to release precautionary statements concerning pediatric general anesthesia. The US Food and Drug Administration cautions against lengthy/repeated general anesthesia or sedation in the third trimester and in children younger than 3 years old. Guidance from the United Kingdom and Irelandand a statement from European bodiesadvocate avoiding unnecessary general anesthesia but recommend no changes to clinical practice.

### The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology consensus statement on the anesthetic management of pregnant and postpartum women receiving thromboprophylaxis or higher dose anticoagulants [^013ff770]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Medium credibility.

Maternal and fetal/neonatal risks related to general anesthesia in obstetrics — General anesthesia continues to be associated with more maternal anesthesia–related adverse events than neuraxial anesthesia, including intraoperative bronchospasm and postoperative hypoventilation, and fetal risks can include respiratory depression at delivery. Maternal risks listed include serious adverse events related to induction of general anesthesia; failed intubation; cerebrovascular injury from a severe hypertensive response to intubation in women with comorbidities; awareness under general anesthesia; intraoperative uterine atony and/or increased obstetric hemorrhage; respiratory depression after emergence from general anesthesia; surgical site infection; inability to provide neuraxial opioids limiting opioid-sparing postcesarean analgesia; persistent pain after delivery; reduced immediate postdelivery skin-to-skin bonding and breastfeeding; and decreased maternal and paternal participation, and satisfaction with birth experience. Fetal/neonatal risks listed include respiratory depression at delivery, Apgar < 7 at 5 minutes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit in urgent cases, in utero exposure to induction/inhalational agents with potential neurobehavioral impact, and reduced benefits of immediate breastfeeding with decreased likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding.

### Safety challenges related to the use of sedation and general anesthesia in pediatric patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging examinations [^ddb0e345]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The use of sedation and general anesthesia has facilitated the significant growth of MRI use among children over the last years. While sedation and general anesthesia are considered to be relatively safe, their use poses potential risks in the short term and in the long term. This manuscript reviews the reasons why MRI examinations require sedation and general anesthesia more commonly in the pediatric population, summarizes the safety profile of sedation and general anesthesia, and discusses an amalgam of strategies that can be implemented and can ultimately lead to the optimization of sedation and general anesthesia care within pediatric radiology departments.

### Exposure to general anesthesia and the risk of dementia [^72f0d538]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dementia is becoming increasingly prevalent among the elderly population. In 2001, ~24 million people worldwide were afflicted with dementia, and that number is estimated to double to an estimated prevalence of 42 million by 2020 and 81 million by 2040. Dementia is challenging from a medical care perspective since it is both progressive and irreversible. Additionally, dementia is a leading cause of admission to long-term care facilities and a major risk factor for hospitalization. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, and it constitutes approximately two-thirds of all cases. It is currently hypothesized that the pathophysiology of AD involves the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) proteins and the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, which leads to neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss in the brain. However, AD pathogenesis is multifactorial, whereby both genetic susceptibility and environmental factors contribute to neurodegeneration.

Generally considered safe and effective, anesthetic drugs have bestowed enormous clinical benefits. Besides, with the global acceleration of population aging, surgery is being performed more frequently. Correspondingly, there is growing concern that anesthesia and/or surgery may have neurodegenerative complications. In vitro studies have shown that inhaled anesthetic agents can promote Aβ oligomerization and enhance Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. Animal studies have also provided evidence that exposure to anesthetic drugs can impair memory, can induce caspase-3 activation, and can increase levels of Aβ. Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) in humans is generally considered to be a short-lived condition where normal function returns within days, while cognitive changes may persist for weeks or longer. It remains unclear whether this decline simply unmasks the early stages of dementia or if it is a predictor of later dementia. Regardless, with clinical features similar to those observed in patients with dementia, the incidence of long-term postoperative cognitive impairment raises concerns that anesthesia and surgery may accelerate the onset and progression of dementia. Currently, it remains controversial as to whether anesthesia is associated with an elevated risk of developing AD in human populations. Observational studies have reported inconsistent results to support the causal relationship between anesthesia, surgery, and dementia.–Accordingly, the consensus statement from the First International Workshop on Anesthetics and Alzheimer's Disease in 2009 suggested that statistically sound prospective and retrospective human studies of the risk of AD after anesthesia are needed. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize the preclinical and clinical evidence regarding the capacity for anesthesia and surgery to induce or accelerate neurodegeneration in AD in order to provide perspective regarding additional studies that are needed.

### Antiplatelet drugs: a review of their pharmacology and management in the perioperative period [^5513763a]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

In the normal course of the delivery of care, anesthesiologists encounter many patients who are receiving drugs that affect platelet function as a fundamental part of primary and secondary management of atherosclerotic thrombotic disease. There are several antiplatelet drugs available for use in clinical practice and several under investigation. Aspirin and clopidogrel (alone and in combination) have been the most studied and have the most favorable risk-benefit profiles of drugs currently available. Prasugrel was recently approved for patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous interventions. Other drugs such as dipyridamole and cilostazol have not been as extensively investigated. There are several newer investigational drugs such as cangrelor and ticagrelor, but whether they confer significant additional benefits remains to be established. Management of patients who are receiving antiplatelet drugs during the perioperative period requires an understanding of the underlying pathology and rationale for their administration, pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, and drug interactions. Furthermore, the risk and benefit assessment of discontinuing or continuing these drugs should be made bearing in mind the proposed surgery and its inherent risk for bleeding complications as well as decisions relating to appropriate use of general or some form of regional anesthesia. In general, the safest approach to prevent thrombosis seems to be continuation of these drugs throughout the perioperative period except where concerns about perioperative bleeding outweigh those associated with the development of thrombotic occlusion. Knowledge of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of antiplatelet drugs may allow practitioners to anticipate difficulties associated with drug withdrawal and administration in the perioperative period including the potential for drug interactions.

Pediatric Neurotoxicity

Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear. However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans (see PRECAUTIONS/Pregnancy, Pediatric Use, ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND/OR TOXICOLOGY).

Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects. These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness.

Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.

### Lasting impact of general anaesthesia on the brain: mechanisms and relevance [^fa934340]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2016). Medium credibility.

General anaesthesia is usually considered to safely induce a reversible brain state allowing the performance of surgery under optimal conditions. An increasing number of clinical and experimental observations, however, suggest that anaesthetic drugs, especially when they are administered at the extremes of age, can trigger long-term morphological and functional alterations in the brain. Here, we review available mechanistic data linking general-anaesthesia exposure to impaired cognitive performance in both young and mature nervous systems. We also provide a critical appraisal of the translational value of animal models and highlight the important challenges that need to be addressed to strengthen the link between laboratory work and clinical investigations in the field of anaesthesia-neurotoxicity research.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary management of osteoarthritis of the hip [^38c7aded]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). High credibility.

Neuraxial vs general anesthesia — Limited evidence suggests that neuraxial anesthesia may be used to reduce adverse events in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip undergoing total hip arthroplasty, with Quality of Evidence: Low and Strength of Option: Limited. Both general and neuraxial anesthesia in total hip arthroplasty is associated with specific risks and benefits, and while neuraxial anesthesia is associated with lower rates of adverse events in most patients, the choice of anesthesia should be individualized to each patient based on their medical comorbidities; the decision to proceed with a particular type of anesthesia should be made by each individual patient and anesthesiologist after an informed decision-making process where the risks and benefits of each anesthetic for that individual patient are discussed.

### Anesthesia-related carbon monoxide exposure: toxicity and potential therapy [^7061a077]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) during general anesthesia can result from volatile anesthetic degradation by carbon dioxide absorbents and rebreathing of endogenously produced CO. Although adherence to the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation guidelines reduces the risk of CO poisoning, patients may still experience subtoxic CO exposure during low-flow anesthesia. The consequences of such exposures are relatively unknown. In contrast to the widely recognized toxicity of high CO concentrations, the biologic activity of low concentration CO has recently been shown to be cytoprotective. As such, low-dose CO is being explored as a novel treatment for a variety of different diseases. Here, we review the concept of anesthesia-related CO exposure, identify the sources of production, detail the mechanisms of overt CO toxicity, highlight the cellular effects of low-dose CO, and discuss the potential therapeutic role for CO as part of routine anesthetic management.

WARNINGS

INTRAVENOUS AMIDATE SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED ONLY BY PERSONS TRAINED IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF GENERAL ANESTHETICS AND IN THE MANAGEMENT OF COMPLICATIONS ENCOUNTERED DURING THE CONDUCT OF GENERAL ANESTHESIA.

BECAUSE OF THE HAZARDS OF PROLONGED SUPPRESSION OF ENDOGENOUS CORTISOL AND ALDOSTERONE PRODUCTION, THIS FORMULATION IS NOT INTENDED FOR ADMINISTRATION BY PROLONGED INFUSION.

Pediatric Neurotoxicity

Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear. However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans (see PRECAUTIONS /Pregnancy, Pediatric Use, ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND/OR TOXICOLOGY).

Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects. These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness.

Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.

### Acid suppression in the perioperative period [^720ec63d]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Aspiration of oropharyngeal and gastric contents during surgery, although infrequent, is a recognized complication of general anesthesia that carries significant risk for serious complications. Complications of aspiration have been reported to cause 10% to 30% of anesthesia-related deaths. Unconsciousness interferes with multiple biologic mechanisms that guard the airway against aspiration, and this is compounded in surgery by anesthesia-induced neurologic impairment and the risks related to placement of nasogastric and endotracheal tubes. Consequences of anesthesia-related aspiration include aspiration pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, and long-term complications such as laryngotracheal damage and decreased lung compliance. Therefore, averting aspiration, particularly in the elderly and other high-risk patients, should be part of the perioperative plan. Although antacids and histamine 2-receptor antagonists have been used perioperatively with some success, they are limited by short duration of action and systemic side effects, among other factors. Proton pump inhibitors are currently being investigated in surgical patients at risk for aspiration or stress ulcers and seem to be potent, extremely effective, and well tolerated. This article reviews the risks for, and potential outcomes of, anesthesia-related aspiration, identifies high-risk populations, and outlines the experience to date with available preventive treatments.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^d2e5d222]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — clinical role and risk considerations — state that when children receive surgery for otitis media with effusion (OME), insertion of tympanostomy tubes is the preferred initial procedure, with candidacy dependent primarily on hearing status, associated symptoms, and the child's developmental risk. Placement of tympanostomy tubes significantly reduces middle ear effusion (MEE) prevalence, resolves hearing loss caused by MEE, reduces the incidence of recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), and provides a mechanism for drainage and administration of topical antibiotic therapy should acute tube otorrhea occur. Tympanostomy tubes also can improve disease-specific quality of life (QOL) for children with chronic OME, recurrent AOM, or both. Risks and potential adverse events are related to general anesthesia, usually required for the procedure, and the effects of the tympanostomy tube on the tympanic membrane and middle ear, but risks associated with general anesthesia can be eliminated by inserting tubes in the office setting without general anesthesia, when appropriate, based on shared decision making between the clinician and family.

### 2025 American society of anesthesiologists practice advisory for perioperative care of older adults scheduled for inpatient surgery [^d9e4982f]. Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative care of older adults — conclusions and recommendations — states that for older adults scheduled for inpatient procedures, expanded preoperative evaluation that includes cognitive and frailty screening should be considered to reduce the risk of postoperative delirium. Care for patients found with cognitive or frailty impairments should include multidisciplinary teams and geriatric specialists when possible, and this recommendation is conditional because the strength of the evidence for delirium prevention was rated low. Either neuraxial or general anesthesia, and total intravenous or inhalation agents, are acceptable for older patients; consideration of the risks and benefits of drugs with potential central nervous system effects in older adults is suggested. Dexmedetomidine may be helpful to reduce the risk of delirium in older surgical patients, but it can be associated with bradycardia and hypotension, and there is uncertainty around effects across baseline risk for delirium, different surgeries, timing of administration and dosage, and use with other medications.

### General anesthesia… [^6af1241e]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. General anesthesia is unconsciousness produced by medications. This allows for surgery and other treatments that would otherwise be too painful or difficult to tolerate. During general anesthesia, a person is unconscious but is not in a natural state of sleep. In the United States, anesthesia is provided by anesthesiologists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and anesthesiologist assistants. Medications and general anesthesia Some of the most common medications used to provide general anesthesia are Propofol, which produces unconsciousness.

In smaller doses, it can be used to provide sedation. Benzodiazepines, which decrease anxiety right before surgery. Some medications that reduce anxiety may also help block memory of events. Narcotics, which prevent or treat pain. Volatile anesthetic agents are inhaled in a gas mixture containing oxygen. Sometimes, to avoid starting an intravenous line in infants and children, a volatile agent is given through a mask for induction of general anesthesia. Other medications include antiemetic agents, muscle relaxants, medications to manage blood pressure or heart rate, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Complications of general anesthesia A common side effect of general anesthesia is nausea and vomiting after surgery. Some people may also have a sore throat and very occasionally damage to teeth, lips, gums, or vocal cords from insertion of breathing tubes and airway devices.

Less common and more serious complications include malignant hyperthermia, heart attack, stroke, or death; these are more likely in patients who have heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney disease, or lung diseases. Very rarely, persons may become aware of events when they are thought to be unconscious from general anesthesia; this is more likely during emergency surgery if the patient is in shock, during open heart surgery with the heart bypass machine, or because of medication error or malfunction of the anesthesia equipment. Preparing for anesthesia Follow the instructions given to you about what and when you may eat or drink before surgery.

### Current and developing approaches for facilitating emergence from general anesthesia [^976d5b80]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the widespread use of clinical anesthesia, the process of emergence from general anesthesia remains primarily driven by anesthetic elimination. Although emergence from general anesthesia is typically safe, prolonged delays strain resource-intensive settings and contribute to increased healthcare costs. In addition to improving access to care, providing clinicians with more precise control over emergence could offer diagnostic potential and improve patient outcomes. For decades, this unmet need has motivated research into the mechanisms underlying anesthetic emergence. Now, the first agents for facilitating emergence are entering the market, with more in development. This narrative review critically evaluates advancements in the development of emergence-promoting therapies, examining insights from preclinical research to clinical trials. This study categorizes prospective emergence agents/strategies into one of three primary approaches: (1) strategies that primarily manipulate anesthetic pharmacokinetics, (2) agents designed to directly target anesthetic receptor-binding sites, and (3) strategies that leverage arousal-promoting neural pathways. The parallel development of these approaches, each with their distinct strengths and limitations, holds promise for paving the way for a tailored approach to facilitate emergence.

### The third American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine practice advisory on local anesthetic systemic toxicity: executive summary 2017 [^b03a326d]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine's Third Practice Advisory on local anesthetic systemic toxicity is an interim update from its 2010 advisory. The advisory focuses on new information regarding the mechanisms of lipid resuscitation, updated frequency estimates, the preventative role of ultrasound guidance, changes to case presentation patterns, and limited information related to local infiltration anesthesia and liposomal bupivacaine. In addition to emerging information, the advisory updates recommendations pertaining to prevention, recognition, and treatment of local anesthetic systemic toxicity. WHAT'S NEW IN THIS UPDATE? This interim update summarizes recent scientific findings that have enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to lipid emulsion reversal of LAST, including rapid partitioning, direct inotropy, and post-conditioning. Since the previous practice advisory, epidemiological data have emerged that suggest a lower frequency of LAST as reported by single institutions and some registries, nevertheless a considerable number of events still occur within the general community. Contemporary case reports suggest a trend toward delayed presentation, which may mirror the increased use of ultrasound guidance (fewer intravascular injections), local infiltration techniques (slower systemic uptake), and continuous local anesthetic infusions. Small patient size and sarcopenia are additional factors that increase potential risk for LAST. An increasing number of reported events occur outside of the traditional hospital setting and involve non-anesthesiologists.

Improvements in anesthetic drugs and monitoring techniques over the past several decades have significantly reduced the anesthetic risks for pediatric patients. Neonates and infants are at increased risk for cardiovascular and pulmonary complications, and recent reports have led to concern that these young patients may be at risk for long-term detrimental neurodevelopmental effects as well. Although studies are currently under way to answer the question of anesthetic neurotoxicity in children, surgeons and anesthesiologists must work with parents to determine the best course of action for these vulnerable patients.

### ASIPP guidelines for sedation and fasting status of patients undergoing interventional pain management procedures [^e8d224bc]. Pain Physician (2019). High credibility.

Interventional pain procedures — sedation and anesthesia risks should be appreciated by every interventional pain practitioner, with three major potential complications described. First, if a needle is inserted incorrectly in a location such as the spinal cord, the patient will not be able to communicate sudden paresthesias or other aberrant sensations while under deep sedation or general anesthesia. The second potential complication is related to the requirement of prone positioning for most interventional pain procedures, which may add risk and complicate responses to adverse events. Thirdly, the inherent risk of deep sedation and/or general anesthesia per se should be considered, which can result in hypoventilation, pulmonary compromise, anoxic brain states, and/or death. In addition, physicians should be concerned about aspiration risk and complications related to keeping patients NPO for the required period of time prior to the procedure. While properly managed sedation can improve patient comfort and facilitate procedure performance, the risk versus benefit ratio for specific patients should be assessed, and it would not seem prudent to use sedation for every patient without appropriate evaluation based solely on revenue considerations for the practice.

3. ANESTHESIA TECHNIQUE

3.1 Question: Should regional anesthesia be preferred over general anesthesia in patients with OSA?
3.1 Recommendation: When applicable, regional anesthesia is preferable over general anesthesia in patients with OSA.

Level of evidence: Moderate; Grade of recommendation: Strong

Rationale

A wide range of literature and earlier guidelines have favored the use of regional anesthesia techniques and multimodal analgesic approaches among patients with OSA despite little scientific evidence to support this practice. To address this matter, a systematic literature search was performed to summarize evidence on preferable anesthesia techniques in patients with OSA.

Anesthesia Technique as a Modifier of Postoperative Outcome.

With regard to comparative effectiveness between general and regional anesthesia specifically in patients with OSA, 6 observational studies were identified.– A summary of evidence is provided in Supplemental Digital Content, Table A12. Overall, studies indicated that the utilization of regional as opposed to general anesthesia would improve postoperative outcome.– The largest population-based analysis included > 30,000 patients with OSA from > 400 US hospitals undergoing joint arthroplasty procedures. Adjusted risk of numerous major complications was significantly lower in patients with OSA who received neuraxial anesthesia versus general anesthesia. Furthermore, the addition of neuraxial to general anesthesia versus the use of general anesthesia alone was associated with improved outcome profiles. Additionally, the utilization of peripheral nerve blocks was associated with decreased odds for mechanical ventilation, critical care admissions, and prolonged hospital length of stay.

Subsequent studies, confirmed the previous findings, while 1 suggested benefits with regard to mortality. Notably, in a prospective analysis investigating drivers of postoperative worsening of sleep-disordered breathing, Chung et aldemonstrated that the utilization of general anesthesia was associated with an increased central apnea index postoperatively, while 72-hour total opioid dose was a driver of increased AHI. This finding suggests that the residual effects of general anesthesia may affect postoperative sleep architecture and sleep-disordered breathing in OSA.

Given the necessity of airway manipulation under general anesthesia, other challenges inherent to OSA should be considered as well. The higher risk for a difficult airway in OSA has been discussed in Section 1. However, challenges with regard to airway complications in patients with OSA appear to also extend to the time for emergence from anesthesia and the immediate postoperative period, potentially leading to the requirement of emergent airway interventions. Thus, consistent with the underlying pathogenesis of OSA, perioperative complications in these patients may be driven by upper airway obstruction. Recently, Ramachandran et alshowed that OSA was an independent predictor of respiratory complications and unplanned intubation after general anesthesia.

### Midazolam [^8b00d709]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Intravenous doses of midazolam should be decreased for elderly and for debilitated patients (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). These patients will also probably take longer to recover completely after midazolam administration for the induction of anesthesia.

Midazolam does not protect against the increase in intracranial pressure or against the heart rate rise and/or blood pressure rise associated with endotracheal intubation under light general anesthesia.

The efficacy and safety of midazolam in clinical use are functions of the dose administered, the clinical status of the individual patient and the use of concomitant medications capable of depressing the CNS. Anticipated effects range from mild sedation to deep levels of sedation virtually equivalent to a state of general anesthesia where the patient may require external support of vital functions. Care must be taken to individualize and carefully titrate the dose of midazolam to the patient's underlying medical/surgical conditions, administer to the desired effect being certain to wait an adequate time for peak CNS effects of both midazolam and concomitant medications, and have the personnel and size-appropriate equipment and facilities available for monitoring and intervention (see Boxed WARNING, WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Practitioners administering midazolam must have the skills necessary to manage reasonably foreseeable adverse effects, particularly skills in airway management. For information regarding withdrawal, see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE section.

### Practice advisory for intraoperative awareness and brain function monitoring: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on intraoperative awareness [^9f1d8fd8]. Anesthesiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Practice advisory purpose, focus, and application — Intraoperative awareness under general anesthesia is an important clinical problem that clearly is within the foundation of training and continuing medical education in anesthesiology. The purposes of this Advisory are to identify risk factors that may be associated with intraoperative awareness, provide decision tools that may enable the clinician to reduce the frequency of unintended intraoperative awareness, stimulate the pursuit and evaluation of strategies that may prevent or reduce the frequency of intraoperative awareness, and provide guidance for the intraoperative use of brain function monitors as they relate to intraoperative awareness. This Advisory focuses on the perioperative treatment of patients who are undergoing a procedure during which general anesthesia is administered, is not intended for the perioperative management of minimal, moderate, or deep sedation in the operating room or intensive care unit; regional or local anesthesia without general anesthesia; monitored anesthesia care; tracheal intubation of patients or those undergoing resuscitation in emergency trauma after the administration of a neuromuscular block, or intentional intraoperative wake-up testing, and is not intended to address the perioperative treatment of pediatric patients. This Advisory is intended for use by anesthesiologists, other physicians who supervise the administration of general anesthesia, and all other individuals who administer general anesthesia, and may also serve as a resource for other physicians and healthcare professionals who are involved in the perioperative management of patients receiving general anesthesia.

### Anaesthetic considerations for surgery in newborns [^a9e713fa]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Almost 30years ago, the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Fetus and Newborn coauthored a policy statement strongly advocating for the use of anaesthesia in all neonates stating 'local or systemic pharmacologic agents now available permit relatively safe administration of anesthesia or analgesia to neonates undergoing surgical procedures and that such administration is indicated according to the usual guidelines for the administration of anesthesia to high-risk, potentially unstable patients'. With current techniques and advanced monitoring, preterm and full-term infants routinely undergo surgical procedures under general anaesthesia to repair congenital defects that were lethal in years past. Recent research in immature animal models, however, has shown evidence of enhanced neuroapoptosis and other signs of neurotoxicity with all of the currently used anaesthetic agents. There is also increasing concern about the potential adverse effects of perioperative hypotension and hypocapnia on neurocognitive development in infants. This review outlines the most recent animal and human evidence regarding the effects of general anaesthesia and anaesthetic-related haemodynamic changes on the developing brain of newborns.

The obesity epidemic is swelling to epic proportions. Obese patients often suffer from a combination of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), also known as the "metabolic syndrome". The metabolic syndrome is an independent predictor of cardiac dysfunction and cardiovascular disease and a risk factor for perioperative morbidity and mortality. In this paper, we discuss the perioperative risk factors and the need for advanced care of obese patients needing general anesthesia for (bariatric) surgical procedures based on physiological principles.

### Life-threatening perioperative anesthetic complications: major issues surrounding perioperative morbidity and mortality [^3d9168fe]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Summary

Even as delivering anesthesia becomes safer due to improved medications, equipment and monitoring, the continued study of perioperative morbidity and mortality discloses risk factors for poor outcomes. Some hazards are more readily rectified such as removing oxygen from the operative field in high-risk surgeries, improving medication delivery systems that prevent wrong drug or dose errors or avoiding opiates in high-risk patients. Other perils are less easily emended, such as needing to perform emergency surgery on patients with multiple comorbidities. Ultimately, accurate and comprehensive communication between anesthesiologists and surgeons throughout the perioperative period will help prevent complications and improve patient outcomes.

Analgesic options for surgical abortion (also called procedural abortion) beyond local anesthesia and minimal sedation include moderate sedation, deep sedation and general anesthesia. These clinical recommendations review the effectiveness of various moderate sedation, deep sedation, and general anesthesia regimens for pain control during abortion; medication regimens used to induce analgesia and anesthesia; patient factors affecting anesthesia safety; preoperative and intraoperative protocols to reduce anesthesia risks; personnel qualifications for administration; recommended patient monitoring protocols; and general risks of anesthesia in the context of abortion care. The scope of these recommendations is based on limited available evidence and considerably relies on existing professional society guidelines and recommendations developed by content experts and reviewers. Further research to compare the efficacy and safety of different regimens is needed.

### Environmental and occupational considerations of anesthesia: a narrative review and update [^b98803ca]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Total Intravenous Anesthesia

Based on the issues associated with volatile anesthetics discussed above, total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) may be considered as an alternative to volatile/inhaled anesthetics. By its nature, TIVA is not associated with the risks of occupational exposure inherent to volatile anesthetic gases; however, TIVA is not entirely devoid of potential negative environmental effects and the total environmental impact of TIVA must be taken into account.

Prediction of environmental hazards and the potential environmental impact of pharmaceuticals can be categorized by their impact on an aquatic environment according to a precautionary principle composed of 3 characteristics: persistence (P; ability to resist degradation in the aquatic environment), bioaccumulation (B; accumulation in adipose tissue of aquatic organisms), and toxicity (T; potential to poison aquatic organisms). Based on these characteristics, the "hazard score" indicates the environmental hazard associated with a particular substance such as a certain volatile or total IV anesthetic, calculated by assigning a numerical value of 0–3: P: 0 (not persistent) or 3 (persistent); B: 0 (does not bioaccumulate) or 3 (does bioaccumulate); T: 0–3, (nontoxic, very toxic, highly toxic). When summed, these characteristics provide a total PBT index that ranges from 0 to 9, with a higher value indicating a greater environmental hazard. For example, if a compound is "P", "B", and "T" (ie, fulfills the specific criteria for all 3 properties), then it is automatically categorized as hazardous to the environment. Likewise, if a compound fulfills the criteria for "very persistent" and "very bioaccumulative" (vB), then it is also considered hazardous to the environment, regardless of predicted levels of exposure and toxicity. Because insufficient evidence exists to assess risk, desflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, and N 2 O do not have hazard scores, indicating that environmental risk cannot be excluded. – In comparison, although the widely used IV anesthetic propofol has demonstrated toxicity in aquatic organisms and disposal via incineration is recommended, propofol has a hazard score of 4, indicating low environmental risk. However, studies have shown that 32%–49% of dispensed propofol is unused and disposed of as waste, and not all institutions incinerate unused propofol. While improper disposal methods and subsequent release into the environment may add to the negative impact of TIVA with agents such as propofol, accumulation of propofol in the environment has not been reliably estimated. Regional or multimodal anesthesia, either alone or in combination with TIVA or inhaled anesthetics, may also be viable alternatives for some procedures.

Informing Patients

Patients must be a part of the solution! To that end they must actively participate in their care, make truly informed decisions, and work with providers and systems of care to improve outcomes. For patients at risk for hemodynamic instability, a thorough review of potential complications should be part of the preoperative discussion along with a discussion of the strategies that will be used to minimize the risk of harm. Ideally, these discussions would occur at the time of the surgical decision between the surgeon and patient with the intent to foster shared decision-making and reassure the patient that their risks are being considered.

Introduction

There is a potential role for general anaesthesia in end‐of‐life care, something which has been described previously but largely overlooked. We will start by reviewing the current place of sedation in end‐of‐life care and show how general anaesthesia is an extension of existing practices. However, introducing general anaesthesia in end‐of‐life care also requires an examination of the associated ethical, medicolegal and practical implications. We stress that general anaesthesia in end‐of‐life care is not a form of assisted dying or euthanasia, which are illegal in the UK.

### Association between exposure to general versus regional anesthesia and risk of dementia in older adults [^ad8e059f]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Cognitive changes are commonly observed in older adults following surgical procedures. There are concerns that exposure to general anesthesia (GA) may contribute to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Our study examined the associations between exposure to GA compared with regional anesthesia (RA) administered for elective surgical procedures and the development of dementia.

Design

Population-based propensity matched retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Linked administrative databases were accessed from ICES (formerly called the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Services) in Ontario, Canada.

Participants

We included all community-dwelling individuals aged 66 and older who underwent one of five elective surgical procedures in Ontario, Canada, between April 1, 2007, and March 31, 2011. Individuals with evidence of dementia preceding cohort entry were excluded. Individuals who received GA were matched within surgical procedures to those who received RA on age, sex, cohort entry year, and a propensity score to control for potential confounders.

Measurements

The baseline characteristics of the study sample were compared before and after matching. Individuals were followed for up to 5years following cohort entry for the occurrence of dementia using a validated algorithm. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to determine the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between anesthetic type and dementia. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were undertaken.

Results

A total of 7,499 matched pairs were included in the final analysis. Overall, no difference was observed in the risk of being diagnosed with dementia for individuals who received GA when compared with RA (HR = 1.0; 95% CI = .8–1.2). There was also no association between anesthesia and dementia in most subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion

Elective surgery using GA was not associated with an overall elevated risk of dementia when compared with RA. Future studies are required to determine whether surgery is a risk factor for dementia irrespective of anesthetic technique.

### Food and drug administration warning on anesthesia and brain development: implications for obstetric and fetal surgery [^8c0133ff]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

There has been growing concern about the detrimental effects of certain anesthetic agents on the developing brain. Preclinical studies in small animal models as well as nonhuman primates suggested loss or death of brain cells and consequent impaired neurocognitive function following anesthetic exposure in neonates and late gestation fetuses. Human studies in this area are limited and currently inconclusive. On Dec. 14, 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning regarding impaired brain development in children following exposure to certain anesthetic agents used for general anesthesia, namely the inhalational anesthetics isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane, and the intravenous agents propofol and midazolam, in the third trimester of pregnancy. Furthermore, this warning recommends that health care professionals should balance the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in young children and pregnant women against potential risks, especially for procedures that may last > 3 hours or if multiple procedures are required in children < 3 years old. The objective of this article is to highlight how the Food and Drug Administration warning may impact the anesthetic and surgical management of the obstetric patient. Neuraxial anesthesia (epidural or spinal anesthesia) is more commonly administered for cesarean delivery than general anesthesia. The short duration of fetal exposure to general anesthesia during cesarean delivery has not been associated with learning disabilities. However, the fetus can also be exposed to both intravenous and inhalation anesthetics during nonobstetric or fetal surgery in the second and third trimester; this exposure is typically longer than that for cesarean delivery. Very few studies address the effect of anesthetic exposure on the fetus in the second trimester when most nonobstetric and fetal surgical procedures are performed. It is also unclear how the plasticity of the fetal brain at this stage of development will modulate the consequences of anesthetic exposure. Strategies that may circumvent possible untoward long-term neurologic effects of anesthesia in the baby include: (1) use of nonimplicated (nongamma-aminobutyric acid agonist) agents for sedation such as opioids (remifentanil, fentanyl) or the alpha-2 agonist, dexmedetomidine, when appropriate; (2) minimizing the duration of exposure to inhalational anesthetics for fetal, obstetric, and nonobstetric procedures in the pregnant patient, as much as possible within safe limits; and (3) commencing surgery promptly and limiting the interval between induction of anesthesia and surgery start time will help decrease patient exposure to inhalational agents. While the Food and Drug Administration warning was based on duration and repetitive nature of exposure rather than concentration of inhalational agents, intravenous tocolytics can be considered for intraoperative use, to provide uterine relaxation for fetal surgery, in lieu of high concentrations of inhalational anesthetic agents. Practitioners should consider the type of anesthesia that will be administered and the potential risks when scheduling patients for nonobstetric and fetal surgery.

### Pro-con debate: electroencephalography-guided anesthesia for reducing postoperative delirium [^1b53866e]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Postoperative delirium (POD) has significant implications on morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures. Monitoring electroencephalography (EEG) to adjust anesthetic management has gained interest as a strategy to mitigate POD. In this Pro-Con commentary article, the pro side supports the use of EEG to reduce POD, citing an empiric reduction in POD with processed EEG (pEEG)-guided general anesthesia found in several studies and recent meta-analysis. The Electroencephalography Guidance of Anesthesia to Alleviate Geriatric Syndromes (ENGAGES) trial is the exception to this, and issues with methods and achieved depths are discussed. Meanwhile, the Con side advocates that the use of EEG to reduce POD is not yet certain, citing that there is a lack of evidence that associations between anesthetic depth and POD represent causal relationships. The Con side also contends that the ideal EEG signatures to guide anesthetic titration are currently unknown, and the potential benefits of reduced anesthesia levels may be outweighed by the risks of potentially insufficient anesthetic administration. As the public health burden of POD increases, anesthesia clinicians will be tasked to consider interventions to mitigate risk such as EEG. This Pro-Con debate will provide 2 perspectives on the evidence and rationales for using EEG to mitigate POD.

### Should general anaesthesia be avoided in the elderly? [^2d3b5b67]. Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Surgery and anaesthesia exert comparatively greater adverse effects on the elderly than on the younger brain, manifest by the higher prevalence of postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction. Postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction delay rehabilitation, and are associated with increases in morbidity and mortality among elderly surgical patients. We review the aetiology of postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction in the elderly with a particular focus on anaesthesia and sedation, discuss methods of diagnosing and monitoring postoperative cognitive decline, and describe the treatment strategies by which such decline may be prevented.

Criteria for anesthesia intervention, testing, and consultation — benefit–risk framing: Any evaluations, tests, and consultations required for a patient are done with the reasonable expectation that such activities will result in benefits that exceed the potential adverse effects. Potential benefits may include a change in the content or timing of anesthetic management or perioperative resource use that may improve the safety and effectiveness of anesthetic processes involved with perioperative care, whereas potential adverse effects may include interventions that result in injury, discomfort, inconvenience, delays, or costs that are not commensurate with the anticipated benefits.

### Risk factors for postoperative nausea and vomiting [^bca256d0]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

Knowledge of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) risk factors allows anesthesiologists to optimize the use of prophylactic regimens. Modern PONV risk research began in the 1990s with publication of studies using logistic regression analysis to simultaneously identify multiple independent PONV predictors and publication of meta-analyses and systematic reviews. This literature shows that female gender post-puberty, nonsmoking status, history of PONV or motion sickness, childhood after infancy and younger adulthood, increasing duration of surgery, and use of volatile anesthetics, nitrous oxide, large-dose neostigmine, or intraoperative or postoperative opioids are well established PONV risk factors. Possible risk factors include history of migraine, history of PONV or motion sickness in a child's parent or sibling, better ASA physical status, intense preoperative anxiety, certain ethnicities or surgery types, decreased perioperative fluids, crystalloid versus colloid administration, increasing duration of anesthesia, general versus regional anesthesia or sedation, balanced versus total IV anesthesia, and use of longer-acting versus shorter-acting opioids. Early-phase menstruation, obesity and lack of supplemental oxygen are disproved risk factors. Current risk scoring systems have approximately 55%-80% accuracy in predicting which patient groups will suffer PONV. Further research examining genetic and under-investigated clinical patient characteristics as potential risk factors, and involving outpatients and children, should improve predictive systems.

### Adverse events and factors associated with potentially avoidable use of general anesthesia in cesarean deliveries [^ad566413]. Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Compared with neuraxial anesthesia, general anesthesia for cesarean delivery is associated with increased risk of maternal adverse events. Reducing avoidable general anesthetics for cesarean delivery may improve safety of obstetric anesthesia care. This study examined adverse events, trends, and factors associated with potentially avoidable general anesthetics for cesarean delivery.

Methods

This retrospective study analyzed cesarean delivery cases without a recorded indication for general anesthesia or contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia in New York State hospitals, 2003 to 2014. Adverse events included anesthesia complications (systemic, neuraxial-related, and drug-related), surgical site infection, venous thromboembolism, and the composite of death or cardiac arrest. Anesthesia complications were defined as severe if associated with death, organ failure, or prolonged hospital stay.

Results

During the study period, 466,014 cesarean deliveries without a recorded indication for general anesthesia or contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia were analyzed; 26,431 were completed with general anesthesia (5.7%). The proportion of avoidable general anesthetics decreased from 5.6% in 2003 to 2004 to 4.8% in 2013 to 2014 (14% reduction; P < 0.001). Avoidable general anesthetics were associated with significantly increased risk of anesthesia complications (adjusted odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 1.9), severe complications (adjusted odds ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.6 to 5.2), surgical site infection (adjusted odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 2.1), and venous thromboembolism (adjusted odds ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.0), but not of death or cardiac arrest. Labor neuraxial analgesia rate was one of the most actionable hospital-level factors associated with avoidable general anesthetics. Relative to hospitals with a rate greater than or equal to 75%, the adjusted odds ratio of avoidable general anesthetics increased to 1.3 (95% CI, 1.2 to 1.4), 1.6 (95% CI, 1.5 to 1.7), and 3.2 (95% CI, 3.0 to 3.5) as the rate decreased to 50 to 74.9%, 25 to 49.9%, and less than 25%, respectively.

Conclusions

Compared with neuraxial anesthesia, avoidable general anesthetics are associated with increased risk of adverse maternal outcomes.

### Use of anesthetic agents in neonates and young children [^614bdebb]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Some drugs used for sedation and anesthesia produce histopathologic central nervous system changes in juvenile animal models. These observations have raised concerns regarding the use of these drugs in pediatric patients. We summarized the findings in developing animals and describe the steps that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and others are taking to assess potential risks in pediatric patients. The FDA views this communication as opening a dialog with the anesthesia community to address this issue.

Methods

We reviewed the available animal studies literature examining the potential neurotoxic effects of commonly used anesthetic drugs on the developing brain. The search strategy involved crossing the keywords neurotoxic and neuroapoptosis with the following general and specific terms: anesthetic, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), ketamine, midazolam, lorazepam, fentanyl, methadone, morphine, meperidine, isoflurane, nitrous oxide, sevoflurane, halothane, enflurane, desflurane, propofol, etomidate, barbiturate, methoxyflurane, and chloral hydrate. We summarized several studies sponsored by the FDA in rats and monkeys, initially examining the potential for ketamine, as a prototypical agent, to induce neurodegeneration in the developing brain.

Results

Numerous animal studies in rodents indicate that NMDA receptor antagonists, including ketamine, induce neurodegeneration in the developing brain. The effects of ketamine are dose dependent. The data suggest that limiting exposure limits the potential for neurodegeneration. There is also evidence that other general anesthetics, such as isoflurane, can induce neurodegeneration in rodent models, which may be exacerbated by concurrent administration of midazolam or nitrous oxide. There are very few studies that have examined the potential functional consequences of the neurodegeneration noted in the animal models. However, the studies that have been reported suggest subtle, but prolonged, behavioral changes in rodents. Although the doses and durations of ketamine exposure that resulted in neurodegeneration were slightly larger than those used in the clinical setting, those associated with isoflurane were not. There are insufficient human data to either support or refute the clinical applicability of these findings.

Conclusions

Animal studies suggest that neurodegeneration, with possible cognitive sequelae, is a potential long-term risk of anesthetics in neonatal and young pediatric patients. The existing nonclinical data implicate not only NMDA-receptor antagonists, but also drugs that potentiate gamma-aminobutyric acid signal transduction, as potentially neurotoxic to the developing brain. The potential for the combination of drugs that have activity at both receptor systems or that can induce more or less neurotoxicity is not clear; however, recent nonclinical data suggest that some combinations may be more neurotoxic than the individual components. The lack of information to date precludes the ability to designate any one anesthetic agent or regimen as safer than any other. Ongoing studies in juvenile animals should provide additional information regarding the risks. The FDA anticipates working with the anesthesia community and pharmaceutical industry to develop strategies for further assessing the safety of anesthetics in neonates and young children, and for providing data to guide clinicians in making the most informed decisions possible when choosing anesthetic regimens for their pediatric patients.

### Neuraxial anaesthesia and peripheral nerve blocks during the COVID-19 pandemic: a literature review and practice recommendations [^a67c5b4f]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a significant impact on global healthcare services. In an attempt to limit the spread of infection and to preserve healthcare resources, one commonly used strategy has been to postpone elective surgery, whilst maintaining the provision of anaesthetic care for urgent and emergency surgery. General anaesthesia with airway intervention leads to aerosol generation, which increases the risk of COVID-19 contamination in operating rooms and significantly exposes the healthcare teams to COVID-19 infection during both tracheal intubation and extubation. Therefore, the provision of regional anaesthesia may be key during this pandemic, as it may reduce the need for general anaesthesia and the associated risk from aerosol-generating procedures. However, guidelines on the safe performance of regional anaesthesia in light of the COVID-19 pandemic are limited. The goal of this review is to provide up-to-date, evidence-based recommendations or expert opinion when evidence is limited, for performing regional anaesthesia procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. These recommendations focus on seven specific domains including: planning of resources and staffing; modifying the clinical environment; preparing equipment, supplies and drugs; selecting appropriate personal protective equipment; providing adequate oxygen therapy; assessing for and safely performing regional anaesthesia procedures; and monitoring during the conduct of anaesthesia and post-anaesthetic care. Implicit in these recommendations is preserving patient safety whilst protecting healthcare providers from possible exposure.

### An international multidisciplinary consensus statement on fasting before procedural sedation in adults and children [^1621f71b]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What are the known risk factors for pulmonary aspiration with general anaesthesia and with procedural sedation?

The evidence relating to general anaesthesia is presented in the online Supplementary Material. The evidence regarding sedation‐associated aspiration risk factors comes mainly from case series in which aspiration occurrences, when present, were contrasted with patients who did not suffer aspiration 19, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52. The most reliable of these is the 139,142‐subject, multicentre registry of paediatric sedation using primarily propofol referred to earlier 19. Additional information comes from a systematic review of the 326 occurrences of sedation‐associated aspiration reported from 1985 to 2016, in which the authors describe patient characteristics and procedural features that seem to be over‐represented in the aspiration events, which may thus be thought of as possible risk factors 20.

Compared with the general anaesthesia studies (see also Supporting Information, Table S3), most sedation studies have smaller sample sizes and a lower incidence of aspiration. Despite this, the two main contributing studies 19, 20 are of higher methodological quality than many of the anaesthesia studies and systematically assessed multiple clinical variables. We summarise findings from these reports in Table 2 and discuss specific items in the context of both the general anaesthesia and sedation literature below.

Table 2
Risk factors for pulmonary aspiration associated with procedural sedation

Greater patient comorbidities

When a medical illness that could pose a risk to life was reported (i.e. ASA physical status of 3 or greater), there were consistent observations of increased aspiration risk for both general anaesthesia 22, 23, 24, 56 and procedural sedation 19, 20, 50.

Tracheal intubation/extubation/airway manipulation

Numerous general anaesthesia studies have observed occurrences of aspiration temporally associated with tracheal intubation/extubation, insertion of supraglottic airway devices, or other airway manipulation 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 56, 57.

Emergency surgery or procedure

Most studies observed that aspiration was more common during emergency surgery in adults 22, 23, 24, 28, 30, 31, 35, with mixed results in children 25, 26, 36, 56.

In contrast, emergency procedures were not identified as risk factors for procedural sedation (Table 2). This probably reflects the fact that emergency sedation is usually of short duration, performed with an intact airway, and without rapid sequence tracheal intubation or other airway manipulation.

### A survey of surgical patients' perspectives and preferences towards general anesthesia techniques and shared-decision making [^2248d97c]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Beliefs

Half of respondents believe that the level of anesthesia clinician experience (54%), dose of anesthesia (53%) and duration of administration (50%) impact whether a patient will have a good experience after receiving general anesthesia.

When respondents were asked questions about general anesthesia, 39.5% believed that both types of anesthesia are safe to administer. They did not think nausea or vomiting, a feeling of general well being, or a quicker time to recovery was associated with one type over another. They believe that intravenous is more commonly given than inhaled. About 40% of respondents thought inhaled anesthesia was associated with a higher incidence of intraoperative awareness and was more likely to contribute to climate change (Table 5. Beliefs about General Anesthesia).

### Risk assessment and optimization strategies to reduce perioperative respiratory adverse events in pediatric anesthesia-part 2: anesthesia-related risk and treatment options [^f55e2aef]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Perioperative respiratory adverse events are the most common cause of critical events in children undergoing anesthesia and surgery. While many risk factors remain unmodifiable, there are numerous anesthetic management decisions which can impact the incidence and impact of these events, especially in at-risk children. Ongoing research continues to improve our understanding of both the influence of risk factors and the effect of specific interventions. This review discusses anesthesia risk factors and outlines strategies to reduce the rate and impact of perioperative respiratory adverse events with a chronologic based inquiry into anesthetic management decisions through the perioperative period from premedication to postoperative disposition.

### Sedation and anesthesia for imaging of the infant and neonate-a brief review [^326e0075]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

There are several key differences in neonatal and infant physiology that affect how medications for anesthesia and sedation must be dosed. Neonates have a comparatively high metabolic rate and high minute alveolar ventilation — this leads to increased uptake of volatile anesthetic agents such as sevoflurane when compared to older patients. The dosing of volatile anesthetics is also dependent on the age and degree of prematurity of the infant. Neonates and infants, in comparison with other children, have decreased protein binding and hepatic and renal function. There are also differences in the distribution of cardiac output to the liver and kidneys of neonates, further affecting drug metabolism and excretion. Neonates (and older infants, to a lesser extent) typically have a longer elimination half-life than older children, and this must be considered when dosing medications for anesthesia. Unfortunately, data regarding dosing of anesthetic medications for neonates and infants is generally much more sparse than what data exists for adults.

These medications should be used carefully, as all have potential associated toxicities. Anesthetic and analgesic agents may induce bradycardia, impair vascular tone leading to hypotension, and diminish respiratory drive and pharyngeal tone. Chemical paralysis guarantees that the patient will not be able to spontaneously breathe for a significant amount of time. Therefore, use of these agents demands invasive airways and mechanical ventilation throughout the procedure and until the impact of administered medications has resolved. Intubation and ventilation incur a risk of injury to the patient's airway and lungs and can interfere significantly with the patient's hemodynamic status. Intravenous access is almost always required for safe administration of anesthesia — intravenous access can be difficult and may require ultrasound guidance, and infiltration can lead to drug extravasation and tissue injury. Use of vaso- and cardio-active medications requires peripheral and sometimes central vascular access; introduction of these lines poses risks to patients including infection, bleeding, damage to vascular and other local structures, and potential tissue injury. Immobile patients are at risk of neurovascular and pressure injuries related to positioning. Administration of general anesthesia outside of the operating room may incur additional risk. In addition, the developmental impact of single and repeat anesthetic encounters in the immature brain remains an area of significant focus. In short, anesthesia is often necessary to achieve a high-quality radiology study, but is not without risk, which must be considered against the potential benefit of any requested study.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^75bf108f]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

General Anesthesia

AF ablation procedures are commonly performed under general anesthesia. Not only does use of general anesthesia improve the safety of the procedure for patients at risk of airway obstruction, but it also improves patient comfort and might improve efficacy by preventing patient movement during the procedure. Given the need to minimize patient movement to improve catheter and mapping system stability, general anesthesia or deep sedation are generally preferred. One prospective randomized clinical trial randomized patients with general anesthesia or conscious sedation. This study reported that use of general anesthesia increased the single procedure success rate, lowered the prevalence of PV reconnection among those who needed a redo procedure, and shortened fluoroscopy time and procedure time. General anesthesia is of particular importance for patients at risk of airway obstruction, those with a history of sleep apnea, and those at increased risk of pulmonary edema. General anesthesia may also be employed electively in healthy patients in order to improve patient tolerance of the procedure. Anesthesia or analgesia needs to be administered by well-trained and experienced individuals with monitoring of heart rate, noninvasive or arterial line BP, and oxygen saturation. Guidelines for assessing levels of anesthesia and training requirements for administration of intravenous sedation during procedures have been developed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists, which can be found on their website. A survey of the writing group members shows that in the United States and Canada, 85% routinely employ general anesthesia. Outside the United States and Canada, 45% routinely employ general anesthesia. (Please also see discussion of anesthesia on page e51).

Conscious and Deep Sedation

Deep sedation is a step beyond conscious sedation and just before general anesthesia. Generally, only anesthesia providers or specially trained physicians can provide deep sedation because airway and hemodynamic management might be required. The major limitation to deep sedation is the need for the patient to lie on the procedure table with minimal movement during the entire procedure. RF lesions can be associated with intense pain, resulting in patient movement. The location of sites eliciting pain with RF lesions are not predictable, although are most often located on the posterior wall. Monitoring esophageal temperature during deep sedation is possible, but more cumbersome, due to intact airway reflexes that are abolished during general anesthesia. Patient movement with right phrenic stimulation during CB procedures is also a common occurrence with deep sedation, and is largely absent with the use of general anesthesia.

### The third American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine practice advisory on local anesthetic systemic toxicity: executive summary 2017 [^5b241cd0]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) practice advisory — key updates and risk patterns — focuses on "the mechanisms of lipid resuscitation, update frequency estimates, the preventative role of ultrasound guidance, changes to case presentation patterns, and limited information related to local infiltration anesthesia and liposomal bupivacaine". Epidemiology "suggest a lower frequency of LAST as reported by single institutions and some registries, nevertheless a considerable number of events still occur within the general community", and "contemporary case reports suggest a trend toward delayed presentation, which may mirror the increased use of ultrasound guidance (fewer intravascular injections), local infiltration techniques (slower systemic uptake), and continuous local anesthetic infusions". Additional risk signals note that "small patient size and sarcopenia are additional factors that increase potential risk for LAST", with "an increasing number of reported events" outside hospitals "involv[ing] non-anesthesiologists". Because "interventions involving local anesthetics are ubiquitous throughout medicine", and LAST "remains a serious adverse event" with events that "range across a continuum from mild subjective prodromal symptoms to seizure, cardiac arrest, and/or death", clinicians should recognize that "a variety of factors influence the likelihood and severity of LAST", including patient factors, medications, block technique, drug and dose, and timeliness/adequacy of detection and treatment; the "overall rarity" yet possibility "despite proper technique argue strongly for education and preparedness among all professionals who administer local anesthetics to their patients".

### Sedation and anesthesia for imaging of the infant and neonate-a brief review [^ef13921e]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The objective of sedation and anesthesia as it pertains to pediatric imaging is simple — to facilitate an optimal image or study to benefit the patient while maintaining the safety and comfort of the child. While simply stated, accomplishing this goal is more complex: the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) defines the requirements for safe sedation of children for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures as requiring a systematic approach that includes medical evaluation, appropriate fasting and preparation, sufficient personnel, equipment, and facility resources, and a trained and knowledgeable medical provider. Need for sedation and general anesthesia for infant and neonatal imaging is increasing as the availability of high-level diagnostic imaging technologies such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear medicine, interventional radiology studies, and other high-resolution techniques expands. Performing high-quality imaging free of motion artifact is particularly difficult in many children without the aid of sedation. Safe administration of sedation and anesthesia to infants and neonates requires special consideration. Their small size makes airway management and other procedures more technically challenging; they metabolize medications differently and have differences in cardiopulmonary physiology when compared to older children or adults.

Protocols for sedation and anesthesia for imaging of the infant vary across institutions. Although several organizations such as the AAP and the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia have published guidelines and positions on the provision of pediatric anesthesia and sedation care, there is much flexibility in the approach to this type of care between providers and throughout hospital systems.

Provision of sedation or general anesthesia is not without risk. The United States Food and Drug administration (FDA) has issued a warning regarding exposure to anesthesia in children under the age of 3, citing a concern that medications used for sedation and anesthesia may negatively affect the developing brain. It is imperative that radiologists and ordering providers understand the risks of sedation and anesthesia and weigh them against the potential benefits of the intended imaging study so that they may ensure that requested sedated studies are necessary and appropriate for each patient.

### Does regional anaesthesia improve outcome? [^adc2e827]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

This review examines the recent evidence of an impact of regional anaesthesia on important clinical outcomes. Evidence was obtained from a variety of studies, with increasing numbers of analyses of large databases being prominent. The benefits and limitations of these approaches are considered in order to provide a context for interpretation of the data they generate. There should be little argument that correctly performed and appropriately used regional anaesthetic techniques can provide the most effective postoperative analgesia for the duration of the block, but the majority of studies suggest that this does not translate into improved longer-term surgical outcomes. The evidence for reduced incidence of major complications when regional anaesthesia is compared with, or added to, general anaesthesia is mixed. There appears to be a small effect in reducing blood loss during major joint arthroplasty. Some, but not all, studies demonstrate a reduced incidence of respiratory and infective complications with regional anaesthesia, but the effect on cardiovascular complications is variable. There are even some data consistent with a hypothesis that general anaesthesia may be protective against postoperative cognitive dysfunction. In conclusion, there is probably no generally applicable benefit in long-term outcomes with regional anaesthesia. More likely is an interaction between patient factors, the surgical procedure, and the relative capability of the anaesthetist to manage different types of anaesthesia.

Grading of the evidence and recommendations — The panel used methods from the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group, and each recommendation received a separate grade for the strength of the recommendation (strong or weak) and for the quality of evidence (high, moderate, or low). In this framework, most clinicians and patients would choose to follow a strong recommendation, whereas a weak recommendation is on the basis that benefits outweigh potential harms and burdens but the balance is smaller or evidence is weaker; decisions to follow a weak recommendation could vary depending on specific clinical circumstances or patient preferences and values. The development process included systematic searches with investigators reviewing 6556 abstracts and including 107 systematic reviews and 858 primary studies, a voting threshold in which a two-thirds majority was required for a recommendation to be approved, solicitation of more than 20 external peer reviewers, approvals in April 2015, October 2015, and August 2015, and an intention to update the guideline by 2021.

### Life-threatening perioperative anesthetic complications: major issues surrounding perioperative morbidity and mortality [^8735639b]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Major issues surrounding perioperative morbidity and mortality in anesthesiology

Since the first use of ether, the risks and benefits of anesthesia have been analyzed repeatedly. Anesthesia evolved from nearly anyone being able to 'drop ether' to the subspecialty practice we undertake today, with non-anesthesiologists increasingly looking through a glass, darkly. Anesthetic equipment, medications, monitors and techniques change to keep pace with advances in surgery, aging patients, patients who are sicker and non-operating room (non-OR) procedures. Surgeons and anesthesiologists sometimes speak in entirely different terms when discussing cases. Part of that disconnect is that surgeons deal with a diagnosis requiring a surgical intervention, while anesthesiologists deliver anesthesia to facilitate a surgery while simultaneously keeping at-risk patient organs viable. In the 1940s, one in a thousand healthy subjects died from their anesthetic. The safety of anesthesia has evolved substantially with improved understanding of anesthetic-related deaths, the advent of better monitoring practices, improved airway management tools, sharing of safety knowledge and peer review. Today, anesthesia-related mortality is about 1.1 per million persons per year in the USA. Here we will elucidate both common and rare causes of anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality that significantly impact perioperative liability, especially in the setting of multiple comorbidities. Our goal in undertaking this review is that by elucidating underlying causes of complications related to anesthesia as well as their prevention, patients can have safer surgical experiences.

### Regional anesthesia and analgesia in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^6b033107]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Regional anesthesia has become invaluable for the treatment of pain during and after a wide range of surgical procedures. However, its benefits in the nonsurgical setting have been less well studied. Regional anesthesia is an appealing modality for critically ill patients, providing focused and sustained pain control with beneficial systemic effect profiles. Indications for regional anesthesia in this patient group are not limited to surgical and postsurgical analgesia but expand to the management of trauma-related issues, medical conditions, and painful procedures at the bedside. Patients in the critical care unit present special challenges to the regional anesthesiologist, including coagulopathies, infections, immunocompromised states, sedation- and ventilation-associated problems, and factors potentially increasing the risk for systemic toxicity. This review is intended to evaluate the role of regional anesthesia in critically ill patients, to discuss potential benefits, and to provide a summary of the published evidence on the subject.

Appendix 1 — Preoperative evaluation for intraoperative awareness risk includes: review patient medical records for potential risk factors such as substance use or abuse, previous episode of intraoperative awareness, history of difficult intubation or anticipated difficult intubation, chronic pain patients using high doses of opioids, ASA physical status IV or V, and limited hemodynamic reserve; interview the patient to assess level of anxiety and obtain information regarding previous experiences with anesthesia; and determine other potential risk factors including cardiac surgery, cesarean delivery, trauma surgery, emergency surgery, reduced anesthetic doses in the presence of paralysis, planned use of muscle relaxants during the maintenance phase of general anesthesia, and planned use of nitrous oxide–opioid anesthesia. Patients whom the individual clinician considers to be at substantially increased risk of intraoperative awareness should be informed of the possibility of intraoperative awareness when circumstances permit.

Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Anaesthetic technique

Early evidence suggested no difference in peri‐operative outcomes based on the mode of anaesthesia. However, more recent evidence indicates that in patients with recent or peri‐operative SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, local or regional anaesthetic techniques may be associated with a moderate (e.g. point estimates varying between 50–150%) reduction in the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications and mortality when compared with general anaesthesia. It is possible that these data are prone to bias through unmeasured covariates and have yet to be reproduced in the setting of omicron and vaccination. On balance, in patients with recent or peri‐operative SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, avoidance of general anaesthesia in favour of local or regional anaesthetic techniques should be considered.

### Conscious sedation for interventional procedures: a practical guide [^0ec6635e]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Sedation is often used in interventional procedures to minimize discomfort, improve the patient's experience, and reduce the risk of procedural complications by assuring nonmobility and compliance of the patient. Sedation, however, adds a new dimension to the procedure by compromising the patients' normal protective mechanisms and carries the potential of cardiac, respiratory, and cognitive complications. Interventional procedures could be performed under local anesthesia with or without sedation, or under general anesthesia. Sedation itself could be categorized into minimal, moderate, or deep sedation. The choice generally depends on patient factors such as age, cardiovascular stability, pain tolerance, and procedural factors such as complexity, extent, and degree of induced pain. In longer and more extensive procedures on more fragile patients, the assistance of an anesthesiologist will be required. The purpose of this article is to provide a basic understanding and a practical guideline for minimal and moderate sedation for the interventionalist contemplating to administer sedation for less involved procedures.

### Sedation and anesthesia for imaging of the infant and neonate-a brief review [^8a4f8fb7]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Requirements for safe provision of sedation or general anesthesia

When non-pharmacologic interventions fail, or conditions such as swallowing dysfunction, critical illness, or urgent/emergent need for imaging results necessitate the use of sedation or general anesthesia, a holistic, standardized approach is crucial to maximize patient safety. As described previously, administration of sedative/hypnotic agents produce sedative effects on a spectrum which ranges from mild anxiolysis with general preservation of respiratory/cardiovascular function and airway reflexes, to general anesthesia with profound cardiorespiratory depression and blunting of autonomic and airway reflexes. While general dosing strategies to achieve various depths of sedation or anesthesia are available, precise individual responses are unpredictable, and therefore providers need to be prepared to support patients as if they were achieving general anesthesia. To this end, it is critical that providers follow established guidance with regard to NPO ("nil-per-os", or "nothing by mouth") time as described by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Committee on Standards and Practice Parameters to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents (Supplementary Material 1).

### Consensus statement on pain management for pregnant patients with opioid-use disorder from the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology, Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine, and American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine [^512a4519]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Ketamine use for labor analgesia in pregnant people with OUD lacks clinical trial data, with noted safety uncertainties and cautionary conditions. Clinical trials evaluating ketamine for labor analgesia or in the peripartum period are lacking, and there are no studies examining the role of ketamine in laboring people with OUD or reporting potential risks for return to use after ketamine exposure with MOUD. Perioperative continuous infusion of subanesthetic intravenous ketamine has been noted to reduce opioid requirements in patients without OUD, but lactation safety and breastmilk transfer data are currently lacking. Under animal experimental conditions, ketamine and other anesthetics have been noted to exhibit neurotoxic effects in developing brains, and the 2016 Food and Drug Administration communication states that general anesthesia and sedation drugs (including but not limited to ketamine) used in children < 3 years of age or in pregnant people in their third trimester who undergo anesthesia for more than 3 hours or repeated use of anesthetics "may affect the development of children's brains". The consensus authors note that exposure in pregnancy and lactation is often under circumstances of necessity and brief, nonrepetitive periods of exposure with patient-centered decisions, and they list potential conditions to avoid or exert caution with ketamine use, including uncontrolled thyroid disease, uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions such as severe hypertension, or a history of hallucinations.

### Updates in our understanding of local anaesthetic systemic toxicity: a narrative review [^5b569b91]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in clinical practice, local anaesthetic systemic toxicity continues to occur with the therapeutic use of local anaesthesia. Patterns of presentation have evolved over recent years due in part to the increasing use of ultrasound which has been demonstrated to reduce risk. Onset of toxicity is increasingly delayed, a greater proportion of clinical reports are secondary to fascial plane blocks, and cases are increasing where non-anaesthetist providers are involved. The evolving clinical context presents a challenge for diagnosis and requires education of all physicians, nurses and allied health professionals about these changing patterns and risks. This review discusses: mechanisms; prevention; diagnosis; and treatment of local anaesthetic systemic toxicity. The local anaesthetic and dose used, site of injection and block conduct and technique are all important determinants of local anaesthetic systemic toxicity, as are various patient factors. Risk mitigation is discussed including the care of at-risk groups, such as: those at the extremes of age; patients with cardiac, hepatic and specific metabolic diseases; and those who are pregnant. Advances in the changing clinical landscape with novel applications and settings for the use of local anaesthesia are also described. Finally, we signpost future directions to potentially improve the management of local anaesthetic systemic toxicity. The utility of local anaesthetics remains unquestionable in clinical practice, and thus maximising the safe and appropriate use of these drugs should translate to improvements in patient care.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: pain control in surgical abortion part 2-moderate sedation, deep sedation, and general anesthesia [^df5a03e4]. Contraception (2021). High credibility.

Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations — anesthesia risks, oxygen use, and emergency equipment report that, across approximately 16.1 million abortion procedures in the United States from 1998 to 2010, 108 deaths occurred (mortality rate of 0.7 per 100,000 procedures), with 22 deaths (20% of the total) attributed to anesthesia complications; among 28 deaths after surgical abortion at 13 weeks' gestation or less, anesthesia complications were the most common cause (n = 13). A review noted 0.02% anesthesia-related complications in office-based settings and < 0.05% in surgical centers and hospitals, with no deaths reported. The ASA Task Force and consultants agree that ready availability of appropriately sized emergency equipment reduces the risks of both moderate and deep sedation, and ASA oxygen guidance states that the literature supports supplemental oxygen during moderate sedation and suggests its use during deep sedation to reduce hypoxia; if hypoxemia is anticipated or develops, supplemental oxygen should be administered, and "supplemental oxygen should be considered for moderate sedation and should be administered during deep sedation unless specifically contraindicated". NAF requires onsite emergency equipment and medications including an oxygen delivery system, airway and resuscitation supplies, and specifies that an automatic external defibrillator should be available at sites with deep sedation and general anesthesia, with NAF guidelines requiring supplemental oxygen with deep sedation and general anesthesia.

### Anesthesiology and cognitive impairment: a narrative review of current clinical literature [^56a112e2]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The effects of anesthetic agents on POCD

Several studies have aimed to determine whether general anesthesia itself is a risk factor for POCD. Many of these studies have chosen to compare general anesthesia (GA) to non-GA techniques such as neuraxial, regional, local anesthesia, and sedation. A meta-analysis published in 2010 looked at the existing literature on the topic. In their analysis, non-GA techniques included spinal, epidural, regional, and combination GA plus neuraxial or regional. POCD was defined by any objectively measured cognitive impairment. There was a non-significant trend toward increased POCD with GA vs. non-GA, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.93–1.95. Since the publication of this meta-analysis, a randomized controlled trial was published which compared GA to spinal without co-administration of confounding sedative medications. The trial population was patients ≥ 55 years of age undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. The authors concluded that the type of anesthesia did not impact rates of POCD at 7 days or 3 months postoperatively. Of note, the trial did conduct an interim analysis and the trial was stopped early for futility at 50% of the a priori calculated required sample size. Furthermore, the mean age of the study population was 63.9 and 66.9 in the GA and spinal groups, respectively, and patients with pre-existing cognitive dysfunction were excluded from the study, which limits generalizability of the findings to individuals of advanced age and individuals with dementia. Indeed, the practice guidelines for perioperative brain health published in 2018 concluded that, based on current available data, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of regional anesthesia instead of general anesthesia.

### Sedation versus general anesthesia on all-cause mortality in patients undergoing percutaneous procedures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8a0dd4e4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The currently available evidence, graded as very low to low certainty, suggests a possible slight advantage of sedation over GA in reducing the risk of in-hospital mortality, specifically in cardiac and macrovascular surgery. However, the extent of this difference is not clearly evident or uncertain in the medium and long-term postoperative periods. Furthermore, the comparison between sedation and GA in cerebrovascular surgery and other surgical patient populations also yields uncertain results, despite the limited number of studies included in the subgroup analysis.

### 2019 HRS / EHRA / APHRS / LAHRS expert consensus statement on catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias [^bc81a7fa]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

The American Society of Anesthesiologists defines levels of sedation in a continuum, varying from minimal sedation (anxiolysis), to moderate sedation or analgesia (conscious sedation), to deep sedation or analgesia, to general anesthesia. Careful preprocedural assessment is indicated to define the ideal strategy for sedation and analgesia based on age and comorbidities, targeted arrhythmia, planned procedure, risk for airway obstruction, and patient wishes. General anesthesia ensures patient comfort that facilitates vascular and especially epicardial access, and also ensures immobility during catheter manipulation for mapping and ablation, especially for procedures of long duration. However, a major disadvantage of general anesthesia is its potential suppression of VA. Elimination of mental stress and the related changes in the autonomic tone during general anesthesia or deep sedation can potentially decrease the spontaneous manifestation of catecholamine-sensitive VA and the induction/maintenance of reentrant VT. Inhaled anesthetics that prolong action-potential duration and ventricular refractoriness (sevoflurane and isoflurane) and intravenous anesthetics that reduce sympathetic tone (dexmedetomidine) are commonly avoided for ablation procedures. Additionally, most of the anesthetic agents used for sedation and analgesia reduce myocardial contractility and systemic vascular resistance, causing hypotension that could be exacerbated during VT, requiring pharmacological or mechanical HS. Those cardiovascular effects are more intense at the anesthetic doses needed for general anesthesia, which additionally produce higher attenuation of sympathetic tone. General anesthesia or the use of cardiodepressive medications, such as propofol for anesthesia in patients with severely compromised LV function, can result in acute hemodynamic compromise during the ablation procedure, and its use needs to be carefully considered for these patients. If general anesthesia is used during epicardial ablation procedures, the concomitant use of muscle relaxants could preclude identification of the phrenic nerve during epicardial ablation. Use of a short-acting muscle relaxant during induction of anesthesia is acceptable, without redosing; however, it could necessitate a deeper level of anesthesia with resultant exaggeration of the above-mentioned hypotensive effects. Nevertheless, the effects of propofol on cardiac electrophysiological proprieties are diverse and could include arrhythmia suppression. In fact, propofol has been associated with suppression of VT and VT storm. The need for sedation and analgesia varies throughout the procedure, being higher during vascular and epicardial access and cardioversion or defibrillation. On the other hand, a more superficial level of sedation (or any) is desirable to prevent VA suppression and to assure VT induction and maintenance for mapping. Short-acting agents are considered more suitable to provide those rapid changes in the requirements of sedation level during mapping and ablation of VAs. Intravenous boli of midazolam and fentanyl at repeated doses as needed was reported by a single-center observational study as a feasible and safe strategy for minimal sedation in patients with idiopathic PVC or VT planned for shorter procedures. However, even shorter-acting sedatives such as midazolam have the potential for suppressing idiopathic VA for prolonged periods of time and need to be used with caution during procedures targeting idiopathic VAs, such as frequent PVCs. A strategy to use shorter-acting sedatives such as propofol for allowing temporary deeper sedation is frequently used initially, and if VAs are suppressed, sedation can be reduced or discontinued to allow for arrhythmias to reappear as necessary. For patients with scar-related VTs, sedatives such as midazolam, which has the additional benefit of amnesia, do not impact on inducibility of VT and can be used in conjunction with analgesics and/or other sedatives such as propofol to achieve the desired level of sedation. Continuous infusion of propofol, alone or complemented with repeated boli of fentanyl (as needed), has been proposed for deep sedation of stable patients during ablation of idiopathic or scar-related VT that are expected to have a longer duration or that require more painful and challenging techniques, such as epicardial access. Two single-center observational studies reported that this strategy can be safely performed in this subset of patients under close hemodynamic monitoring. Propofol had to be discontinued (switched to midazolam) in 11.7% of the procedures, predominantly due to hypotension presenting in elderly patients and prolonged procedural duration. Respiratory depression resulting in sustained oxygen saturation of < 90% requiring reduction of propofol and transitory mechanical maneuvers to assist ventilation was present in 1.5% of the patients in the same study.
The selection of sedation strategy for patients undergoing ablation of VAs requires a balance between the desire of assuring a comfortable and safe procedure and the need to induce the targeted arrhythmia. Proactive communication between the operator and the anesthesia team and with the patient about the patient's needs and desires, as well as the electrophysiological requirements, helps to select a sedation strategy that is in the best interest of the patient.
In the prospective arm of a large observational study, inwhich patients with sustained, monomorphic VT and SHD underwent noninvasive programmed stimulation (NIPS) under minimal sedation, followed by invasive programmed stimulation under general anesthesia using propofol or isoflurane, > 90% remained inducible under general anesthesia, although in half, a different VT was induced. General anesthesia was associated, however, with less hemodynamic stability and greater use of vasopressor support with phenylephrine, without an adverse effect on procedural outcomes. More aggressive stimulation was often required with general anesthesia than with conscious sedation. In another cohort of 25 patients referred for epicardial ablation in the setting of NICM, a strategy of initial programmed stimulation under sedation with midazolam, fentanyl, or remifentanil led to induction of tolerated VT in 15 patients, and avoidance of epicardial access (which was performed under general anesthesia) altogether occurred in 10 (40%). On the basis of the cited single-center observational studies (.) about the various sedative and analgesic strategies for ablation of VAs, it is reasonable to avoid general anesthesia and deeper levels of sedation in patients with idiopathic VAs (PVC or VT) planned for shorter procedures, particularly when the arrhythmia is suspected to be catecholamine-sensitive (typically, automatic and triggered arrhythmias) or was not inducible during a prior procedure. In these patients, a minimal sedation strategy with short-acting sedatives and analgesics, with repeated doses as needed, can be useful to ensure adequate sedation without VA suppression.
Epicardial scar-related VT mapping and ablation underdeep sedation with sufentanil or remifentanil and intermittent boli of midazolam was reported as a feasible and safe strategy in a single-center prospective series and a case report. Interestingly, no respiratory failure resulting in endotracheal intubation or prolonged periods of hypotension requiring HS were observed (except during periods of unstable VT) in these cases (combined 79 procedures in 73 patients). Importantly, this strategy allowed epicardial access with comfort, preventing the need for general anesthesia and muscle relaxants (facilitating the identification of the phrenic nerve during epicardial ablation), and providing rapid recuperation of consciousness with no recall of punctures or cardioversions. Remifentanil is an opioid with an analgosedative effect that can have advantages for ablation of VAs, including a lack of negative inotropic effect, comparatively little effect on arrhythmogenicity, time-to-peak effect of approximately 90 seconds and a half-life of 3–4 minutes. This agent is also associated with hypotension likely secondary to vasodilatation and bradycardia. Moderate to deep sedation with continuous infusion of propofol and repeated boli of fentanyl under close hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring might be considered for stable patients with ablation of idiopathic or scar-related VA with no indication for general anesthesia who are expected to undergo a procedure of longer duration or for patients who require more painful techniques, such as epicardial access. Another short-action anesthetic, such as remifentanil or sufentanil, could also be considered. Of note, patients with severe hemodynamic compromise, severe life-threatening comorbidities or acute illness, respiratory failure, high risk for airway obstruction, or who were intubated before the procedure for arrhythmia storm or cardiogenic shock were excluded in the cited studies and are also traditionally considered candidates for general anesthesia. Hospital and regulatory guidance varies widely on the training and specialization required for different levels of sedation and administration of various drugs (see Section 11).

### Breaking myths and building awareness: spinal anesthesia for cesarean section in palestine-what women know and what holds them backs-a cross-sectional study [^8155399c]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cesarean section (CS) is a surgical procedure that involves delivering one or more babies through an incision in the mother's abdomen. It stands as one of the most frequently performed surgeries globally according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and is also the most common obstetric operation emphasizing its pivotal role in modern obstetric and surgical practice. A key component of a successful CS is the administration of anesthesia, which not only provides pain relief but also contributes to overall maternal well-being during and after the procedure.

Anesthesia plays a crucial role in ensuring a safe and pain-free experience during cesarean section (CS) procedures, Both general anesthesia and regional anesthesia are commonly used techniques for this purpose. However, when considering the risks and benefits for both the mother and the fetus, regional anesthesia is generally the preferred approach. Specifically, spinal anesthesia has gained increasing preference in recent years. It offers significant advantages, particularly in reducing maternal and risks, including better hemodynamic stability and fewer complications compared to general anesthesia. Additionally, neonatal outcomes are improved, as spinal anesthesia avoids the systemic effects of general anesthesia, leading to safer conditions for the fetus. Given these advantages, females knowledge of spinal anesthesia are essential, to have a less stressful experience during the procedure.

Maternal knowledge and awareness of spinal anesthesia are critical for informed decision-making during Cesarean section procedures. When women are well-informed about the benefits, risks, and expected outcomes of spinal anesthesia, they are more likely to make decisions that align with their preferences, which can enhance their overall experience. However, without adequate knowledge, women may feel anxious or uncertain about the procedure, potentially leading to a less satisfactory experience or even the rejection of an otherwise safe method.

Women's attitudes toward the type of anesthesia are often shaped by a complex interplay of personal beliefs, cultural factors, previous experiences with medical procedures, occupational status and preoperative information. Research has shown that fear of pain or perceived risks associated with regional anesthesia may lead women to express concerns or refuse this method. in addition, fear of regional block not working, needle phobia and Fear seeing things during surgery are additional causes. These misconceptions may contribute to delayed patient presentation, potentially negatively impacting outcomes and the quality of care.

### Sedation versus general anesthesia on all-cause mortality in patients undergoing percutaneous procedures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0af6496d]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This meta-analysis was conducted according to the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and followed a protocol registered on the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42023399151).

Search strategy

Two investigators conducted an independent and comprehensive search of online databases, namely PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, with no language restrictions, to identify articles on the key terms "general anesthesia", "sedation", and "mortality". The search encompassed articles available up until February 28, 2023. In the event of any discrepancies during the literature search process, a third reviewer was consulted to facilitate a thorough discussion and reach a consensus. The specific search terms employed for each electronic database were detailed in Supplemental Table 1.

Study selection

All references identified through the implemented search strategy were exported to Endnote V.X9 (Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia, USA) and subjected to an independent evaluation by two reviewers. The initial screening involved assessing the titles and abstracts of all retrieved search results, followed by a detailed examination of the full texts of potentially relevant articles. For inclusion in this meta-analysis, studies were required to satisfy the following PICOS criteria: (1) Population: patients undergoing percutaneous procedures with either GA or sedation, (2) Intervention: sedation, encompassing various depths and drug usage, (3) Comparison intervention: GA with tracheal intubation or laryngeal mask ventilation, (4) Outcome: risk estimates of death or mortality at least one postoperative time point, and (5) Study design: RCT and cohort study. Studies that did not meet these criteria, including those with insufficient data, nonhuman studies, abstracts only, and protocols, were excluded. In instances where disputes arose regarding the eligibility of specific papers, a comprehensive discussion was held involving a third reviewer to resolve.

Exenatide delays gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. There have been rare post-marketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations.

Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking exenatide, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing exenatide could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents.

### Local versus general anaesthesia for carotid endarterectomy [^1c0032b2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Carotid endarterectomy may significantly reduce the risk of stroke in people with recently symptomatic, severe carotid artery stenosis. However, there are significant perioperative risks that may be reduced by performing the operation under local rather than general anaesthetic. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 1996, and previously updated in 2004 and 2008.

Objectives

To determine whether carotid endarterectomy under local anaesthetic: (1) reduces the risk of perioperative stroke and death compared with general anaesthetic; (2) reduces the complication rate (other than stroke) following carotid endarterectomy; and (3) is acceptable to patients and surgeons.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (September 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2013), EMBASE (1980 to September 2013) and Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings (ISTP) (1980 to September 2013). We also handsearched relevant journals, and searched the reference lists of articles identified.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing the use of local anaesthetic to general anaesthetic for carotid endarterectomy were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We calculated a pooled Peto odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for the following outcomes that occurred within 30 days of surgery: stroke, death, stroke or death, myocardial infarction, local haemorrhage, cranial nerve injuries, and shunted arteries.

Main Results

We included 14 randomised trials involving 4596 operations, of which 3526 were from the single largest trial (GALA). In general, reporting of methodology in the included studies was poor. All studies were unable to blind patients and surgical teams to randomised treatment allocation and for most studies the blinding of outcome assessors was unclear. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of stroke within 30 days of surgery between the local anaesthesia group and the general anaesthesia group. The incidence of strokes in the local anaesthesia group was 3.2% compared to 3.5% in the general anaesthesia group (Peto OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.28). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who had a stroke or died within 30 days of surgery. In the local anaesthesia group 3.6% of patients had a stroke or died compared to 4.2% of patients in the general anaesthesia group (Peto OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.16). There was a non-significant trend towards lower operative mortality with local anaesthetic. In the local anaesthesia group 0.9% of patients died within 30 days of surgery compared to 1.5% of patients in the general anaesthesia group (Peto OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.07). However, neither the GALA trial or the pooled analysis were adequately powered to reliably detect an effect on mortality.

Authors' Conclusions

The proportion of patients who had a stroke or died within 30 days of surgery did not differ significantly between the two types of anaesthetic techniques used during carotid endarterectomy. This systematic review provides evidence to suggest that patients and surgeons can choose either anaesthetic technique, depending on the clinical situation and their own preferences.

### Consensus statement on pain management for pregnant patients with opioid use disorder from the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology, Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine, and American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine [^8115015e]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Ketamine for labor analgesia — pregnant patients with opioid use disorder (OUD): Clinical trials evaluating ketamine for labor analgesia or in the peripartum period are lacking, and there are no studies examining the role of ketamine in laboring people with OUD; perioperative continuous infusion of subanesthetic intravenous ketamine has been noted to reduce opioid requirements in patients without OUD, but lactation safety and breastmilk transfer data are currently lacking. The 2016 Federal Drug Administration (FDA) Drug Safety Communication states that general anesthesia and sedation drugs (including but not limited to ketamine) used in children < 3 years of age or in pregnant people in their third trimester who are undergoing anesthesia for more than 3 hours or repeated use of anesthetics, 'may affect the development of children's brains', while the experts note exposures in pregnancy and lactation are often brief and decisions must be patient-centered with appropriate individual risk and benefit considerations. Potential conditions to avoid or exert caution with ketamine use include uncontrolled thyroid disease, uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions such as severe hypertension, or a history of hallucinations.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: pain control in surgical abortion part 2-moderate sedation, deep sedation, and general anesthesia [^63fe6367]. Contraception (2021). High credibility.

Sedation, monitoring, and anesthesia — clinical recommendations (GRADE): A combination of intravenous fentanyl and midazolam is effective in reducing pain associated with first-trimester surgical abortion (GRADE 1B). The ventilatory function of patients receiving sedation and analgesia "should be continually monitored by observation or auscultation" (GRADE 1C). The ASA classification system "can be used as a guide to assess a patient's procedure-related risk" (GRADE 2C). "Supplemental oxygen should be used to decrease the frequency of hypoxia", with its use "considered when administering moderate sedation and recommended when administering deep sedation unless specifically contraindicated for a particular patient" (GRADE 1C). "Low-risk patients undergoing surgical abortion in the first and second trimester may safely receive moderate or deep sedation without routine endotracheal intubation" (GRADE 1B). Consensus-based guidance adds that "General anesthesia for dilation and evacuation is commonly administered with a propofol infusion and an opioid" and that "Several factors may influence the decision of whether a patient is an appropriate candidate for out-of-hospital anesthesia… " (both GRADE 1C).

### The third American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine practice advisory on local anesthetic systemic toxicity: executive summary 2017 [^38a32ca9]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) practice advisory — limitations and scope are explicitly qualified: Readers are reminded that practice advisories "are created when data on a subject are limited or non-existent". Such advisories "rely on limited clinical and animal data and, as such, the synthesis and interpretation of data by one group of experts may differ from conclusions by another set of equally qualified experts". Consequently, "practice advisories represent a level of recommendation less than that offered by standards or clinical practice guidelines". The document states, "The recommendations contained herein do not define standard of care" and "They are not intended to replace clinical judgment as applied to a specific patient scenario". These recommendations are "intended to encourage optimal patient care, but cannot ensure the avoidance of adverse outcomes" and, "as with any practice advisory recommendation, these are subject to revision as knowledge of specific complications advances".

### Anaesthesia in the prone position [^d92b0ff8]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Prone positioning of patients during anaesthesia is required to provide operative access for a wide variety of surgical procedures. It is associated with predictable changes in physiology but also with a number of complications, and safe use of the prone position requires an understanding of both issues. We have reviewed the development of the prone position and its variants and the physiological changes which occur on prone positioning. The complications associated with this position and the published techniques for various practical procedures in this position will be discussed. The aim of this review is to identify the risks associated with prone positioning and how these risks may be anticipated and minimized.

### Medication safety in the operating room: literature and expert-based recommendations [^434811c7]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Human error poses significant risk for hospitalized patients causing an estimated 100,000 to 400,000 deaths in the USA annually. Medication errors contribute, with error occurring in 5.3% of medication administrations during surgery. In this study 70.3% of medication errors were deemed preventable. Given the paucity of randomized controlled studies, we undertook a rigorous review of the literature to identify recommendations supported by expert opinions. An extensive literature search pertaining to medication error, medication safety, operating room, and anaesthesia was performed. The National Guidelines Clearinghouse was searched for any anaesthesia or operating room medication safety guidelines. A total of 74 articles were included. Recommendations were tabulated and assigned points based on a scale revised from a prior study. A total of 138 unique recommendations were identified, with point tallies ranging from 4 to 190. An in-person focus meeting occurred, where the 138 recommendations were reviewed, combined and condensed. A modified Delphi process was used to eliminate items found to be unimportant or those unable to be quantified (e.g. "minimize fatigue"). A total of 35 specific recommendations remained. Adverse events as a result of medication errors occur frequently in the operative setting. There are few rigorous studies to direct medication safety strategies, but this should not lead us to do nothing. The overwhelming consensus regarding best practices should be accepted, and the recommendations implemented. Our list of recommended strategies can hopefully be used to assess local vulnerabilities and institute system solutions.

### Practice advisory for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of infectious complications associated with neuraxial techniques: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on infectious complications associated with neuraxial techniques and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine [^c836bd12]. Anesthesiology (2017). Medium credibility.

ASA/ASRA practice advisory — prevention of infectious complications associated with neuraxial techniques states that for preoperative evaluation, "A history and physical examination relevant to the procedure and review of relevant laboratory studies should be conducted# to identify patients who may be at risk of infectious complications before performing neuraxial techniques", with the caveat that "# Ordering, conducting, or requiring routine laboratory studies may not be necessary". It further advises: "Consider alternatives to neuraxial techniques for patients at high risk".

### Diprivan [^8ac9f813]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Most adult ICU patients recovering from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation will require maintenance rates of 5 to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 to 3 mg/kg/h) individualized and titrated to clinical response (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). With medical ICU patients or patients who have recovered from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation, the rate of administration of 50 mcg/kg/min or higher may be required to achieve adequate sedation. These higher rates of administration may increase the likelihood of patients developing hypotension. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS).

Dosage and rate of administration should be individualized and titrated to the desired effect, according to clinically relevant factors including the patient's underlying medical problems, preinduction and concomitant medications, age, ASA-PS classification, and level of debilitation of the patient. The elderly, debilitated, and ASA-PS III or IV patients may have exaggerated hemodynamic and respiratory responses to rapid bolus doses (see WARNINGS).

DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be individualized according to the patient's condition and response, blood lipid profile, and vital signs (see PRECAUTIONS, Intensive Care Unit Sedation). For intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation should be initiated slowly with a continuous infusion in order to titrate to desired clinical effect and minimize hypotension. When indicated, initiation of sedation should begin at 5 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h). The infusion rate should be increased by increments of 5 to 10 mcg/kg/min (0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg/h) until the desired level of sedation is achieved. A minimum period of 5 minutes between adjustments should be allowed for onset of peak drug effect. Most adult patients require maintenance rates of 5 to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 to 3 mg/kg/h) or higher. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS. Dosages of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be reduced in patients who have received large dosages of narcotics. Conversely, the DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion dosage requirement may be reduced by adequate management of pain with analgesic agents. As with other sedative medications, there is interpatient variability in dosage requirements, and these requirements may change with time (see SUMMARY OF DOSAGE GUIDLINES). Evaluation of level of sedation and assessment of cns function should be carried out daily throughout maintenance to determine the minimum dose of DIPRIVAN required for sedation (see Clinical Trials, Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Bolus administration of 10 or 20 mg should only be used to rapidly increase depth of sedation in patients where hypotension is not likely to occur. Patients with compromised myocardial function, intravascular volume depletion, or abnormally low vascular tone (e.g., sepsis) may be more susceptible to hypotension (see PRECAUTIONS).

### Practice guidelines for obstetric anesthesia: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on obstetric anesthesia and the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology [^d42386bb]. Anesthesiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Appendix 3: Overview of anesthetic care for labor and delivery — context (not recommendations): Not all women require anesthetic care during labor or delivery, and maternal request represents sufficient justification for pain relief. When sufficient resources are available, neuraxial catheter techniques should be one of the analgesic options offered, and the choice of a specific neuraxial technique should be individualized and based on anesthetic risk factors, obstetric risk factors, patient preferences, progress of labor, and resources at the facility. When neuraxial techniques are used for analgesia during labor or vaginal delivery, the primary goal is to provide an adequate maternal analgesia with minimal motor block (e.g., achieved with the administration of local anesthetics at low concentrations with or without opioids). When a neuraxial technique is chosen, appropriate resources for the treatment of complications should be available; if an opioid is added, treatments for related complications should be available. An IV infusion should be established before the initiation of neuraxial analgesia or general anesthesia and maintained throughout the duration of the neuraxial analgesic or anesthetic; however, administration of a fixed volume of IV fluid is not required before neuraxial analgesia is initiated. The information in this appendix is intended to provide overview and context for issues concerned with anesthetic care for labor and delivery and are not guideline recommendations.

### Bupivacaine (Exparel) [^65b4f1ba]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

There are no studies conducted with EXPAREL in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, embryo-fetal deaths were observed with subcutaneous administration of bupivacaine to rabbits during organogenesis at a dose equivalent to 1.6 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 266 mg. Subcutaneous administration of bupivacaine to rats from implantation through weaning produced decreased pup survival at a dose equivalent to 1.5 times the MRHD [see Data]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risks to a fetus.

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2–4% and of miscarriage is 15–20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.

Clinical Considerations

Labor or Delivery

Bupivacaine is contraindicated for obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia. While EXPAREL has not been studied with this technique, the use of bupivacaine for obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia has resulted in fetal bradycardia and death.

Bupivacaine can rapidly cross the placenta, and when used for epidural, caudal, or pudendal block anesthesia, can cause varying degrees of maternal, fetal, and neonatal toxicity [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The incidence and degree of toxicity depend upon the procedure performed, the type, and amount of drug used, and the technique of drug administration. Adverse reactions in the parturient, fetus, and neonate involve alterations of the central nervous system, peripheral vascular tone, and cardiac function.

### The third American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine practice advisory on local anesthetic systemic toxicity: executive summary 2017 [^e2593a7d]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) practice advisory — classification of recommendations and levels of evidence are defined and justified as follows: Because "There are no randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating human LAST; future RCTs are unlikely", "the panel's recommendations are based on a modified Classification of Recommendations and Levels of Evidence schema that was developed by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association". The advisory emphasizes that "assigning a level of evidence B or C should not be construed as implying that the associated recommendation is supported by conflicting data or is limited by conflicting interpretations of the available data". Table definitions are: Class I "Conditions for which there is evidence and/or general agreement that a given procedure or treatment is useful and effective"; Class II "Conditions for which there is conflicting evidence and/or a divergence of opinion about the usefulness/efficacy of a procedure or treatment", with IIa "Weight of evidence/opinion is in favor of usefulness/efficacy" and IIb "Usefulness/efficacy is less well established by evidence/opinion"; and Class III "Conditions for which there is evidence and/or general agreement that the procedure/treatment is not useful/effective, and in some cases may be harmful". Levels of evidence are "Level A Data derived from RCTs", "Level B Data derived from nonrandomized or laboratory, animal, studies; supported by multiple case reports or case series", and "Level C Consensus opinion of experts".

### An international multidisciplinary consensus statement on fasting before procedural sedation in adults and children [^ff7cdfe2]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

We attained 'strong consensus' on all statement elements (see also Supporting Information, Table S1).

Question 1: Is there a difference in the incidence and outcome of pulmonary aspiration events between patients who receive general anaesthesia and those who undergo procedural sedation, and are the associated risks different between the two?

There are theoretical and practical reasons why the risk of aspiration during sedation is almost certainly lower than that during general anaesthesia. First, unconsciousness without response to painful stimuli is not a targeted endpoint in either 'moderate' 6, 7, 11, 16, 17 or 'deep' 6, 7, 11, 16, 17 sedation. Although non‐responsiveness is typical with ketamine, this unique dissociative state helps maintain protective airway reflexes, and aspiration has not been previously reported with ketamine monotherapy except in compromised neonates 20, 21. Accordingly, protective airway reflexes should be more consistently retained with moderate, deep and dissociative sedation than during general anaesthesia, in which complete or substantial loss of protective airway reflexes is implicit. Second, most elective sedations are performed on patients who are generally healthy in spite of their active procedural indication. Greater patient comorbidities have been identified as a risk factor for aspiration in both adults 22, 23, 24 and children 25, 26. In many or most settings, ASA physical status 3 and 4 patients often receive anaesthesia when possible. Third, aspiration during general anaesthesia most frequently occurs during airway manoeuvres such as tracheal intubation and extubation, use of muscle relaxants and following positive pressure bag/mask ventilation which can cause gas insufflation of the stomach 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37. Such high‐risk events are less relevant to procedural sedation, where they only occur as part of rescue for significant airway or respiratory adverse events. Fourth, most procedures performed under sedation are relatively brief, which results in less time for aspiration risk. Finally, inhalational anaesthetics can be emetogenic, with nausea and vomiting common during post‐anaesthesia recovery. Most procedural sedation is performed without inhalational agents and with a substantially lower frequency of emesis. The commonly used sedative, propofol, is anti‐emetic 38.

### 2025 American society of anesthesiologists practice advisory for perioperative care of older adults scheduled for inpatient surgery [^98d180e2]. Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

Neuraxial versus general anesthesia — complications showed a lack of convincing evidence supporting regional anesthesia to general anesthesia across complications (no strength of evidence greater than low); pooled randomized clinical trial results were inconclusive for lower risk of myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest due to limitations in study-level risk of bias, inconsistency of effects, and imprecision; stroke was reported in three randomized clinical trials with no difference between techniques; pooled analyses concerning renal complications seems to favor neuraxial anesthesia but was influenced by data from one large randomized clinical trial; evidence shows lower relative but not absolute risk for pneumonia with neuraxial anesthesia but few events were observed; and evidence for pulmonary embolism was inconclusive and limited by study risk of bias and imprecision for low event rates.

### Placenta praevia and placenta accreta: diagnosis and management: green-top guideline no. 27a [^94bc08d9]. BJOG (2019). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for placenta previa, more specifically with respect to regional anesthesia, RCOG 2019 guidelines recommend to prefer regional anesthesia over general anesthesia for Cesarean delivery in patients with placenta previa or a low-lying placenta, given its lower risks of hemorrhage. Inform patients with anterior placenta previa or a low-lying placenta that it may be necessary to convert to general anesthesia if required and ask to consent.

### Consensus guidelines for the perioperative management of patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [^32286a68]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Deep sedation without tracheal intubation (monitored anaesthesia care) and general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation are commonly used anaesthesia techniques for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). There are distinct pathophysiological differences between monitored anaesthesia care and general anaesthesia that need to be considered depending on the nature and severity of the patient's underlying disease, comorbidities, and procedural risks. An international group of expert anaesthesiologists and gastroenterologists created clinically relevant questions regarding the merits and risks of monitored anaesthesia care vs general anaesthesia in specific clinical scenarios for planning optimal anaesthetic approaches for ERCP. Using a modified Delphi approach, the group created practical recommendations for anaesthesiologists, with the aim of reducing the incidence of perioperative adverse outcomes while maximising healthcare resource utilisation. In the majority of clinical scenarios analysed, our expert recommendations favour monitored anaesthesia care over general anaesthesia. Patients with increased risk of pulmonary aspiration and those undergoing prolonged procedures of high complexity were thought to benefit from general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation. Patient age and ASA physical status were not considered to be factors for choosing between monitored anaesthesia care and general anaesthesia. Monitored anaesthesia care is the favoured anaesthesia plan for ERCP. An individual risk-benefit analysis that takes into account provider and institutional experience, patient comorbidities, and procedural risks is also needed.

### An international multidisciplinary consensus statement on fasting before procedural sedation in adults and children [^9dbe26c0]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 6: Are there barriers to the development of fasting recommendations for procedural sedation that differ from existing guidelines designed for general anaesthesia?

The evidence relating to general anaesthesia is presented in the online Supplementary Material. Similar barriers exist to procedural sedation practitioners who desire, based on evidence previously discussed, to deviate from fasting guidelines stipulated for anaesthesia. Despite the differences between sedation and anaesthesia and the compelling evidence and basis for differential aspiration risk, in the past it has been near‐universal to specify identical fasting precautions for both 1, 4, 6, 7, 16, 17. Given these many decades of precedent and an unwillingness for institutions to appear to be 'breaking the rules', individual clinicians are likely to be challenged and could face censure if applying the evidence contrary to existing guidelines.

The algorithm we designed to support our recommendations (Fig. 1) summarises the approach we advocate. In this flow chart, each patient is risk stratified during their pre‐sedation assessment using evidence‐based factors relating to patient characteristics, comorbidities, the nature of the procedure and the nature of the anticipated sedation technique. For elective procedures, graded fasting precautions for liquids and solids are then recommended based upon this assessment of negligible, mild or moderate aspiration risk. We did not include a high‐risk category, because even with the most notable risk factors, the evidence suggests that aspiration remains uncommon.

### Optimal perioperative management of the geriatric patient: a best practices guideline from the American college of surgeons NSQIP and the American Geriatrics Society [^12821e24]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2016). Medium credibility.

Regional techniques for anesthesia in the older adult — scope and evidence: Regional anesthesia refers to nerve blockade with local anesthetic medications, including "neuraxial" blocks with injection into the epidural or subarachnoid ("spinal anesthesia") space and peripheral nerve blocks such as the femoral nerve or the brachial plexus, and may be used as a primary anesthetic modality (typically combined with intravenous sedation) or combined with general anesthesia as an adjunctive modality to enhance intraoperative and postoperative pain relief; definitive evidence does not exist establishing the superiority of regional anesthesia compared with general anesthesia when used as a primary modality for surgical anesthesia in older adults, and although a recent Cochrane review suggests there may be benefits in certain patient groups, this issue remains controversial due to study quality and lack of consideration of neuraxial blockade risks, so determining the planned primary anesthetic technique should occur in a multidisciplinary fashion involving the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and, whenever possible, the geriatrician.
