## Question

Significance of elevated free light chains with normal protein electrophoresis and normal ratio

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage an incidental finding of mildly elevated serum free light chains with a normal kappa/lambda ratio and a normal serum protein electrophoresis, and what the risk of progression to hematologic malignancy is in this scenario. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a normal ratio with elevated absolute FLCs implies biologically. Then, I should verify the malignancy risk from population data. Next, I will review confounders that can cause polyclonal FLC elevation, especially renal function and inflammation. After that, I need to check assay and reporting considerations that can mislead interpretation. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, guideline-aligned follow-up plan and counseling message, making sure I double-check thresholds and intervals before concluding [^113UPp1Z] [^115SXdT5].

> Let me first confirm the pattern: symmetrically elevated kappa and lambda with a normal ratio and a negative SPEP typically reflects polyclonal B‑cell/plasma cell activation rather than a clonal plasma cell disorder, because monoclonality would usually skew the kappa/lambda ratio outside 0.26–1.65 and often produce a visible M‑spike on SPEP or immunofixation, which we do not see here [^111Pwfei] [^117PMyJ3].

> Wait, let me verify the malignancy risk signal in this exact phenotype. A population-based analysis of 1,012 patients with normal baseline FLCs and 760 with mildly elevated FLCs but normal ratio found that the latter group had significantly lower malignancy-free survival, indicating a small but real increase in risk over time, with a hazard ratio around 1.5–2.0 after matching, though absolute annual risk remains low in most cohorts [^115Sag9o]. I should also note that polyclonal FLC elevation has been associated with a higher future risk of developing MGUS in longitudinal community cohorts, supporting a link between immune activation and later clonal emergence, albeit with modest absolute risk [^11224GQG] [^117TUU1Q].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check for common non-malignant drivers of polyclonal FLC elevation. Renal function is paramount: even mild CKD reduces FLC clearance and can raise both chains symmetrically; using CKD‑adjusted ratio ranges (for example, 0.37–3.10 in eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) helps avoid false alarms, and age‑adjusted reference intervals further reduce overdiagnosis, especially in older adults [^112QpPFP] [^111GEFTK] [^116VLG6f]. I should also consider chronic inflammation, autoimmune disease, chronic infections, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia states such as IgG4‑related disease, all of which can elevate FLCs without clonality, so I need to ensure the clinical context is reviewed carefully [^1114vrLW] [^112Nru9g].

> I need to ensure the laboratory interpretation is sound. Let me first confirm that both quantitative kappa and lambda and the calculated ratio were reported, because best practice is to report all three to avoid misclassification; then I should double-check for analytical pitfalls like antigen excess, which can artifactually lower one chain and distort the ratio, prompting dilution and repeat testing if clinical suspicion is high and results are discordant with SPEP/IFE [^11444d7T] [^113b27Hg] [^117NLjoq]. But wait, what if the lab is using outdated reference intervals? Recent large cohort data show that standard FLC reference intervals overcall κ‑type LC‑MGUS and undercall λ‑type disease; revised age‑ and kidney‑aware intervals substantially reduce false positives without missing progressors, so I should interpret results in light of these contemporary ranges when available [^116VLG6f] [^115zBrxX].

> Next, I should review the immediate work‑up. I will now examine a CBC, calcium, creatinine/eGFR, and urinalysis to screen for myeloma-defining events or renal involvement, and I should confirm that serum immunofixation was performed alongside SPEP because guidelines recommend SPEP plus sFLC for initial detection, with IFE as needed to characterize any M‑protein; if the clinical picture suggests AL amyloidosis, I should add a 24‑hour urine protein and consider cardiac biomarkers and imaging, given the high sensitivity of combined SPEP/IFE/sFLC for detecting monoclonal proteins in that setting [^113UPp1Z] [^115SXdT5] [^113GBni6] [^111Pwfei].

> Let me think about longitudinal management. If baseline evaluation is unrevealing and there are no red flags, repeating FLCs in 6–12 months is reasonable; if stable, spacing to yearly is acceptable, with closer intervals if values rise or clinical features evolve. I should confirm that any new ratio abnormality or evolving asymmetry prompts reactivation of the work‑up, including IFE and consideration of bone marrow evaluation if clinical risk is high or progression is suspected, aligning with MGUS follow‑up principles and risk stratification models that incorporate FLC ratio and M‑protein features [^116SarbZ] [^117PMyJ3].

> I should double-check my counseling message. The absolute risk of progression from this polyclonal, ratio‑normal phenotype is low but not zero; the relative risk is modestly elevated compared with those with completely normal FLCs, so vigilance is warranted without alarm. Emphasizing modifiable contributors such as optimizing renal health, managing inflammatory comorbidities, and avoiding unnecessary invasive testing unless indicated helps frame expectations and reduces overdiagnosis, especially as contemporary reference intervals already mitigate false positives [^115Sag9o] [^116VLG6f].

> In summary, mildly elevated free light chains with a normal kappa/lambda ratio and a normal SPEP most often reflect polyclonal immune activation rather than a clonal plasma cell disorder; there is a small increase in future malignancy risk that justifies periodic surveillance and attention to reversible drivers, but not immediate invasive therapy. I need to ensure renal function and age‑appropriate reference intervals are applied, verify assay integrity, and follow guideline‑based initial testing and interval follow‑up to balance early detection with avoidance of overdiagnosis [^113UPp1Z] [^112QpPFP] [^116VLG6f].

An isolated elevation in free light chains with a normal κ/λ ratio and normal SPEP/IFE is most often due to **polyclonal B-cell activation** [^112L9erX] from chronic inflammation, infection, or autoimmunity, and is not by itself diagnostic of a clonal plasma cell disorder [^111Pwfei]. This pattern carries a **low malignancy risk** but warrants **clinical correlation** and periodic reassessment if persistent or rising [^115Sag9o]. If unexplained or progressive, consider urine studies, renal function assessment, and hematology referral; **routine bone marrow biopsy is not indicated** without additional evidence of clonality or organ damage [^116bkfsy].

## Clinical significance of elevated free light chains with normal ratio

- **Polyclonal B-cell activation**: Symmetric elevation of κ and λ with a normal ratio typically reflects polyclonal plasma cell activation from chronic inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease [^112L9erX] [^111Pwfei].

- **Low malignancy risk**: This pattern is not diagnostic of MGUS, multiple myeloma, or related disorders, which require a clonal process with an abnormal κ/λ ratio or a detectable M-protein [^111Pwfei] [^1129zqXW].

- **Prognostic implications**: Persistent polyclonal FLC elevation may signal higher future risk of monoclonal gammopathies, but the absolute risk remains low and progression is uncommon [^11224GQG].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Initial evaluation**: Confirm results with repeat FLC testing, SPEP, and IFE; assess renal function (eGFR) and screen for inflammation/infection [^113PhT6r] [^115cW2DQ].

- **Follow-up**: If stable and no clonal markers, observe with periodic FLC and clinical review; if rising or new abnormalities, escalate evaluation [^115yu5ts].

- **Additional testing**: Consider urine IFE, renal imaging, or hematology referral if unexplained elevation persists or progresses [^113GBni6].

- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Not indicated without evidence of clonality, organ damage, or progression [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic implications and risk of progression

Risk of progression is **low**, as polyclonal FLC elevation with a normal ratio is not a precursor to MGUS or multiple myeloma [^1129zqXW]. Monitoring should include **periodic reassessment** of FLC and clinical status; persistent or rising elevation merits closer follow-up and targeted evaluation [^116bkfsy].

---

## Clinical management and follow-up

- **Identify and treat underlying causes**: Address inflammation, infection, or autoimmunity to reduce polyclonal FLC production [^112L9erX].

- **Monitor periodically**: Repeat FLC, SPEP, and IFE every 6–12 months if stable; shorten intervals if values rise or clinical status changes [^notfound].

- **Escalate evaluation**: If clonal markers appear, organ damage emerges, or FLC levels increase substantially, pursue hematology referral and disease-specific workup [^111GEFTK].

---

An isolated elevation in free light chains with a normal κ/λ ratio and normal SPEP/IFE most often reflects **polyclonal activation** [^112L9erX] and carries a low malignancy risk. Management centers on identifying underlying causes, periodic monitoring, and selective additional testing if results change or suspicion for clonal disease rises [^notfound].

Box 1 An example consult request with a summary of analysis and results produced by our service

Consult request: Do patients who have a first-time mildly elevated kappa or lambda free light chains go on to develop malignancy?

Question formulation: Patients who have an incidental mildly elevated first free light chain test result are patients 18 or older, with no history of hematologic malignancy, with a first kappa free light chain test result between 2.1 and 5.0 (inclusive) or a lambda free light chain test result between 2.7 and 5.0 (inclusive), a normal free light chain ratio test result, and a normal serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) test result (if any) within 30 days on either side of their free light chain test. Patients with a normal first free light chain test result are patients 18 or older, with no history of malignancy, with a normal free light chain ratio test result, a kappa free light chain test result between 0.3 and 2.0 (inclusive) and a lambda free light chain test result between 0.6 and 2.6 (inclusive). A normal free light chain ratio test result is between 0.3 and 1.6 (inclusive). Hematologic malignancy is defined as any of ICD9 200–209, ICD9 238.6, ICD9 238.7, ICD10 C81-C96 or ICD10 D47. The outcome of interest is time to first hematologic malignancy.

Analysis type: Survival analysis with right-censoring to account for differences in follow-up time among patients, and using three choices of matching algorithms to restrict analysis to similar patients.

Results: Our analysis identified 1012 patients whose first serum free light chains were normal, and 760 whose first serum free light chains were mildly elevated despite having a normal ratio. The cohort with mildly elevated light chains had significantly lower malignancy-free survival (p < 0.001). This finding held true when using propensity score matching to control for confounding by observable patient characteristics (age, sex, previous diagnoses, treatments, et cetera).

### Serum free light chain assay and κ / λ ratio performance in patients without monoclonal gammopathies: high false-positive rate [^112nU6XA]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Serum free light chain assay is a recommended screening test for monoclonal gammopathies. Anecdotal observations indicated a high rate of false-positive abnormal κ/λ ratios. This study was undertaken to ascertain the magnitude of the false-positive rate and factors contributing to the error rate.

Methods

Results of serum protein electrophoresis, serum free light chains, and related tests, usually done for investigation of suspected monoclonal gammopathy, were reviewed retrospectively for 270 patients and 297 observations.

Results

Using the conventional κ/λ ratio, 36.4% of the ratios were abnormal, in the absence of monoclonal gammopathy. When the renal κ/λ ratio was used, the rate of abnormal κ/λ ratios was 30.1%. In patients with a γ-globulin concentration of1.6g/dL or more, the usual κ/λ ratio was abnormal in 54.8% of the patients. Urine protein electrophoresis was used in 53 (19.6%) instances, whereas bone marrow examination was done in 65 (24.1%) cases.

Conclusions

Usual κ/λ ratio was abnormal in 36.4% of the observations in patients without evidence of monoclonal gammopathy, and an abnormal κ/λ ratio should not be used as the sole indicator for diagnosis of neoplastic proliferation of the lympho-plasmacytic system. Hypergammaglobulinemia is associated with a higher rate of false-positive abnormal κ/λ ratios. Examination of urine for monoclonal immunoglobulins may be underused, and recommendations by some to use serum free light chain assay in place of, rather than as an adjunct to, urine electrophoresis are not warranted.

### Monoclonal and polyclonal serum free light chains and clinical outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^116btGiE]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Free light chains (FLCs) are the most commonly detected paraproteins in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We examined the types of FLC abnormalities and prognostic utility of the FLC assay compared with standard prognostic biomarkers in a prospective cohort of 339 patients with newly diagnosed CLL. Three types of FLC abnormalities were identified: monoclonal elevated FLC (elevated κ and/or λ with abnormal FLC ratio), polyclonal elevated FLC (elevated κ and/or λ with normal FLC ratio), and ratio-only FLC abnormality (normal range κ and λ with abnormal FLC ratio). One hundred sixty-five patients (49%) had a FLC abnormality with approximately equal distribution among monoclonal elevation, polyclonal elevation, and ratio-only abnormality. All FLC abnormalities were associated with poor time to first treatment: monoclonal FLC (hazard ratio [HR], 4.99; 95% confidence interval, 2.94–8.48), polyclonal FLC (HR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.24–4.64), ratio-only FLC (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.40–4.69). Monoclonal FLC and polyclonal FLC were associated with poor overall survival compared with patients with normal FLC. Results remained significant after adjusting for Rai stage. The FLC assay is a simple, widely available clinical test with similar prognostic utility as routinely used prognostic biomarkers for CLL. Among persons with FLC abnormalities, the type of abnormality affects prognostic significance.

### Polyclonal serum free light chain elevation is associated with increased risk of monoclonal gammopathies [^112L9erX]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Plasma cells, normal as well as clonal, secrete small amounts of kappa or lambda free light chains and these are quickly eliminated by the kidneys resulting in relatively low levels of circulating serum free light chains. However, in the presence of clonal plasma cells as with MGUS or MM, there is excess production of one or other light chain leading to a skewed ratio between the two light chains, as well as overall increased levels. An abnormal serum free light ratio becomes more common along the spectrum of disease progression from MGUS to SMM and finally to active MM. A polyclonal elevation of both kappa and lambda serum free light chain can be observed in many individuals, not resulting in an abnormal FLC ratio, the etiology of which is not clear. It has been observed in the context of immune activation as it can occur with chronic infections and inflammatory states.

We hypothesized that a polyclonal increase in serum free light chain may help to identify individuals at higher risk of developing a monoclonal gammopathy. We undertook this study in a population-based cohort who have been previously examined for the prevalence of MGUS to ascertain if increased polyclonal FLC levels were associated with an increase in the risk of MGUS and related disorders including smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), multiple myeloma (MM), or light chain amyloidosis.

Ethics approval and consent to participate

The study was approved by the Icelandic National Bioethics Committee (no. 16–022, 26 April 2016) and by the Icelandic Data Protection Agency. All participants provided signed informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Study design

The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase included individuals who tested positive for LC monoclonal gammopathy (MG) by screening and had BM sample collected for flow cytometry analysis of PC. The flow cytometry analysis was used to determine the presence or absence of clonal PC and their detection status was correlated with clinical features and evaluated for concordance with the revised definition of LC-MGUS. Additionally, the detection status of clonal PC was correlated with the FLC ratio in paired samples, aimed to establish an optimal FLC ratio threshold to effectively differentiate between individuals with and without underlying clonal PC population in the BM. Due to the high rate of clonal PC detection in samples from individuals with lambda-involved FLC ratio, which limited the ability to establish a clear relationship between the two variables for those samples, this threshold was confined to individuals with kappa-involved FLC ratio.

The second phase focused on the clinical implication of the established FLC ratio threshold and was limited to individuals with LC-MGUS who were actively monitored for progressive disease as part of the iStopMM randomized trial of follow-up strategies (Arms 2 and 3). This phase included two analyses that stratified individuals according to the FLC ratio threshold at screening: First, a longitudinal assessment of FLC ratio evolvement as an indicator of progressive disease; and second, assessing the incidence of more advanced PCD during follow-up. The overall design of the study is presented in Fig. 1.

### Serum free light chain ratio is an independent risk factor for progression in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^111kTuJq]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that the presence of monoclonal free kappa or lambda immunoglobulin light chains in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), as detected by the serum free light chain (FLC) assay increases the risk of progression to malignancy. Of 1384 patients with MGUS from Southeastern Minnesota seen at the Mayo Clinic from 1960 to 1994, baseline serum samples obtained within 30 days of diagnosis were available in 1148. At a median follow-up of 15 years, malignant progression had occurred in 87 (7.6%) patients. An abnormal FLC ratio (kappa-lambda ratio < 0.26 or > 1.65) was detected in 379 (33%) patients. The risk of progression in patients with an abnormal FLC ratio was significantly higher compared with patients with a normal ratio (hazard ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.3–5.5; P < .001) and was independent of the size and type of the serum monoclonal (M) protein. Patients with an abnormal serum FLC ratio, non-immunoglobulin G (non-IgG) MGUS, and a high serum M protein level (≥ 15 g/L) had a risk of progression at 20 years of 58% (high-risk MGUS) versus 37% with any 2 of these risk factors (high-intermediate risk), 21% with one risk factor (low-intermediate risk), and 5% when none of the risk factors were present (low risk).

### Serum free light-chain measurements for identifying and monitoring patients with nonsecretory multiple myeloma [^112fxGsM]. Blood (2001). Low credibility.

Using sensitive, automated immunoassays, increased concentrations of either kappa or lambda free light chains (and abnormal kappa/lambda ratios) were detected in the sera of 19 of 28 patients with nonsecretory multiple myeloma. Four other patients had suppression of one or both light chains, and the remaining 5 sera had normal or raised free light-chain concentrations with substantially normal kappa/lambda ratios. Six of the patients with an elevated single free light chain, who were studied during follow-up, had changes in disease activity that were reflected by the changes in free light-chain concentrations. It is concluded that quantification of free light chains in serum should prove useful for the diagnosis and monitoring of many patients with nonsecretory myeloma.

INTRODUCTION

Monoclonal gammopathies comprise a spectrum of disorders that range from asymptomatic monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis. The more advanced of these conditions are typically characterized by overproduction of clonal immunoglobulins that may be identified as intact immunoglobulins (immunoglobulin G [IgG], IgA, IgM, IgD, or IgE linked to κ or λ light chains), or free κ or λ light chain molecules without accompanying heavy chains. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis (PE), immunofixation, and serum free light chain (SFLC) assays are used clinically to identify and quantify disease burden, and they provide critical information for patient screening, diagnosis, and treatment response assessment.

For many years following initial US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2001, the Freelite assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was the sole method for clinical measurement of SFLC. This quantitative assay employs polyclonal antisera to detect κ and λ light chain epitopes that are exposed when light chains are not bound to heavy chains. The manufacturer-recommended normal reference intervals used data from a study published in 2002 and included 100% of the FLC results from 282 healthy donors: 0.33 to 1.94 mg/dL for κ FLC (KFLC), 0.57 to 2.63 mg/dL for λ FLC (LFLC), and 0.26 to 1.65 for the κ/λ ratio (KLR). Inclusion of all values from this healthy cohort yielded "diagnostic ranges" that were wider than typical reference intervals, which typically include only the central 95% of values from a healthy population. As the manufacturer continues to promote these diagnostic ranges as the recommended normal reference interval, we refer to them in this report as "manufacturer-recommended reference intervals". It is standard practice for these intervals to be verified in individual clinical laboratories in accordance with College of American Pathology guidelines.

### Are renal reference intervals required when screening for plasma cell disorders with serum free light chains and serum protein electrophoresis? [^116oz8hL]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Renal impairment and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia may abnormally increase the serum free light chain (sFLC) ratio, giving false-positive results with current reference intervals. We measured sFLCs with concomitant serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) in 281 patients. Results were interpreted relative to renal function (serum creatinine concentrations) and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Overall, 78 plasma cell disorders (PCDs) were detected with the serum panel of SPEP/sFLC vs 76 with SPEP/UPEP. In 13 samples with negative SPEP/UPEP, mildly increased ratios up to 3.1 (normal, 0.26–1.65) were observed: 10 were associated with increased serum creatinine and 1 with polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia; 2 were unassociated with either condition. In 2 samples, decreased kappa/lambda ratios were identified that were clinically significant despite normal SPEP/UPEP. Two monoclonal gammopathies were identified with UPEP and sFLC, but samples were normal with SPEP. Screening for PCDs with a serum panel consisting of SPEP and the sFLC assays is a highly sensitive approach that could eliminate the need for UPEP. A mildly increased kappa/lambda ratio up to 3.1 was observed with increased serum creatinine and/or polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia that was consistent with pathophysiologic changes, and, therefore, renal reference intervals are recommended.

### The relationship between the serum free light chain assay and serum immunofixation electrophoresis, and the definition of concordant and discordant free light chain ratios [^111TVokN]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

"Stringent" complete remission in myeloma has been defined by a normal serum free light chain ratio (SFLCR) in addition to the standard criteria for CR. 2648 serial samples from 122 IgG or IgA myeloma patients were studied to explore the relationship between SFLCR and serum immunofixation electrophoresis (SIFE). SFLCR was normal in 34% of cases with positive SIFE and abnormal in 66%. SFLCR was normal in 69% of cases with negative SIFE and abnormal in 31%. When evaluated with SIFE as the benchmark, the sensitivity of SFLCR was 66% and specificity was 69%. These findings were unchanged when abnormal SFLCR values were classified as concordant (< 0.26 for lambda disease and > 1.65 for kappa) or discordant (< 0.26 for kappa disease and > 1.65 for lambda). Additional studies are required to determine the temporal relationship between SFLCR normalization and paraprotein clearance. Until then, the role of SFLCR in defining response remains controversial.

### Presence of monoclonal free light chains in the serum predicts risk of progression in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^113uFJCP]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that the presence of monoclonal free light chains (FLC) in the serum of patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a marker of clonal evolution and a risk factor for progression. Forty-seven patients with MGUS and documented progression to myeloma or related malignancy were compared with 50 age- and gender-matched patients with MGUS and no evidence of progression after 5 or more years of follow-up. The presence of an abnormal kappa/lambda FLC ratio in the serum was associated with a higher risk of MGUS progression (relative risk 2.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.6–4.0; P < 0.001).

### Serum free light chain analysis [^114dVV6b]. American Journal of Hematology (2010). Low credibility.

In a variety of hematologic malignancies, immunoglobulin light chains (LC) are overproduced clonally and circulate without being linked by disulphide bonds to the immunoglobulin heavy chain. The recent development of a robust assay known as κ and λ "free" LC (FLC) to quantify the levels of these unbound LC in the serum, and thereby determine their ratio, has led to an explosion of studies that demonstrate its utility in a wide range of hematologic disorders. This article summarizes laboratory testing for serum FLC, with a particular focus on clinical applications for the test.

### Serum free light chain assay in monoclonal gammopathic manifestations [^112zJ4eS]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum free light chain assay is used in the diagnosis and monitoring of monoclonal gammopathic manifestations. For the kappa (κ)/lambda (λ) ratio, there is a 36% false-positive rate in patients without monoclonal gammopathic manifestations and a 30% false-negative rate in patients with monoclonal gammopathic manifestations. This study was undertaken to address the higher false-negative rate in λ chain-associated monoclonal lesions.

Methods

Results of serum protein electrophoresis, serum immunofixation electrophoresis, and serum free light chain assays were reviewed retrospectively. The results for serum free light chains in cases of intact immunoglobulin monoclonal gammopathic manifestations only were analyzed.

Results

Concentrations of involved serum free light chains were significantly higher in κ chain-associated lesions than in λ chain-associated lesions. The concentration of uninvolved light chains was significantly higher in λ chain-associated lesions.

Conclusions

κ light chains are present in significantly greater abundance than are λ chains in their respective monoclonal lesions. Moreover, κ and λ light-chain levels are not comparable for similar quantitative levels of monoclonal immunoglobulins. The findings warrant a reconsideration of the role of serum free light chain concentrations and involved to uninvolved serum free light chain ratio in designation of myeloma-defining conditions and other diagnostic criteria based on serum free light chain assay.

### Laboratory detection and initial diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies [^113nCPTX]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Serum free light chain (sFLC) reporting — The strength of evidence is very low and based on one low quality retrospective cohort study with specified risks of bias, yet the expert panel (EP) proposed a strong recommendation to report both quantitative levels and kappa/lambda ratio when sFLC is performed because the ratio provides additional information when total immunoglobulin is abnormal; a minority anticipated a moderate cost increase (12.5%) while a majority (87.5%) judged resource use negligible, all EP members deemed acceptability favorable (75% acceptable; 25% probably acceptable), and feasibility was rated as 87.5% feasible and 12.5% probably feasible.

Another critical test is the serum free light-chain assay, which detects unbound free light chains. This assay measures κ and λ free light chains independently and can be used to determine the κ:λ free light-chain ratio. Clonality can be inferred from an abnormal κ:λ free light-chain ratio: a high ratio indicates a κ clone whereas a low ratio indicates a λ clone. Because free light chains are cleared by the kidney, impaired renal function alters the free light-chain concentration. The 'normal' free light-chain ratio, 0.26–1.65, can rise to 0.34–3.10 in patients with severe renal impairment (CKD stage 5 or greater), but small declines in renal function can also impair free light-chain clearance. Knowing which serum free light-chain assay is being used by the laboratory is extremely important, as at least two major assays are currently on the market. Not only are the results of these assays mathematically inconvertible, but the effects of renal impairment differ between these assays; the evidence suggests that the N Latex assay is less affected than the FreeLite assay by impaired renal function. Thus, the same assay must be used to monitor a particular patient throughout their treatment. Moreover, given that the two assays have different performance characteristics, free light-chain levels might need to be checked using the other assay if the first result is negative. In addition, serum immunofixation might be more helpful than serum free light-chain assays in diseases associated with an intact monoclonal immunoglobulin (such as PGNMID). Finally, although antibodies for use in urinary light-chain assays have been developed, these assays have not been validated and should not be used to quantify the amount of light chain (Bence Jones protein) in a 24 h urine specimen (which should instead be measured by urine protein electrophoresis, as previously stated).

Identification of the culprit monoclonal immunoglobulin has important diagnostic and prognostic consequences. The monoclonal immunoglobulin detected in serum and/or urine must match that found in immunoglobulin deposits in the kidney; if the immunoglobulin found in renal deposits differs from that found in the circulation, the monoclonality of the putative culprit immunoglobulin is called into question. Although the serum M-spike concentration and serum free light-chain assay results have both diagnostic and prognostic importance, the correlation between the results of these tests and the severity or type of kidney disease is less well established.

### The significance of free light-chain ratio in light-chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a flow cytometry sub-study of the iStopMM screening study [^117W2wxN]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Light-chain (LC) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a precursor to LC-multiple myeloma (LC-MM), amyloidosis, and related plasma cell disorders (PCD). It is characterized by abnormal serum free light-chain (FLC) levels without a detected monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein) of heavy-chain type and the absence of any evidence of MM-related end organ damage. In contrast to other MGUS entities presenting with an M protein, the key diagnostic factor for LC-MGUS — abnormal FLC levels — only indirectly implies underlying monoclonality. Moreover, it does not provide evidence of the developmental stage in B cell differentiation, as in distinguishing between IgM and non-IgM MGUS. In light of recent evidence suggesting that the reference intervals used for the standard definition of LC-MGUS are inaccurate and potentially resulting in a high-rate of false positive diagnoses, we recently proposed a revised definition of LC-MGUS which includes novel reference intervals for FLC that are based on results from the Iceland Screens, Treats, or Prevents MM study (iStopMM) and factors in age and renal function. We found the prevalence of LC-MGUS to be 0.27% in individuals aged 40 years and older when applying the revised FLC intervals, compared to a prevalence of 1.54% when applying the standard FLC intervals.

Assessing the risk of progression from LC-MGUS to more advanced PCD presents challenges, particularly since FLC measures are the only blood-based disease biomarker. Therefore, current risk models for progression in MGUS, based in part on M protein concentration and isotype, do not apply to LC-MGUS. Smoldering MM (SMM) defines a higher risk precursor state than MGUS, which is particularly relevant given the increasing evidence supporting early intervention in high-risk, asymptomatic individuals. However, the definition of LC-SMM has not been well established, partly due to the replacement of urine protein electrophoresis by more sensitive FLC measurements. To address this, we recently described the first screened cohort of LC-SMM and proposed an updated definition consisting of abnormal FLC levels together with > 10% PC in the bone marrow (BM) and overcomes the inconvenience and ineffectiveness of using urine measurements of monoclonal proteins. Ultimately, there is a need for studies evaluating prognostic markers specifically for LC MGUS to direct the management of these individuals, including different levels of FLCs, immunoparesis, and flow cytometry analysis of PC in the BM.

### Serum free light chain ratio is an independent risk factor for progression in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^117PMyJ3]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Mayo Clinic risk stratification model for progression of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance" for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.

The Mayo Clinic Risk Stratification Model for Progression of Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) is a clinical calculator used in the field of hematology. This model is specifically designed for patients diagnosed with MGUS, a condition characterized by the presence of an abnormal protein in the blood, which can potentially progress to more serious conditions like multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to stratify patients into risk groups (low, intermediate, and high) based on three factors: the amount of M protein, the type of M protein, and the ratio of free light chains in the blood. This risk stratification helps clinicians predict the likelihood of progression from MGUS to a malignant condition over a 20-year period, thereby guiding follow-up and management strategies.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator. However, it should be noted that it is not applicable to patients who have already progressed to a malignant condition from MGUS. It is also less accurate in predicting progression in patients with non-IgM type MGUS, as the model was primarily developed based on patients with IgM type MGUS.

The Mayo Clinic model assesses the risk of progression for individuals with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by analyzing three key clinical factors. Each factor receives a score based on defined criteria, and the sum of these scores predicts the likelihood of disease progression over a 20-year period.

To begin, consider the three clinical inputs:

- Serum M protein level:

- Less than 15 grams per liter (< 15 g/L) scores 0.
- Equal to or greater than 15 grams per liter (≥ 15 g/L) scores 1.

- Serum M protein type:

- Immunoglobulin G scores 0.
- Non-immunoglobulin G scores 1.

- Serum free light chain ratio:

- Normal ratio, within the range of 0.26 to 1.65, scores 0.
- Abnormal ratio, outside the normal range, scores 1.

Each of these criteria contributes either 0 or 1 point, culminating in a total score between 0 and 3. This aggregate score serves as a prognostic tool that guides the interpretation of progression risk. Here's what each score signifies in terms of 20-year risk:

- A score of 0 corresponds to a 5% risk of progression.
- A score of 1 increases the risk to 21%.
- A score of 2 elevates the risk further to 37%.
- A full score of 3 indicates a high risk, at 58%.

Through this model, healthcare providers can quantitatively assess an individual's risk of progression from MGUS to potentially more serious conditions, aiding in personalized patient management and monitoring strategies.

### Verification of serum reference intervals for free light chains in a local South African population [^115cUycE]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Monoclonal serum free light chain measurements are used to follow up and manage patients with monoclonal gammopathies, and abnormal serum free light chain ratios are associated with risk of progression in certain diseases. We aimed to validate the reference intervals in our population. Reference intervals for κ and λ free light chains were established on 120 healthy adults. Creatinine levels were measured to exclude renal dysfunction and serum protein electrophoresis was performed. All creatinine values were within normal limits. After exclusion of subjects with abnormal serum protein electrophoreses, 113 subjects were available for analysis. The 95% reference interval was 6.3–20.6 mg/L for κ free light chains, 8.7–25.9 mg/L for λ free light chains and 0.46–1.23 for free light chain ratio. Most of the values fell within the manufacturer's recommended limits and therefore could be used for our population.

### Elevated serum free light chains are associated with event-free and overall survival in two independent cohorts of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^112emTXv]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The serum free light chain (FLC) assay quantitates free kappa (κ) and free lambda (λ) immunoglobulin light chains. This assay has prognostic value in plasma cell proliferative disorders. There are limited data on serum FLC in B-cell malignancies.

Patients and Methods

The association of pretreatment FLC with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was evaluated in 76 patients from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial N0489 (NCT00301821) and 219 patients from the University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Specialized Program of Research Excellence Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER). Published reference ranges were used to define an elevated FLC or an abnormal κ:λ FLC ratio.

Results

Elevated FLC or abnormal κ:λ FLC ratio was present in 32% and 14% of patients, respectively. Patients with elevated FLC had an inferior OS and EFS in both cohorts compared with patients with normal FLC (N0489: EFS hazard ratio [HR], 3.06; OS HR, 3.16; both P < .02; MER: EFS HR, 2.42; OS HR, 3.40; both P < .001; combined EFS HR, 2.57; OS HR, 3.74; both P < .001). All associations remained significant for EFS and OS after adjusting for the International Prognostic Index (IPI). Abnormal κ:λ FLC ratio was modestly associated with outcome in the combined group (EFS HR, 1.61; OS HR, 1.67; both P = .07), but not in patients without corresponding elevated κ or λ. Elevated FLC was the strongest predictor of outcome in multivariable models with the IPI components.

Conclusion

Increased serum FLC is an independent, adverse prognostic factor for EFS and OS in DLBCL and warrants further evaluation as a biomarker in DLBCL.

### Value of serum-free light chain measurements in response and progression assessment in multiple myeloma with monoclonal protein measurable by electrophoresis [^112y5jbd]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A better understanding of the biology and clinical behavior of multiple myeloma (MM) has translated to improvement in treatment approaches and outcomes. The treatment landscape in newly diagnosed MM has undergone a remarkable evolution with the introduction of many immunotherapies, which has led to deeper responses and better survival outcomes. Integration of monoclonal antibodies as the backbone of anti-MM therapy, increasing utilization of bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) are transforming the treatment paradigm for MM. However, with enhanced treatment efficacy, we need more sensitive tools to detect low levels of circulating monoclonal proteins for accurate response assessment and early relapse detection. Monoclonal (M) protein can be detected in the serum and/or urine of patients with MM as either intact immunoglobulins (Ig) or free light chains (FLC). The serum immunoglobulin-free light chain (sFLC) assay measures the serum levels of free kappa and lambda light chains. In MM, the elevated levels of sFLC reflect the tumor burden and, due to their shorter half-life compared to immunoglobulins, allow for an earlier assessment of the response to therapy. Serum FLC measurement is part of the new diagnostic criteria for MM and serves as a marker to monitor changes in tumor burden over time. Over 90% of patients with Immunoglobulin-secretory MM (Ig-MM) and nearly all patients with light chain MM (LCMM) have detectable or measurable sFLC at diagnosis. Advances in techniques, such as high-resolution electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, continue to improve the sensitivity of monoclonal protein detection but are still not routinely accessible in daily clinical practice.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, more specifically with respect to laboratory testing, BSH 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain immunofixation upon detection of a new M protein to confirm the type of monoclonal protein.

### The evolving use of serum free light chain assays in haematology [^112ekWc5]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Over the last few years new immunoassays have emerged that allow the measurement of free immunoglobulin light chains (FLCs) in serum to a level of 2–4 mg/l and provide a much greater sensitivity than older methods, such as immunofixation, which is able to detect FLCs at a minimum concentration of 100–150 mg/l. The new FLC assay has enabled the detection of monoclonal protein in some patients with non-secretory myeloma and amyloidosis that were previously undetectable. FLC measurements are quantitative, correlating with disease activity, and are an advance in monitoring light chain only multiple myeloma, AL amyloidosis, non-secretory and oligo-secretory multiple myeloma. Serum FLC concentrations also reflect the disease course in the majority of myeloma patients producing intact monoclonal immunoglobulin proteins and have been incorporated into the new response criteria. The rapid half life of lambda and kappa free light chains means that FLC assays may provide a more rapid indication of the response to treatment but their clinical utility in this setting needs further study. An abnormal FLC ratio has been shown to be a risk factor for progression of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smouldering myeloma and solitary plasmacytoma of bone and is prognostic in multiple myeloma.

### Concentrations of serum free light chains in kappa and lambda lesions in light-chain myelomas [^111hD59Q]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Concentration of serum free light chains has been promoted as an assay in the evaluation of monoclonal gammopathic manifestations. A high false-positive rate in patients without monoclonal gammopathic manifestations and a high false-negative rate in patients with those manifestations have been reported. The false-negative rate for lambda chain-associated lesions is higher than that for kappa chain-associated lesions.

Objective

To assess the serum free light chains in light-chain myelomas.

Methods

Concentrations of involved and uninvolved serum free light chains were retrospectively reviewed in patients with light-chain myelomas.

Results

The highest recorded levels of involved light chains in kappa-chain myelomas and lambda-chain myelomas were comparable. The levels of uninvolved light chains were higher, although not statistically significantly, in lambda-chain lesions.

Conclusions

The results of serum free light chains in light-chain myelomas support the clinical usefulness of the assay in monitoring patients with light chain myeloma.

### International myeloma working group guidelines for serum-free light chain analysis in multiple myeloma and related disorders [^113PhT6r]. Leukemia (2009). Low credibility.

The serum immunoglobulin-free light chain (FLC) assay measures levels of free kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains. There are three major indications for the FLC assay in the evaluation and management of multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders (PCD). In the context of screening, the serum FLC assay in combination with serum protein electrophoresis (PEL) and immunofixation yields high sensitivity, and negates the need for 24-h urine studies for diagnoses other than light chain amyloidosis (AL). Second, the baseline FLC measurement is of major prognostic value in virtually every PCD. Third, the FLC assay allows for quantitative monitoring of patients with oligosecretory PCD, including AL, oligosecretory myeloma and nearly two-thirds of patients who had previously been deemed to have non-secretory myeloma. In AL patients, serial FLC measurements outperform PEL and immunofixation. In oligosecretory myeloma patients, although not formally validated, serial FLC measurements reduce the need for frequent bone marrow biopsies. In contrast, there are no data to support using FLC assay in place of 24-h urine PEL for monitoring or for serial measurements in PCD with measurable disease by serum or urine PEL. This paper provides consensus guidelines for the use of this important assay, in the diagnosis and management of clonal PCD.

### Laboratory detection and initial diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies [^116SarbZ]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, more specifically with respect to laboratory testing, AACC/ASCP/CAP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider using the ratio of serum free kappa-to-serum free lambda, IgM isotype, M protein > 1.5 g/dL, and immunoparesis as risk factors for progression to multiple myeloma or a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.

### Serum free light chains, not urine specimens, should be used to evaluate response in light-chain multiple myeloma [^113BzKo9]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines for monitoring multiple myeloma (MM) patients expressing light chains only (light-chain MM [LCMM]) rely on measurements of monoclonal protein in urine. Alternatively, serum free light chain (sFLC) measurements have better sensitivity over urine methods, however, demonstration that improved sensitivity provides any clinical benefit is lacking. Here, we compared performance of serum and urine measurements in 113 (72κ, 41λ) newly diagnosed LCMM patients enrolled in the Intergroupe Francophone du Myélome (IFM) 2009 trial. All diagnostic samples (100%) had an abnormal κ:λ sFLC ratio, and involved (monoclonal) FLC (iFLC) expressed at levels deemed measurable for monitoring (≥ 100 mg/L). By contrast, only 64% patients had measurable levels of monoclonal protein (≥ 200 mg per 24 hours) in urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP). After 1 and 3 treatment cycles, iFLC remained elevated in 71% and 46% of patients, respectively, whereas UPEP reported a positive result in 37% and 18%; all of the patients with positive UPEP at cycle 3 also had elevated iFLC levels. Importantly, elevated iFLC or an abnormal κ:λ sFLC ratio after 3 treatment cycles associated with poorer progression-free survival (P = .006 and P < .0001, respectively), whereas positive UPEP or urine immunofixation electrophoresis (uIFE) did not. In addition, patients with an abnormal κ:λ sFLC ratio had poorer overall survival (P = .022). Finally, early normalization of κ:λ sFLC ratio but not negative uIFE predicted achieving negative minimal residual disease, as determined by flow cytometry, after consolidation therapy (100% positive predictive value). We conclude that improved sensitivity and prognostic value of serum over urine measurements provide a strong basis for recommending the former for monitoring LCMM patients.

### Screening for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is contraindicated [^113pi8Lf]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

A key point, then, is that an abnormal κ/λ ratio is not diagnostic of monoclonality, and a normal κ/λ ratio does not exclude monoclonality. In tertiary care, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia cases generate more abnormal κ/λ ratios than those from de novo MG. Even using κ/λ ratio of ≥ 3.0 or 3.15 as the diagnostic criterion generates more than 80% false‐positive results for the presence of an MG.

In the iStopMM study design, the investigators started with serum free light chain levels and the κ/λ ratio to identify patients with putative light chain MGUS, the primary criterion being κ/λ ratio of > 3.15. They sought evidence to corroborate monoclonality by conducting flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow. While it is a state‐of‐the‐art assay for flow cytometry, it is not the most sensitive method for diagnosing monoclonality. The investigators have overlooked simpler, less expensive, less invasive and more sensitive tests to detect monoclonality. The following non‐invasive tests ought to have preceded bone marrow examination:
UIFE using antisera to free light chains (FLC‐UIFE)
Enhanced sensitivity assay for detecting monoclonal light chains in serum by FLC modified serum immunofixation electrophoresis (FLC‐Modified SIFE).
Mass spectrometric detection (Not MASS‐FIX MALDI) of monoclonal immunoglobulins in serum.

### Comparison of serum free light chain and urine electrophoresis for the detection of the light chain component of monoclonal immunoglobulins in light chain and intact immunoglobulin multiple myeloma [^1167jwUT]. Haematologica (2016). Low credibility.

Response criteria for multiple myeloma are based upon changes in monoclonal protein levels quantified using serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis. The latter lacks sensitivity at low monoclonal protein levels and since 2001, the serum free light chain test has been available and its clinical utility proven, yet guidelines have not recommended it as a replacement for urine assessment. Herein we evaluated responses using serum free light chain measurements and serum and urine electrophoresis after 2 and 4 cycles of therapy and after stem cell transplantation in 25 light chain and 157 intact immunoglobulin myeloma patients enrolled in the IFM 2007–02 MM trial. All 25 light chain patients had measurable disease by serum free light chain and urine methods at presentation. By contrast 98 out of 157 intact immunoglobulin patients had measurable disease by serum free light chain compared to 55 out of 157 by urine electrophoresis. In all patients there was substantial agreement between predicate (serum/urine protein electrophoresis) and test (serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chain) methods for response assessment (Weighted Kappa = 0.83). Urine immunofixation became negative in 47% light chain and 43% intact immunoglobulin patients after 2 cycles of therapy. At this time the serum free light chain ratio normalised in only 11% and 27% patients, respectively. In summary we found good agreement between methods for response assessment, but the serum free light chain test provided greater sensitivity than urine electrophoresis for monitoring. To our knowledge this is the first report comparing both methods for response assignment based on the International Myeloma Working Group guidelines. (Clinical Trials Register.eu identifier: 2007–005204–40).

### Prognostic value of the serum free light chain ratio in newly diagnosed myeloma: proposed incorporation into the international staging system [^113tXrCM]. Leukemia (2008). Low credibility.

To determine if the serum free light chain (FLC) ratio has prognostic value in patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM), baseline serum samples from a well-characterized cohort of 790 newly diagnosed MM patients were tested with the FLC assay. FLC ratio was calculated as kappa/lambda (reference range 0.26–1.65). On the basis of the distribution of values, a cutpoint kappa/lambda FLC ratio of < 0.03 or > 32 was chosen for further analysis. Overall survival was significantly inferior in patients with an abnormal FLC ratio of < 0.03 or > 32 (n = 479) compared with those with an FLC ratio between 0.03 and 32 (n = 311), with median survival of 30 versus 39 months, respectively. We incorporated abnormal FLC ratio with the International Staging System (ISS) risk factors (that is, albumin < 3.5 g/dl and serum beta(2)-microglobulin ≥ 3.5 g/l), to create a risk stratification model with improved prognostic capabilities. Patients with 0, 1, 2 or 3 adverse risk factors had significantly different overall survival, with median survival times of 51, 39, 30 and 22 months, respectively (P < 0.001). These findings suggest that the serum FLC ratio at initial diagnosis is an important predictor of prognosis in myeloma, and can be incorporated into the ISS for improved risk stratification.

### Defect in automated antigen excess detection discovered after reviewing serum free light chain results in context with clinical findings [^117NLjoq]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Serum κ and λ free light chains can be markedly elevated in monoclonal gammopathies; consequently, serum free light chain (sFLC) immunoassays are susceptible to inaccuracies caused by antigen excess. As a result, diagnostics manufacturers have attempted to automate antigen excess detection. A 75-year-old African-American woman had laboratory findings consistent with severe anemia, acute kidney injury, and moderate hypercalcemia. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis and sFLC testing were ordered. The sFLC results initially showed mildly elevated free λ light chains and normal free κ. The pathologist noted that sFLC results were discrepant with the bone marrow biopsy, electrophoresis, and immunofixation results. After manual dilution of the serum, repeat sFLC testing revealed significantly higher λ sFLC results. Antigen excess causing falsely low sFLC quantitation may not be detected by immunoassay instruments as intended. Correlation with clinical history, serum and urine protein electrophoresis results, and other laboratory findings is essential when interpreting sFLC results.

Systemic light chain amyloidosis — laboratory evaluation for monoclonal proteins: The laboratory evaluation begins with a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, including platelet counts, and peripheral blood smear. Screening for monoclonal protein by serum and urine protein electrophoresis (SPEP and UPEP) alone may not be adequate, as it does not show a monoclonal spike in nearly 50% of cases; therefore, serum immunofixation electrophoresis (SIPE) and 24-hour urine immunofixation electrophoresis (UIPE) is essential along with serum free light chain (FLC) analysis. The measurement of serum FLC is a diagnostic necessity, as the majority of patients with light chain amyloidosis will have abnormalities of the kappa or lambda chains with an abnormal kappa/lambda ratio.

### Serum free light chain measurement aids the diagnosis of myeloma in patients with severe renal failure [^112bK31j]. BMC Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Monoclonal free light chains (FLCs) frequently cause rapidly progressive renal failure in patients with multiple myeloma. Immunoassays which provide quantitative measurement of FLCs in serum, have now been adopted into screening algorithms for multiple myeloma and other lymphoproliferative disorders. The assays indicate monoclonal FLC production by the presence of an abnormal kappa to lambda FLC ratio (reference range 0.26–1.65). Previous work, however, has demonstrated that in patients with renal failure the FLC ratio can be increased above normal with no other evidence of monoclonal proteins suggesting that in this population the range should be extended (reference range 0.37–3.1). This study evaluated the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the immunoassays in patients with severe renal failure.

Methods

Sera from 142 patients with new dialysis-dependent renal failure were assessed by serum protein electrophoresis (SPE), FLC immunoassays and immunofixation electrophoresis. The sensitivity and specificity of the FLC ratio's published reference range was compared with the modified renal reference range for identifying patients with multiple myeloma; by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

Results

Forty one patients had a clinical diagnosis of multiple myeloma; all of these patients had abnormal serum FLC ratios. The modified FLC ratio range increased the specificity of the assays (from 93% to 99%), with no loss of sensitivity. Monoclonal FLCs were identified in the urine from 23 of 24 patients assessed.

Conclusion

Measurement of serum FLC concentrations and calculation of the serum kappa/lambda ratio is a convenient, sensitive and specific method for identifying monoclonal FLC production in patients with multiple myeloma and acute renal failure. Rapid diagnosis in these patients will allow early initiation of disease specific treatment, such as chemotherapy plus or minus therapies for direct removal of FLCs.

### Automated detection of free monoclonal light chains by enhanced-sensitivity modified immunofixation electrophoresis with antisera against free light chains [^112exkKm]. Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple myeloma, a malignant tumor of plasma cells (terminally differentiated B-lymphocytes), is the second-most common hematologic malignancy in adults and accounts for approximately 2% of cancer deaths. The cancer is treatable but not curable, although the introduction of newer drugs has prolonged survival, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy targeting B-cell maturation antigen shows further promise.

More than 99% of multiple myeloma cases produce detectable amounts of monoclonal immunoglobulins (Ig) in serum. Demonstrating monoclonality is an essential part of the diagnostic workup of the lesion. Usually, the monoclonal nature of the lesion is established by detecting restricted heterogeneity or mobility of immunoglobulins or light chain moieties in serum or urine. Increased numbers of plasma cells in bone marrow is a cardinal feature of the disorder, and demonstration of a clonal population of plasma cells in bone marrow is generally required for detection of minimal residual disease. Analysis of plasma cell immunoglobulin genomic architecture to demonstrate monoclonality is not a usual requirement for diagnosis of multiple myeloma. An abnormal level and an abnormal light chain ratio of serum free light chains (SFLCs) may suggest a monoclonal lesion but is not diagnostic of monoclonality. Similarly, a normal light chain ratio does not exclude monoclonality.

### Screening for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is contraindicated [^1179j5p4]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Even with evidence of the lack of usefulness of κ/λ ratio as a diagnostic marker for MGUS, patients are being subjected to additional testing, including bone marrow biopsy without the benefit of urine immunofixation electrophoresis (UIFE). A particularly problematic sentiment has been expressed by the authors of iStopMM study, namely, 'To address this, we recently described the first screened cohort of LC‐SMM and proposed an updated definition consisting of abnormal FLC levels together with > 10% PC in the bone marrow (BM) and overcomes the inconvenience and ineffectiveness of using urine measurements of monoclonal proteins'. This sentiment suggests that UIFE is more inconvenient than trephine bone biopsy, which is clearly contrary to most patients' perceptions of urinalysis versus invasive bone biopsy. In addition, UIFE is not ineffective, in fact in a large study, a positive UIFE was the only evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy in about 3% of cases.

Serum free light chain (SFLC) assay and κ/λ ratio have limited usefulness in MGUS and other disorders. Documented utility for SFLC is limited to monitoring light chain MM and diagnosis of light chain predominant multiple myeloma (LCPMM). Other diagnostic criteria based on SFLC have been contested, for example, (a) Involved light chain level and ratio of involved to uninvolved light chain level in diagnosing myeloma defining condition. The sensitivity of this criterion is < 16%. It is possible that had the criterion been based on light chain‐specific levels, it might have been more useful for diagnosing MM. In neoplastic monoclonal gammopathy (MG), kappa light chain levels are four to five times higher than those in lambda‐associated MG. Levels of uninvolved kappa light chains are twice as high as those of lambda uninvolved light chains.(b) Requirement of a normal κ/λ ratio for stringent complete response is likely invalid as following autologous stem cell transplantation the resulting oligoclonal pattern generates more cases of kappa dominant abnormal κ/λ ratio in patients with lambda chain associated MM than cases with lambda dominant abnormal κ/λ ratio.(c) Light chain escape, if it occurs it must be exceedingly rare as most, if not all, of the instances of this 'entity' can be explained by the recurrence of a LCPMM.

### Prognostic value of serum free light chain ratio at diagnosis in multiple myeloma [^1138RXp3]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

The prognostic value of baseline serum free light chain ratio (sFLCR) was investigated in 94 multiple myeloma (MM) patients. sFLCR was calculated as kappa/lambda or lambda/kappa, depending on the patients' dominating monoclonal light chain. Median baseline sFLCR was 3.57 in kappa-MM patients, 45.09 in lambda-MM. 'High' sFLCR (≥ the observed median value for kappa- and lambda-MM respectively) correlated with elevated serum creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase, extensive marrow infiltration and light chain type MM. The 5-year disease-specific survival was 82% and 30% in patients with sFLCR lower than and equal or greater than the median, respectively (P = 0.0001). sFLCR was an independent prognostic factor.

### The significance of free light-chain ratio in light-chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a flow cytometry sub-study of the iStopMM screening study [^1122PDyy]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

We assessed the clinical significance of FLC ratio 3.15 threshold among LC-MGUS actively monitored for progressive disease as part of the iStopMM randomized trial of follow-up strategies. Those with FLC ratio > 1.65 to 3.15 at screening maintained a stable FLC ratio over time, used as indicator of progressive disease, and none progressed to a more advanced PCD (including light-chain amyloidosis), during a follow-up period over 4 years. In contrast, individuals with > 3.15 demonstrated a significant increase in FLC ratio over time, together with a relatively high incidence of advanced PCD precursor diagnoses, including 4/71 (5.6%) individuals progressing to LC-MM during follow-up. Of note, individuals identified as intermediate-risk or high-risk SMM within the iStopMM study are offered MM treatment as part of an early intervention treatment trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03815279) which may limit the incidence of MM in this cohort. These findings imply that LC-MGUS diagnosed with an FLC ratio > 1.65 to 3.15, likely represents condition with minimal clinical significance, questioning the necessity of monitoring disease progression for this subgroup. However, longer follow-up is essential to determine long-term implications in relation to these findings.

### Elevated serum free light chains are associated with inferior event free and overall survival in Hodgkin lymphoma [^114dRxm4]. American Journal of Hematology (2011). Low credibility.

The serum free light chain (FLC) assay quantitates free immunoglobulin kappa and lambda light chains, which has prognostic value in plasma cell dyscrasias. However, there is limited data on serum FLC in lymphoid malignancies. We analyzed the association of pretreatment FLC with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in 100 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Elevated polyclonal FLC were present in 30% of patients; these patients had an inferior EFS (HR = 4.84; 95% CI: 1.84–12.7) and OS (HR = 8.87; 95% CI: 2.35–33.52) compared to patients with normal FLC. Further studies of FLC in HL are warranted.

### Polyclonal serum free light chain elevation is associated with increased risk of monoclonal gammopathies [^11224GQG]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathies (MG) constitute a spectrum of disorders starting from a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) to active disease requiring therapy such as multiple myeloma. MG are characterized by proliferation of clonal plasma cells (PC) secreting a monoclonal protein either as intact immunoglobulin or free kappa or lambda free light chains (FLC). We hypothesized that a polyclonal elevation of serum FLC may indicate an inflammatory state that precedes development of MG. We studied 15,630 individuals from Olmsted county, who did not have MGUS based on baseline screening studies. At a median follow-up of 18.1 years, 264 patients had developed a clonal PC disorder; 252 with MGUS, 1 with SMM, 8 with MM, and 3 with amyloidosis, translating to an annual incidence of development of a MG of 0.1%. We examined the baseline polyclonal ΣFLC (kappa+lambda FLC) from the initial screening and grouped them into deciles. The highest decile group had a 2.6-fold (95% CI; 1.8, 3.7) increase in the risk of developing a MG, P < 0.001. We demonstrate for the first time, the increased risk of developing MG in patients with elevated serum FLC, suggesting that an underlying inflammatory state may play an etiologic role.

### New definition of light chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^115zBrxX]. JAMA Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Given the pivotal role of serum FLC measurement in detection, risk stratification, and monitoring of lymphoproliferative disorders, ensuring the accuracy of their reference intervals is crucial. Our newly proposed reference intervals for κ and λ FLC differ significantly from the standard intervals. In our cohort, we observed markedly higher levels of κ FLC, λ FLC, and FLC ratio compared with the values reported in the original study. This finding is in line with several recent smaller studies that have consistently demonstrated a high rate of false-positive results in individuals with slightly abnormal κ FLC levels. These results, together with our current findings, emphasize the imprecision of the standard reference intervals and the need for revised reference intervals. Discrepancies between our and the original reference intervals likely stem from a combination of different baseline populations studied and a change in κ levels of the Freelite assay (The Binding Site) over time. The exact cause of this upward drift in κ levels remains unknown but could possibly be linked to incremental changes in calibration over time. Interestingly, within our revised reference interval, the lower limit of the FLC ratio has significantly increased. This shift cannot be solely attributed to an upward drift in λ FLC levels, as this was minimal compared with the substantial change in κ FLC levels. It appears that the lower limit of the standard reference interval for FLC ratio has hitherto been erroneously low, resulting in false-negative values in cases of λ plasma cell disorders, which is consistent with previous studies. This discrepancy implies that use of the standard reference interval results in overdiagnosis of κ LC disease in persons without a true monoclonal disorder and underdiagnosis of λ LC disease in individuals with an underlying monoclonal disorder.

### Kappa free light chain index in the real world-Do we miss clinically relevant information by skipping oligoclonal banding? [^114SVwYd]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the present study, the vast majority of discordant results had negative OCB and positive κ ‐FLC index results. The only discordant finding with positive OCB and negative κ ‐FLC had markedly elevated serum κ ‐FLC concentration. It is not clear whether highly elevated κ ‐FLC in serum, for example due to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or hematological malignancies, might indeed lead to false‐negative κ ‐FLC index, or whether this observation is just a coincidence.

Of patients with negative OCB but positive κ ‐FLC index, some exhibited an isolated intrathecal IgA or IgM synthesis. While CSF‐restricted IgG OCB reflects only an intrathecal IgG synthesis, the κ ‐FLC index can be elevated in case of an intrathecal IgG, but also in case of an IgA and/or IgM synthesis, that is, the κ ‐FLC index mirrors a broader intrathecal plasma cell activity. The remaining discordant OCB negative samples showed in the majority of cases only low κ ‐FLC index values. Beyond that, one might speculate on further biological factors that could impact results. Previous studies with consecutive LP reported newly emerging OCB positivity during follow‐up. This suggests that the OCB positivity rate might increase with disease duration, that is, with ongoing chronic intrathecal inflammatory activity. It is possible that a short disease duration before LP explains discordant κ ‐FLC and OCB findings, considering the hypothesis that κ ‐FLC raises earlier in neuroinflammatory diseases. However, this has to be proven by further research.

### New definition of light chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^116VLG6f]. JAMA Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Recent studies suggest standard reference intervals for serum free light chains (FLC) are inaccurate and that this problem can only be partially remedied by using separate reference intervals for individuals with impaired kidney function. This decreases the utility of FLC testing in the clinical evaluation and follow-up of plasma cell disorders, particularly affecting the diagnosis of light chain (LC) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).

Objective

To evaluate the distribution of serum FLC and FLC ratios in individuals with preserved kidney function and to propose revised reference intervals and a new definition of LC-MGUS.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Iceland Screens, Treats or Prevents Multiple Myeloma (iStopMM) study is a nationwide prospective study of 75 422 participants (more than 50% of the Icelandic population) 40 years and older who were screened for MGUS. Data were collected from September 2016 to May 2023, and data were analyzed from June 2023 to May 2024.

Exposure

Samples were analyzed by serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation electrophoresis and FLC assay. Participants were actively followed up for progression.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The rate of abnormal FLC results using standard reference intervals was assessed, and revised age-stratified 99% reference intervals were calculated using nonparametric regression. The prevalence of LC-MGUS based on standard and revised reference intervals was evaluated along with progression to lymphoproliferative disorders.

Results

In total, 41 882 participants met inclusion criteria; a total of 23 786 (56.8%) were female, and the median (IQR) age was 60 (52–68) years. Using standard FLC reference intervals, 7316 κ FLC (17.5%), 1668 λ FLC (4.0%), and 1543 FLC ratios (3.7%) were abnormal. Revised reference intervals were calculated for those younger than 70 years (κ FLC, 6.3–39.0 mg/L; λ FLC, 5.9–36.7 mg/L; FLC ratio, 0.44–2.16) and 70 years or older (κ FLC, 7.0–55.8 mg/L; λ FLC, 6.4–48.0 mg/L; FLC ratio, 0.46–2.59). The prevalence of LC-MGUS was 1.54% (95% CI, 1.46–1.63) using standard intervals and 0.27% (95% CI, 0.23–0.30) using the revised intervals, yielding a decrease of 82%. None of the 1006 persons meeting LC-MGUS criteria based on standard intervals but not based on revised intervals progressed to a lymphoproliferative disorder during a median (range) follow-up of 4.6 (2.5–6.7) years.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, a new definition of LC-MGUS based on revised, more accurate FLC reference intervals decreased the false-positive rate of FLC testing by 82%.

### Elevated IgM and abnormal free light chain ratio are increased in relatives from high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia pedigrees [^1116LyGY]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

B-cells produce immunoglobulin (Ig) as part of the native and adaptive immune system. Aberrant B-cell activation and expansion may be reflected in abnormal polyclonal or monoclonal production of Ig heavy chains (e.g. IgA, IgG, and IgM) and/or light chains (κ and λ). This includes intact Igs comprising bound heavy light chains (HLC) and unbound free light chains (FLC) due to more abundant light-chain synthesis. Abnormal polyclonal (κ + λ) or monoclonal (κ/λ) FLCs in serum have been shown to be biomarkers of prognosis and survival in plasma cell disorders – and other B-cell lymphoid malignancies, including CLL –. Prospective cohorts have identified elevated polyclonal and abnormal monoclonal FLCs as early biomarkers of CLL, detectable upto 9.8 years before diagnosis. More recently, assays to quantitate serum Ig HLCs have been developed. In plasma cell disorders, HLCs have also proven to be useful biomarkers of progression, prognosis, and survival, independent of FLC markers. The role of HLC biomarkers has yet to be explored in other B-cell malignancies. Here we explore the hypothesis that inherited risk extends to early steps in CLL pathogenesis, defective immune response (polyclonal expansion), and the development of clonal populations. We investigate the potential for heritability of polyclonal and monoclonal FLCs and HLCs using "at-risk" relatives in CLL pedigrees.

### The significance of free light-chain ratio in light-chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a flow cytometry sub-study of the iStopMM screening study [^111Y8ov4]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

In total, BM samples from 61 individuals with positive screening for LC-MG were analyzed by flow cytometry for detection of clonal PC. The median age was 67 years (range: 43–89 years), 43 (70.5%) were males, and the median eGFR was 72.3 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (IQR: 60.5–84.8 mL/min/1.73 m 2). There were 42 (68.9%) who had kappa-involved FLC ratio, with median of 7.57 (IQR: 2.85–29.0), and 19 (31.1%) had lambda-involved FLC ratio, with median of 0.0560 (IQR: 0.0253–0.107). The diagnosis distribution at the time of flow cytometry was 28 LC-MGUS, 24 LC-SMM, 8 LC-MM, and 1 solitary bone plasmacytoma with minimal marrow involvement (SPM). BM samples were collected for flow cytometry at a median of 10 months (range: 2–79 months) post screening, with a median achieved LOD of 2.8 × 10 −6 (range: 1.3–9.5 × 10 −6) (Table 1).

### The significance of free light-chain ratio in light-chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a flow cytometry sub-study of the iStopMM screening study [^116Q2jXa]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The primary strength of this study lies in the large cohort of individuals with LC-MG identified through a population-based screening in the iStopMM study. This included analysis of BM samples, utilizing a sensitive and standardized flow cytometry assay, providing valuable insights into PC monoclonality in relation to diagnostic factors in LC-MG. Additionally, the thorough follow-up within a clinical trial framework, which included regular sampling and clinical assessments, provided robust evaluation of the clinical relevance of the FLC ratio threshold observed.

The insights of the study are somewhat constrained by the overrepresentation of individuals with kappa-involved FLC ratio in the iStopMM study, based on standard pathological FLC ratio reference values. Additionally, with the high detection of clonal PC in BM samples from individuals with lambda-involved FLC ratio (18 of 19 samples), a relationship between FLC ratio and clonal PC presence could not be established for this group. Several factors might have affected the detection of clonal PC: BM sample quality and hemodilution, uneven distribution of PC in the BM, and conventional limitations of the flow cytometry assay, such as the potential lack of phenotypical aberrancy in clonal PC not detected by the markers used. Furthermore, the dataset was not sufficiently large to thoroughly investigate the influence of age and kidney function on the relationship between FLC ratio and the presence of clonal PC. We observed that individuals without detected clonal PC were more likely to have increased age and reduced kidney function, which are associated with a more skewed kappa-involved FLC ratio. Despite this, the proposed cutoff of > 3.15 was identified as highly sensitive in predicting clonal PC. This is consistent with the revised normal FLC reference ranges, as the proposed cutoff is either above or within the upper end of these ranges for individuals with impaired kidney function (e.g. eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2: 0.54–3.30) or advanced age (≥ 70 years: 0.45–2.59), supporting its applicability in these populations.

### Appraisal of immunoglobulin free light chain as a marker of response [^114QHCby]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

The immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC) assay is an invaluable tool for following patients with oligosecretory plasma cell dyscrasia. Baseline values have also been shown to be prognostic in all plasma cell disorders tested. A looming question, however, is the role it should play in following myeloma patients with disease that is measurable using serum and urine electrophoresis. We used the data and stored samples from a mature Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group clinical trial (E9486) to assess serum levels of FLC at baseline and after 2 months of alkylator-based therapy. For serial determinations, the absolute level of involved serum FLC or the difference of the involved and uninvolved FLC is preferred over the ratio of involved to uninvolved FLC. FLC response after 2 months of therapy was superior to early M-protein measurement to predict overall response. The ideal cut-point for FLC change appears to be between 40% and 50% reduction. The correlation between serial measurements of serum FLC and urine M-protein is inadequate to abolish the serial 24-hour urine protein. Although baseline values of FLC are prognostic in newly diagnosed myeloma patients, serial measurements do not appear to have added value in patients who have M-proteins measurable by electrophoresis.

### Serum free light chain measurement aids the diagnosis of myeloma in patients with severe renal failure [^111GaDNe]. BMC Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The utility of a screening assay in practice however, is a function of its specificity as well as its sensitivity. In patients with renal failure, as glomerular filtration reduces, renal clearance of all FLCs will decrease. This results in longer serum half-lives and an increase in the κ/λ FLC ratio. Previous work we have undertaken demonstrated that in patients with renal failure, with no evidence of monoclonal proteins, the median FLC ratio was increased to 1.1 (range 0.37–3.1) from that of the published control population of 0.58 (0.26–1.65). We hypothesized that extending the reference range for the FLC ratio, to take into account this influence of renal function, would increase the specificity of the assay in patients with dialysis-dependent renal failure. Use of the published reference range for the FLC ratio, 0.26–1.65, gave the assay a specificity of 93% for patients with myeloma. This improved to 99% with the proposed extended reference range (0.37–3.1), indicating the new range may have a practical benefit by reducing the number of false positives.

Interpretation of FLC ratios between 1.65 and 3.0 is currently difficult. We would propose checking the patient's renal function. If normal, a ratio in this range may be indicative of a monoclonal process and further laboratory and clinical investigation will be appropriate. If the renal function is abnormal, a ratio in the range of 1.65–3.0 is probably a consequence of the renal impairment; however further investigation of some patients may be appropriate, particularly if AL-amyloidosis is suspected.

An interesting observation of this study was that the patients with cast nephropathy had higher absolute levels of the monoclonal free light chain type than the myeloma patients with other renal pathologies. Although this difference did not reach significance it adds further evidence to the findings of Bergner et al who demonstrated that urinary FLC concentrations are higher in patients with cast nephropathy compared with other FLC related renal pathologies.

### Diagnostic performance of serum free light chain measurement in patients suspected of a monoclonal B-cell disorder [^1154re61]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

The present study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of different testing strategies to diagnose malignant B-cell disorder or monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). Sensitivity and specificity were determined in 833 consecutive patients investigated for a monoclonal gammopathy. Serum protein electrophoresis (PE), serum kappa/lambda free light chain (FLC) ratio, and serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) were performed in all patients. Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with a malignant plasma cell disorder, 25 with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 156 with MGUS. Serum PE (with follow-up IFE) plus FLC had a sensitivity of 82.3% and a specificity of 96.8% and missed one plasmacytoma and 23 patients with MGUS. Serum IFE plus urine IFE had a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 100% and missed two MGUS patients. Serum IFE plus FLC had a sensitivity of 93.8% and a specificity of 96.8% and missed one MGUS patient. Serum PE plus FLC had a significantly lower sensitivity than serum IFE plus FLC or serum IFE plus urine IFE for the diagnosis of MGUS. The sensitivity of serum IFE plus FLC was comparable to the sensitivity of serum IFE plus urine IFE. The specificity of serum IFE plus FLC, however, was lower than the specificity of serum IFE plus urine IFE.

### Polyclonal serum free light chain elevation is associated with increased risk of monoclonal gammopathies [^113xnBL6]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a relatively common abnormality in the older individuals, characterized by clonal proliferation of mature plasma cells in the bone marrow, with small numbers of these cells observed in the peripheral blood. The prevalence is estimated to be 3.2 per 100,000 individuals greater than 50 years of age; increasing in prevalence with age with 5.3 per 100,000 among those over 70 years of age. While the condition itself is asymptomatic and with no clear consequence, the significance lies in the increased risk of development of a plasma cell disorder requiring therapy such as multiple myeloma or amyloidosis or another related lymphoid disorder. – Large epidemiological studies of MGUS from various parts of the globe have estimated this risk to be ~1% per year, with no change in risk over the years. Various risk factors have been identified for identifying patients who are at a higher risk for progression, including the level and type of the monoclonal protein, and abnormal serum free light chain ratio.

While much has been studied regarding the risk of progression from MGUS, there is limited information regarding the risk factors for development of MGUS. There are clearly genetic and environmental factors that predisposes one to the development of monoclonal gammopathies. Increased risk of MGUS have been found among the first degree relatives of those with a diagnosis of myeloma, and genetic loci have been identified that are associated with an increased risk of development of myeloma. Environmental factors such as exposure to ionizing radiation, petroleum products, and pesticides have been implicated in the development of myeloma and likely influences the development of MGUS as well. Chronic infection has been proposed as a risk factor for development of MGUS, but the reduced prevalence seen in the Asian population may argue against this possibility. It is important for us to identify factors that can predict the development of monoclonal gammopathies, as this can potentially give us the opportunity to explore the prevention approaches.

### How to screen for monoclonal gammopathy in patients with a suspected amyloidosis [^111Pwfei]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Monoclonal Protein Assessment Components

Although SPEP/IFE yields an abnormal result in most patients with monoclonal proteins, it has limitations. The burden of clonal plasma cells in patients with AL amyloidosis is typically low, meaning that the amount of monoclonal protein produced can be difficult to measure. The clonal plasma cells in patients with AL amyloidosis often produce monoclonal FLC only; because FLC are smaller than intact immunoglobulins, they can migrate to SPEP regions other than γ or can be excreted in the urine. Due to these factors, an M spike cannot be identified on SPEP in up to 30% of patients with AL amyloidosis (Figure 1). Additional testing beyond SPEP/IFE is therefore required to exclude a monoclonal protein in patients with suspected amyloidosis.

Figure 1
SPEP/IFE in a Patient With AL Amyloidosis

No quantifiable M spike is seen, but a subtle abnormality in the gamma region was identified (arrow). Trace monoclonal free lambda light chain was identified on immunofixation. AL = light chain amyloidosis; SPEP/IFE = serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation.

Serum free light chain (SFLC) measurements must also be obtained. Typically, concentrations of both light chain subtypes (kappa and lambda) and the kappa:lambda ratio (KLR) are reported. Adding SFLC to SPEP/IFE can significantly increase the ability to identify serum monoclonal protein in patients with AL amyloidosis, with sensitivity up to 99% for both assays in combination. Abnormal SFLC results do not always indicate the presence of monoclonal protein. Symmetric elevations in kappa and lambda light chain (with normal KLR) do not establish monoclonal protein and can be characteristic of nonspecific inflammatory states. Because light chains are renally excreted, patients with chronic kidney disease have impaired light chain clearance, with worsening in the normally more efficient kappa (compared with lambda) light chain clearance. Because kappa light chains are also typically produced at a higher rate than lambda, modestly elevated KLRs in patients with chronic kidney disease may be due to perturbed balance of clearance and production.

### Abnormal serum free light chain ratios are associated with poor survival and may reflect biological subgroups in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [^116xyb8W]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The measurement of immunoglobulin serum free light chains (sFLC) has prognostic significance in plasma cell dyscrasias but its role in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is unknown. This retrospective study from three UK hospitals analysed sFLC in 181 untreated/pre-treatment CLL patients and 78 treated CLL patients, with samples taken later in their disease. An abnormal sFLC ratio was significantly associated with poor overall survival for the 181 untreated/pre-treatment patients (P = 0.0001) and for all patients (P = 0.002), irrespective of cause of death. Using multivariate analysis (n = 194), four independent prognostic variables for overall survival were identified namely Zap-70 (P = 0.0001), beta2M (P = 0.01), IGHV mutation status (P = 0.017) and an abnormal sFLC ratio (P = 0.024). For CLL patients with unmutated IGHV genes, elevated kappa/lambda ratios were adversely prognostic. For patients with mutated IGHV genes, reduced kappa/lambda ratios were adversely prognostic and associated with the poor prognostic IGHV3–21, IGHV3–48 and IGHV3–53 subgroups, suggesting an abnormal sFLC ratio may reflect biological subgroups within CLL. Abnormal sFLC ratios need to be studied prospectively in CLL patients and the biological rationale for their abnormality investigated.

### Utility of serum free light chain measurements in multiple myeloma patients not achieving complete response to therapy [^1117bdZK]. Leukemia (2015). Low credibility.

Normalization of the serum-free light-chain ratio (FLCr) with the absence of bone marrow monoclonal plasma cells following achievement of a complete response (CR) to therapy denotes a stringent CR in multiple myeloma (MM), and is associated with improved overall survival (OS). However, its value in patients achieving < CR is not clear. We hypothesized that patients achieving a normalization of FLCr with initial therapy of MM will have an improved outcome, even in the absence of a CR. We retrospectively evaluated 449 patients with newly diagnosed MM with measurable disease at baseline, who did not achieve a CR with initial therapy. One hundred and fifty-three patients (34%) had a normal FLCr, whereas 296 (66%) had an abnormal ratio. Patients with a normal FLCr had a longer progression-free survival (29 vs 16 months, P < 0.001) and OS (91 vs 58 months, P < 0.001). Normalization of FLCr retained its prognostic value in a multivariable model. Our results suggest an important role for sFLC measurement in disease monitoring even in patients who achieve only a partial response to therapy. Obtaining a normal FLCr confers a favorable prognosis independent from other factors, supporting the inclusion of sFLC in all levels of response criteria.

### Defining new reference intervals for serum free light chains in individuals with chronic kidney disease: results of the iStopMM study [^112QpPFP]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Monoclonal gammopathies include a wide spectrum of disorders ranging in severity from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS), to active multiple myeloma (MM), amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, among many others. MGUS is a precursor to MM and related diseases, and light chain (LC)-MGUS a precursor to LC-MM and AL amyloidosis. In addition to serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE), the serum free light chain (FLC) assay has become the method of choice for detection, prognostication, and monitoring of monoclonal gammopathies. LC-MGUS is defined as an FLC ratio and involved FLC level outside reference intervals without evidence of end-organ damage, MGUS, or other lymphoproliferative disorders (LP). However, as FLCs are primarily cleared by the kidneys, the kidney function is a major determinant of the serum concentration. The prevalence of LC-MGUS in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is uncertain.

The reference intervals for serum kappa FLC (3.3–19.4 mg/L), lambda FLC (5.7–26.3 mg/L), and FLC ratio (0.26–1.65) were defined in a small cohort (N = 282) with normal kidney function. A kidney reference interval for FLC ratio (0.37–3.10) for patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 based on a study of few individuals with CKD stage 3 and above. The kidney reference interval for FLC ratio was later validated in a cohort of patients with MM on dialysis. No validation study on FLC ratio has been performed in patients with earlier stages of CKD or with other monoclonal gammopathies. No reference intervals for absolute levels of kappa and lambda FLCs have been proposed in people with CKD stage 3 or higher. It is of major importance to identify individuals with true monoclonal gammopathy, and as the prevalence of both monoclonal gammopathies and CKD increase with age, it is imperative that the FLC assay is accurate and usable in individuals with CKD.

### Immunoglobulin heavy / light chain ratios improve paraprotein detection and monitoring, identify residual disease and correlate with survival in multiple myeloma patients [^1122ymFa]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

In multiple myeloma (MM), precise quantification of monoclonal immunoglobulin (M-Ig) and its variations during the course of the disease, discrimination between monoclonal and polyclonal isotype particularly at low concentrations of M-Igs, information about the ratio of clonal and polyclonal plasma cellsand about the amount of immunosuppressionis important for prognostication, response evaluation and treatment selection. International guidelines recommend the use of serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and nephelometry (NEPH) for quantification of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-Ig) in MM, with immunofixation electropheresis (IFE) being used to confirm complete response (CR). However, the usefulness of SPEP is limited at low M-Ig levels, when the M-Igs co-migrate with other serum proteins, as commonly observed in IgA and less frequently in IgG MM, and when the M-Ig fails to resolve as a discrete band. Total immunoglobulin measurements with NEPH can resolve some of these issues. However, they tend to overestimate the amount of M-Ig at high concentrations, particularly in IgG and IgM paraproteinemias, but do not discriminate between M-Ig and normal polyclonal immunoglobulins, which becomes particularly relevant at low M-Ig concentrations.

Novel antibodies have been produced (heavy/light chain (HLC) antibodies), which separately identify the different light chain types of each immunoglobulin class, that is, IgGκ, IgGλ, IgAκ, and IgAλ. They allow accurate quantification of the involved and uninvolved immunoglobulin of the patient's affected isotype. Furthermore, a ratio of the monoclonal and the polyclonal immunoglobulin of the same isotype, that is, of IgGκ/IgGλ, can be calculated (HLC ratio) in the same manner as serum-free light chain (FLC) κ/λ ratios. Measurement of FLC has become a standard technique for response assessment. Preliminary studies employing the HLC assay have shown that HLC ratios may be of use in screening, monitoring and risk stratifying of patients with MM, AL amyloidosis, Waldenström's macroglobulinemiaand MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance). In addition, they may provide the only sensitive marker of disease progression in some patients.

### Serum free light chain (FLC) measurement can aid capillary zone electrophoresis in detecting subtle FLC-producing M proteins [^116pvQoU]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that using a free light chain (FLC) assay as an adjunct to capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) could improve detection of lymphoplasmacytic processes. We prospectively studied 1,003 consecutive serum samples submitted for routine protein electrophoresis and/or immunofixation electrophoresis by CZE and FLC. Samples from patients previously characterized as having M proteins were excluded. Protein electrophoresis was read by a pathologist unaware of the FLC results. Sixteen cases revealed an abnormal free kappa/lambda ratio in which CZE did not demonstrate an M protein. Nine cases of B-lymphocyte or plasma cell proliferative processes were detected by an abnormal free kappa/lambda ratio in which CZE did not demonstrate an M protein. Cases with low free kappa/lambda ratios included 1 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 1 IgM lambda with aplastic anemia, and 1 lambda light chain myeloma. Cases with high free kappa/lambda ratios included 2 CLL, 1 lymphocytosis (possibly early CLL), 1 kappa light chain myeloma, 1 atypical lymphoma with neuropathy, and 1 nonsecretory myeloma. Addition of the free kappa/lambda ratio to CZE increases the yield of lymphocyte and plasma cell proliferative processes detected by 56%.

Patients and methods

Patient selection

We used a population-based cohort previously assembled by us to estimate the prevalence of MGUS. The original cohort comprised 21,463 out of the 28,038 enumerated Olmsted County residents aged 50 years or older, as of January 1, 1995, in whom blood samples were available for study. From among the 21,462 subjects in the Olmsted County MGUS prevalence cohort, we excluded the 4096 anonymized subjects, 710 subjects who were known to have a plasma cell disorder (MGUS or light chain MGUS), 758 subjects whose remaining sample was insufficient to perform the FLC assay, 52 subjects who were not Mayo Clinic patients, and 216 subjects who did not have a plasma cell disorder but had an abnormal FLC ratio. This resulted in a cohort of 15,630 patients who had no evidence at baseline of a clonal plasma cell disorder. We obtained the FLC results on this cohort from samples collected at baseline when the Olmsted prevalence study was conducted.

Laboratory methodology

Following approval by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, the FLC assay (FREELITE™, The Binding Site Ltd. Birmingham, UK) was measured in the 18,372 stored serum samples on a Dade Behring BNII automated nephelometer (Siemens, Newark, Delaware). In addition to reporting the κ and λ FLC concentrations, the assay reports the FLC κ/λ ratio (FLC-R), and an abnormal result was defined as an abnormal FLC-R (normal diagnostic range: 0.26–1.65). As described earlier, we excluded all patients with MGUS and all patients with an abnormal serum FLC ratio at baseline from the study cohort. We used the sum of the kappa and lambda FLC (ΣFLC) to examine the impact of polyclonal elevation of serum free light chains. We compared the risk of development of a clonal plasma cell disorder during follow-up among patients in the top decile (10th decile) of ΣFLC compared with the lower 9 deciles (1–9th deciles).

Systemic light chain amyloidosis — renal assessment and free light chain interpretation: To assess organ involvement, the workup should include urinalysis with quantification of proteinuria by 24-hour urine collection and measurement of creatinine clearance (calculated or measured directly). FLCs are cleared by the kidney; therefore, renal insufficiency increases the concentrations of FLC, and in that case, the kappa/lambda ratio or the difference between involved and uninvolved FLCs should be monitored.

Serum free light chain (sFLC) kappa/lambda ratio — diagnostic use and kidney function–specific reference ranges are as follows: The ratio of kappa and lambda free light chains, rather than absolute levels, should be used for diagnostic and disease-monitoring purposes; in chronic kidney disease higher K/L ratios are common and in such cases SIFE and UIFE are normal and AL amyloidosis is uncommon, whereas a low K/L ratio is never normal and should always prompt further investigation; consider that a normal K/L ratio is 0.26 to 1.65 with normal kidney function, and chronic kidney disease–adjusted ranges are GFR 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 with sFLC K/L ratio 0.46 to 2.62, GFR 30 to 44 mL/min/1.73 m2 with ratio 0.48 to 3.38, and GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 with ratio 0.54 to 3.30; when the monoclonal protein screen is abnormal or borderline abnormal, collaboration with a hematologist is warranted to exclude AL amyloidosis, and there is a rare entity of heavy-chain amyloidosis diagnosable by immunofluorescence staining of biopsy tissue with anti-heavy-chain antibodies.

### Revised free light chain reference intervals enhance risk stratification in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and reduce overdiagnosis [^115e7BzX]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The revised iStopMM reference intervals improve the diagnostics of light chain (LC) MGUS by reducing false positives (leading to an 82% reduction in prevalence) while still accurately detecting all cases that progressed to MM in the iStopMM cohort and have been externally validated. Even so, the implications of the revised FLC reference intervals for MGUS risk stratification are unknown. This study aims to compare the original and revised (iStopMM) definition of abnormal FLC ratio as a risk factor of malignant progression for MGUS with an intact M-protein, both independently and as part of the Mayo Clinic risk stratification model. Optimizing MGUS risk stratification is important for the identification of clinically relevant individuals for work and follow-up, while avoiding unnecessary, costly, time-consuming, and potentially harmful scans and examinations of low-risk individuals. By improving this balance, the study contributes to the overall aim of early cancer detection while simultaneously minimizing overdiagnosis.

- CBC with differential

- blood chemistry (including calcium, albumin, and creatinine)

### Extended use of serum free light chain as a biomarker in lymphoproliferative disorders: a comprehensive review [^114w3riH]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Serum free light chain (sFLC) assays were shown to improve detection, management, and prognostication in plasma cell disorders. Recently, sFLC assays improved detection of M proteins when combined with standard methods of protein electrophoresis/immunofixation in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (NHL/CLL). Incidence of abnormal sFLC ratio (sFLCr) varied from 0% to 36% and 29.7% to 59% in NHL and CLL, respectively. Increased sFLC levels or abnormal sFLCr predict shorter overall survival in early-stage CLL. Furthermore, abnormal sFLCr correlated with advanced disease stage and poorer outcome. In diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, increased sFLC was demonstrated as an independent, adverse prognostic factor for overall/event-free survival. Moreover, abnormal sFLCr can be a diagnostic tool in central nervous system lymphomas. Finally, the quantitative FLC assay has the potential to become a new, easily measured biomarker for predicting prognosis and enhanced detection in NHL/CLL. It may be used serially at follow-up evaluations to provide clues to relapse.

### Revised free light chain reference intervals enhance risk stratification in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and reduce overdiagnosis [^114Hp7Bx]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is an asymptomatic precursor condition of multiple myeloma (MM) and other lymphoproliferative disorders. The prevalence of MGUS increases with age and is found in approximately 4.2% of the population over 50 years of age. Although all cases of MM are preceded by MGUS, only a minority (approximately 1% annually) of those with MGUS progress to malignant lymphoproliferative disease.

An early diagnosis of MM or a precursor state may decrease the risk of irreversible organ damage as seen in late-stage disease and improve treatment outcomes. Furthermore, MM patients with an acute disease presentation have a poorer prognosis compared to patients diagnosed in an outpatient setting. Therefore, current guidelines recommend follow-up and/or more thorough examination (for example, bone marrow sampling) of individuals with MGUS at high risk of progression. To identify high-risk patients, the Mayo Clinic risk stratification model is used to guide work-up and follow-up of MGUS.

An abnormal free light chain (FLC) ratio increases the risk of MGUS progression independently of other risk factors and is incorporated in the Mayo Clinic risk stratification model. Besides monoclonal gammopathies, the serum FLC is affected by age and renal function, which must be considered when interpreting FLC levels and ratios. The first reference intervals for FLC were defined in a smaller cohort of 282 individuals with normal kidney function and later for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with estimated glomerular rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. However, these reference intervals have been revised as proposed by the Iceland Screens, Treats or Prevents MM (iStopMM) group based on a large cohort of 75,422 participants from the general population with and without CKD who were screened for MGUS by FLC assay allowing definition of reference intervals stratified by age and renal function.

### Elevated monoclonal and polyclonal serum immunoglobulin free light chain as prognostic factors in B-and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma [^117KaYbw]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

The serum immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC) assay quantitates free kappa (κ) and lambda (λ) light chains. FLC elevations in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are associated with an inferior survival. These increases in FLC can be monoclonal (as in myeloma) or polyclonal. The goal was to estimate the frequency of these elevations within distinct types of B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and whether the FLC measurements are associated with event-free survival (EFS). We studied serum for FLC abnormalities using normal laboratory reference ranges to define an elevated κ or λ FLC. Elevations were further classified as polyclonal or monoclonal. Four hundred ninety-two patients were studied: 453 B-cell and 34 T-cell NHL patients. Twenty-nine % (142/453) of patients had an elevated FLC of which 10% were monoclonal elevations. Within B-cell NHL, FLC abnormalities were most common in lymphoplasmacytic (79%), mantle cell (68%), and lymphomas of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (31%); they were least common in follicular (15%). The hazard ratio (HR) for EFS in all patients was 1.41 (95% CI; 1.11–1.81); in all B-cell NHL the HR was 1.44 (95% CI 1.11–1.96); in all T-cell NHL the HR was 1.17 (95% CI 0.55–2.49). FLC abnormalities predicted an inferior OS (HR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.93–3.90, P < 0.0001). The serum FLC assay is useful for prognosis in both B-cell and T-cell types of NHL. In B-cell NHL further discrimination between a monoclonal and polyclonal elevation may be helpful and should be analyzed in prospective clinical trials.

### The significance of free light-chain ratio in light-chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a flow cytometry sub-study of the iStopMM screening study [^112xhN8p]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, this study leveraged flow cytometry analysis to assess the presence of clonal PC in BM from individuals with LC-MGUS, establishing a correlation with the FLC ratio. We found that LC-MGUS with FLC ratio in the range of > 1.65 to 3.15 was associated with an absence of clonal PC and non-progressive disease. These insights challenge the accuracy of the standard FLC ratio intervals, suggesting that they lead to overdiagnosis of kappa-involved LC-MGUS. Consequently, our findings advocate adopting the more stringent kappa-involved FLC ratio threshold of > 3.15 as an indication of underlying PC monoclonality, for more accurate identification of individuals at increased risk of developing symptomatic PCD.

### Serum immunoglobulin free light chain measurements and heavy chain isotype usage provide insight into disease biology in patients with POEMS syndrome [^114LEGLg]. American Journal of Hematology (2010). Low credibility.

POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, skin changes) syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome in which nearly all patients have a monoclonal lambda restricted plasma cell disorder. We investigated whether patients with POEMS have abnormal serum immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC) ratios. Fifty patients with newly diagnosed POEMS syndrome were assessed. Cystatin C levels were measured to discern whether subclinical renal insufficiency could account for FLC elevations in the presence of a normal FLC ratio. Forty-five patients (90%) had elevated lambda FLC; however, only nine (18%) had abnormal FLC ratios. The rise in serum FLC of POEMS patients appeared to be multifactorial-both a function of subclinical renal insufficiency and polyclonal activation of medullary and extramedullary plasma cells. Those patients expressing a clonal IgA were more likely to have clonal plasmacytosis observed on iliac crest biopsy than those with IgG. In summary, serum immunoglobulin profiles are unique in POEMS syndrome as compared with other plasma cell disorders.

Abnormalities of immunoglobulin free light chains (FLCs) are frequently present in patients with monoclonal gammopathies and can cause kidney disease. The recent introduction of highly sensitive immunoassays that measure FLCs to levels below those present in normal individuals has provided a new tool for diagnosis and management in this setting. Here, we review the biology of FLC production in health and disease, and the utility of FLC immunoassays in the assessment of monoclonal gammopathies in kidney disease.

### Revised free light chain reference intervals enhance risk stratification in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and reduce overdiagnosis [^1121d7VS]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Free light chains ratio and progression risk

The incidence rate of progression to MM/NHL/AL amyloidosis was 13.5 cases per 1000 person-years for MGUS individuals overall. The rate was similar for those with normal FLC ratio (9.5 cases per 1000 person-years) and for those who reclassified from abnormal to normal FLC ratio (10.2 cases per 1000 person-years). For the individuals with abnormal FLC ratio according to the revised reference interval, the incidence rate of progression was significantly higher (21.8 cases per 1000 person-years).

Similarly, cumulative incidence of progression was similar for individuals with normal FLC ratio compared to those with reclassified FLC ratio compared after 5 years (2.7% vs. 2.4%) and after 10-years (3.4% vs. 3.8%). For individuals with abnormal FLC ratio according to the revised reference intervals, the cumulative incidence was higher after 5 years (6.8, 95% CI 5.5–7.9) and 10 years (8.7%, 95% CI 7.5–10.0).

In the Cox regression model, we found no difference in progression risk between individuals with reclassified FLC ratio (from abnormal to normal) compared to those with normal FLC ratio in the unadjusted analysis (HR: 1.07, 95% CI 0.74–1.57) or adjusted for age, sex, isotype, and M protein concentration (HR: 1.03, 95% CI 0.71–1.51). For individuals with abnormal FLC according to the revised reference intervals, we found a significantly higher risk of progression compared to those with normal FLC ratio in the unadjusted analysis (HR: 2.23, 95% CI 1.79–2.78) and adjusted (HR: 1.85, 95% CI 1.47–2.33). The results are summarized in Fig. 2 and Table 3.

### Polyclonal serum free light chain elevation is associated with increased risk of monoclonal gammopathies [^116rFevJ]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

The findings of the current study have several implications. The polyclonal elevation in the immunoglobulin free light chain points toward a general activation of plasma cells or other lymphoid cells that may precede the development of the monoclonal plasma cell population. It strengthens the argument in favor of chronic antigenic stimulation, infectious or otherwise, as a possible initial trigger for the establishment of the MGUS clone. We hypothesize that the first step in the pathogenesis of MGUS is a polyclonal expansion of plasma cells in response to antigenic stimulation that manifests as higher levels of free serum kappa and lambda FLCs. These FLC elevations may be mild enough to not elevate the level of either light chain outside what is considered the normal reference range, but asseen in our study can be detected with greater likelihood of being in the highest population decile of ΣFLC. This polyclonal expansion phase persists for a prolonged period of time, increasing the odds of a plasma cell acquiring one of the two main classes of primary cytogenetic abnormalities (immunoglobulin heavy chain translocations or trisomies) that establish the premalignant MGUS clone. As we have previously described, the MGUS clone once established is at the risk of acquiring additional cytogenetic abnormalities which results in a long-term persistent risk of progression to MM or related malignancy.

From a population standpoint, the identification of biomarkers for development of monoclonal gammopathies can have potential clinical applications in the long term. There is clear evidence suggesting the early intervention in MM at the asymptomatic SMM phase may provide an opportunity to alter the natural history of the disease in a positive way. This is likely to lead to more screening approaches and identification of monoclonal gammopathies in the population, especially in high-risk populations such as first-degree relatives of patients with myeloma, and in blacks. But more importantly, the finding that polyclonal elevations precede the development of MGUS provides clues to etiologic factors. For instance, we have data from our earlier studies that polyclonal elevations of immunoglobulins, as well as MGUS are much more common in Ghana compared with age-matched population in Olmsted County. The findings of this study strengthen the hypothesis that the first step in the pathogenesis of MM in polyclonal expansion of plasma cells presumably in response to antigenic stimulation, and provides important insights for future studies to determine more specific etiologic factors for MGUS and MM.

### Reference interval of free light chains ratio in patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis [^114GZPd6]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

For MG detection, we performed capillary serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and sFLC to all patients. In patients with monoclonal spike, hypogammaglobulinemia or altered FLCr, immunosubtraction (Minicap Flex Piercing - Sebia) was also performed in order to get a better characterization of the paraprotein. Patients with incidental diagnosis of MG were excluded from the analysis, and were referred to the Hematology Unit for a more accurate diagnosis and management. Normality of data was assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Differences in continuous variables were compared with the use of a Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test. Double-sided 95% reference intervals were determined as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI Guidelines C28-A3), using a non-parametric percentile method or a normal distribution method for data that exhibit parametric distribution. Atypical data (outliers) were evaluated with Tukey test, and not removed from the analysis. Correlations between sFLC and age and eGFR were assessed by Spearman rank-correlation coefficient. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

A total of 142 patients were initially included. An MG was incidentally detected in 5 patients (3.5%) who were excluded from the final analysis. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the 137 cases are shown in Table 1. A total of 27% of patients had RKF, with a median urine output in 24 hours of 700 mL (interquartile range [IQR], 448–1150) and a median eGFR of 3.42 mL/min (IQR, 1.36–9.74).

Kappa and Lambda values for the 137 patients are available in the Online Supplementary Appendix. The median Kappa level was 157 mg/L (IQR, 125.8–197.3), with a reference range of 64.5–281.8 mg/L. There was no significant relationship between Kappa levels and age of participants (P = 0.98 by Spearman's correlation) (Figure 1A). The median of Kappa in patients with or without RKF was 126.6 mg/L (IQR, 98.2–152.9) and 165.6 mg/L (IQR, 132.4–202.4), respectively (P < 0.01) (Online Supplementary Appendix). In patients with RKF, we found a moderate inverse correlation between eGFR and Kappa levels (Spearman's rank correlation coefficients, -0.51; P < 0.01).

Results

The demographics and selected assay results for the patients are presented in table 1. There were no significant differences in the demographics of the AKI patients with and without myeloma. The patients with multiple myeloma however, had higher median serum creatinines at presentation.

Table 1
Dialysis populations: demographics and haematological data.

*Serum creatinine significantly higher in multiple myeloma patients compared with the dialysis population as a whole, P < 0.02. **One patient with known chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, in remission, presented with acute renal failure and biopsy proven cast nephropathy. Investigation identified an intact IgM band on immunofixation electrophoresis with an associated λ FLC, bone marrow examination provided a haematological diagnosis of IgM myeloma.

Forty-one of the 142 AKI patients had a clinical diagnosis of multiple myeloma (Figures 1 and 2). All of these 41 patients had abnormal FLC ratios by both the published reference range and the proposed reference range. The proposed reference range increased the specificity of the assay for diagnosis of multiple myeloma (99% versus 93%), with no loss in sensitivity (100%) and thus increased the area under the ROC curve (0.96 to 0.99; Figure 3).

### New definition of light chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^116hBHuW]. JAMA Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Based on prospective screening of more than 75 000 individuals, we propose a revision of the reference intervals for serum κ FLC, λ FLC and FLC ratio, stratified by age, along with a new definition of LC-MGUS to significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy of this disorder. In the iStopMM cohort, applying our new definition decreased the prevalence of LC-MGUS by 82% in individuals 40 years and older, without any of the previously misdiagnosed cases progressing to a lymphoproliferative disorder during a follow-up period of 4648 patient-years.

In our large prospective screened cohort, we found that the standard reference intervals for κ FLC, λ FLC, and the FLC ratio among individuals with preserved kidney function resulted in marked overdiagnosis of κ LC and underdiagnosis of λ LC monoclonal gammopathies. The revised intervals could facilitate future risk stratification efforts and focus the treatment response criteria on individuals with more clinically relevant disease. In turn, the new definition of LC-MGUS may alleviate the burden of anxiety and unnecessary testing in individuals previously receiving what we can now recognize as false-positive diagnoses. These improvements could significantly decrease unnecessary costs from extensive work-ups and lifelong monitoring, directing limited health care resources to relevant cases.

### Prevalence and risk of progression of light-chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a retrospective population-based cohort study [^1129zqXW]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is defined by expression of heavy-chain immunoglobulin (IgH) and is the precursor lesion for 80% of cases of multiple myeloma. The remaining 20% are characterised by absence of IgH expression; we aimed to assess prevalence of a corresponding precursor entity, light-chain MGUS.

Methods

We used a population-based cohort, previously assembled to estimate MGUS prevalence, of 21,463 residents of Olmsted County, MN, USA, aged 50 years and older. We did a serum free light-chain assay on all samples with sufficient serum remaining, and immunofixation electrophoresis was done for all samples with an abnormal free light-chain ratio or abnormal protein electrophoresis results from the original study. Light-chain MGUS was defined as an abnormal free light-chain ratio with no IgH expression, plus increased concentration of the involved light chain. We calculated age-specific and sex-specific prevalence and rates of progression to lymphoproliferative disorders for light-chain and conventional MGUS and assessed incidence of renal disorders in patients with light-chain MGUS.

Findings

610 (3.3%) of 18,357 people tested had an abnormal free light-chain ratio, of whom 213 had IgH expression that was diagnostic of conventional MGUS. 146 of the remaining 397 individuals had an increase of at least one free light chain and met criteria for light-chain MGUS. Prevalence of light-chain MGUS was 0.8% (95% CI 0.7–0.9), contributing to an overall MGUS prevalence of 4.2% (3.9–4.5). Risk of progression to multiple myeloma in patients with light-chain MGUS was 0.3% (0.1–0.8) per 100 person-years. 30 (23%) of 129 patients with light-chain MGUS were diagnosed with renal disease.

Interpretation

We define a clinical entity representing the light-chain equivalent of conventional MGUS and posing a risk of progression to light-chain multiple myeloma and related disorders.

### Association of elevated serumfree light chains with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis [^111vQHK6]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Free lightchain testing

Heparinized plasma or serum samples were tested using the sFLC assay (FREELITE™, The Binding Site Ltd. Birmingham, UK) to measure κ and λ immunoglobulin FLC levels at either the Mayo Clinic or National Cancer Institute (NCI). Prior studies have shown the high intraclass correlation between FLC measures using fresh and stored serum and for the FREELITE™ kappa and lambda free light chains assay; both EDTA-plasma and lithium heparin-plasma can serve as acceptable substitutes for serum. As previously described, the analytic sensitivity for the nephelometric FLC assay is 0.1 mg/L for a monoclonal κ or λ FLC. For samples analyzed at both NCI and Mayo Clinic, elevated FLC was defined as a κ or λ level above the reference range (κ > 19.4 mg/L, λ > 26.3 mg/L). Likewise, an elevated FLC was considered monoclonal if the rFLC (κ / λ) was outside of the normal range of 0.26–1.65. Elevated FLC levels with normal rFLC (κ / λ) were considered as polyclonal. Patients with normal FLC levels but an abnormal rFLC (κ / λ) were considered to have ratio-only FLC abnormalities and not considered in the evaluation of elevated FLC. We also evaluated the absolute value or sum of the free light chains, which has utility in non-clonal disease situations and has been shown to predict survival in the general population. The timing of the plasma or serum samples was a median of 2 months between diagnosis date and blood draw date for sporadic CLL cases (N = 302) (range = (0 years–5.7 years), IQR = (2 weeks–9 months)), and a median 18 months between diagnosis and blood draw date for familial CLL cases (N = 154) (range = (0 years–25 years), IQR = (6 months–4.2 years)). Additionally, the FLC was measured in the baseline sample for the majority of subjects, therefore corresponding baseline MBL status was used. Some of the subjects may have had MBL identified in a follow-up sample, but for this study we use the MBL status at the time of the FLC measurement.

### Serum free light chain measurement aids the diagnosis of myeloma in patients with severe renal failure [^111E2ZYc]. BMC Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of this study was to assess serum free light chain immunoassays as an aid in the diagnosis of multiple myeloma in patients with severe renal failure. All 41 patients who were diagnosed with multiple myeloma were identified as abnormal using the assays. The assays indicate the presence of monoclonal FLCs by comparing the quantitative measurement of κ FLCs with λ FLCs, as a κ/λ FLC ratio. In patients with monoclonal κ FLC production the ratio is increased and in patients with monoclonal λ FLC the ratio is decreased. The sensitivity of the assays in this setting (100%) was not unexpected as previous studies have reported greater sensitivity for serum versus urine detection of monoclonal FLC in both myeloma and AL amyloidosis.

Before serum FLC assays became available, urine analysis was the preferred method for identifying monoclonal FLC production in routine haematological screens for multiple myeloma and other lymphoproliferative disorders. However, the collection of urine samples, particularly 24 hour collections, is frequently problematic. In one screening study, urine samples were lacking for more than half the population and in our study population urine samples were only provided for 24 of 41 myeloma patients. In an analysis of 428 patients with monoclonal FLCs in their urine, Katzmann et al found that the combination of serum electrophoresis tests and serum FLC analysis identified all patients requiring treatment and could, therefore, remove the requirement for urine analysis when screening. Notably, the urine from one of the myeloma patients in our study was reported as normal despite a clearly abnormal serum FLC concentration. This study, therefore, provides further evidence that serum FLC assays may have greater utility for identifying monoclonal FLC production than urine analysis.

### The cumulative amount of serum-free light chain is a strong prognosticator in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^115YEnqe]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Identification of patients at risk of early disease progression is the mainstay of tailored management in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although application of established biomarkers is limited by intrinsic detection/readout complexities, abnormality of κ and λ serum-free light chain ratio [sFLC (κ/λ)] was proposed as a straightforward prognosticator in CLL. By analyzing 449 therapy-naive patients, we show that an abnormal sFLC(κ/λ), along with CD38, ZAP-70, IGHV mutations, cytogenetics and stage, independently predicts treatment-free survival (TFS) but becomes prognostically irrelevant if the cumulative amount of clonal and nonclonal FLCs [sFLC(κ + λ)], a variable associated with cytogenetic risk, exceeds the threshold of 60.6 mg/mL. Patients with sFLC(κ + λ) above cut-off displayed a poorer TFS outcome, irrespective of sFLC(κ/λ). Only ZAP-70, cytogenetics, stage, and TFS remained associated with sFLC(κ + λ) in a multivariate model. By assigning 1 point each for these variables, the 3-year probability of TFS was 94.8%, 84.5%, 61.6%, and 21.1% for patients scoring 0, 1, 2, and 3 + 4, respectively (P < .0001). These data, and the demonstration that monoclonal and polyclonal B cells concur to FLC synthesis in tumor tissues, suggest that sFLC(κ/λ) and sFLC(κ + λ) mirror distinct biologic processes in CLL. sFLC(κ + λ) assessment represents a sensitive and cost-effective tool for identifying CLL patients requiring early treatment.

### Polyclonal serum free light chain elevation is associated with increased risk of monoclonal gammopathies [^113V1yRM]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Much has been learned in terms of the risk factors for progression from MGUS to smoldering multiple myeloma and active multiple myeloma. It is well-known that all patients with myeloma have a preceding phase of MGUS that can exist upto 35 years before patients develop active disease. Less is known regarding the development of MGUS, in terms of risk factors and most importantly biomarkers for its development in normal individuals. Epidemiological studies have suggested multiple risk factors for development of monoclonal gammopathies, including exposure to hydrocarbons, pesticides, and radiation.– A genetic predisposition has been highlighted by the increased prevalence of MGUS in the African–American population, who has a 2 to 3 full higher risk compared with Caucasians. – In addition, familial studies have demonstrated a higher risk of MGUS in first-degree relatives of patients with myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies.

### IgG4-related disease: what a hematologist needs to know [^1114vrLW]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia

As for eosinophilia, IgG4-RD represents an important new diagnostic consideration in patients with hypergammaglobulinemia. An elevated serum IgG4 level, often accompanied by an increase in IgG1, causes polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Rarely, this elevation can be sufficient to result in polyclonal hyperviscosity syndrome. It is not known what causes the exuberant production of IgG4 immunoglobulins, currently considered an epiphenomenon rather than a contributor to the pathogenesis of the disease. Not surprisingly, the serum free light chains tend to be abnormally elevated. IgE is often markedly increased, particularly in patients with eosinophilia and atopy, whereas IgA and IgM levels are normal or modestly elevated. Serum IgG4 typically runs in the fast gamma or beta-gamma region on the serum protein electrophoresis, and thus the typical electrophoretic profile of a patient with IgG4-RD demonstrates polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia with beta-gamma bridging. This sometimes prominent pattern is dependent on IgG4 concentration and is highlighted in Figure 3. The hypergammaglobulinemia can be mistaken for a polyclonal increase in IgA, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or "biclonal" IgG kappa and lambda gammopathy, as laboratory physicians may not be familiar with the dense bands of IgG-lambda and kappa which in fact represent polyclonal IgG4. Some patients have even been treated for myeloma before subsequently being found to have IgG4-RD as the cause of their protein abnormalities, plasmacytosis and renal disease. Laboratory physicians must, therefore, consider the differential diagnosis of beta-gamma bridging and order or suggest additional investigations to clarify clonality and heavy chain composition where necessary.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cardiac amyloidosis, more specifically with respect to testing for monoclonal protein, ARC 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain the following three tests to screen for the presence of a monoclonal protein in patients with symptoms, ECG, echocardiography, MRI, or biomarkers suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis:

- serum kappa/lambda free light chain ratio (abnormal if the ratio is < 0.26 or > 1.65)

- serum protein immunofixation (abnormal if monoclonal protein is detected)

- urine protein immunofixation (abnormal if monoclonal protein is detected).

### Prognostic utility of intact immunoglobulin Ig' κ / Ig' λ ratios in multiple myeloma patients [^116gTSqP]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

To determine whether isotype matched immunoglobulin (Ig; Ig′κ/Ig′λ) ratios had prognostic significance in patients with intact Ig multiple myeloma (MM). Novel immunoassays measuring serum concentrations of the Ig heavy chain/light chain (HLC) subsets IgGκ, IgGλ, IgAκ and IgAλ were compared with monoclonal protein ('M-spike') quantification by serum protein electrophoresis, β 2 -microglobulin (β 2 -M), albumin, serum free light chain (FLC) and cytogenetic markers in relation to outcome in 339 MM patients. Abnormal IgGκ/IgGλ and IgAκ/IgAλ ratios present in the respective tumor isotypes at clinical presentation were predictive of shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio (HR) 1.9; P = 0.0002), predominantly due to the suppression of the uninvolved (polyclonal) Ig of the same isotype as the tumor (HR 1.8; P = 0.002). No significant associations were observed between PFS and M-spike concentrations, suppression of non-tumor Igs of different isotypes or FLC κ/λ ratios. β 2 -M and HLC ratios were independently prognostic (P = 0.045 and P = 0.001). A staging system using β 2 -M and extreme HLC ratios (< 0.01 or > 200) had greater prognostic value than the widely used ISS staging system (HR 1.7; P = 0.00002 vs HR 1.3; P = 0.017). These results suggest that HLC ratios may have a role in clinical management of MM.

### Comparative evaluation of involved free light chain and monoclonal spike as markers for progression from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to multiple myeloma [^115yu5ts]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is currently defined as a premalignant clonal plasma cell disorder characterized by production of a serum monoclonal protein. It is observed in 3.2% of those aged > 50 years 1 and is diagnosed incidentally in routine laboratory tests. It is considered to be a precursor‐stage of multiple myeloma (MM), and in 1% of patients per year, 2 progresses to MM, but also to other plasma cell disorders such as light‐chain amyloidosis or other lymphoproliferative diseases including Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance often precedes MM with a constant annual risk, thus, life‐long follow‐up is necessary. 3, 4 Several risk factors associated with progression to MM have been suggested, with a non‐IgG M‐protein, 5, 6 M‐spike > 1.5 g/dL 5, 6 and abnormal serum free light chain (sFLC) ratios (FLCr) 6 incorporated into current International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) risk criteria. 2 Evolving M‐protein (increasing levels over time) has been suggested as a risk factor in smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) in smaller retrospective studies. 7, 8, 9 Furthermore, it has been reported that MGUS patients that progress to MM convert from low/intermediate‐risk to high‐risk MGUS prior to the MM diagnosis. 10

Performance of Standard Reference Intervals

Standard reference intervals yielded a high rate of aberrant results in the cohort (Figure 1), with 17.5% of κ FLC, 4.0% of λ FLC, and 3.7% of the FLC ratios classified as abnormal. The distribution of abnormal results was predominantly above the upper limit of normal for all 3 parameters, with 17.5% (n = 7313) having high κ FLC and 0.01% (n = 3) low κ FLC, 3.7% (n = 1525) having high λ FLC and 0.3% (n = 143) low λ FLC, and 3.6% (n = 1505) having a high FLC ratio and 0.1% (n = 38) a low ratio. The crude rate of LC-MGUS using the standard reference intervals in this subpopulation with preserved kidney function was 2.0% (n = 850), of whom 813 had κ LC-MGUS and 37 had λ LC-MGUS. Combining the standard reference intervals for κ FLC, λ FLC, and FLC ratio in those with eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or greater with the iStopMM kidney reference intervals for individuals with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, the whole-group prevalence of LC-MGUS was 1.54% (95% CI, 1.46–1.63). The prevalence of κ LC-MGUS was 1.47% (95% CI, 1.39–1.55), and the prevalence of λ LC-MGUS was 0.07% (95% CI, 0.05–0.09).

### Evidence of serum immunoglobulin abnormalities up to 9.8 years before diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a prospective study [^114g2asV]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Immune-related deficiencies are well-known complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although recent data indicate that almost all CLL patients are preceded by a monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis precursor state, patterns of immune defects preceding CLL diagnosis are unclear. We identified 109 persons who developed CLL from the prospective and nationwide Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial with 77 469 participants, with serially collected prediagnostic serum samples. We assayed monoclonal (M)-proteins, kappa/lambda free light chains (FLCs) in prediagnostic obtained up to 9.8 years before CLL diagnosis. The prevalence of an abnormal FLC ratio, M-protein, and hypogamma-globulinemia before CLL diagnosis was 38% (95% confidence interval, 29%-47%), 13% (7%-21%), and 3% (1%-8%), respectively. M-proteins and abnormal FLC ratios were detected up to 9.8 years before CLL diagnosis in a total of 48 persons (44%). Hypogammaglobulinemia was not present until 3 years before the diagnosis of CLL. Among 37 patients with information on tumor cell immunophenotype, an association between immunophenotype and involved FLC (P = .024, Fisher exact test) was observed. Among 61 persons with a normal FLC ratio and without an M-protein, 17 had elevated kappa and/or lambda FLC levels, indicating polyclonal B-cell activation in 17 of 109 (16%) patients. These findings support a role for chronic immune stimulation in CLL genesis.

### Use of clinical decision support to improve the laboratory evaluation of monoclonal gammopathies [^1119c5Y2]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

There is considerable variation in ordering practices for the initial laboratory evaluation of monoclonal gammopathies (MGs) despite clear society guidelines to include serum free light chain (sFLC) testing. We assessed the ability of a clinical decision support (CDS) alert to improve guideline compliance and analyzed its clinical impact.

Methods

We designed and deployed a targeted CDS alert to educate and prompt providers to order an sFLC assay when ordering serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) testing.

Results

The alert was highly effective at increasing the co-ordering of SPEP and sFLC testing. Preimplementation, 62.8% of all SPEP evaluations included sFLC testing, while nearly 90% of evaluations included an sFLC assay postimplementation. In patients with no prior sFLC testing, analysis of sFLC orders prompted by the alert led to the determination that 28.9% (800/2,769) of these patients had an abnormal κ/λ ratio. In 452 of these patients, the sFLC assay provided the only laboratory evidence of a monoclonal protein. Moreover, within this population, there were numerous instances of new diagnoses of multiple myeloma and other MGs.

Conclusions

The CDS alert increased compliance with society guidelines and improved the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected MGs.

### The significance of free light-chain ratio in light-chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a flow cytometry sub-study of the iStopMM screening study [^114aAL46]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Light-chain (LC) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a precursor of multiple myeloma (MM) and related conditions. LC-MGUS is characterized by free light-chain (FLC) levels outside defined reference intervals, indirectly indicating underlying plasma cell (PC) monoclonality. Next-generation flow cytometry (NGF) was used to evaluate clonal PC presence in bone marrow (BM) samples from individuals with LC-MGUS in the iStopMM study, aiming to assess the predictive value of the FLC ratio for clonal PC presence and its prognostic implications. BM samples from 61 individuals with LC monoclonal gammopathy were analyzed. Clonal plasma cells were detected in 53.6% of LC-MGUS samples (n = 28) and in all samples from individuals with more advanced conditions (n = 33). The FLC ratio was predictive of clonal PC presence for kappa-involved FLC ratios (p < 0.05; n = 42), with an optimal cutoff of 3.15 (96.7% sensitivity, 91.7% specificity). Of 195 individuals with kappa-involved LC-MGUS in follow-up within the iStopMM study, none with FLC ratios > 1.65 to 3.15 progressed to MM (n = 124), whereas 4/71 (5.6%) with FLC ratios > 3.15 progressed over median follow-up of 55 months. These findings support using a kappa-involved FLC ratio cutoff of > 3.15 to more accurately identify individuals at increased risk of developing symptomatic PC disorders.

A 33-year-old man with overall renal function in the lower normal range had daily excretion in the urine of between 31 and 70 gm of protein composed entirely of free monoclonal K light chains. K light chains were also present in the serum. Serum protein electrophoresis and findings on bone marrow and lymph node biopsy were diagnostic of light chain disease. Amyloid was absent from renal tissue. General clinical improvement and almost total disappearance of protein from the urine followed treatment with phenylalanine mustard.

### Elevated serum free light chains are associated with event-free and overall survival in two independent cohorts of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma… [^112a7JPw]. ASCO (2011). Low credibility.

Results Elevated FLC or abnormal κ: λ FLC ratio was present in 32% and 14% of patients, respectively. Patients with elevated FLC had an inferior OS and EFS in both cohorts compared with patients with normal FLC and elevated FLC as a κ concentration higher than 1. 94 mg/dL or λ concentration higher than
2. 63 mg/dL based on the published normal ranges for Mayo Medical Laboratories 25and as used in previous studies. 9–19. Statistical Analyses The primary analysis was to assess the association of FLC concentrations and abnormal κ: λ FLC ratio with EFS and OS for DLBCL. FLC concentrations were examined as continuous variables on the log scale.

For analysis purposes, due to the biologic potential for a monoclonal increase in one light chain but not the other, elevated FLC was defined as having a λ and/or κ concentration above the established Mayo Medical Laboratories normal range. Increased serum FLC was strongly associated with an inferior outcome and remained significant after adjusting for IPI. Abnormal κ: λ FLC ratio, however, was only modestly associated with outcome across all patients, with the association only related to a concomitant elevated FLC. Patients with abnormal κ: λ FLC ratio without an elevation of either chain should be considered normal for risk. We defined elevated FLC as a concentration above the published normal range for either κ and/or λ. This definition captures patients with either a monoclonal or polyclonal FLC expansion, as outcome was similarly poor for each type of FLC expansion.

Examination of the hazard ratio across the continuous range of each light chain shows an increase in risk for high values of κ, λ, as well as total FLC. There are several plausible causes of elevated FLC in patients with DLBCL. Host effects, such as renal dysfunction, .
