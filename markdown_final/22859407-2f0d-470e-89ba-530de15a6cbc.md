## Question

Painful intercourse due to vaginal atrophy treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to treat painful intercourse due to vaginal atrophy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and characterizing the pain. Then, I should verify first-line nonhormonal options and their limits. Next, I will review when to escalate to local estrogen, which formulation to choose, dosing, and safety. After that, I need to consider alternatives like ospemifene and vaginal DHEA, especially for patients with a history of breast cancer. I will then examine emerging options such as energy-based devices and injectables, and finally outline monitoring, follow-up, and patient education to close the loop on care.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and characterize the pain carefully, because dyspareunia has a broad differential and I need to ensure we are truly dealing with genitourinary syndrome of menopause rather than vulvodynia, vaginismus, endometriosis, pelvic floor dysfunction, or infection. I should take a focused sexual and menopausal history, inspect the vulva and vagina for pallor, dryness, loss of rugae, petechiae, and perform a gentle cotton-swab mapping to distinguish focal vestibular pain from diffuse atrophic tenderness, while also screening for urinary symptoms that often coexist with GSM. Wait, let me verify the epidemiology to set pretest probability: GSM affects roughly 27% to 84% of postmenopausal women, with dyspareunia and dryness being the most frequent moderate-to-severe complaints, which supports GSM as a leading cause of postmenopausal dyspareunia when the exam is concordant [^11384iHQ] [^111HYfxb].

> Next, I should review first-line nonhormonal therapy because many patients prefer to start conservatively and guidelines endorse lubricants and moisturizers as initial management. I need to ensure I recommend water- or silicone-based lubricants for sexual activity and a vaginal moisturizer applied at least twice weekly for baseline hydration; let me double-check that both NAMS and the Endocrine Society align here, and yes, they do. Hold on, I should verify expectations: lubricants and moisturizers improve comfort but do not reverse atrophic histology, so persistent or moderate-to-severe symptoms warrant escalation beyond this step [^1118m8Ep] [^116Emjai] [^113HupWX].

> If symptoms persist despite optimized nonhormonal therapy, I should confirm candidacy for local vaginal estrogen and then select a formulation based on patient preference and adherence considerations. Low-dose vaginal estrogen is guideline-preferred when GSM is the only bothersome menopausal symptom because systemic absorption is minimal at labeled low doses and efficacy is high. Let me consider the options: a sustained-release estradiol ring (e.g. Estring) changed every 90 days, a low-dose estradiol tablet (10 mcg) used nightly for two weeks then twice weekly, or conjugated equine estrogen cream with an initial intensive phase followed by maintenance; I should confirm that comparative data show similar symptom relief across forms, which Cochrane suggests, while noting some signals that creams may be associated with more endometrial thickening than rings, likely due to higher delivered dose. I need to ensure I counsel on correct use and hygiene, especially with applicators, to minimize mess and improve adherence [^114BBpqy] [^116QbYip] [^113iJv4F].

> Now, I will examine dosing strategy and safety, and I should double-check whether routine endometrial surveillance is needed. For initiation, a common approach is nightly dosing for 1 to 2 weeks, then taper to twice-weekly maintenance as symptoms improve; many patients continue therapy as long as symptoms persist, which is supported by NAMS. Wait, let me verify endometrial risk: with low-dose local estrogen, clinically meaningful systemic absorption is uncommon and routine endometrial surveillance is not recommended for asymptomatic users, though any postmenopausal bleeding warrants prompt evaluation for endometrial pathology. I should also confirm that adding a progestogen is not indicated with low-dose local estrogen, which the Endocrine Society explicitly states, and I should reinforce this to avoid unnecessary hormones [^114uHW8s] [^113hcVn2] [^113hcVn2] [^114XRgd9].

> But wait, what if the patient has a history of hormone-sensitive breast cancer or is on endocrine therapy? I need to ensure shared decision-making with oncology before prescribing local estrogen. Guidelines suggest that if nonhormonal measures fail, low-dose vaginal estrogen can be considered in breast cancer survivors after oncologic consultation, acknowledging uncertainty and the need for individualized risk–benefit discussion. Let me reconsider alternatives in this setting: ospemifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator with vaginal estrogenic effects, is FDA-approved for moderate-to-severe dyspareunia and can be offered as a non-estrogen hormonal option; vaginal DHEA ovules are another second-line choice endorsed by contemporary guidelines. I should confirm that ospemifene improves vaginal pH, parabasal cells, and dyspareunia, which it does in systematic reviews, while still discussing endometrial safety data gaps beyond one year [^114Go1z6] [^112DF5rR] [^111ZAj2T] [^113HDMhN] [^113TTHoh] [^116hQMDK].

> Next, I should review what to do if local therapy is contraindicated, declined, or ineffective. Energy-based devices such as fractional CO₂ or radiofrequency have been explored, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: high-quality evidence is limited, professional societies caution against routine use outside trials, and consensus statements emphasize that medium- and long-term efficacy and safety remain unproven. I need to ensure patients understand that while small studies and preference trials suggest benefit, these devices should generally be reserved for select cases after careful counseling, and combined therapy sequences with local estrogen or moisturizers are still investigational [^111Ykr2P] [^1152E2eb] [^1161w6Ub] [^114DBZXc] [^112xcQ2c].

> I will now examine injectable options and other adjuncts briefly, but I should confirm the evidence level. Platelet-rich plasma, hyaluronic acid, autologous fat, and botulinum toxin have been described for vaginal wall injection, mainly for mild atrophy or as adjuncts, yet there are no robust randomized trials establishing efficacy or standardized safety protocols, and vascular complications have been reported. Hold on, I should verify that these remain experimental and not first-line, which aligns with current reviews calling for further study and standardization before routine adoption [^112hqN5M].

> Let me think about monitoring and follow-up, because I need to ensure we close the loop on response and safety. I should reassess at about 3 months to confirm symptom improvement, adherence, and tolerability, then continue periodic review at 6 to 12 month intervals as long as therapy continues. I should double-check that any new postmenopausal bleeding mandates endometrial evaluation, and I should screen for vaginal irritation, discharge changes, or infection at each visit. If dyspareunia persists despite appropriate local therapy, I should reconsider the differential diagnosis and evaluate for pelvic floor dysfunction, vulvodynia, or other pain generators, potentially involving pelvic floor physical therapy or sexual health counseling [^114XRgd9] [^11384iHQ] [^113QYits].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient education addresses barriers to care and sets realistic expectations. Many women are unaware that GSM is a treatable medical condition and avoid discussing symptoms; I should proactively initiate the conversation, explain the chronic progressive nature of GSM, and clarify that effective therapies exist. Let me verify that surveys consistently show underrecognition and undertreatment, which supports routine screening and counseling. I should also review proper product use, storage, and hygiene, and encourage ongoing sexual activity when feasible because it helps maintain vaginal elasticity and comfort, reinforcing a biopsychosocial approach to sexual health after menopause [^1166fmbg] [^116R7aBg] [^112gomwN] [^114qXsxc].

Painful intercourse from vaginal atrophy is best managed with a **stepwise approach**: start with nonhormonal lubricants and moisturizers [^113HupWX]; if symptoms persist, use low-dose local estrogen (cream, tablet, or ring) [^114BBpqy] [^113hcVn2]; and consider ospemifene or vaginal DHEA if estrogen is contraindicated or ineffective [^114APRHg] [^113TTHoh]. Local estrogen is **highly effective and safe** [^116QbYip], with minimal systemic absorption and no need for routine progestogen [^115m3wmE]; ospemifene and DHEA are effective alternatives [^116hQMDK] [^111HYfxb]. Energy-based devices are not recommended outside trials due to limited evidence [^111Ykr2P] [^1152E2eb]. Regular sexual activity and pelvic floor therapy can improve outcomes [^112gomwN] [^11384iHQ].

---

## Non-hormonal therapies (first-line)

Non-hormonal options are **recommended first-line** for mild symptoms or for patients who prefer to avoid hormones [^113HupWX] [^1118m8Ep].

- **Vaginal lubricants**: Water-based or silicone-based lubricants reduce friction and discomfort during intercourse [^11574g8X] [^114u1m4R].

- **Vaginal moisturizers**: Regular use (2–3 times weekly) improves dryness, itching, and dyspareunia [^116Emjai] [^111LvDn9].

- **Pelvic floor physical therapy**: Reduces pain and improves sexual function by addressing muscle tension and dysfunction [^notfound].

---

## Hormonal therapies (second-line)

Hormonal therapies are **indicated for moderate-to-severe symptoms** or when non-hormonal measures fail [^114BBpqy] [^111E5hsy].

---

### Local estrogen therapy

Local estrogen is the **most effective treatment** for vaginal atrophy, with minimal systemic absorption and a favorable safety profile [^112tLDqM] [^113hcVn2].

- **Forms**: Creams, tablets, and rings are available; all are effective, and choice depends on patient preference and adherence [^116QbYip] [^113hcVn2].

- **Efficacy**: Rapid symptom relief (within 2–4 weeks) with continued improvement over 3–6 months [^notfound].

- **Safety**: Minimal systemic absorption; no need for routine progestogen or endometrial surveillance in asymptomatic women [^115m3wmE] [^113hcVn2].

- **Duration**: Treatment can be continued as long as symptoms persist, with periodic reassessment [^114uHW8s] [^111VhfSq].

---

### Systemic estrogen therapy

Systemic estrogen is **considered when additional menopausal symptoms** are present [^1146ThMd]. It is effective for vaginal atrophy but carries higher systemic risks than local therapy [^1146ThMd] [^1178t9JH].

---

## Alternative pharmacologic therapies

Alternative therapies are **options for patients who cannot or prefer not to use estrogen**.

- **Ospemifene**: A selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) effective for moderate-to-severe dyspareunia; non-hormonal alternative to estrogen [^114APRHg] [^116hQMDK].

- **Vaginal DHEA**: Intravaginal DHEA restores local estrogen and androgen levels, improving symptoms without significant systemic absorption [^111HYfxb] [^115ctiVx].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies such as energy-based devices (laser, radiofrequency) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections are under investigation. Current evidence is **limited**, and these therapies are **not recommended for routine use** outside clinical trials [^111Ykr2P] [^1152E2eb] [^112hqN5M].

---

## Lifestyle modifications and patient education

Lifestyle measures and education **improve adherence and outcomes**. Regular sexual activity helps maintain vaginal elasticity and lubrication [^notfound], and patient education about GSM, treatment options, and adherence improves satisfaction and results [^114qXsxc] [^113azrf8].

---

## Summary of treatment options

| **Treatment option** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Lubricants/moisturizers | Moderate | High | First-line; mild symptoms |
| Local estrogen | High | High | Second-line; moderate-severe symptoms |
| Ospemifene | High | Moderate | Alternative to estrogen |
| Vaginal DHEA | High | High | Alternative to estrogen |
| Systemic estrogen | High | Moderate | Multiple menopausal symptoms |
| Energy-based devices | Limited | Unknown | Experimental |

---

Painful intercourse from vaginal atrophy is managed with a **stepwise approach**: start with non-hormonal lubricants and moisturizers, escalate to local estrogen if needed, and consider ospemifene or vaginal DHEA if estrogen is contraindicated. Local estrogen is **highly effective and safe**, with minimal systemic absorption and no need for routine progestogen [^113hcVn2] [^115m3wmE].

### An individualized approach to the management of vaginal atrophy in Latin America [^114qXsxc]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

In the absence of guidelines specific for Latin America, a region where the impact of menopause is becoming increasingly important, an evidence-based specialist opinion on management of vaginal atrophy will help improve outcomes.

Methods

An advisory board meeting was convened in São Paulo, Brazil, to discuss practical recommendations for managing vaginal atrophy in women in Latin America. Before the meeting, physicians considered various aspects of the condition, summarizing information accordingly. This information was discussed during the meeting. The expert consensus is now summarized.

Results

In Latin America, given the relatively early age of menopause, it will be beneficial to raise awareness of vaginal atrophy among women before they enter menopause, considering cultural attitudes and involving partners as appropriate. Women should be advised about lifestyle modifications, including attention to genital hygiene, clothing, and sexual activity, and encouraged to seek help as soon as they experience vaginal discomfort. Although treatment can be started at any time, prompt treatment is preferable. A range of treatments is available. By addressing the underlying pathology, local estrogen therapy can provide effective symptom relief, with choice of preparation guided by patient preference. An individualized treatment approach should be considered, giving attention to patients' specific situations.

Conclusions

It is critical that women are empowered to understand vaginal atrophy. Educating women and healthcare providers to engage in open dialogue will facilitate appreciation of the benefits and means of maintaining urogenital health, helping to improve outcomes in middle age and beyond. Women should receive this education before menopause.

### Recognizing and treating urogenital atrophy in postmenopausal women [^113zzX5L]. Journal of Women's Health (2010). Low credibility.

Urogenital atrophy resulting from postmenopausal estrogen deficiency has numerous clinical effects, including vaginal dryness, sexual dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), all of which can cause significant distress and reduction in quality of life. Although nearly one third to one half of postmenopausal women experience these symptoms, they are often overlooked because patients may be reluctant to discuss them and clinicians fail to screen for them. As these symptoms are unlikely to resolve without treatment, the prompt diagnosis and treatment of urogenital atrophy is essential. Estrogen therapy, administered either locally or systemically, provides significant relief from symptoms related to urogenital atrophy. However, systemic estrogen therapy is contraindicated in some women and may not be accepted in women without other menopausal symptoms. Local low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy, in the form of vaginal estrogen tablets, creams, or rings, has been shown to reduce dyspareunia and vaginal dryness, restore vaginal pH, and restore normal vaginal cytology. All forms of vaginal estrogen therapy are effective and well tolerated, although vaginal tablets and rings may have fewer adverse effects and have higher rates of adherence than creams.

This article focuses on the cause, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis of, and treatment options for vasomotor symptoms. In addition, it summarizes important points for health care providers caring for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with regard to health maintenance, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and vaginal atrophy. Treatment options for hot flashes with variable effectiveness include systemic hormone therapy (estrogen/progestogen), nonhormonal pharmacologic therapies (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, clonidine, gabapentin), and nonpharmacologic therapy options (behavioral changes, acupuncture). Risks and benefits as well as contraindications for hormone therapy are further discussed.

### Diagnosis and treatment of atrophic vaginitis… [^112iKoee]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Presenting Signs and Symptoms A long-term decrease in estrogen stimulation is generally required before symptoms of atrophic vaginitis arise. A decrease in vaginal lubrication is an early hallmark of hormone insufficiency. Treatment ESTROGEN REPLACEMENT Because the lack of circulating, natural estrogens is the primary cause of atrophic vaginitis, hormone replacement therapy is the most logical choice of treatment and has proved to be effective in the restoration of anatomy and the resolution of symptoms. Estrogen replacement restores normal pH levels and thickens and revascularizes the epithelium. Adequate estrogen replacement therapy increases the number of superficial cells. Systemic administration of estrogen has been shown to have a therapeutic effect on symptoms of atrophic vaginitis. Additional advantages of systemic administration include a decrease in postmenopausal bone loss and alleviation of vasomotor dysfunction.

Standard dosages of systemic estrogen, however, may not eliminate the symptoms of atrophic vaginitis in 10 to 25 percent of patients. 16 Systemic estrogen in higher dosages may be necessary to alleviate symptoms. Some women require coadministration of a vaginal estrogen product that is applied locally. Up to 24 months of therapy may be necessary to totally eradicate dryness; however, some patients do not fully respond even to this treatment regimen. 10 Other treatment options include transvaginal delivery of estrogen in the form of creams, pessaries or a hormone-releasing ring. Treatment with a low-dose transvaginal estrogen has proved effective in relieving symptoms without causing significant proliferation of the vaginal epithelium.

Negative effects of transvaginal treatment include patient dislike of vaginal manipulation, less prevention of postmenopausal bone loss and vasomotor dysfunction, decreased control of absorption with vaginal creams compared to oral and transdermal delivery, and irregular treatment intervals that may cause patients to forget to administer the treatment.
6. Transvaginal rings offer convenience, constancy of hormonal concentration in the blood stream and a therapeutic value equivalent to creams without the need for frequent application. Control of hormone dosage is manipulated by changing the surface area of the ring. Atrophic vaginitis symptoms are relieved without stimulation of endometrial proliferation, thereby eliminating the need to add opposing progestogen to the regimen. 18 Rings may be removed and reinserted by most patients with little difficulty and can be worn during coitus.

### The women's EMPOWER survey: identifying women's perceptions on vulvar and vaginal atrophy and its treatment [^112fMqJT]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) affects up to two thirds of postmenopausal women, but most symptomatic women do not receive prescription therapy.

Aim

To evaluate postmenopausal women's perceptions of VVA and treatment options for symptoms in the Women's EMPOWER survey.

Methods

The Rose Research firm conducted an internet survey of female consumers provided by Lightspeed Global Market Insite. Women at least 45 years of age who reported symptoms of VVA and residing in the United States were recruited.

Main Outcome Measures

Survey results were compiled and analyzed by all women and by treatment subgroups.

Results

Respondents (N = 1,858) had a median age of 58 years (range = 45–90). Only 7% currently used prescribed VVA therapies (local estrogen therapies or oral selective estrogen receptor modulators), whereas 18% were former users of prescribed VVA therapies, 25% used over-the-counter treatments, and 50% had never used any treatment. Many women (81%) were not aware of VVA or that it is a medical condition. Most never users (72%) had never discussed their symptoms with a health care professional (HCP). The main reason for women not to discuss their symptoms with an HCP was that they believed that VVA was just a natural part of aging and something to live with. When women spoke to an HCP about their symptoms, most (85%) initiated the discussion. Preferred sources of information were written material from the HCP's office (46%) or questionnaires to fill out before seeing the HCP (41%). The most negative attributes of hormonal products were perceived risk of systemic absorption, messiness of local creams, and the need to reuse an applicator. Overall, HCPs only recommended vaginal estrogen therapy to 23% and oral hormone therapies to 18% of women. When using vaginal estrogen therapy, less than half of women adhered to and complied with posology; only 33% to 51% of women were very to extremely satisfied with their efficacy.

Conclusion

The Women's EMPOWER survey showed that VVA continues to be an under-recognized and under-treated condition, despite recent educational initiatives. A disconnect in education, communication, and information between HCPs and their menopausal patients remains prevalent. Kingsberg S, Krychman M, Graham S, et al.

### Materials selection for the injection into vaginal wall for treatment of vaginal atrophy [^112hqN5M]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Vaginal atrophy caused by the aging process and perineal trauma has a negative impact on women. A new vaginal atrophy treatment is injection of materials into the vaginal wall, including platelet-rich plasma (PRP), autogenous fat graft (AFG), hyaluronic acid (HA), botulinum toxin (BTX), and collagen, but to date their efficacy has not been reviewed. Vaginal wall injection is available only for mild cases of vaginal atrophy or as an adjunct to vaginal surgery. PRP is used mainly to restore vaginal function, and multiple injections are needed to achieve good results in vaginal atrophy. HA, AFG, and collagen are used mainly to augment the vaginal wall. BTX injection can inhibit vaginal muscle spasm and reduce pain during sexual intercourse in patients with vaginismus. Injection of most of these materials into vaginal wall is effective and relatively safe. Vascular embolisms are the most serious complication of vaginal injection and should be prevented. In addition, there has been no randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial or discussion of methods to avoid serious complications resulting from vaginal injection. Therefore, further studies of the injection of materials into the vaginal wall to treat vaginal atrophy are required, and the procedures should be standardized to benefit more patients.

### Should I stay for local hormone therapy or should I go for radiofrequency to treat vulvovaginal atrophy? A patient preference trial [^112xcQ2c]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our study shows that RF is as effective as topical hormone treatment and could be suggested as an alternative to it, selectively in cases in which estrogens are contraindicated, not tolerated, or not effective. Treatment management should be tailored to individual goals and to patient's symptoms. From this perspective, further studies addressing the cost-effectiveness, in addition to the clinical effectiveness, of the two treatment options are needed.

### Synthetic conjugated estrogens, b (Enjuvia) [^111x2uTt]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3-month to 6-month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see BOXED WARNINGS and WARNINGS). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding.

ENJUVIA tablets are taken orally, once daily for:

The treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, associated with menopause.
ENJUVIA 0.3 mg
ENJUVIA 0.45 mg
ENJUVIA 0.625 mg
ENJUVIA 0.9 mg
ENJUVIA 1.25 mg
The treatment of moderate to severe vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse, symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, associated with menopause. When prescribing solely for the treatment of moderate to severe vaginal dryness and pain during intercourse, topical vaginal products should be considered.
ENJUVIA 0.3 mg

Patients should be started at the lowest approved dose of 0.3 mg ENJUVIA daily. Subsequent dosage adjustment (which will differ depending on the indication) may be made based upon the individual patient response. This dose should be periodically reassessed by the healthcare provider.

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^1146ThMd]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Menopause hormone therapy — overview and symptom relief benefits emphasize that systemic hormone therapy is an acceptable option for relatively young (up to age 59 or within 10 years of menopause) and healthy women who are bothered by moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, and that individualization is key with consideration of quality-of-life priorities and risk factors including age, time since menopause, and risks of blood clots, heart disease, stroke, and breast cancer. Systemic hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for most menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms and vaginal atrophy; estrogen therapy as a single agent is sufficient in women who have undergone hysterectomy, whereas progestogen therapy is required to prevent endometrial cancer when estrogen is used systemically in women with a uterus. For symptoms limited to vaginal dryness or discomfort with intercourse, local estrogen therapy is effective and preferred, and low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy is recommended in this setting.

### Resistance and barriers to local estrogen therapy in women with atrophic vaginitis [^111TSaqi]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vaginal atrophy results from a decrease in circulating estrogen and is experienced by approximately 50% of postmenopausal women. Its symptoms affect multiple dimensions of genitopelvic health, sexuality, and overall quality of life. Nonhormonal over-the-counter treatments may provide temporary symptom relief, but the condition is progressive, and hormonal treatment may be warranted.

Aim

The study aims to review the literature and discuss the impact of atrophic vaginitis and various treatment options, including the resistance and barriers to the use of local estrogen therapy for atrophic vaginitis. This article also aims to provide a greater awareness of the condition and the difficulties in communicating effectively with patients, and to provide strategies to help healthcare professionals acquire effective communication skills to initiate a candid dialogue with patients who may be suffering in silence and may benefit from therapy.

Methods

This review was based on peer-reviewed publications on the topic of atrophic vaginitis and local estrogen therapy identified from key word searches of PubMed, in addition to landmark studies/surveys and treatment guidelines/recommendations on menopause available in the literature and on the Internet.

Main Outcome Measures

The main outcomes are the impact of atrophic vaginitis and the various treatment options, including the resistance and barriers to the use of local estrogen therapy.

Results

Minimally absorbed local vaginal estrogen therapy enables administration of estrogen doses much lower than systemic doses used for vasomotor symptoms. Local therapy is also the first-line pharmacologic treatment recommended by the North American Menopause and International Menopause Societies. Despite treatment options, the sensitive nature of the condition and embarrassment may prohibit or limit many women from openly discussing symptoms with healthcare professionals. Many are hesitant to initiate hormonal treatment because of safety concerns.

Conclusions

Healthcare professionals should initiate and encourage frank and candid conversation about vaginal atrophy at annual visits and provide follow-up and treatment as needed.

### The 2020 genitourinary syndrome of menopause position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111HYfxb]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update and expand the 2013 position statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) on the management of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), of which symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) is a component.

Methods

A Panel of acknowledged experts in the field of genitourinary health reviewed the literature to evaluate new evidence on vaginal hormone therapies as well as on other management options available or in development for GSM. A search of PubMed was conducted identifying medical literature on VVA and GSM published since the 2013 position statement on the role of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for VVA in postmenopausal women. The Panel revised and added recommendations on the basis of current evidence. The Panel's conclusions and recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause affects approximately 27% to 84% of postmenopausal women and can significantly impair health, sexual function, and quality of life. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is likely underdiagnosed and undertreated. In most cases, symptoms can be effectively managed. A number of over-the-counter and government-approved prescription therapies available in the United States and Canada demonstrate effectiveness, depending on the severity of symptoms. These include vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, vaginal estrogens and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), systemic hormone therapy, and the estrogen agonist/antagonist ospemifene. Long-term studies on the endometrial safety of vaginal estrogen, vaginal DHEA, and ospemifene are lacking. There are insufficient placebo-controlled trials of energy-based therapies, including laser, to draw conclusions on efficacy and safety or to make treatment recommendations.

Conclusions

Clinicians can resolve many distressing genitourinary symptoms and improve sexual health and the quality of life of postmenopausal women by educating women about, diagnosing, and appropriately managing GSM. Choice of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms, the effectiveness and safety of treatments for the individual patient, and patient preference. Nonhormone therapies available without a prescription provide sufficient relief for most women with mild symptoms. Low-dose vaginal estrogens, vaginal DHEA, systemic estrogen therapy, and ospemifene are effective treatments for moderate to severe GSM. When low-dose vaginal estrogen or DHEA or ospemifene is administered, a progestogen is not indicated; however, endometrial safety has not been studied in clinical trials beyond 1 year. There are insufficient data at present to confirm the safety of vaginal estrogen or DHEA or ospemifene in women with breast cancer; management of GSM should consider the woman's needs and the recommendations of her oncologist.

### The MATE survey: men's perceptions and attitudes towards menopause and their role in partners' menopausal transition [^114RfLhQ]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Due to the increasing longevity of women in the United States, women may live up to 40% of their lifespan after menopause. Menopausal women have marked declines in estrogen levels and increases in follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, and often have bothersome symptoms, such as vasomotor symptoms and dyspareunia due to vulvar vaginal atrophy (VVA). Up to 75% of women are likely to be symptomatic during menopause. -

Traditionally, surveys have targeted menopausal women to assess their perceptions and attitudes regarding menopause, menopausal symptoms, and available treatment options.- To date, very few surveys have targeted women's male partners to assess their understanding of menopause, and they have been limited in scope. - The Cl arifying Vaginal Atrophy's Impact o n Se x and R elationships (CLOSER) online survey mainly explored the impact of VVA on sex, relationships, and intimacy for 1,000 couples, and reported that most men believed vaginal discomfort caused their partners to avoid intimacy, experience loss of libido, and find sex painful. A small Turkish survey of 33 married men reported that they knew very little about menopause and treatment options. Finally, another small Turkish study (n = 60) showed that men had positive attitudes toward menopause. Therefore, the awareness and attitudes of menopause shared by men are still largely unknown; yet, male partners may influence how women cope with and manage their menopausal symptoms.

The Men's perception and Attitudes Toward mEnopause (MATE) survey was designed to gauge men's awareness of menopausal symptoms and understanding of menopause and its treatment options, evaluate the impact of menopausal symptoms on men, and determine the influence of men on their partner's menopausal symptom management.

### Practical aspects in the management of vaginal atrophy and sexual dysfunction in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women [^115ZPq3i]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

The decline in circulating estrogen levels in peri- and postmenopause has a wide range of physiological effects, including atrophy of tissues in the urogenital tract. Vaginal atrophy is an important contributor to postmenopausal sexual dysfunction.

Aim

To provide a framework for clinical evaluation and clinical management of sexual dysfunction secondary to vaginal atrophy.

Method

Conduct a brief overview of literature on evaluation and treatment of vaginal atrophy, augmented with the authors' clinical observations and experience.

Results

Estrogen decline disrupts many physiological responses characteristic of sexual arousal, including smooth muscle relaxation, vasocongestion, and vaginal lubrication; genital tissues depend on continued estrogen and androgen stimulation for normal function. An upward shift in vaginal pH as the result of vaginal atrophy alters the normal vaginal flora. Reduced lubrication capability and reduced tissue elasticity, in addition to shortening and narrowing of the vaginal vault, can lead to painful and/or unpleasant intercourse. At the same time, diminished sensory response may reduce orgasmic intensity. Other contributors to peri- and postmenopausal sexual dysfunction include reduced androgen levels, aging of multiple body systems, and side-effects of medications. Workup of sexual health problems starts by taking a comprehensive sexual, medical, and psychosocial history, followed by complete physical examination and laboratory evaluation. Clinical management includes measures to preserve and enhance overall health, adjustment of medication regimes to reduce or avoid side-effects, and topical or systemic hormone supplementation with estrogens and/or androgens.

Conclusions

No single therapeutic approach is appropriate for every woman with peri- or postmenopausal sexual dysfunction; instead, treatment should be based on a comprehensive evaluation and consideration of medical and psychosocial contributors to the individual's dysfunction. Further research is required to establish optimal regimens of hormonal and nonhormonal agents, including dosages/dosage forms and duration of treatment, for specific subtypes of sexual dysfunction.

### Vaginal health in the United States: results from the vaginal health: insights, views&attitudes survey [^116R7aBg]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess US postmenopausal women's knowledge of and attitudes toward vaginal atrophy, using the Vaginal Health: Insights, Views & Attitudes survey.

Methods

Data were obtained from 3,520 postmenopausal women (aged 55–65 y) in the United States, Canada, and Europe using a structured Internet-based questionnaire. Results for US women (n = 500) are presented.

Results

Eighty percent of women had finished their menses more than 5 years previously, and 93% had experienced at least one menopausal symptom, although only 63% associated vaginal symptoms with menopause. Of those who had experienced "vaginal discomfort" (48%), vaginal dryness (85%) and pain during intercourse (52%) were most commonly reported. Eighty-two percent of women had experienced vaginal discomfort for 1 year or more. Most women (80%) considered vaginal discomfort to negatively impact their lives, particularly with regard to sexual intimacy (75%), ability to have a loving relationship (33%), and overall quality of life (25%); women also felt that it made them feel old (36%) and affected their self-esteem (26%). Of those with symptoms, 37% did not consult any healthcare professional, and 40% waited 1 year or more before doing so. Although 78% of those with vaginal discomfort used some form of treatment, this consisted mainly of lubricating gels and creams (65%); only 34% of women had used any form of hormone therapy.

Conclusions

Vaginal atrophy negatively impacts women's lives, but women lack knowledge of the subject and are hesitant to consult healthcare professionals, who should proactively initiate discussions regarding appropriate treatment options.

### The role of local vaginal estrogen for treatment of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women: 2007 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111VhfSq]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To create an evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) on the role of local vaginal estrogen therapy (ET) for the treatment of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women.

Design

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this document. A panel of clinicians and researchers acknowledged to be experts in the field of genitourinary disease was enlisted to review, synthesize, and interpret the current evidence on vaginal ET for vaginal atrophy, develop conclusions, and make recommendations. Their advice was used to assist the NAMS Board of Trustees in publishing this position statement.

Results

Randomized controlled trials, albeit limited, have shown that low-dose, local vaginal estrogen delivery is effective and well tolerated for treating vaginal atrophy. All of the low-dose vaginal estrogen products approved in the United States for treatment of vaginal atrophy are equally effective at the doses recommended in labeling.

Conclusions

The choice of therapy should be guided by clinical experience and patient preference. Progestogen is generally not indicated when low-dose estrogen is administered locally for vaginal atrophy. Data are insufficient to recommend annual endometrial surveillance in asymptomatic women using vaginal ET. Vaginal ET should be continued for women as long as distressful symptoms remain. For women treated for non-hormone-dependent cancer, management of vaginal atrophy is similar to that for women without a cancer history. For women with a history of hormone-dependent cancer, management recommendations are dependent upon each woman's preference in consultation with her oncologist.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) management — For postmenopausal women with symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy, we suggest a trial of vaginal moisturizers to be used at least twice weekly, and for women who do not produce sufficient vaginal secretions for comfortable sexual activity, we suggest vaginal lubricants. For women without a history of hormone-(estrogen) dependent cancers whose GSM symptoms, including vulvovaginal atrophy, persist despite using vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, we recommend low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. In women with a history of breast or endometrial cancer whose symptomatic GSM does not respond to nonhormonal therapies, we suggest a shared decision-making approach that includes the treating oncologist to discuss using low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. For women taking raloxifene, without a history of hormone- (estrogen) dependent cancers, who develop GSM symptoms that do not respond to nonhormonal therapies, we suggest adding low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy, and for women using low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy, we suggest against adding a progestogen (ie, no need for adding progestogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia). For women using vaginal estrogen therapy who report postmenopausal bleeding or spotting, we recommend prompt evaluation for endometrial pathology.

### Clinical consensus statement: vaginal energy-based devices [^1161w6Ub]. Urogynecology (2022). High credibility.

American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS) clinical consensus on vaginal energy-based devices — background and scope — states that although devices such as lasers are used for a variety of surgical applications, the agency has not approved their use for any specific gynecologic indication, and the document addresses vulvovaginal EBD devices including laser and radiofrequency (RF) devices. An International Continence Society/International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease Best Practice Consensus Statement concluded that laser is not recommended for routine treatment of vaginal atrophy or urinary incontinence unless treatment is part of a well-designed clinical trial or with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent, and audit. The purpose of this CCS is to convey findings concerning specific statements related to fractionated CO₂ laser, Er:YAG laser, hybrid laser, and RF for indications such as vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and lichen sclerosus, and AUGS supports efforts to assist clinicians in helping patients understand their evidence-based treatment options. Health care providers in female pelvic medicine are positioned to evaluate and manage genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), and some deliver patient services using the EBDs discussed in the FDA Safety Communication.

### Efficacy, tolerability, and endometrial safety of ospemifene compared with current therapies for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy: a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^116hQMDK]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is caused by hypoestrogenism during menopause. A wholly contained subgroup within GSM, vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) describes the changes in appearance and physiological functions of the genital tissues that may cause vulvovaginal symptoms of GSM, including vaginal dryness, burning, irritation, and sexual symptoms such as lack of lubrication, discomfort, pain, and impaired sexual function. Vulvovaginal symptoms occur in 39% to 51% of women, with 55% to 62% of symptoms categorized as moderate or severe, the most frequent being vaginal dryness and dyspareunia (ie, pain during intercourse).

Treatment goals include symptom relief and restoration of the vaginal environment to a healthy state. Nonhormone lubricants and moisturizers provide short-term relief but do not treat nor reverse the underlying condition. Considering the pathophysiology of VVA (ie, hypoestrogenism), hormonal therapy is common, which includes local estrogen therapy (ET) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) when systemic therapy is unnecessary.

Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator or estrogen agonist/antagonist indicated for treating moderate to severe dyspareunia and/or vaginal dryness. Unlike other selective estrogen receptor modulators (eg, tamoxifen, raloxifene, bazedoxifene), which have no reproducible estrogenic effects on the vagina, ospemifene binds to estrogen receptors in the vulvovaginal squamous epithelium resulting in activation of their estrogenic pathways. Ospemifene, which is approved by Health Canada, the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, increases superficial cells, while decreasing parabasal cells, vaginal pH, and the severity of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, all hallmarks of an estrogenic effect. - The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada and The North American Menopause Society guidelines recommend lubricants and moisturizers as first-line and local ET, DHEA, and ospemifene as second-line therapies. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic literature review (SLR) and network meta-analysis (NMA) to evaluate ospemifene for VVA due to menopause.

### Evaluation and differential diagnosis of dyspareunia [^1168TB1B]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Dyspareunia is genital pain associated with sexual intercourse. Although this condition has historically been defined by psychologic theories, the current treatment approach favors an integrated pain model. Identification of the initiating and promulgating factors is essential to reaching a successful diagnosis. The differential diagnoses include vaginismus, inadequate lubrication, atrophy and vulvodynia (vulvar vestibulitis). Less common etiologies are endometriosis, pelvic congestion, adhesions or infections, and adnexal pathology. Urethral disorders, cystitis and interstitial cystitis may also cause painful intercourse. The location of the pain may be described as entry or deep. Vulvodynia, atrophy, inadequate lubrication and vaginismus are associated with painful entry. Deep pain occurs with the other conditions previously noted. The physical examination may reproduce the pain, such as localized pain with vulvar vestibulitis, when the vagina is touched with a cotton swab. The involuntary spasm of vaginismus may be noted with insertion of an examining finger or speculum. Palpation of the lateral vaginal walls, uterus, adnexa and urethral structures helps identify the cause. An understanding of the present organic etiology must be integrated with an appreciation of the ongoing psychologic factors and negative expectations and attitudes that perpetuate the pain cycle.

### SOGC clinical practice guidelines. the detection and management of vaginal atrophy. number 145, may 2004 [^112gomwN]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To support the practitioner in the diagnosis of vaginal atrophy and in the management of the related symptoms.

Options

The modalities of evaluation range from basic pelvic examination, examination of the vulva, and laboratory tests.

Outcomes

A comprehensive approach to the detection of vaginal atrophy and a discussion of available therapeutic and nontherapeutic options.

Evidence

Published opinions of experts, supplemented by evidence from clinical trials, where appropriate.

Values

The quality of the Force on the Periodic Health Examination.

Benefits, Harms and Costs

Diagnosis of vaginal atrophy is often a challenge because women are unwilling to report symptoms, which have the potential to significantly decrease their quality of life. Increased clinical suspicion is the first step in the diagnosis of vaginal atrophy, which will prompt the initiation of safe therapies with proven efficacy.

Recommendations

(1) Health-care providers should routinely assess postmenopausal women for the symptoms and signs of vaginal atrophy, a common condition that exerts significant negative effects on quality of life. (III-C) (2) Regular sexual activity should be encouraged to maintain vaginal health. (II-2B) (3) Women experiencing recurrent urinary tract infections should be instructed that consumption of pure cranberry-lingonberry juice, rather than cranberry drink, will decrease their risk of urinary infections. (I-A) (4) Vaginal moisturizers applied on a regular basis have an efficacy equivalent to local hormone replacement for the treatment of local urogenital symptoms such as vaginal itching, irritation, and dyspareunia, and should be offered to women wishing to avoid the use of hormone replacement therapy. (I-A) (5) Women experiencing vaginal atrophy can be offered any of the following effective vaginal estrogen replacement therapies: conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) cream (I-A), a sustained-release intravaginal estradiol ring (I-A), or a low-dose estradiol tablet. (I-A) (6) Although systematic absorption of estrogen can occur with local preparations, there is insufficient data to recommend annual endometrial surveillance in asymptomatic women using local estrogens. (III-C) (7) For menopausal women experiencing recurrent urinary tract infections and who have no contraindication to local hormone replacement, vaginal estrogen therapy should be offered. (I-A) VALIDATION: These guidelines have been reviewed by the joint committee of Clinical Practice Gynaecology and Urogynaecology and approved by the Execute and Council of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 pilot trial evaluating a novel, vaginal softgel capsule containing solubilized estradiol [^115frBEx]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Menopause is marked by a decline in endogenous estrogen, which causes atrophic changes to occur in the genital tract. Over time, the tissue lining the vagina becomes thinner, drier, and less elastic, resulting in vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA; also known as genitourinary syndrome of menopause).VVA is generally accompanied by symptoms such as vaginal dryness, irritation, itching, dysuria, and vaginal pain or bleeding associated with sexual activity; however, early, sustained treatment can preclude irreversible declines in vaginal health. Up to 32 million women in the United States currently are suffering from symptoms of VVA, and more than 85% of this population currently receives no prescription therapy for the condition. Effective treatments designed to help relieve the pain and discomfort associated with VVA symptoms will improve the quality of life for many women.

The North American Menopause Society and the International Menopause Society recommend local vaginal estrogens when menopausal symptoms are limited to VVA. Despite the relative safety and efficacy of local vaginal treatments, consumers remain dissatisfied with the currently available local treatment options. Vaginal creams approved in the 1980s are antiquated. They require an applicator, can be unsanitary and inconvenient for women to apply, and dosing can be complicated and confusing. The creams can be messy and cause excessive discharge, leading some women to alternatively choose vaginal tablets or rings. Vaginal tablets currently on the market, however, can be difficult to use, may not fully dissolve for days, and may be inconvenient, in addition to concerns of overall treatment efficacy. Likewise, the vaginal ring may be difficult to insert and remove, may change position or dislodge, and has been shown to release an initial burst of systemic estradiol (E₂).

### Endocrine therapy for surgeons: practical pearls for managing menopausal, bone loss and sexual adverse effects [^1155QhvK]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer patients are living longer than ever before and as such the population of breast cancer survivors continues to grow. Approximately 80% of breast cancers are hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and most patients will receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant estrogen blockade, referred to as endocrine therapy. Although endocrine therapy reduces HR+ breast cancer recurrence by 30–50%, significant adverse effects pose a threat to treatment adherence. These adverse effects include vasomotor symptoms, colloquially referred to as hot flashes, bone loss, joint arthralgias, genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), previously referred to as vaginal atrophy, and low libido. This review will present the evidence-based treatments available for each of these adverse effects, including clear treatment algorithms for GSM, which is often experienced by patients but overlooked by providers. The most important takeaway is to ask open-ended questions, encourage reporting of these symptoms, and refer patients to specialty providers as needed. Surgeons may be the first to encounter these symptoms, therefore it is critical to remain informed of the treatment options.

### Should urogenital atrophy in breast cancer survivors be treated with topical estrogens? [^111NsPKQ]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

Breast cancer survivors represent a unique patient population with a high prevalence of menopausal symptoms. Given the improved longevity of cancer patients, the consequences of menopause have become an increasingly important and challenging management issue. To date, considerable attention has been paid to the management of menopausal vasomotor symptoms and bone health among breast cancer patients. As a result, numerous nonhormonal treatment options have been developed for the management of these issues. The treatment of urogenital symptoms among this population is poorly understood and relatively understudied. Although systemic or topical estrogen replacement is the most effective method for treating hypoestrogenic urogenital symptoms, women with a prior diagnosis of breast cancer are cautioned from taking exogenous estrogens in order to avoid a potential contribution to recurrent breast cancer risk. This review focuses on the urogenital consequences of estrogen deprivation therapy in breast cancer patients and provides practitioners with a simple guide of current and future strategies for managing these symptoms.

### Dyspareunia in women [^11384iHQ]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Dyspareunia is recurrent or persistent pain with sexual intercourse that causes distress. It affects approximately 10% to 20% of U.S. women. Dyspareunia may be superficial, causing pain with attempted vaginal insertion, or deep. Women with sexual pain are at increased risk of sexual dysfunction, relationship distress, diminished quality of life, anxiety, and depression. Because discussing sexual issues may be uncomfortable, clinicians should create a safe and welcoming environment when taking a sexual history, where patients describe the characteristics of the pain (e.g., location, intensity, duration). Physical examination of the external genitalia includes visual inspection and sequential pressure with a cotton swab, assessing for focal erythema or pain. A single-digit vaginal examination may identify tender pelvic floor muscles, and a bimanual examination can assess for uterine retroversion and pelvic masses. Common diagnoses include vulvodynia, inadequate lubrication, vaginal atrophy, postpartum causes, pelvic floor dysfunction, endometriosis, and vaginismus. Treatment is focused on the cause and may include lubricants, pelvic floor physical therapy, topical analgesics, vaginal estrogen, cognitive behavior therapy, vaginal dilators, modified vestibulectomy, or onabotulinumtoxinA injections.

### Efficacy and tolerability of local estrogen therapy for urogenital atrophy [^1131aF8E]. Menopause (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to identify vaginal discomfort in the form of dryness, itching, burning, and dyspareunia, which remains an inadequately addressed clinical problem for many postmenopausal women, and to describe the age or menopause-related dysfunction of the female urethral tract, which is prevalent.

Methods

Medical literature on the incidence and treatment of vulvovaginal symptoms in postmenopausal women was reviewed.

Results

Urogenital atrophy should not be considered an inevitable consequence of menopause because various hormonal and nonhormonal products are available to relieve symptoms. Estrogen deficiency is the primary cause of atrophic urogenital changes, and postmenopausal estrogen therapy is the most logical choice for treatment. All available low-dose local estrogen formulations are effective, but the optimal dose and preferred mode of estrogen administration to achieve symptom relief can vary from woman to woman. Individualization of therapy is the key to balancing the desired local effects of topical vaginal estrogens with potential systemic effects, which may or may not be desired.

Conclusions

This article reviews the use of products for the management of urogenital atrophy in terms of their efficacy, safety, and other characteristics that may influence prescribing and woman's preference.

### Vulvovaginal atrophy: current and future therapies (CME) [^115ctiVx]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vulvovaginal atrophy results from estrogen deficiency and affects a large number of postmenopausal women. Symptoms include vaginal dryness, itching, irritation, and dyspareunia.

Aim

The purpose of this review is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and acceptability of current treatment methods for vulvovaginal atrophy, as well as highlight evolving new treatment methods. Method. We conducted a review of the literature concerning treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy.

Results

All currently available low-dose local estrogen formulations are effective and yield few side effects. Fears sparked by the Women's Health Initiative, as well as recommendations by the FDA, have generated interest in the development of new treatment methods. Lower doses of existing formulations have proven to be efficacious. The use of estrogen agonists/antagonists and intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) have both been shown to positively affect vaginal atrophy symptoms without inducing endometrial proliferation.

Conclusion

Potential new treatment methods show promise to provide efficacy in treatment while avoiding unwanted side effects. Further research is needed to establish optimal treatment formulations.

### Addressing the needs of breast cancer survivors [^112Ej1EK]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Sexual Dysfunction

Sexual concerns in survivors of breast cancer can include a constellation of symptoms including vulvovaginal symptoms, decreased sexual desire, and poor body image leading to a negative impact on quality of life. The cornerstone of adjuvant treatment for early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer can extend for 5–10 years and includes therapies such as ovarian suppression in premenopausal women, tamoxifen, or an aromatase inhibitor. The extended period of estrogen lowering to below-normal postmenopausal levels and modulation of the estrogen receptor can lead to distressing symptoms such as vaginal dryness and painful intercourse. These undesirable toxicities of treatment are often under-recognized and not optimally addressed. The spectrum of gynecological manifestations is termed the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and includes dryness, burning, dysuria, and itching. These symptoms may arise due to atrophic changes in the mucosa of the vagina and vulvar area. Some over-the-counter topical therapies such as alcohol-based wipes, items with artificial fragrances, parabens, propylene alcohol, and glycerin may be irritants and further exacerbate these symptoms. The initial step is to reduce potential exposure to offending agents and addition of vaginal moisturization with simple emollients such as organic coconut oil and once burning symptoms lessen, hyaluronic acid-based moisturizers may be added. These are available as gels, creams, or suppositories. These should be used consistently several times a week. During sexual activity, silicone or water-based lubricants are effective. Women with menopausal dyspareunia following breast cancer treatment reported decreased pain with the application of liquid lidocaine to the vulvar vestibule before penetration. Also, it must be noted that generally, tamoxifen is associated with a lower risk of vaginal symptoms, vaginal atrophy, and GSM symptoms when compared to aromatase inhibitors. Therefore, a potential option for patients for patients with significant vaginal toxicity symptoms could be switching to tamoxifen.

### Vaginal estrogens for the treatment of dyspareunia [^1167x5sr]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vaginal atrophy, which is associated with vaginal itching, burning, dryness, irritation, and pain, is estimated to affect up to 40% of postmenopausal women. Estrogens play a key role in maintaining vaginal health; women with low serum estradiol are more likely to experience vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and reduced sexual activity compared with women who have higher estradiol levels.

Aims

The purpose of this review is to assess the prevalence and impact of dyspareunia, a symptom of vaginal atrophy, on the health of postmenopausal women and to evaluate treatment options using vaginal estrogens (U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approved).

Methods

Relevant published literature was identified by searching Index Medicus using the PubMed online database. The search terms dyspareunia, vaginal estrogen, vaginal hormone therapy, vaginal atrophy, and atrophic vaginitis were the focus of the literature review.

Results

Current treatment guidelines for vaginal atrophy recommend the use of minimally absorbed local vaginal estrogens, along with non-hormonal lubricants or moisturizers, coupled with maintenance of sexual activity. Vaginal estrogen therapy has been shown to provide improvement in the signs and symptoms of vaginal or vulvar atrophy. Vaginal tablets, rings, and creams are indicated for the treatment of vaginal atrophy, and the FDA has recently approved a low-dose regimen of conjugated estrogens cream to treat moderate-to-severe postmenopausal dyspareunia. The use of low-dose vaginal estrogens has been shown to be effective in treating symptoms of vaginal atrophy without causing significant proliferation of the endometrial lining, and no significant differences have been seen among vaginal preparations in terms of endometrial safety.

Conclusion

Women should be informed of the potential benefits and risks of the treatment options available, and with the help of their healthcare provider, choose an intervention that is most suitable to their individual needs and circumstances.

1 Introduction

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. Around 42%–70% of patients undergoing systemic treatment for breast cancer, including endocrine therapy, are likely to experience some degree of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA). Chemotherapy can cause sudden temporary or permanent menopause in up to 80% of premenopausal women due to premature ovarian failure, and it can also lead to further reductions in estrogen levels after natural menopause. The climacteric phase can change the epithelial lining of the genital tract, due to decreasing estrogen levels, further leading to the onset of symptoms and signs characteristic of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). The initial symptoms of VVA include reduced vaginal lubrication, followed by additional vaginal and urinary symptoms that can worsen with secondary infections, such as burning, itching, bleeding, discharge, pain during intercourse, and painful urination. Nonhormonal options, such as lubricants, are not effective enough in fully alleviating atrophy symptoms. While local estrogens are the standard treatment for GSM, they may adversely affect breast cancer outcomes and therefore they are usually avoided in this patient group.

Recent studies indicate that laser therapy could serve as a beneficial nonhormonal treatment option to address postmenopausal genitourinary syndrome, as well as for a group of women who survived breast cancer, and could not use hormones to treat the syndrome. A preliminary search of PROSPERO, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and JBI Evidence Synthesis were conducted, and no current or progress scoping reviews on the topic were identified. Mension et al. a study in Scopus (Elsevier) has compared several therapies used to treat genitourinary syndrome on breast cancer survivors (BCS). The present study, however, focuses on Laser Therapy using either Erbium or CO₂, to address the genitourinary syndrome on patients with breast cancer, including several studies that have been published after the publication of Mension et al. This review aims to provide data for physicians and other health professionals who deal directly with BCS, so that they have access to more information about a possible safe and effective alternative for the treatment of GSM. In this context, we structured this review to answer two questions: "Are CO₂ and erbium lasers safe treatments for BCS?" "Is laser treatment effective to treat genitourinary syndrome in breast cancer patients?"

### Clarifying vaginal atrophy's impact on sex and relationships (CLOSER) survey: emotional and physical impact of vaginal discomfort on north American postmenopausal women and their partners [^111o4U2s]. Menopause (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aims to determine the emotional and physical impact of vaginal atrophy on North American postmenopausal women and their male partners.

Methods

A weighted sample of 1,000 married or cohabiting North American postmenopausal women aged 55 to 65 years with vaginal discomfort and 1,000 male partners of postmenopausal women aged 55 to 65 years who experienced vaginal discomfort participated in the Clarifying Vaginal Atrophy's Impact on Sex and Relationships (CLOSER) online survey to determine the impact of vaginal discomfort and local estrogen therapy on intimacy, relationships, and women's self-esteem.

Results

Vaginal discomfort caused most surveyed North American women to avoid intimacy (58%), experience loss of libido (64%), and experience pain associated with sex (64%). Most surveyed North American men also believed that vaginal discomfort caused their partners to avoid intimacy (78%), experience loss of libido (52%), and find sex painful (59%). Approximately 30% of North American women and men cited vaginal discomfort as the reason they ceased having sex altogether. North American women who used local estrogen therapy to treat their vaginal discomfort reported less painful sex (56%), more satisfying sex (41%), and improved sex life (29%). Most men reported looking forward to having sex (57%) because of their partner's use of local estrogen therapy.

Conclusions

Local estrogen therapy ameliorates the negative impact of vaginal atrophy on the intimate relationships of North American postmenopausal women and their male partners. Additional education and awareness efforts about the symptoms of and available treatments for vaginal atrophy may be of further benefit to North American partners.

### Should I stay for local hormone therapy or should I go for radiofrequency to treat vulvovaginal atrophy? A patient preference trial [^115TL9XK]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

The population of developed countries is aging considerably due to an increasing life expectancy. From this perspective, improving the quality of life (QoL) of the older population has become essential, and this also entails ensuring these individuals an adequate sexual life.

In the last decades, there has been an increasing interest in sexual health, and a special consideration has been given to menopause; although society tends to consider postmenopausal women less interested in their sexuality, many women continue to consider sex as a fundamental element of their lives. Women are now more careful and demanding about their body, their sexual function, and their sexual image.

It is acknowledged that the hormone withdrawal that occurs following menopause may worsen sexual function for women by reducing sexual desire and lubrification and by causing dyspareunia. In fact, hypoestrogenism causes loss of collagen fibers and adipocytes in tissues, reduced vascular flow, reduced vaginal secretion and lubrication, and a rise in vaginal pH. It is estimated that almost 40% to 60% of all postmenopausal women suffer from genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), although the actual number is likely underreported.GSM was described by The Menopause Society (formerly known as The North American Menopause Society) in 2014 as a clinical condition, which is due to the postmenopausal reduction in the concentration of sexual hormones and is characterized by vulvovaginal (dryness, burning, itching, vaginal discharge, bleeding, or spotting) and lower urinary tract symptoms (dysuria, urinary frequency, or recurrent urinary tract infections). This is a very common chronic and progressive condition that negatively interferes with female postmenopausal quality of life (QoL), with a significant negative impact on physical, emotional, and sexual life.

### Management of symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy: 2013 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^112tLDqM]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To update and expand the previous position statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) on the management of symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) in postmenopausal women.

Methods

NAMS searched PubMed for medical literature on VVA published since their 2007 position statement on the role of local vaginal estrogen for treatment of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. A panel of acknowledged experts in the field of genitourinary health reviewed the literature to evaluate new evidence on local estrogen as well as on other management options available or in development for symptomatic VVA. The panel's conclusions and recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Symptomatic VVA can significantly impair the quality of life (QOL) of postmenopausal women and may be underdiagnosed. In most cases, it can be managed successfully. A number of over-the-counter and government-approved prescription therapies available in the United States and Canada demonstrate effectiveness, depending on the severity of VVA symptoms. These include vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, vaginal estrogen, hormone therapy, and the selective estrogen-receptor modulator ospemifene (indicated for dyspareunia). Long-term studies on the endometrial safety of local estrogen and ospemifene are lacking. Changes in the vaginal microbiome have various effects on symptoms.

Conclusions

Clinicians can improve the sexual health and QOL of postmenopausal women by educating women about, diagnosing, and appropriately managing symptomatic VVA. Choice of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms, the effectiveness and safety of therapy for the individual patient, and patient preference. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment for moderate to severe symptoms, although a direct comparison of estrogen and ospemifene is not available. Nonhormonal therapies available without a prescription provide sufficient relief for most women with mild symptoms. When low-dose estrogen is administered locally, a progestogen is not indicated for women without a uterus and generally is not indicated for women with an intact uterus. However, endometrial safety has not been studied in clinical trials beyond 1 year. There are insufficient data to confirm the safety of local estrogen in women with breast cancer; management of VVA should take the woman's needs and the recommendation of her oncologist into consideration. Research on the vaginal microbiome may lead to other therapies in the future.

### The women's EMPOWER survey: women's knowledge and awareness of treatment options for vulvar and vaginal atrophy remains inadequate [^1166fmbg]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Postmenopausal women's knowledge about vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) and available treatment options has historically been inadequate. Recent direct-to-consumer marketing and educational efforts would have been expected to increase awareness and treatment options.

Aim

To compare results of the Women's EMPOWER survey with other available VVA surveys to assess progress in women's understanding and approaches to treatment of VVA.

Methods

The Women's EMPOWER survey, an internet-based survey of US women with VVA symptoms, assessed women's awareness of VVA and their behaviors and attitudes associated with symptom treatment.

Main Outcome Measures

These survey results were compared with previously published results of the Revealing Vaginal Effects at Mid-Life (REVEAL), Women's Voices in Menopause (WVM), Vaginal Health: Insight, Views, & Attitudes (VIVA), Clarifying Vaginal Atrophy's Impact on Sex and Relationship (CLOSER), and Real Women's Views of Treatment Options for Menopausal Vaginal Changes (REVIVE) surveys.

Results

Results of the Women's EMPOWER survey were consistent with those of past VVA surveys and showed that postmenopausal women generally failed to recognize VVA and its chronic, progressive process and that they were reluctant to discuss vaginal or sexual symptoms with their health care professionals (HCPs). However, women indicated a strong desire for accurate medical information about VVA from their health care professionals and a willingness to learn if HCPs would initiate the conversation. Most women believed that vaginal symptoms are a normal part of aging and they just need to cope with the symptoms. In the United States, women were most concerned with safety-related issues, including increased risk of breast cancer, side effects, and systemic absorption.

Conclusion

The Women's EMPOWER survey demonstrates and reinforces that even with multimedia marketing and educational strategies in the years after other major VVA surveys, minimal progress has been made toward increasing women's awareness of, knowledge about, or understanding of VVA. Based on these data, a focus on initiating discussions and education with postmenopausal women so that they better comprehend VVA as a chronic progressive medical condition (not just aging), the symptoms associated with VVA, and the benefit-risk profile regarding treatment options is warranted.

### Progress and prospects in treating postmenopausal vaginal atrophy [^113erdLo]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Anatomically described as a "potential space", the vagina is a highly estrogen-responsive organ, and its biology changes dramatically at menopause. After menopause, many women experience vaginal dryness and/or dyspareunia, which are caused primarily by regression of the vaginal epithelium. Unlike vasomotor symptoms, which typically resolve overtime, vaginal atrophy remains a persistent consequence of the menopausal transition. This article discusses current trends and potential future treatments that may improve choices for menopausal and postmenopausal women.

### Identifying and treating sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women: the role of estrogen [^1133pZqS]. Journal of Women's Health (2011). Low credibility.

Sexual dysfunction is a common, but frequently overlooked, problem in postmenopausal women. At menopause, dramatic decreases in circulating estrogen concentrations cause physiologic changes that may affect sexual function, most notably the development of vulvovaginal atrophy. Vulvovaginal atrophy often leads to vaginal dryness, itching, irritation, reduced lubrication, dyspareunia, and vaginal bleeding associated with sexual activity. Estrogen deficiency also can affect other aspects of sexual function, including reduced vaginal blood flow and a reduced capacity for arousal and orgasm. As estrogen loss is a significant cause of sexual dysfunction in menopausal women, estrogen therapy is a logical treatment option in this population. Although both systemic and local estrogen therapy improve vaginal health and sexual functioning, local vaginal therapy with estrogen creams, rings, or tablets may be more appropriate for women without other indications for systemic estrogen therapy. These therapies are highly effective in reversing vaginal atrophy, improving vaginal symptomatology, and reducing dyspareunia, and may have effects on other dimensions of sexual function. Emerging treatments, such as ultra-low-dose vaginal estradiol tablets, new selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) are other promising options for postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy and sexual dysfunction.

### Local oestrogen for vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women [^116QbYip]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginal atrophy is a frequent complaint of postmenopausal women; symptoms include vaginal dryness, itching, discomfort and painful intercourse. Systemic treatment for these symptoms in the form of oral hormone replacement therapy is not always necessary. An alternative choice is oestrogenic preparations administered vaginally (in the form of creams, pessaries, tablets and the oestradiol-releasing ring). This is an update of a Chochrane systematic review; the original version was first published in October 2006.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to compare the efficacy and safety of intra-vaginal oestrogenic preparations in relieving the symptoms of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases and trials registers to April 2016: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Register of trials, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016 issue 4), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, DARE, the Web of Knowledge, OpenGrey, LILACS, PubMed and reference lists of articles. We also contacted experts and researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of oestrogenic preparations administered intravaginally in postmenopausal women for at least 12 weeks for the treatment of symptoms resulting from vaginal atrophy or vaginitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data. The primary review outcomes were improvement in symptoms (participant-assessed), and the adverse event endometrial thickness. Secondary outcomes were improvement in symptoms (clinician-assessed), other adverse events (breast disorders e.g. breast pain, enlargement or engorgement, total adverse events, excluding breast disorders) and adherence to treatment. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) (dichotomous outcomes) and mean differences (MDs) (continuous outcomes) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE methods.

Main Results

We included 30 RCTs (6235 women) comparing different intra-vaginal oestrogenic preparations with each other and with placebo. The evidence was low to moderate quality; limitations were poor reporting of study methods and serious imprecision (effect estimates with wide confidence intervals)1. Oestrogen ring versus other regimensOther regimens included oestrogen cream, oestrogen tablets and placebo. There was no evidence of a difference in improvement in symptoms (participant assessment) either between oestrogen ring and oestrogen cream (odds ratio (OR) 1.33, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.19, two RCTs, n = 341, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence) or between oestrogen ring and oestrogen tablets (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.15, three RCTs, n = 567, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). However, a higher proportion of women reported improvement in symptoms following treatment with oestrogen ring compared with placebo (OR 12.67, 95% CI 3.23 to 49.66, one RCT, n = 67). With respect to endometrial thickness, a higher proportion of women who received oestrogen cream showed evidence of increase in endometrial thickness compared to those who were treated with oestrogen ring (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.94, two RCTs, n = 273; I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). This may have been due to the higher doses of cream used. 2. Oestrogen tablets versus other regimensOther regimens in this comparison included oestrogen cream, and placebo. There was no evidence of a difference in the proportions of women who reported improvement in symptoms between oestrogen tablets and oestrogen cream (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.01, two RCTs, n = 208, I² = 0% low-quality evidence). A higher proportion of women who were treated with oestrogen tablets reported improvement in symptoms compared to those who received placebo using a fixed-effect model (OR 12.47, 95% CI 9.81 to 15.84, two RCTs, n = 1638, I² = 83%, low-quality evidence); however, using a random-effect model did not demonstrate any evidence of a difference in the proportions of women who reported improvement between the two treatment groups (OR 5.80, 95% CI 0.88 to 38.29). There was no evidence of a difference in the proportions of women with increase in endometrial thickness between oestrogen tablets and oestrogen cream (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.60, two RCTs, n = 151, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence).3. Oestrogen cream versus other regimensOther regimens identified in this comparison included isoflavone gel and placebo. There was no evidence of a difference in the proportions of women with improvement in symptoms between oestrogen cream and isoflavone gel (OR 2.08, 95% CI 0.08 to 53.76, one RCT, n = 50, low-quality evidence). However, there was evidence of a difference in the proportions of women with improvement in symptoms between oestrogen cream and placebo with more women who received oestrogen cream reporting improvement in symptoms compared to those who were treated with placebo (OR 4.10, 95% CI 1.88 to 8.93, two RCTs, n = 198, I² = 50%, low-quality evidence). None of the included studies in this comparison reported data on endometrial thickness.

Authors' Conclusions

There was no evidence of a difference in efficacy between the various intravaginal oestrogenic preparations when compared with each other. However, there was low-quality evidence that intra-vaginal oestrogenic preparations improve the symptoms of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women when compared to placebo. There was low-quality evidence that oestrogen cream may be associated with an increase in endometrial thickness compared to oestrogen ring; this may have been due to the higher doses of cream used. However there was no evidence of a difference in the overall body of evidence in adverse events between the various oestrogenic preparations compared with each other or with placebo.

### Vaginal estrogen preparations for relief of atrophic vaginitis… [^116g73hi]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario A 60-year-old woman presents with vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. She has declined systemic hormone therapy because of concerns about potential complications. Clinical Question Should we prescribe a vaginal estrogen preparation for relief of atrophic vaginitis. Evidence-Based Answer Vaginal estrogen preparations are safe and effective as short-term treatment in patients with vaginal atrophy who are not candidates for systemic hormone therapy. Compared with estradiol products, conjugated equine estrogen creams may be associated with a higher incidence of adverse effects. Women may prefer the estradiol-releasing vaginal ring over other delivery systems. Cochrane Abstract Vaginal atrophy is a frequent condition in postmenopausal women. Symptoms include vaginal dryness, itching, discomfort, and painful intercourse. Treatment with oral hormone therapy is not always necessary; alternatives include estrogenic preparations administered vaginally. Background. Creams, pessaries, tablets, and the estradiol-releasing vaginal ring appeared to be equally effective in treating the symptoms of vaginal atrophy. One trial found significant side effects in women who used conjugated equine estrogen cream compared with women who took tablets. Hormone therapy is effective in treating vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women, but some patients and physicians prefer to avoid systemic hormone therapy because of potential harmful effects. Topical estrogen preparations offer an alternative approach to managing symptoms of vaginal atrophy. Several products are available in the United States, including estradiol vaginal creams, tablets, and rings, and conjugated equine estrogen vaginal creams.

Because topical estrogen delivery avoids hepatic first-pass metabolism, lower dosages are needed for symptom relief compared with oral therapy. In the studies reviewed, adverse effects from vaginal estrogens were rare. In one trial, conjugated equine estrogen cream was associated with more adverse effects, including vaginal bleeding, breast pain, and perineal pain, than estradiol vaginal tablets. Two studies showed increased rates of endometrial hyperstimulation in women using conjugated equine estrogen cream compared with women using the estradiol ring. However, this finding is difficult to interpret because of differences in dosing recommendations among the various estrogen preparations.

### Interventions to address sexual problems in people with cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline adaptation of cancer care Ontario guideline [^113azrf8]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose The adaptation of the Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) guideline Interventions to Address Sexual Problems in People With Cancer provides recommendations to manage sexual function adverse effects that occur as a result of cancer diagnosis and/or treatment. Methods ASCO staff reviewed the guideline for developmental rigor and updated the literature search. An ASCO Expert Panel (Table A1) was assembled to review the guideline content and recommendations. Results The ASCO Expert Panel determined that the recommendations from the 2016 CCO guideline are clear, thorough, and based upon the most relevant scientific evidence. ASCO statements and modifications were added to adapt the CCO guideline for a broader audience. Recommendations It is recommended that there be a discussion with the patient, initiated by a member of the health care team, regarding sexual health and dysfunction resulting from cancer or its treatment. Psychosocial and/or psychosexual counseling should be offered to all patients with cancer, aiming to improve sexual response, body image, intimacy and relationship issues, and overall sexual functioning and satisfaction. Medical and treatable contributing factors should be identified and addressed first. In women with symptoms of vaginal and/or vulvar atrophy, lubricants in addition to vaginal moisturizers may be tried as a first option. Low-dose vaginal estrogen, lidocaine, and dehydroepiandrosterone may also be considered in some cases. In men, medication such as phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors may be beneficial, and surgery remains an option for those with symptoms or treatment complications refractory to medical management. Both women and men experiencing vasomotor symptoms should be offered interventions for symptomatic improvement, including behavioral options such as cognitive behavioral therapy, slow breathing and hypnosis, and medications such as venlafaxine and gabapentin.
