## Question

What condition is represented by ICD-10-CM code I71.3?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what condition is represented by ICD-10-CM code I71.3. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ICD-10-CM structure and how to interpret the alphanumeric code. Then, I should verify the exact meaning of I71.3 across authoritative sources. Next, I will check for any nuances such as laterality or encounter type that might modify the code. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically accurate answer and confirm it against multiple references to ensure correctness.

> Let me first confirm the coding framework. ICD-10-CM uses a letter–number format where the first character is a letter (category), followed by two digits (subcategory), a decimal, and then additional digits for specificity; for vascular diseases, the I70–I79 range covers diseases of arteries, arterioles, and capillaries, and I71 specifically denotes aortic aneurysm and dissection, which anchors the interpretation of I71.3 [^447404e0].

> Now, I should verify the exact meaning of I71.3. Multiple high-credibility sources consistently define I71.3 as abdominal aortic aneurysm, ruptured; in other words, a ruptured AAA, which is a life-threatening vascular emergency requiring immediate intervention [^447404e0] [^69ed776d] [^c756da88].

> Wait, let me verify whether there are any modifiers I might be missing. Unlike some ICD-10-CM categories that require 7th characters for encounter type or laterality, the I71 series for aortic aneurysm does not typically carry 7th-character extensions for laterality or encounter type; I should double-check that I71.3 stands alone as "ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm" without needing additional digits, and indeed, the authoritative mortality and epidemiologic sources treat I71.3 as the complete code for ruptured AAA [^447404e0] [^69ed776d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the distinction from related I71 codes. I71.4 denotes abdominal aortic aneurysm without rupture, I71.1 and I71.2 refer to thoracic aortic aneurysm with and without rupture respectively, and I71.5 and I71.6 cover thoracoabdominal aneurysm with and without rupture; this confirms that I71.3 is specifically the ruptured abdominal form, not thoracic or thoracoabdominal, and not unruptured [^447404e0] [^69ed776d].

> I will now examine real-world usage to ensure clinical alignment. Large cohort studies and population analyses consistently use I71.3 to identify ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm events for outcomes research and surveillance, reinforcing that the code is operationally understood as ruptured AAA in practice [^c756da88] [^47ab8d70] [^c59c1727].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final phrasing. ICD-10-CM code I71.3 represents abdominal aortic aneurysm, ruptured, which is the clinical diagnosis of a ruptured AAA [^447404e0] [^69ed776d].

---

ICD-10-CM code I71.3 denotes a **ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)** [^447404e0], a life-threatening emergency characterized by tearing of the abdominal aortic wall with bleeding into the retroperitoneum or peritoneal cavity. This code is used for **documenting ruptured AAA** in medical records and billing, and it excludes unruptured AAA (I71.4) and thoracic aneurysm rupture (I71.1). Immediate surgical intervention is critical to reduce mortality, which remains high without prompt repair [^69ed776d].

---

## Clinical definition and pathophysiology

A ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is the catastrophic failure of the abdominal aortic wall, leading to **rapid blood loss** and hemodynamic collapse. The pathophysiology involves progressive dilation and weakening of the aortic wall, often due to atherosclerosis, hypertension, or genetic predisposition, culminating in rupture when wall stress exceeds tensile strength [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with:

- **Sudden severe abdominal or back pain**: Often described as "tearing" or "ripping".
- **Hypotension or shock**: From massive hemorrhage.
- **Palpable pulsatile abdominal mass**: May be absent in obese patients or when rupture has occurred.
- **Loss of consciousness**: In severe cases due to exsanguination.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Prompt diagnosis relies on **clinical suspicion** and rapid imaging:

- **Ultrasound**: Rapid, non-invasive bedside test for unstable patients.
- **Computed tomography angiography (CTA)**: Gold standard for stable patients, defining anatomy and guiding intervention.
- **Laboratory tests**: Hemoglobin/hematocrit, renal function, and coagulation profile.

---

## Treatment and management

Immediate surgical intervention is the cornerstone of management, with two main options:

| **Treatment modality** | **Indication** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Open surgical repair (OSR) | - Unstable patients <br/> - Extensive anatomical involvement | - Direct control of rupture <br/> - Long-term durability | - High morbidity <br/> - Longer recovery |
| Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) | - Stable patients <br/> - Favorable anatomy | - Minimally invasive <br/> - Lower perioperative morbidity | - Need for suitable anatomy <br/> - Lifelong surveillance |

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Ruptured AAA carries **high mortality**: approximately 80–90% overall, with 50–70% mortality even with surgical intervention. Early recognition, rapid transport, and immediate surgical management are critical to improving outcomes [^69ed776d].

---

## ICD-10-CM coding considerations

- **Code I71.3** specifically denotes ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and excludes unruptured AAA (I71.4) and thoracic aneurysm rupture (I71.1).
- **Accurate documentation** of rupture status and anatomical location is essential for correct coding and billing.
- **ICD-10-CM coding** supports epidemiologic tracking, quality assessment, and reimbursement processes [^439852f4].

---

## Conclusion

ICD-10-CM code I71.3 represents a **ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm**, a surgical emergency with high mortality. Rapid diagnosis and immediate intervention are essential to improve survival, and precise coding ensures accurate clinical documentation and billing.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^d495525c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^8b6d266d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Nonarthritic hip joint pain [^43fdb678]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Medium credibility.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain — classification codes include the primary International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes "M25.5 Pain in joint, M24.7 Protrusio acetabuli, M24.0 Loose body in joint, and M24.2 Disorder of ligament". The corresponding ICD-9-CM codes and conditions are "719.45 Joint pain, 718.65 Unspecified intrapelvic protrusion of acetabulum, 718.15 Loose body in joint, and 718.5 Other derangement of joint pelvic region and thigh". Other ICD-10 codes that may be associated are "M21.0 Valgus deformity, not elsewhere classified", "M21.1 Varus deformity, not elsewhere classified", "M21.2 Flexion deformity", "M24.3 Pathological dislocation and subluxation of joint, not elsewhere classified", and "M24.4 Recurrent dislocation and subluxation of joint".

### ICD-10: history and context [^7f4e391d]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

In recent months, organized medicine has been consumed by the anticipated transition to the 10th iteration of the International Classification of Disease system. Implementation has come and gone without the disruptive effects predicted by many. Despite the fundamental role the International Classification of Disease system plays in health care delivery and payment policy, few neuroradiologists are familiar with the history of its implementation and implications beyond coding for diseases.

Methods

Data and Study Sample

We used the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, including individuals ages 0 to 64 years enrolled in noncapitated commercial insurance plans with both medical and pharmacy benefits. The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^5ad88265]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we only examined the association of diagnostic category prevalence with the ICD-10-CM transition for individuals younger than 65 years who were privately insured by employer-sponsored insurance, a population mostly enrolled in relatively generous health plans. Coding patterns and discontinuities in frequencies of diagnostic categories may not generalize to individuals covered by other insurers (eg, the ACA marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid). Many health care practitioners have been encouraged by their institutions to maximize the capture of patient complexity in their billing. However, our study data came from commercial plans whose payments are rarely risk adjusted for disease prevalence. Specifically, their payments do not generally rely on HHS-HCCs, reducing the explicit incentive to increase the prevalence of well-reimbursed HHS-HCC categories. Second, we did not examine changes at the ICD-10-CM transition on coding for particular conditions for specific patients or in category prevalence based on other sources of diagnoses, such as electronic medical records. Third, we used a piecewise linear model to look for changes in level and trend, but for some categories in which diagnostic category prevalence trends are not linear, our model may find changes at the transition when a nonlinear model would not.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^7e59b1dc]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Since implementation of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) in the US, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The widely used pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) system required a major update from version 2 (V2) to version 3 (V3) to capture the range of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

Objective

To update the CCC V3 system, creating V3, with new, missing, or retired codes; to reconceptualize the system's use of technology codes; and to compare CCC V3 with V2.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This repeated cross-sectional study examined US hospitalization data from the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) and the Medicaid Merative MarketScan Research Databases from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2019, for all patients aged 0 to 18 years. Data were analyzed from March 1, 2023, to April 1, 2024.

Exposures

The CCCs were identified in both data sources using the CCC V2 and V3 systems.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The (1) percentage of pediatric hospitalizations associated with a CCC, (2) numbers of CCC body-system categories per patient, and (3) explanatory power for hospital length of stay and in-hospital mortality were compared over time for V3 vs V2.

Results

Among 7 186 019 hospitalizations within PHIS, 54.3% patients were male, the median age was 4 years (IQR, 1–11 years), and 51.2% were aged 0 to 4 years). The CCC V2 identified 2 878 476 (40.1%) patients as having any CCC compared with 2 753 412 (38.3%) identified by V3. In addition, V2 identified 100 065 (1.4%) patients with transplant status compared with 146 683 (2.0%) by V3, and V2 identified 914 835 (12.7%) as having technology codes compared with 805 585 (11.2%) by V3. The 2 systems were similar in accounting for the number of CCC body-system categories per patient and in explaining variation in hospital length of stay and in-hospital mortality. For both V2 and V3, 10.0% of the variance in hospital length of stay and 12.0% of the variance in in-hospital mortality was explained by the presence of a CCC. Similar patterns were observed when analyzing the 2 999 420 Medicaid Merative MarketScan Research Databases' hospitalizations (52.3% of patients were male, the median age was 1 year [IQR, 0–12 years], and 62.0% were 0 to 4 years old), except that the percentages of identified CCCs were all lower: V2 identified 758 110 hospitalizations (25.3%) with any CCC compared with 718 100 (23.9%) identified by V3.

Conclusions and Relevance

These results suggest that, moving forward, V3 should be used to identify CCCs, and ongoing, frequent updates to V3, using a transparent, structured process, will enable V3 to accurately reflect the evolving spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^5e1c6ada]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^cd799048]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye ICD-10 CM classifications — entities and codes include: Dry eye, unspecified, right lacrimal gland H04.121; left lacrimal gland H04.122; bilateral lacrimal gland H04.123; keratoconjunctivitis sicca (not specified as Sjögren) H16.22-; Sjögren syndrome, sicca syndrome M35.00; Sjögren syndrome with keratoconjunctivitis M35.01; filamentary keratitis H16.12-; exposure keratoconjunctivitis H16.21-; punctate keratitis H11.14-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, and the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct; the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder x must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^3fb71031]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### Amblyopia preferred practice pattern [^1cde52cc]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Amblyopia — ICD-10 CM coding categories and laterality conventions are listed as follows: Amblyopia, unspecified is H53.00–; Strabismic amblyopia (suppression) is H53.03–; Deprivation amblyopia is H53.01–; Refractive amblyopia, including anisometropic and isoametropic amblyopia, is H53.02–; and Amblyopia, suspect is H53.04–. Laterality uses the final character, with mappings "1, right eye; 2, left eye; 3, bilateral; 9, eye not specified"; when laterality is specified it can appear in different digit positions, and if no bilateral code is provided for a bilateral condition, separate left and right codes are assigned; unspecified laterality can be "a 0 or 9 depending on whether it is a 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th digit".

### Corneal edema and opacification preferred practice pattern ® [^14409d67]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Corneal opacification — ICD-10 CM classifications list minor corneal opacity H17.81-, peripheral corneal opacity H17.82-, central corneal opacity H17.1-, and phthisical cornea A18.59, H44.52-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^e0159918]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM coding — Macular degeneration, dry corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.51 and to ICD-10 CM Nonexudative AMD H35.31-; macular degeneration, wet corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.52 and to ICD-10 CM Exudative AMD H35.32-; macular drusen corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.57 and to ICD-10 CM Drusen (degenerative) of macula H35.36-. AMD does not require laterality indicators. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of ICD-10 CM codes indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^3a864023]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis — ICD-10 CM classifications and laterality rules include the following: Entities coded under bacterial keratitis include corneal ulcer, unspecified (H16.00-), marginal corneal ulcer (H16.04-), ring corneal ulcer (H16.02-), central corneal ulcer (H16.01-), hypopyon ulcer (H16.03-), perforated corneal ulcer (H16.07-), unspecified corneal edema (H18.20), contact lens keratitis (H18.82-), and bacterial keratitis (H16.8). Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; "The applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct", "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field", and "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned", and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^2079c164]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

On October 1, 2015, the US transitioned to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) for recording diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures. It is unknown whether this transition was associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence based on diagnosis classification systems commonly used for payment and quality reporting.

Objective

To assess changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined level and trend changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition and clinically reviewed a subset of diagnostic categories with changes of 20% or more. Data included insurance claim diagnoses from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, for more than 18 million people aged 0 to 64 years with private insurance. Diagnoses were mapped using 3 common diagnostic classification systems: World Health Organization (WHO) disease chapters, Department of Health and Human Services Hierarchical Condition Categories (HHS-HCCs), and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification System (AHRQ-CCS). Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Exposures

US implementation of ICD-10-CM.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Monthly rates of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 eligible members.

Results

The analytic sample contained information on 2.1 billion enrollee person-months with 3.4 billion clinically assigned diagnoses; the mean (range) monthly sample size was 22.1 (18.4 to 27.1) million individuals. While diagnostic category prevalence changed minimally for WHO disease chapters, the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with level changes of 20% or more among 20 of 127 HHS-HCCs (15.7%) and 46 of 282 AHRQ-CCS categories (16.3%) and with trend changes of 20% or more among 12 of 127 of HHS-HCCs (9.4%) and 27 of 282 of AHRQ-CCS categories (9.6%). For HHS-HCCs, monthly rates of individuals with any acute myocardial infarction diagnosis increased 131.5% (95% CI, 124.1% to 138.8%), primarily because HHS added non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction diagnoses to this category. The HHS-HCC for diabetes with chronic complications increased by 92.4% (95% CI, 84.2% to 100.5%), primarily from including new diabetes-related hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia codes, and the rate for completed pregnancy with complications decreased by 54.5% (95% CI, -58.7% to -50.2%) partly due to removing vaginal birth after cesarean delivery as a complication.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with large prevalence changes for many diagnostic categories. Diagnostic classification systems developed using ICD-9-CM may need to be refined using ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for disease surveillance, performance assessment, and risk-adjusted payments.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^ccf9d77a]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis ICD-10 CM coding — Blepharitis, which includes entities with the following ICD-10 classifications, lists Ulcerative (H01.01-), Squamous (H01.02-), Stye (H00.01-), Meibomitis (H01.02-), Abscess of eyelid (H00.03-), and Parasitic infestation of eyelid (B89). CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; "(-) = 1, right upper eyelid; 2, right lower eyelid; 4, left upper eyelid; 5, left lower eyelid", and when laterality is specified "Right upper eyelid is always 1", "Right lower eyelid is always 2", "Left upper eyelid is always 4", and "Left lower eyelid is always 5". "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters" and "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field"; if a 7th character is required and the code is "not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code exists and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned" and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". A starred note instructs to "Code first underlying disease, as leishmaniasis (085.0–085.9), loiasis (125.2), onchocerciasis (125.3), or pediculosis (132.0)".

### The complexity and challenges of the international classification of diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification to international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification transition in EDs [^9b81e000]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Beginning October 2015, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services will require medical providers to use the vastly expanded International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) system. Despite wide availability of information and mapping tools for the next generation of the ICD classification system, some of the challenges associated with transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM are not well understood. To quantify the challenges faced by emergency physicians, we analyzed a subset of a 2010 Illinois Medicaid database of emergency department ICD-9-CM codes, seeking to determine the accuracy of existing mapping tools in order to better prepare emergency physicians for the change to the expanded ICD-10-CM system. We found that 27% of 1830 codes represented convoluted multidirectional mappings. We then analyzed the convoluted transitions and found that 8% of total visit encounters (23% of the convoluted transitions) were clinically incorrect. The ambiguity and inaccuracy of these mappings may impact the workflow associated with the translation process and affect the potential mapping between ICD codes and Current Procedural Codes, which determine physician reimbursement.

### Retinal vein occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^f45120fb]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal vein occlusion ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM codes — International Classification of Diseases (ICD) classifications include: central retinal vein occlusion — ICD-9 CM 362.35; ICD-10 CM H34.811-, H34.812-, H34.813-; venous tributary (branch) occlusion — ICD-9 CM 362.36; ICD-10 CM H34.831-, H34.832-, H34.833-; venous engorgement — ICD-9 CM 362.37; ICD-10 CM H34.821-, H34.822-, H34.823-. For ICD-10 CM laterality, the guidance states: "For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1 Left is always 2 Bilateral is always 3".

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^0ea4ef88]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

This cross-sectional study was deemed exempt from review by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board because it did not constitute human participants research and used deidentified data; the requirement for informed consent was therefore waived. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Identification of New or Missing ICD-10-CM Codes

We used a comprehensive, supervised semiautomated strategy to identify new, missing, or retired ICD-10-CM codes. First, we remapped the previously published CCC V2 ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes using the 2018 General Equivalence Mappings electronic mapping tool from the CMS. All CCC V2 ICD-9-CM codes were forward remapped, and all CCC V2 ICD-10 codes were remapped backward using the General Equivalence Mappings, which allowed for identification of new or missing codes. Second, we manually compared the remapped codes with annual update lists of new ICD-10-CM codes for 2019 to 2023 using the hierarchical ICD-10 code structure to identify related codes that might represent a CCC. Third, 2 complex care pediatricians (J. A.F. and C.F.) independently reviewed all identified candidate codes for inclusion or exclusion in the CCC V3 system based on the CCC definition used to create the previous versions: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by joint review of the code or codes in question. Fourth, the final list of CCC V3 codes was created, reviewed for quality, and finalized for use. To enable transparency of code determinations, we created a list of all codes reviewed for inclusion or exclusion for CCC V3 and their determinations, including retired codes that were used in previous CCC versions (eTable 1 in Supplement 1, eTable 2 in Supplement 2, and eTable 3 in Supplement 3).

### Validation of ICD-10-CM codes for injuries complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium: a medical record review [^46dfe7de]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

The ability of the O9A.2-O9A.5 codes to identify true injury cases is unknown. Furthermore, per the ICD-10-CM guidelines for Coding and Reporting, codes from Chapter 15, PCP (O00-O9A) 'have sequencing priority over codes from other chapters. Additional codes from other chapters may be used in conjunction with Chapter 15 codes to further specify conditions'. Specifically, O9A.2 'should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate injury, poisoning, toxic effect, adverse effect or under-dosing code, and then the additional code(s) that specifies the condition caused by the poisoning, toxic effect, adverse effect or underdosing'. Similarly, O9A.3-O9A.4 should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate codes to identify any associated current injury due to physical abuse or sexual abuse. However, it has not been studied how often and why the O9A.2-O9A.5 are listed as a secondary diagnosis, and what percentage of injuries complicating pregnancy-related outcomes are potentially missed when the definition for injury hospitalisations captures only principal diagnoses of O9A.2-O9A.5.

ICD-10-CM coding of inpatient and emergency department discharge data follows guidelines for assigning a principal diagnosis. In inpatient data, the principal diagnosis is defined as 'that condition established after study to be the chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for care'. This definition does not apply to hospital-based outpatient services, including emergency department visits. In outpatient settings, the first-listed diagnosis represents 'the code for the diagnosis, condition, problem or other reason for the encounter/visit shown in the medical record as chiefly responsible for the service provided. In some cases the first-listed diagnosis may be a symptom when a diagnosis has not been established (confirmed) by the physician'.

This analysis evaluates the ability of O9A.2-O9A.5 codes to identify injuries in inpatient and emergency department discharge claims from one healthcare facility in Kentucky, looking additionally at the codes' positive predictive value (PPV) when used as a principal diagnosis within inpatient data, as a secondary diagnosis within inpatient data, and in any position within emergency department data.

### The transition to ICD-10-CM: challenges for pediatric practice [^51ad6a56]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Diagnostic codes are used widely within health care for billing, quality assessment, and to measure clinical outcomes. The US health care system will transition to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), in October 2015. Little is known about how this transition will affect pediatric practices. The objective of this study was to examine how the transition to ICD-10-CM may result in ambiguity of clinical information and financial disruption for pediatricians.

Methods

Using a statewide data set from Illinois Medicaid specified for pediatricians, 2708 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, diagnosis codes were identified. Diagnosis codes were categorized into 1 of 5 categories: identity, class-to-subclass, subclass-to-class, convoluted, and no translation. The convoluted and high-cost diagnostic codes (n = 636) were analyzed for accuracy and categorized into "information loss", "overlapping categories", "inconsistent", and "consistent". Finally, reimbursement by Medicaid was calculated for each category.

Results

Twenty-six percent of pediatric diagnosis codes are convoluted, which represents 21% of Illinois Medicaid pediatric patient encounters and 16% of reimbursement. The diagnosis codes represented by information loss (3.6%), overlapping categories (3.2%), and inconsistent (1.2%) represent 8% of Medicaid pediatric reimbursement.

Conclusions

The potential for financial disruption and administrative errors from 8% of reimbursement diagnosis codes necessitates special attention to these codes in preparing for the transition to ICD-10-CM for pediatric practices.

### Use of ICD-10-CM coded hospitalisation and emergency department data for injury surveillance [^ee350889]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Injury surveillance, the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of injury data, provides critical information to support public health efforts to reduce injury-related morbidity, mortality and disability. For the past several decades, state and local health departments and national agencies in the USA have relied on the use of hospital discharge and emergency department (ED) data coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to conduct injury surveillance. Surveillance case definitions and analyses have been based on ICD-9-CM codes. However, a US mandate to code using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)has resulted in a need to update injury surveillance case definitions and analysis guidance based on ICD-10-CM.

Beginning in October 2015, the US Department of Health and Human Services required all hospitals and healthcare providers covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act to use the ICD-10-CM to report electronic healthcare transactions. The coding structure of ICD-10-CM is based on ICD-10 mortality coding and classification published by the WHO, however, the classification scheme has been greatly expanded to capture the diagnostic detail needed for medical diagnoses. ICD-10-CM contains nearly five times the number of codes found in ICD-9-CM (approximately 72 000 codes in ICD-10-CM compared with 15 000 codes in ICD-9-CM). Because ICD-10-CM captures greater detail than either ICD-9-CM or ICD-10, this classification system has the potential to provide enhanced understanding of the types and causes of non-fatal injury.

### Mediators and adverse effects of child poverty in the United States [^1107af4b]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Tracking socioeconomic risk in health care settings using ICD-10-CM — compared with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) provides a more robust classification system that enables clinicians to track socioeconomic factors in patient care that may be related to families' annual income level; by using the ICD-10-CM, child health clinicians can submit supplemental codes that include not only diagnosis, such as acute asthma exacerbation, but additional socioeconomic factors related to the asthma exacerbation and treatment, such as childhood poverty or the family's inability to afford the recommended medical regimen; it will be important to capture this additional socioeconomic information with the sole use of ICD-10-CM codes to enable investigators to examine the putative impact of expanded codes on children's health care.

### Long-term risk of adverse events in patients discharged alive after hospitalization for hypertensive crisis [^c59c1727]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Cohort

The searches on the TriNetX online research platform were performed on the 24th of February 2025 for individuals aged ≥ 18 years who were discharged from the hospital after a hypertensive crisis. Based on the ICD-10-CM codes recorded within one month before the discharge, patients were subdivided in two groups: hypertensive urgencies (I16.0), and hypertensive emergencies (I16.1). In those with hypertensive emergencies, the type of target organ damage was reported, i.e. central nervous system [CNS: ischemic stroke (I63), hypertensive encephalopathy (I67.4), intracerebral haemorrhages (I60 and I61)], cardiovascular [CV: myocardial infarction (MI (I21)], acute heart failure (HF (I50.21, I50.23, I50.31, I50.33, I50.41, I50.43), aortic dissection or rupture (AD (I71.1, I71.3, I71.5, I71.8)), or renal (acute kidney failure (N17)). More information about the ICD-10-codes utilized can be found in Supplementary Table 1.

The study period was comprised between the 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2022. At the time of the search, 85 participating healthcare organizations, primarily located in the US, had data available for patients who met the study inclusion criteria. The baseline index event date was the discharge from hospital, any other diagnoses or treatment reported before this date were the individual's baseline characteristics.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes were the one-year risk of: all-cause death, and major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE), i.e. ischemic stroke, MI, acute HF, cardiac arrest, aortic dissection or rupture. The secondary outcomes were the one-year risk of each component of the MACE outcome. The adverse events of interest were identified via ICD-10-CM codes (Supplementary Table 2).

### Development of a customised programme to standardise comorbidity diagnosis codes in a large-scale database [^7b265eb9]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

On 1 October 2015, the department of Health and Human Services updated the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system by mandating the adoption of ICD-10 diagnosis codes in electronic medical records. Serving as the new standard for naming and categorizing patient diagnoses, the ICD-10 system contains over five times more codes than ICD-9, posing a challenge for analysing longitudinal databases spanning both systems. Prior solutions have included the use of alternate coding systems, which are updated each time a new ICD system is released. Current literature is aimed at the accuracy and scope of these systems, how they update with new ICD releases, and how systems are similar or different. These studies fail to address how to implement such a system on a large-scale database, where manual reference and cell-by-cell translation is infeasible. We sought to develop a programme that quickly and accurately standardises a dataset to one diagnostic coding system.

### Idiopathic epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^b546b23f]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Appendix 2 — International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction are as follows: Epiretinal membrane — ICD-9 CM 362.56; ICD-10 CM H35.371, H35.372, H35.373. Vitreomacular traction, adhesion — ICD-9 CM 379.27; ICD-10 CM H43.821, H43.822, H43.823. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned; unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM mapping of the AAST emergency general surgery disease severity grading systems: conceptual approach, limitations, and recommendations for the future [^57d673b3]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) recently established a grading system for uniform reporting of anatomic severity of several emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases. There are five grades of severity for each disease, ranging from I (lowest severity) to V (highest severity). However, the grading process requires manual chart review. We sought to evaluate whether International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM) codes might allow estimation of AAST grades for EGS diseases. The Patient Assessment and Outcomes Committee of the AAST reviewed all available ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes relevant to 16 EGS diseases with available AAST grades. We then matched grades for each EGS disease with one or more ICD codes. We used the Official Coding Guidelines for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and the American Hospital Association's "Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM" for coding guidance. The ICD codes did not allow for matching all five AAST grades of severity for each of the 16 diseases. With ICD-9-CM, six diseases mapped into four categories of severity (instead of five), another six diseases into three categories of severity, and four diseases into only two categories of severity. With ICD-10-CM, five diseases mapped into four categories of severity, seven diseases into three categories, and four diseases into two categories. Two diseases mapped into discontinuous categories of grades (two in ICD-9-CM and one in ICD-10-CM). Although resolution is limited, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes might have some utility in roughly approximating the severity of the AAST grades in the absence of more precise information. These ICD mappings should be validated and refined before widespread use to characterize EGS disease severity. In the long-term, it may be desirable to develop alternatives to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for routine collection of disease severity characteristics.

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^f960c8ff]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Background

The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), a coding system for all claims billing in the USA, went into effect on 1 October 2015, replacing the 9th Revision (ICD-9-CM). The coding transition brought with it benefits and challenges for drug overdose surveillance using hospital and emergency department (ED) discharge data. Increases in specificity of drug codes, the ability to distinguish initial encounters from subsequent encounters and sequelae, the inclusion of external cause information within drug overdose diagnosis codes and new concepts like 'underdosing' provide epidemiologists with richer data. However, these new features impact how injuries, including drug overdose, should be measured and interpreted using ICD-10-CM coded discharge data. Amid a continuing drug overdose epidemic in the USA, high-quality data and standardised surveillance methods are key for tracking and assessing drug overdose burden.

Several studies have characterised drug overdoses using ICD-10-CM coded discharge data, but have used varying selection criteria and indicator definitions to ascertain drug overdose cases. Specifically, these indicator definitions differ on the number of diagnosis fields searched, the encounter types included, the manner of injury/intent selected and the specific ICD-10-CM codes included. Some studies searched all diagnosis fields (ie, primary diagnosis field, secondary diagnosis and all other fields available)and others only included cases with a primary diagnosis of injury.

ICD-10-CM introduced the differentiation of encounter type, with codes for initial encounter, subsequent encounter and sequelae. Initial encounters represent active treatment of drug overdose, while subsequent encounters represent encounters taking place 'after the patient has completed active treatment of the condition and is receiving routine care for the condition during the healing or recovery phase'. Sequelae are new medical conditions or complications, occurring at any point after the acute phase of the injury, which are residual effects of the original injury. Some studies have included all encounters, while others have limited inclusion to initial encounter type.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^6ece3d7b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Rapid access to well-characterized, large SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 cohorts is critical for scientific discovery. ICD-10 codes are a standard terminology and are attractive for data aggregation because they are uniformly used among health care systems. However, these codes perform poorly in capturing COVID-19–related symptoms. Our findings highlight the critical need for meticulous data validation to feed multicenter registries built from EMRs. Reliable, accurate data are the foundation of scientific discovery; the right data lead to the right solutions.

### General surgeon involvement in the care of patients designated with an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-endorsed ICD-10-CM emergency general surgery diagnosis code in Wisconsin [^5fcbf5f7]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The current national burden of emergency general surgery (EGS) illnesses and the extent of surgeon involvement in the care of these patients remain largely unknown. To inform needs assessments, research, and education, we sought to: (1) translate previously developed International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes representing EGS conditions to ICD 10th Revision, CM (ICD-10-CM) codes and (2) determine the national burden of and assess surgeon involvement across EGS conditions.

Methods

We converted ICD-9-CM codes to candidate ICD-10-CM codes using General Equivalence Mappings then iteratively refined the code list. We used National Inpatient Sample 2016 to 2017 data to develop a national estimate of the burden of EGS disease. To evaluate surgeon involvement, using Wisconsin Hospital Association discharge data (January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2018), we selected adult urgent/emergent encounters with an EGS condition as the principal diagnosis. Surgeon involvement was defined as a surgeon being either the attending provider or procedural physician.

Results

Four hundred and eighty-five ICD-9-CM codes mapped to 1,696 ICD-10-CM codes. The final list contained 985 ICD-10-CM codes. Nationally, there were 2,977,843 adult patient encounters with an ICD-10-CM EGS diagnosis. Of 94,903 EGS patients in the Wisconsin Hospital Association data set, most encounters were inpatient as compared with observation (75,878 [80.0%] vs. 19,025 [20.0%]). There were 57,780 patients (60.9%) that underwent any procedure. Among all Wisconsin EGS patients, most had no surgeon involvement (64.9% [n = 61,616]). Of the seven most common EGS diagnoses, surgeon involvement was highest for appendicitis (96.0%) and biliary tract disease (77.1%). For the other five most common conditions (skin/soft tissue infections, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intestinal obstruction/ileus, pancreatitis, diverticular disease), surgeons were involved in roughly 20% of patient care episodes.

Conclusion

Surgeon involvement for EGS conditions ranges from highly likely (appendicitis) to relatively unlikely (skin/soft tissue infections). The wide range in surgeon involvement underscores the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in the care of EGS patients.

### Emergency department coding of bicycle and pedestrian injuries during the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 [^c0c5cfeb]. Injury Prevention (2012). Low credibility.

ICD-9 diagnosis codes consist of the following: 3-digit numeric characters (001–999), with two decimals representing illnesses and conditions; alphanumeric E-codes (E000–E999), describing external causes of injuries, poisonings, and adverse effects; and V codes (V01–V82), describing factors influencing health status and contact with health services. ICD-10 uses 3-digit alphanumeric codes (A00–Z99) with two decimals. There are many other changes in ICD-10 that have been described in detail elsewhere. Canada implemented ICD-10 for the classification of cause of death, beginning in 2000. In an agreement with WHO, Canada adopted an enhanced version of ICD-10-CA by keeping the main structure of ICD-10, yet including more subgroup definitions using a third decimal and introducing the first Canadian classification of intervention.

E-codes have been widely used in surveillance system for mortality in traffic-related injuriesand morbidity of bicyclists, pedestrians, and those with sport and recreational related injuries; however, coding issues might have led to errors in the interpretation of research findings. Appropriate coding by ICD-9 and ICD-10 has always been an important issue for health surveillance and health services research. Many studies have evaluated the validity and/or reliability of ICD-9 coding for external causes of injuries (from now on called E-coding for both ICD-9 and ICD-10), or focused on principal diagnosis. Other studies evaluated the validity/reliability of ICD-10 for E-codingor only principal diagnosis in ICD-10.

For those countries that implemented ICD-10, the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 may have had an impact on the trends of causes of injuries. Bridge coding studies, to date, have evaluated the impact of a coding change by focusing on principal causes of mortality and not external cause of injury. One study examined the usefulness of ICD-10-CM in capturing public health diseases (reportable diseases, leading cause of death and morbidity/mortality related to terrorism) and reported agreement levels of coders when coding such diseases in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM. They found that ICD-10-CM was more specific and fully captured more diseases than ICD-9-CM; however, coders were more consistent in coding ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM.

### Use of the postacute sequelae of COVID-19 diagnosis code in routine clinical practice in the US [^505766f9]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

A new International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code (U09.9 Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified) was introduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on October 1, 2021.

Objective

To examine the use of the U09.9 code and describe concurrently diagnosed conditions to understand physician use of this code in clinical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study of US patients with an ICD-10-CM code for post-COVID-19 condition used deidentified patient-level claims data aggregated by HealthVerity. Children and adolescents (aged 0–17 years) and adults (aged 18–64 and ≥ 65 years) with a post-COVID-19 condition code were identified between October 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022. To identify a prior COVID-19 diagnosis, 3 months of continuous enrollment (CE) before the post-COVID-19 diagnosis date was required.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Presence of the ICD-10-CM U09.9 code.

Results

There were 56 143 patients (7723 female patients [61.2%]; mean [SD] age, 47.6 [19.2] years) with a post-COVID-19 diagnosis code, with cases increasing in mid-December 2021 following the trajectory of the Omicron case wave by 3 to 4 weeks. The analysis cohort included 12 622 patients after the 3-month preindex CE criteria was applied. Among this cohort, the median (IQR) age was 49 (35–61) years; however, 1080 (8.6%) were pediatric patients. The U09.9 code was used most often in the outpatient setting, although 305 older adults (14.0%) were inpatients. Only 698 patients (5.5%) had at least 1 of the 5 codes listed as possible concurrent conditions in the coding guidance. Only 8879 patients (70.4%) had a documented acute COVID-19 diagnosis code (569 [52.7%] among children), and the median (IQR) time between acute COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 diagnosis codes was 56 (21–200) days. The most common concurrently coded conditions varied by age; children experienced COVID-19-like symptoms (eg, 207 [19.2%] had cough and 115 [10.6%] had breathing abnormalities), while 459 older adults aged 65 years or older (21.1%) experienced respiratory failure and 189 (8.7%) experienced viral pneumonia.

Conclusions and Relevance

This retrospective cohort study found patients with a post-COVID-19 ICD-10-CM diagnosis code following the acute phase of COVID-19 disease among patients of all ages in clinical practice in the US. The use of the U09.9 code encompassed a wide range of conditions. It will be important to monitor how the use of this code changes as the pandemic continues to evolve.

### Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks, and lattice degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^ab59a3b4]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes — precursors to rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and related entities are mapped between ICD-9 CM and ICD-10 CM, including break, unspecified (361.00; H33.00-), break, giant (361.03; H33.03-), vitreous detachment/degeneration (379.21; H43.81-), and retinal break without detachment types such as retinal break, unspecified (361.30; H33.30-), horseshoe tear (361.32; H33.31-), and round hole (361.31; H33.32-), as well as retinal dialysis (361.04; H33.04-) and lattice degeneration of the retina (362.63; H35.41-). Additional information for ICD-10 CM states that certain categories have applicable 7th characters and that "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used", and that for bilateral sites "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; the table specifies " = 1, right eye; 2, left eye; 3, bilateral", and that "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

Denominator ARDS identification approach — to balance feasibility and sensitivity, an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code–only denominator akin to NQF 0500 was contemplated but rejected because many patients with ARDS are not recognized by clinicians and an ICD-10-CM–based PM would have low sensitivity and limited impact; an alternative higher-sensitivity definition including all mechanically ventilated acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was also rejected because LTVV may not benefit patients without ARDS and ATS PMs must remain evidence based; instead, to improve specificity, the committee opted for a strategy similar to NQF 3215 requiring electronic health record data extraction for Berlin Definition criteria, ventilator settings, ARDS risk factors, echocardiogram, and other evidence of cardiac dysfunction, despite added complexity judged necessary to support a meaningful PM.

### Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of polygenic risk score-stratified screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^47ab8d70]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Modelling the independent association of PRS with AAA

The non-overlapping subset of 91,731 individuals in UK Biobank also served as the test set for our risk prediction model, using 740 incident time-to-AAA as the outcome of interest to allow for appropriate adjustment of other potentially time-varying risk factors. Date and cause of death together with the date of loss-to-follow-up were collected. The outcome was defined as first hospital inpatient admission with AAA code (either AAA-related surgical procedure or AAA code recorded at admission for other cause) or AAA death. This includes ICD-10 codes I71.3 and I71.4 together with surgical procedure codes (see Supplementary Table 4 for full list); as such this definition does not relate to specific diagnostic criteria such as aneurysm size. This outcome may strictly be defined as "recorded AAA" to reflect the fact that it captures only a proportion of existing AAAs in the population (since those with an unidentified unruptured AAA and those with an unruptured AAA who do not attend hospital in the follow-up period will not be included here), though for simplicity will be hereafter referred to as AAA. Under this definition, the AAA may be known either because of rupture, surgical intervention or detection either via NAAASP or opportunistically. Individuals with a prevalent AAA event at entry into UKB were excluded from this analysis.

### Simulation of ICD-9 to ICD-10-CM transition for family medicine: simple or convoluted? [^3f7280a1]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the transition from International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to Interactional Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), on family medicine and to identify areas where additional training might be required.

Methods

Family medicine ICD-9-CM codes were obtained from an Illinois Medicaid data set (113,000 patient visits and $5.5 million in claims). Using the science of networks, we evaluated each ICD-9-CM code used by family medicine physicians to determine whether the transition was simple or convoluted. A simple transition is defined as 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to 1 ICD-10-CM code, or 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to multiple ICD-10-CM codes. A convoluted transition is where the transitions between coding systems is nonreciprocal and complex, with multiple codes for which definitions become intertwined. Three family medicine physicians evaluated the most frequently encountered complex mappings for clinical accuracy.

Results

Of the 1635 diagnosis codes used by family medicine physicians, 70% of the codes were categorized as simple, 27% of codes were convoluted, and 3% had no mapping. For the visits, 75%, 24%, and 1% corresponded with simple, convoluted, and no mapping, respectively. Payment for submitted claims was similarly aligned. Of the frequently encountered convoluted codes, 3 diagnosis codes were clinically incorrect, but they represent only < 0.1% of the overall diagnosis codes.

Conclusions

The transition to ICD-10-CM is simple for 70% or more of diagnosis codes, visits, and reimbursement for a family medicine physician. However, some frequently used codes for disease management are convoluted and incorrect, and for which additional resources need to be invested to ensure a successful transition to ICD-10-CM.

Statistics on the patient trajectories calculated from the atrial fibrillation cohort extracted from the MIMIC-IV database.

Statistics are provided for both raw data and processed data.

There is a large number of distinct ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes (and analog ATC codes for medications) in the MIMIC-IV data. Since the atrial fibrillation cohort is limited to 6535 patients, pre-processing is needed to reduce the number of node labels for the learning algorithm. The data was processed by: (1) Dropping all Condition nodes, which correspond to earlier versions than ICD-10-CM (ICD-9 and a few ICD-8 codes). (2) Only keeping the chapter (the three first characters) of the ICD-10-CM codes and merging nodes that ended up as identical. (3) Dropping rare events (condition and medication nodes that occurred less than 50 times). After these steps, 944 node labels remained. The largest graph had 143 Encounters, and the largest Encounter had 180 successors. More details about the pre-processed trajectories are given in Table 1.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^a36ea6dd]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Case selection

A total of 4832 records from MCA and 5211 records from MCB were included in the study and analysed in a parallel manner (table 2). On average, the ICD-9-CM subsets had more codes per record than the ICD-10-CM subsets: 8.9 versus 8.4 and 12.5 versus 12.3 in the MCA and MCB datasets, respectively. In the MCA dataset, 657 and 659 dually coded records had a principal diagnosis from the list of nature-of-injury codes shown in table 1, using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, respectively. In the MCB dataset, the corresponding numbers were 537 and 544 records, respectively.

Table 2
Sample selection and characteristics of the Clinical Modification of the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM)/Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of ICD (ICD-10-CM) dually coded datasets

In the MCA dataset, five records had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas seven records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). In the MCB dataset, one record had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas eight records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). Specifically, the ICD-10-CM case definition for injury has been slightly expanded by the NCHS, such that initial encounters for periprosthetic fractures around internal prosthetic joints (T84.04 before 10/01/2016; M97 thereafter) and encounters for injuries and abuse complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (O9A.2-O9A.5) are now included. These expansions accounted for 9 of the additional 15 records that were selected as injuries based only on ICD-10-CM diagnoses, whereas the exclusion of subsequent encounters from the ICD-10-CM case definition accounted for five of the six records selected based only on ICD-9-CM diagnoses.

### Variation in completeness of coding external cause of injuries under ICD-10-CM [^617b7d53]. Injury Prevention (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Information about causes of injury is key for injury prevention efforts. Historically, cause-of-injury coding in clinical practice has been incomplete due to the need for extra diagnosis codes in the International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding. The transition to ICD-10-CM and increased use of clinical support software for diagnosis coding is expected to improve completeness of cause-of-injury coding. This paper assesses the recording of external cause-of-injury codes specifically for those diagnoses where an additional code is still required.

Methods

We used electronic health record and claims data from 10 health systems from October 2015 to December 2021 to identify all inpatient and emergency encounters with a primary diagnosis of injury. The proportion of encounters that also included a valid external cause-of-injury code is presented.

Results

Most health systems had high rates of cause-of-injury coding: over 85% in emergency departments and over 75% in inpatient encounters with primary injury diagnoses. However, several sites had lower rates in both settings. State mandates were associated with consistently high external cause recording.

Conclusions

Completeness of cause-of-injury coding improved since the adoption of ICD-10-CM coding and increased slightly over the study period at most sites. However, significant variation remained, and completeness of cause-of-injury coding in any diagnosis data used for injury prevention planning should be empirically determined.

### Death certificate-based ICD-10 diagnosis codes for COVID-19 mortality surveillance-United States, January-December 2020 [^558158a2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Approximately 375,000 deaths during 2020 were attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates reported to CDC (1). Concerns have been raised that some deaths are being improperly attributed to COVID-19 (2). Analysis of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnoses on official death certificates might provide an expedient and efficient method to demonstrate whether reported COVID-19 deaths are being overestimated. CDC assessed documentation of diagnoses co-occurring with an ICD-10 code for COVID-19 (U07.1) on U.S. death certificates from 2020 that had been reported to CDC as of February 22, 2021. Among 378,048 death certificates listing U07.1, a total of 357,133 (94.5%) had at least one other ICD-10 code; 20,915 (5.5%) had only U07.1. Overall, 97.3% of 357,133 death certificates with at least one other diagnosis (91.9% of all 378,048 death certificates) were noted to have a co-occurring diagnosis that was a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both. Overall, 70%-80% of death certificates had both a chain-of-event condition and a significant contributing condition or a chain-of-event condition only; this was noted for adults aged 18–84 years, both males and females, persons of all races and ethnicities, those who died in inpatient and outpatient or emergency department settings, and those whose manner of death was listed as natural. These findings support the accuracy of COVID-19 mortality surveillance in the United States using official death certificates. High-quality documentation of co-occurring diagnoses on the death certificate is essential for a comprehensive and authoritative public record. Continued messaging and training (3) for professionals who complete death certificates remains important as the pandemic progresses. Accurate mortality surveillance is critical for understanding the impact of variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and of COVID-19 vaccination and for guiding public health action.

Among those who could potentially benefit from screening, some aneurysms ruptured between recall scans, pending a decision about surgery and while awaiting surgery (table 2). Twenty five ruptures also occurred after the men had had normal initial scans, of which 19 were fatal. The rate of these ruptures increased noticeably after eight years of follow-up (fig 2). In years 8, 9, and 10 (when censoring impacts on the follow-up data available) six, six, and three ruptures occurred, respectively, with corresponding rupture rates per 10 000 person years of 3.0, 3.8, and 5.7. Time since initial scan, rather than age, was the main determinant of this increased risk of rupture.

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^f0ecb9a3]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In October 2015, discharge data coding in the USA shifted to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), necessitating new indicator definitions for drug overdose morbidity. Amid the drug overdose crisis, characterising discharge records that have ICD-10-CM drug overdose codes can inform the development of standardised drug overdose morbidity indicator definitions for epidemiological surveillance.

Methods

Eight states submitted aggregated data involving hospital and emergency department (ED) discharge records with ICD-10-CM codes starting with T36-T50, for visits occurring from October 2015 to December 2016. Frequencies were calculated for (1) the position within the diagnosis billing fields where the drug overdose code occurred; (2) primary diagnosis code grouped by ICD-10-CM chapter; (3) encounter types; and (4) intents, underdosing and adverse effects.

Results

Among all records with a drug overdose code, the primary diagnosis field captured 70.6% of hospitalisations (median = 69.5%, range = 66.2%-76.8%) and 79.9% of ED visits (median = 80.7%; range = 69.8%-88.0%) on average across participating states. The most frequent primary diagnosis chapters included injury and mental disorder chapters. Among visits with codes for drug overdose initial encounters, subsequent encounters and sequelae, on average 94.6% of hospitalisation records (median = 98.3%; range = 68.8%-98.8%) and 95.5% of ED records (median = 99.5%; range = 79.2%-99.8%), represented initial encounters. Among records with drug overdose of any intent, adverse effect and underdosing codes, adverse effects comprised an average of 74.9% of hospitalisation records (median = 76.3%; range = 57.6%-81.1%) and 50.8% of ED records (median = 48.9%; range = 42.3%-66.8%), while unintentional intent comprised an average of 11.1% of hospitalisation records (median = 11.0%; range = 8.3%-14.5%) and 28.2% of ED records (median = 25.6%; range = 20.8%-40.7%).

Conclusion

Results highlight considerations for adapting and standardising drug overdose indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM.

### Clostridium difficile-associated disease in the elderly, United States [^21a47909]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Zilberberg et al. recently commented on the increase of hospitalizations for Clostridium difficile –associated disease (CDAD) and noted an increase in the case-fatality rate during 2000–2005. These findings refer to the entire US adult population and agree with our observations for the elderly (> 65 years of age). We assessed trends of CDAD in the elderly by using hospital billing data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which covers 98% of the elderly population. We abstracted all 1,054,125 hospitalization records that included C. difficile (International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification [ICD 9-CM], diagnosis code 008.45) in any of the 10 diagnosis code positions for a 14-year period (1991–2004). We used elderly-population data from the 1990 and 2000 US Census. The ICD code for C. difficile was introduced in 1992. Case-patients in our dataset prior to this date represent severe illness and were hospitalized for > 1 year and therefore were still in the hospital when the ICD code was introduced. We considered data from 1993 through 2004 because 1991 and 1992 are not representative due to introduction of the ICD code.

We observed an increase in overall hospitalizations that included a diagnosis for CDAD (Appendix Figure) and an increase in rates of CDAD from 13.71/10,000 elderly in 1993 to 38.78/10,000 in 2004. The highest rate of hospitalizations was detected in the oldest patients (> 85 years of age), 48.2/10,000 vs. 11.9 in those 65–74 years of age and 26.0 in those 75–84 years of age. These rates might be higher than rates reported by Zilberberg et al. because our records account for all treated conditions recorded by all 10 diagnosis codes. The ICD code for CDAD typically does not appear in the primary and secondary diagnosis; overall, 60% of all CMS records list CDAD as codes 3–10. Primary and secondary codes typically represent diagnoses for which the patient is admitted, whereas diagnosis codes 3–10 are codes used for chronic conditions and sequelae. The Appendix Figure, panel A, shows the change in the proportion of CDAD cases in each diagnosis code over the study period. The proportion of CDAD in the primary and secondary diagnosis position increased during 1996–1997; however, this proportion is stabilizing at ≈25%.

### Evaluating the association between American Association for the Surgery of Trauma emergency general surgery anatomic severity grades and clinical outcomes using national claims data [^c5b7988a]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency general surgery (EGS) encompasses a heterogeneous population of acutely ill patients, and standardized methods for determining disease severity are essential for comparative effectiveness research and quality improvement initiatives. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) has developed a grading system for the anatomic severity of 16 EGS conditions; however, little is known regarding how well these AAST EGS grades can be approximated by diagnosis codes in administrative databases.

Methods

We identified adults admitted for 16 common EGS conditions in the 2012 to 2017q3 National Inpatient Sample. Disease severity strata were assigned using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes based on AAST EGS anatomic severity grades. We evaluated whether assigned EGS severity (multiple strata or dichotomized into less versus more complex) were associated with in-hospital mortality, complications, length of stay, discharge disposition, and costs. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, hospital traits, geography, and year.

Results

We identified 10,886,822 EGS admissions. The number of anatomic severity strata derived from ICD-9/10-CM codes varied by EGS condition and by year. Four conditions mapped to four strata across all years. Two conditions mapped to four strata with ICD-9-CM codes but only two or three strata with ICD-10-CM codes. Others mapped to three or fewer strata. When dichotomized into less versus more complex disease, patients with more complex disease had worse outcomes across all 16 conditions. The addition of multiple strata beyond a binary measure of complex disease, however, showed inconsistent results.

Conclusion

Classification of common EGS conditions according to anatomic severity is feasible with International Classification of Diseases codes. No condition mapped to five distinct severity grades, and the relationship between increasing grade and outcomes was not consistent across conditions. However, a standardized measure of severity, even if just dichotomized into less versus more complex, can inform ongoing efforts aimed at optimizing outcomes for EGS patients across the nation.

### Demographics of children with feeding difficulties from a large electronic health record database [^568eca93]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Feeding difficulties are among the most common concerns expressed by parents in younger children. However, few studies have reported on the characteristics of patients with clinically significant feeding diagnoses. The aim of the current study is to describe the characteristics of patients diagnosed with feeding difficulties including concurrent conditions, age, and sex, sampled nationwide utilizing the Cerner Health Facts Database.

Methods

We identified patients with a diagnosis of feeding difficulties (ICD-9 783.3 or ICD-10 R63.3), age 7 months to 17 years, with an outpatient visit between 2010 and 2017. The demographics and complex clinical conditions of this population were categorized. The cohort was then collapsed into a matrix defining recognized phenotype codes for ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnoses to identify associated conditions.

Results

We identified 39,674 patients (0.95%) representing 101,684 encounters from 68 health systems across the United States; 43% of patients were female. Gastrointestinal conditions were the most common, followed by malnutrition, developmental and behavioral diagnoses, and neurologic conditions.

Conclusions

This study is one of the most robust studies defining the prevalence, demographic characteristics, and phenotypic profiling of patients with feeding difficulties. Our observations have implications on screening and resource allocation to recognize and manage this poorly understood population.

### Use of and comorbidities associated with diagnostic codes for COVID-19 in US health insurance claims [^4cec95fd]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Accurate identification of COVID-19 diagnosis in patient medical records is essential for studies using administrative data to examine morbidity, mortality, and risk factors associated with COVID-19. Before April 1, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested using the existing International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code B97.29 (other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere) as the primary diagnostic code for patients infected with COVID-19. On April 1, 2020, a new code U07.1 (2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease) was added to ICD-10-CM and was rapidly adopted by hospitals. Our study examined how nonhospital and hospital health care professionals have used these diagnostic codes in practice using a national medical claims data set in the US. We analyzed the comorbidities associated with COVID-19 diagnosis to assess the specificity of the legacy code and the importance of using both codes.

### Reduced long-term risk of aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a nationwide observational study [^090d14eb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Follow‐Up and End Points

For the main analyses, all patients were studied from baseline until an end point, death or end of the study (May 31, 2015). The major primary end points were hospitalization for AA or AD and death. AA was defined as codes 441.1 to 441.7 and 441.9 (ICD‐9), where 441.1, 441.3, 441.5, and 441.6 (ICD‐9) were thoracic, abdominal, unspecified, and thoracoabdominal ruptured aneurysms, respectively; and codes I71.1 to I71.6 and I71.8 to I71.9 (ICD‐10), where I71.1, I71.3, I71.5, and I71.8 (ICD‐10) represented thoracic, abdominal, thoracoabdominal, and unspecified ruptured aneurysms, respectively. AD was defined as codes 441.0 to 441.3 (ICD‐9) and I71.0 (ICD‐10).

The other main end point was an analysis of death after hospitalization for AA or AD. Events were obtained by linking data to the Inpatient Register and the Cause of Death register.

Statistical Analysis

The cumulative incidence of AA and AD, as well as subsequent mortality after hospitalization for AA and AD, was estimated using Kaplan‐Meier estimates. It was compared between T2DM and CS groups using Cox regression models containing variables that captured sex, age, preexisting conditions, treatment, and socioeconomic variables, which were based on virtually perfect data.

Time updated observations of clinical characteristics from the NDR were evaluated as risk factors for AA and AD using a Cox regression model in which missing values were imputed with the last value carried forward.

Survival after hospitalization for AA and AD was compared between T2DM and CS groups up to 2 years after the index event using Cox regression models that include sex, age, preexisting conditions, and socioeconomic variables, for which the 2‐year cutoff was chosen to ensure that the models met the proportional hazards assumption.

Descriptive statistics are presented in terms of averages with SDs and counts with percentages. Because the analyses are explorative rather than confirmative, no corrections for multiple comparisons were made.

### Positive predictive value of international classification of diseases, 10th revision, codes for cirrhosis and its related complications [^7a9e696f]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Large administrative databases using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes are useful for epidemiologic, health services, and outcomes research. 1,2 However, coding accuracy of disease conditions could be a limiting factor. Cirrhosis prevalence is increasing because of an aging hepatitis C cohort and an increase in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. 3 We previously examined the validity of ICD, 9th revision (ICD-9), codes for cirrhosis in US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative databases. 4,5 This work has formed the basis for many clinical, epidemiologic, and health services research studies. However, with transition from the ICD-9 to ICD, 10th revision (ICD-10), coding system, it is important to determine the validity of these new cirrhosis codes in administrative databases. Although the greater number of codes in the ICD-10 system may be associated with greater specificity and coding accuracy than with the ICD-9 system, this hypothesis remains untested.

### Trends in severe maternal morbidity in the US across the transition to ICD-10-CM / PCS from 2012–2019 [^178b52ac]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Surveillance of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) is critical for monitoring maternal health and evaluating clinical quality improvement efforts.

Objective

To evaluate national and state trends in SMM rates from 2012 to 2019 and potential disruptions associated with the transition to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification and Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-CM/PCS) in October 2015.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This repeated cross-sectional analysis examined delivery hospitalizations from 2012 through 2019 in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample and State Inpatient Databases, an all-payer compendium of hospital discharge records from community, nonrehabilitation hospitals. Trends were evaluated using segmented linear binomial regression models that allowed for discontinuities across the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition. Analyses were completed from April 2021 through March 2022.

Exposures

Time, ICD-10-CM/PCS coding system, and state.

Main Outcomes and Measures

SMM rates, excluding blood transfusion, per 10 000 delivery hospitalizations, overall and by indicator.

Results

From 2012 to 2019, there were 5 964 315 delivery hospitalizations in the national sample representing a weighted total of 29.8 million deliveries with a mean (SD) maternal age of 28.6 (5.9) years. SMM rates increased from 69.5 per 10 000 in 2012 to 79.7 per 10 000 in 2019 (rate difference [RD], 10.2; 95% CI, 5.8 to 14.6) without a significant change across the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition (RD, -3.2; 95% CI, -6.9 to 0.6). Of 20 SMM indicators, rates for 10 indicators significantly increased while 3 significantly decreased; 5 of these changes were associated with ICD-10-CM/PCS transition. Acute kidney failure had the largest increase, from 6.4 to 15.3 per 10 000 delivery hospitalizations (RD, 8.9; 95% CI, 7.5 to 10.3) with no change associated with ICD transition (RD, -0.1; 95% CI, -1.2 to 1.1). Disseminated intravascular coagulation had the largest decrease from 31.3 to 21.2 per 10 000 (RD, 10.2; 95% CI, -12.8 to -7.5), with a significant drop associated with ICD transition (RD, -7.9; 95% CI, -10.2 to -5.6). State SMM rates significantly decreased for 1 state and significantly increased for 21 states from 2012 to 2019 and associations with ICD transition varied.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, overall US SMM rates increased from 2012 to 2019, which was not associated with the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition. However, data for certain indicators and states may not be comparable across coding systems; efforts are needed to understand SMM increases and state variation.

### Identification of work-related injury emergency department visits using international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) codes [^2d8c153a]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study data

Data for this study were obtained from the Kentucky outpatient services database in the Office of Health Data and Analytics at the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services. Records were deidentified per state data agreements and reflected ED encounters of care rather than unique numbers of individuals receiving care for an injury. Calendar year was based on date of discharge. Records were not limited by patient state of residence for better approximation of resident and non-resident work-related injuries. This study was approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board. Analyses were conducted using SAS V.9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA).

ICD-10-CM ED visit records

Injury-related ED visits were identified from records with a discharge date of 1 January 2016, to 31 December 2019, guided by CDC's 2017 proposed surveillance case definition for injury ED visits. Only initial encounters were included (a seventh character of 'A' or missing) in the ED dataset using a diagnosis code of S00–S99, T07–T34, T36–T50 with a sixth character of 1, 2, 3 or 4; T36.9, T37.9, T39.9, T41.4, T42.7, T43.9, T45.9, T47.9 and T49.9 with a fifth character of 1, 2, 3 or 4; T51–T65, T66–T76, T79; or an external cause-of-injury code of V00–V99, W00–X58, X71–X83, X92–Y09, Y21–Y33 or Y35–Y38. Subsequent and sequelae visits were omitted.

### Consensus recommendations for optimizing electronic health records for nutrition care [^e38c3b60]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2020). High credibility.

Malnutrition diagnosis documentation — Malnutrition diagnoses "have been mapped to ICD-10 codes: mild protein-calorie malnutrition is E44.1, moderate protein-calorie malnutrition is E44.0, and (unspecified) severe protein-calorie malnutrition is E43", and compliant documentation includes "the diagnosis and its severity,… documented by a provider (physician, advanced practitioner provider)"; "the clinical indicators to support the diagnosis, for example, weight loss of 10% in a 3-month time frame"; and "development of a treatment plan… for example, initiation of enteral nutrition (EN)". Malnutrition may be coded as "a secondary diagnosis that can affect the Medicare Severity–Diagnosis Related Group Complications or Comorbidities and Major Complications or Comorbidities", and "Accurate documentation by physicians and advanced practice providers must be present to support coding, reimbursement, benchmarking, and high-quality patient care".

### ICD-10-CM codes | Diagnosis | Healthcare providers… [^b59701f1]. archive.cdc.gov (2022). Medium credibility.

ICD-10-CM Codes Medical Coding Update: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome has a Distinct ICD-10 Code, G93.
32. The research and clinical care of ME/CFS achieved an important milestone on October 1, 2022, with the update to ICD-10-CM. The ICD-10-CM codes now include a specific code for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, G93.
32. The code applies to "myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, " "chronic fatigue syndrome, " and "myalgic encephalomyelitis. " Providers can now select G93. 32 as a diagnostic code for ME/CFS. The update also directs coders to use the code U09. 9 for post-COVID condition when appropriate, making it clearer when ME/CFS occurs following SARS CoV-2 infection. Prior versions of ICD-10-M placed chronic fatigue syndrome in the non-specific "chronic fatigue, unspecified" R53.
82.

This brought much confusion to healthcare providers, patients, and researchers because ME/CFS was grouped with all types of unspecified chronic fatigue. The new code will make it easier for healthcare providers to bill and get reimbursed for ME/CFS-related care as it enables documentation of ME/CFS in medical records. The new release also modifies the description of tabular listing code G93. 3 to encompass both viral and non-viral causes. CDC's National Center for Health Statistics made the recommendations based on a proposal from seven ME/CFS patient advocate organizations to allow accurate coding for understanding ME/CFS using medical records. Potential impacts include more precise tracking of ME/CFS morbidity and mortality and ME/CFS- related healthcare utilization. The new code will not prevent misdiagnosis or under-diagnosis of patients and will not correct for past coding classifications.

However, highlighting the new code will raise awareness of ME/CFS among healthcare providers. For more information and to see a comprehensive list of the ICD-10-CM codes, please visit: Comprehensive Listing ICD-10-CM Files.

### Derivation and validation of a 10-year risk score for symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm: cohort study of nearly 500 000 individuals [^c756da88]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcome

The NHS in the United Kingdom generates routine data on admissions that includes details of all inpatient admissions at all NHS hospitals, and these hospital records were linked by anonymized numeric participant identification number to UK Biobank participants. All clinical data in the hospital inpatient data were coded according to the World Health Organization's ICD-10 codes. All operations and procedures were coded according to the Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys: Classification of Interventions and Procedures codes (OPCS-4). Dates and causes of death were obtained from death certificates held by the NHS Information Center for participants from England and Wales and the NHS Central Register Scotland for participants from Scotland.

The outcome of interest was first hospital inpatient diagnosis of AAA or death from AAA (both based on ICD-10 codes I71.3 or I71.4), or an AAA-related surgical procedure. The definition of AAA-related inpatient diagnosis was therefore based on diagnostic codes for AAA but did not relate to specific diagnostic criteria (such as aneurysm size). As a sensitivity analysis to test performance of the model in discriminating the most serious incident AAA cases, a composite outcome was derived for death from AAA (ICD-10 codes I71.3 or I71.4) or an AAA-related surgical procedure only. In deriving survival models for each participant, the start of the period at risk was the date of assessment, and the period at risk ended at the first qualifying AAA event, or end of follow-up (June 30, 2020, in England; February 29, 2016, in Wales; October 31, 2017, in Scotland), whichever came first. For the 10-year risk score, follow-up was curtailed to a maximum of 10 years for each participant.

### International classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification for the pulmonary, critical care, and sleep physician [^d06e16db]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

After a patient encounter, the physician uses two coding systems to bill for the service rendered to the patient. The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code is used to describe the encounter or procedure. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code is used to describe the diagnosis(es) of the patient. On October 1, 2015, ICD-9-CM coding will end, and all physicians will be required to use a new diagnostic coding system, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). This article describes the new diagnostic coding system and how it differs from the old system. There are resources and costs involved for physicians and physician practices to prepare properly for ICD-10-CM. Similar to other important events, the more thorough the preparation, the more likely a positive outcome will occur. Resource use is very important in preparation for the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Greater familiarity with ICD-10-CM plus a thorough, effective preparation will lead to reduced costs and a smooth transition. Coding descriptor changes and additional codes occur in ICD-10-CM for chronic bronchitis and emphysema, asthma, and respiratory failure. These changes will affect the coding of these diseases and disorders by physicians. Because the number of codes will increase more than fivefold, the complexity of documentation to support ICD-10-CM will increase substantially. The documentation in the patient's chart to support the ICD-10-CM codes used will need to be enhanced. The requirement for accurate and comprehensive documentation cannot be emphasized enough. All of the coding and documentation changes will be a challenge to pulmonary, critical care, and sleep physicians. They must be prepared fully when ICD-10-CM coding begins and ICD-9-CM coding stops abruptly on October 1, 2015.

### Defining indicators for drug overdose emergency department visits and hospitalisations in ICD-10-CM coded discharge data [^653242a6]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
The anatomy of an ICD-10-CM drug poisoning diagnosis code. ICD-10-CM, International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification.

Several key changes in the diagnosis codes from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM guidance had to be considered when defining and tracking drug overdose indicators. These include the following:

External cause of injury codes for drug poisoning were combined with diagnostic codes in ICD-10-CM: under ICD-9-CM, poisoning surveillance indicators relied on both poisoning diagnosis codes, which described the substances involved, and poisoning external cause codes, which conveyed the intent (eg, suicide or unintentional). Under ICD-10-CM, the poisoning diagnosis codes or T-codes (T36-T50) include information on both the substances involved and intent of the injury (ie, '1': accidental, '2': intentional self-harm, '3': assault, '4': undetermined, '5': adverse effect and '6': underdosing).
Coding of undetermined and accidental poisonings changed in ICD-10-CM: under ICD-9-CM, medical coders were instructed to select undetermined intent for external causes of injury when the intent was unspecified in the medical record; however, the guidance under ICD-10-CM instructs coders to default to accidental intent and only select undetermined intent if the medical record explicitly indicates that the intent is undetermined.
ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of underdosing: ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of 'underdosing', the use of less than the prescribed drug according to a provider or drug manufacturer.
ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of encounter type: ICD-10-CM introduced the new concept of encounter type for many injury diagnosis codes. For drug poisoning T-codes, a seventh character of 'A' indicates an initial encounter, 'D' indicates a subsequent encounter and 'S' indicates sequela. An initial encounter captures when a patient is receiving active treatment for the injury event, though it may not be the first encounter related to that injury event (eg, receiving treatment from two physicians for the same injury). A subsequent encounter captures when a patient is seen after active treatment for a follow-up related to the initial injury (eg, follow-up visit related to an overdose). A sequela captures when a patient is being treated for a secondary condition that arose because of the injury (eg, peripheral neuropathy).

### 2022 AHA / ACC key data elements and definitions for cardiovascular and noncardiovascular complications of COVID-19: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical data standards [^8bd30e5b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

AHA/ACC COVID-19 data standards — purpose, scope, harmonization, and privacy are outlined, emphasizing consistent capture of clinical concepts and alignment with broader standards. The key data elements are intended "to facilitate the consistent, accurate, and reproducible capture of clinical concepts" and "standardize the terminology used to describe CVDs and procedures", with goals including "to facilitate further development of clinical registries, implementable clinical guidelines, quality and performance improvement programs, outcomes evaluations, public reporting, and clinical research, including the comparison of results within and across these initiatives" and "to ensure equity across all endeavors related to clinical data standards". The ACC/AHA Task Force "selects cardiovascular conditions, procedures, and other topics related to cardiovascular health and medicine that will benefit from the creation of a clinical data standard set", and expert groups "develop a comprehensive, yet not exhaustive, data standard set" where projects may use "only a subset" or add elements such as "Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes, or outcomes". The intent is "to standardize clinical concepts, focusing on the patient and clinical care and not on administrative billing or coding concepts", envisioning administrative codes "to follow the lead of the clinical data standards". Harmonization is emphasized as the ACC and AHA "recognize that there are other national efforts" and "every attempt is made to harmonize" by instructing writing committees "to consider adopting or adapting existing nationally recognized data standards". Privacy protections are highlighted: HIPAA "went into effect in April 2003" and specifies "protected health information" that "may not be disclosed to third parties… without the patient's permission", while PHI "may be included in databases used for health care operations under a data use agreement", and research using PHI "must be reviewed by an institutional review board"; identifying information is included in the standards "to facilitate uniform collection of these elements when appropriate". Harmonizing definitions "facilitates comparisons and enables the conduct of pooled analyses and meta-analyses", deepening understanding of study results.

### Updated estimates for the burden of chronic limb-threatening ischemia in the Medicare population [^327790fc]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Estimates of chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) based on diagnosis codes of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) suggest a prevalence of 0.23%-0.32% and incidence of 0.20%-0.26% among Medicare patients. ICD-10-CM includes 144 CLTI diagnosis codes, allowing improved specificity in identifying affected patients. We sought to use ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes to determine the prevalence of CLTI among Medicare patients and describe the patient cohort affected by this condition.

Methods

Using two years of data from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, we identified all patients that had at least one CLTI diagnosis code to determine prevalence and incidence rates. Sensitivity analyses were performed to compare our methodology to prior publications and quantify the extent of missed diagnoses. The number and type of vascular procedures that occurred after diagnosis were tabulated. A cohort of patients with two or more CLTI diagnosis codes were then identified for further descriptive analysis. Associations between patient demographics and survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

Over 65 million patients were enrolled in Medicare in 2017 to 2018. Of these, 480,227 had diagnosis of CLTI, with a corresponding to a 1-year incidence of 0.33% and a 2-year prevalence of 0.74%. Patients underwent an average of 43.6 vascular procedures per 100 person-years. Sensitivity analyses identified 89,805 additional patients that had a diagnosis code of peripheral arterial disease who underwent revascularization or amputation. Patients with CLTI were predominantly male (56.2%), white (76.4%), and qualified for Medicare due to age (64.0%). Thirty-seven percent were dual-eligible. One-year survival was 77.7%, significantly lower than estimated actuarial survival adjusted for age, sex, and race (95.1%; P < .001). Cox proportional hazards models demonstrate significantly increased mortality for men vs women (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–1.10; P < .001), but no association between race and overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.98–1.01; P = 0.83).

Conclusions

Using ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, we demonstrated slightly higher incidence and prevalence of CLTI than in published literature, reflecting our more complete methodology. Sensitivity analyses suggest that increased complexity of the highly specific ICD-10-CM coding may diminish capture of CLTI. Inclusion of patients with non-CLTI peripheral arterial disease diagnoses produces moderate increases in incidence and prevalence at the cost of decreased specificity in identifying patients with CLTI. Medicare patients with CLTI are older, and more commonly male, black, and dual eligible compared with the general Medicare population. Observed mid-term survival for patients with CLTI is significantly lower than actuarial estimates, confirming the importance of focused efforts on identifying and aligning goals of care in this complex patient population.

### Cardiomyopathy prevalence and pregnancy-related mortality: United States, 2010 to 2020 [^d5fbb113]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data source for prevalence analysis

For prevalence analyses, we obtained data from the 2010 to 2020 National Inpatient Sample (NIS), produced by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.NIS is a nationally representative data set containing 20% of hospital discharges using all-payer inpatient data. It includes records from state inpatient databases from 48 states (excluding Alabama and Idaho) and the District of Columbia starting in 2017. Before 2017, 44 to 46 states participated.

Study population for prevalence analysis

Our study population included all pregnancy-related hospitalizations among women aged 15 to 55 years. Using an established algorithm, we identified pregnancy-related hospitalizations using International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification and International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) diagnosis and procedure codes and diagnosis related group codes (Supplemental Table 1). A pregnancy-related hospitalization was defined as any hospital discharge record related to pregnancy, including postpartum visits and visits for nonpregnancy-related conditions while pregnant. From pregnancy-related discharges we identified delivery discharges as any hospital discharge record related to delivery of live or still birth. These delivery discharges were denominators of prevalence calculations.

Among pregnancy-related hospitalizations, we defined PPCM as a discharge diagnosis using ICD-9-CM codes 674.50 to 674.54 or ICD-10-CM code O90.3. OCM was defined as a discharge diagnosis using ICD-9-CM codes 425.0 to 425.9, 429.83 or ICD-10-CM codes I42.0 to I42.9, I25.5, I51.81. PPCM is a diagnosis of exclusion. Therefore, the presence of cardiomyopathy codes other than PPCM indicates that the condition was attributed to another cause of heart failure. Consequently, discharges with both PPCM and OCM codes were categorized as OCM. We also analyzed OCM cases excluding those with a PPCM diagnosis.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^e2e7d764]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

Therapeutic epidural interventions — documentation and medical necessity specify that documentation includes evaluation and management services, procedural services, and billing and coding, and that medical necessity requires appropriate diagnosis and coding by the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10-CM) to justify services rendered and indicate the severity of a patient's condition. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services defines medical necessity as: "… no payment may be made under part A or part B for any expense incurred for items or services which. are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member", and further require that a service must be safe and effective; not experimental or investigational and appropriate including duration and frequency; furnished in accordance with accepted standards of medical practice; furnished in a setting appropriate to the patient's medical needs and condition; ordered and/or furnished by qualified personnel; one that meets, but does not exceed, the patient's medical need; and at least as beneficial as an existing and available medically appropriate alternative.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^da217d43]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Standardized code sets — HIPAA mandate and ICD-10 governance in the United States — are described as follows: Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services mandates use of standardized code sets in support of electronic health care transactions, which include International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10); Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS); Current Procedural Terminology (CPT); National Drug Codes (NDCs); and Current Dental Terminology. The World Health Organization created the ICD-10 with adaptability for expansion and specificity for enhanced measurement, surveillance, research, and reporting across multiple domains, and it was clinically modified and initiated in the United States on October 1, 2015. The 4 cooperating parties that oversee and manage the ICD-10 in the United States are the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Health Information Management Association, and the American Hospital Association.

### Regional disparities in incidence, handling and outcomes of patients with symptomatic and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms in Norway [^fdd0511f]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study incidence, handling and outcome of patients hospitalised with symptomatic and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in Norway.

Design, Material and Methods

Retrospective study of 1291 patients, between January 2008 and August 2010 using the National Patient Registry and a regional vascular surgery registry. We applied a stepwise logistic regression model to detect differences in regional in-hospital mortality.

Results

385/711 (54%) patients hospitalised for aneurysm rupture, rAAA (ICD-10: I71.3), died. The odds of dying varied with a factor 2.3 between the extreme regions. 475/711 (67%) underwent repair, 323 survived, giving an in-hospital mortality rate of 32% after surgery. Older patients were significantly less likely to be transported for surgery. The overall incidence for patients aged > 50 was 16.6 rAAA per 100,000 person-years. There was remarkable variation across counties with rates between 7.7 and 26.8. A total of 580 patients were hospitalised with suspected symptomatic aneurysms (ICD-10:I71.4, acute admission); 224 (39%) were treated with aneurysm repair, 356 (61%) were discharged without repair without a significant difference across health regions.

Conclusions

For rAAA, we found substantial geographical variations in incidence, surgery and patient outcome. These results highlight the need for increased awareness about the condition and suggest ways to improve care trajectories to reduce delay to surgery, thereby minimising rupture mortality.

### Stigmatizing language in substance use-related international classification of diseases codes [^b2733d29]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives:

Healthcare-associated stigma is a critical barrier for treatment engagement for patients with substance use disorders. Although there are efforts to combat stigmatizing language in clinical documentation, little is known about the presence of substance use-related stigmatizing language in structured diagnosis codes ubiquitous in clinical medicine.

Methods:

We examined the presence of substance use-related stigmatizing terms contained within the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code descriptions. Stigmatizing terms were compiled from guidelines authored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, while ICD-10-CM codes were obtained from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Results:

We evaluated 74,259 ICD-10-CM code descriptions and identified 173 substance use-related codes with stigmatizing language. The stigmatizing terms detected were "abuse" (157 code descriptions), "alcoholic" (16), and "drug abuser" (2). The term "abuse" was used in relation to multiple substances including alcohol, opioids, cannabis, sedatives, hypnotics and anxiolytics, cocaine, stimulants, hallucinogens, inhalants, other psychoactive substances, tobacco, and other medicinal products.

Conclusions:

Stigmatizing language is used in multiple ICD-10-CM code descriptions. Subsequent iterations should bring ICD-10-CM code descriptions in line with current recommendations for destigmatized descriptors to avoid the perpetuation of stigma in healthcare.

### Positive predictive value of, and, codes for identification of congenital heart defects [^33cdf326]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background Administrative data permit analysis of large cohorts but rely on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes that may not reflect true congenital heart defects (CHDs). Methods and Results CHDs in 1497 cases with at least 1 encounter between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019 in 2 health care systems, identified by at least 1 of 87 ICD-9-CM / ICD-10-CM CHD codes were validated through medical record review for the presence of CHD and CHD native anatomy. Interobserver and intraobserver reliability averaged > 95%. Positive predictive value (PPV) of ICD-9-CM / ICD-10-CM codes for CHD was 68.1% (1020/1497) overall, 94.6% (123/130) for cases identified in both health care systems, 95.8% (249/260) for severe codes, 52.6% (370/703) for shunt codes, 75.9% (243/320) for valve codes, 73.5% (119/162) for shunt and valve codes, and 75.0% (39/52) for "other CHD" (7 ICD-9-CM / ICD-10-CM codes). PPV for cases with > 1 unique CHD code was 85.4% (503/589) versus 56.3% (498/884) for 1 CHD code. Of cases with secundum atrial septal defect ICD-9-CM / ICD-10-CM codes 745.5/Q21.1 in isolation, PPV was 30.9% (123/398). Patent foramen ovale was present in 66.2% (316/477) of false positives. True positives had younger mean age at first encounter with a CHD code than false positives (22.4 versus 26.3years; P = 0.0017). Conclusions CHD ICD-9-CM / ICD-10-CM codes have modest PPV and may not represent true CHD cases. PPV was improved by selecting certain features, but most true cases did not have these characteristics. The development of algorithms to improve accuracy may improve accuracy of electronic health records for CHD surveillance.

### Trends and factors associated with concordance between international classification of diseases, ninth and tenth revision, clinical modification codes and stroke clinical diagnoses [^4dc41749]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) codes are often used for disease surveillance. We examined changes in concordance between ICD-CM codes and clinical diagnoses before and after the transition to ICD-10-CM in the United States (October 1, 2015), and determined if there were systematic variations in concordance by patient and hospital characteristics. Methods- We included Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program patient discharges from 2014 to 2017. Concordance between ICD-CM codes and the clinical diagnosis documented by the physician (assumed as accurate) was calculated for each diagnosis category: ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Results- In total, 314857 patient records were included in the analysis (n = 280 hospitals), 55.9% of which were obtained after the transition to ICD-10-CM. While concordance was generally high, a small, and temporary decline occurred from the last calendar quarter of ICD-9-CM (average unadjusted concordance = 92.8%) to the first quarter of ICD-10-CM use (91.0%). Concordance differed by diagnosis category and was generally highest for ischemic stroke. In the analysis of ICD-10-CM records, disagreements often occurred between ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack records and between subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage records. Compared with the smallest hospitals (≤ 200 beds), larger hospitals had significantly higher odds of concordance (ischemic stroke adjusted odds ratio for ≥ 400 beds, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5–1.9). Conclusions- This study identified a small and transient decline in concordance between ICD-CM codes and stroke clinical diagnoses during the coding transition, indicating no substantial impact on the overall identification of stroke patients. Researchers and policymakers should remain aware of potential changes in ICD-CM code accuracy over time, which may affect disease surveillance. Systematic variations in the accuracy of codes by hospital and patient characteristics have implications for quality-of-care studies and hospital comparative assessments.

### Genetic architecture of abdominal aortic aneurysm in the million veteran program [^76efe5e9]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

AAA Phenotype Definitions

From the participants passing quality control in MVP, individuals were defined as having AAA or being a disease-free control using a previously adjudicateddefinition initially proposed by Denny et al. AAA cases were defined as the presence of 2 instances of any of the following International Classification of Diseases (ICD)–9 or ICD-10 codes in a participant's EHR: 441.3, 441.4, I71.3, or I71.4. Controls were defined as possessing no occurrences of the aforementioned ICD codes, as well as no occurrences of the ICD-9 codes 440 through 448 or ICD-10 codes I71 through I75, I77 through I79, or K55. This identified 7642 AAA cases and 172 172 controls of European ancestry for genetic discovery, and an independent set of 1656 AAA cases and 44 908 controls of European ancestry and 718 AAA cases and 46 380 controls of African ancestry for our PRS analysis. In HUNT, all patients diagnosed with AAA from 1995 through 2014 in Nord-Trøndelag were identified from hospital and outpatient registries from the 3 local hospitals: St Olav's Hospital, Levanger Hospital, and Namsos Hospital. All diagnoses were verified manually using patient chart data. The unique personal identification number was used to link data on AAA diagnoses and death with exposure data from HUNT. This identified 674 AAA cases and 66 358 controls for downstream analysis. In the eMERGE Network, BioMe, and the Penn Medicine Biobank, AAA was defined in a manner identical to the definition proposed by Denny et al. In the Mayo Clinic Vascular Disease Biorepository, which consists of patients referred for noninvasive vascular evaluation including abdominal ultrasound, AAA cases were defined as having an infrarenal abdominal aortic diameter ≥ 3 cm or a history of open or endovascular AAA repair. Controls were not known to have AAA and had no ICD-9 diagnosis codes for AAA.

### Hypertension increases PPV for polycystic kidney disease in PKD1 and PKD2 variant carriers [^5426df33]. HGG Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Phenotypes

UKB data were provided from the UKB resource (accessed September 2022). International Classification of Diseases (ICD) Ninth and Tenth Revision codes and associated dates (both ICD-9 and ICD-10) were collected from inpatient data (category 2000), cancer register (category 100092), and the first occurrences (category 1712), which records the earliest instance of a diagnosis from the primary care data, hospital inpatient data, death register records, and self-reported medical conditions mapped to an ICD-10 code at a 3-character resolution (i.e. E11 instead of E11.0). Helix cohort phenotypes were processed from Epic/Clarity EHR data as previously described and updated as of January 2023. ICD codes and associated dates (ICD-9 and ICD-10-Clinical Modification [CM]) were collected from available diagnosis tables (from problem lists, medical histories, admissions data, surgical case data, account data, claims, and invoices). All datasets were transformed into the OMOP Common Data Model version 5.4. Therefore, diagnosis codes were mapped to SNOMED terms and represented by concept IDs. To be comprehensive in our cohort definition, we used both the source concept ID and the standard concept ID to extract relevant codes.

Clinical diagnosis definition

Phenotypes were defined by diagnosis included in the EHR. HTN, KD, and ESKD were defined by phecode review, as well as a literature search around clinical diagnosis codes (ICD-10, ICD-10-CM, ICD-9, SNOMED) given the different natures of the source datasets. Because all diagnoses were mapped to SNOMED, we identified the first record of each included SNOMED term to represent the first occurrence of disease for the associated individual. KD included instances of codes comprising CKD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or ESKD (the updated Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] terminology guideline), ADPKD, and HTN secondary to KD (indicating the presence of KD). The first incidence of any code falling into each category was considered the first diagnosis date for each category. A complete list of diagnosis codes and mapped SNOMED terms corresponding to each phenotype (HTN, KD, and ESRD) can be found in Tables S2–S4, respectively.

### Proportionate and absolute vascular disease mortality by race and sex in the United States from 1999 to 2019 [^447404e0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This retrospective study utilized a publicly accessible cause of death data in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide‐Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database. This database contains national mortality and population data based on death certificates of US residents, and has been well validated in population based studies of cardiovascular mortality. This database contains detailed information including background demographics, geographic data, diagnosis codes, and mortality. All the data examined for this analysis were population‐level data that are publicly available. As such, no institutional review approval was required.

Individuals aged < 18 years or individuals with unknown age at the time of death on the death certificate were excluded from this analysis. We first analyzed the demographics for the general population, followed by overall CVD and, subsequently, each vascular subtype. We used age‐adjusted mortality rate (AMMR), which is standardized to the 2000 US Census to control for the difference in population age distribution that may have effects on mortality rates. To calculate the AAMR we selected the category/ International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code "Disease of the circulatory system" (ICD, Tenth Revision [ICD‐10] codes I00–I99) (CVD) as the underlying cause of death. We then examined PVD (ICD‐10 I70‐I78 [Diseases of arteries, arterioles, and capillaries]; ICD‐10 I80–89 [Diseases of vein, lymphatic vessel, lymph nodes, not elsewhere classified including phlebitis and thrombophlebitis]; and ICD‐10 I26 [pulmonary embolism]). Following this, we explored the various subtypes of PVD including aortic aneurysm (ICD‐10 I71.1 [Thoracic aortic aneurysm]; ICD‐10 I71.2 [Thoracic aortic aneurysm, without mention of rupture]; ICD‐10 I71.3 [Abdominal aortic aneurysm, ruptured]; ICD I71.4 [Abdominal aortic aneurysm, without mention of rupture]; ICD‐10 I71.5 [Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, ruptured]; ICD‐10 I71.6 [Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, without mention of rupture]; ICD‐10 I71.8 [Aortic aneurysm of unspecified site, ruptured]; ICD‐10 I71.9 [Aortic aneurysm of unspecified site, without mention of rupture]), aortic dissection (ICD‐10 I71.0 [dissection of aorta]), arterial thrombosis (ICD I74 [arterial embolism and thrombosis], ICD‐10 I77 [other disorders of arteries and arterioles] and ICD‐10 I78 [diseases of the capillaries]), venous thrombosis/disease (ICD‐10 I80–89 [Diseases of vein, lymphatic vessel, lymph nodes, not elsewhere classified including phlebitis and thrombophlebitis]), and pulmonary embolism (ICD‐10 I26) (Table S1). We plotted the AAMR per 100 000 individuals. We then compared the AAMR by sex and race (eg, Black men age‐adjusted rate divided by White men age‐adjusted rate). All deaths for 1999 to 2019 reported in the database are classified using the ICD‐10 diagnosis codes. Race was reported by informant (next of kin) or funeral director on the death certificate.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^950eb144]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Dually coded data

Hospital inpatient discharge data independently coded according to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting in two university medical centres located in California (MCA) and in the Midwest (MCB) were used for this study. These data were generated in the ordinary course of business, as part of the process of training and supervising professional coders and predicting the local financial impact of the code set conversion.

At MCA, dual coding was usually done by the same coder, during the same reading of the original record, although in some cases, ICD-10-CM coding was performed by a different coder after the ICD-9-CM coded claim had been submitted. All professional coders at MCA had sufficient experience with ICD-10-CM to be classified as proficient in ICD-10-CM coding. A deidentified version of this dually coded dataset with 5167 systematically sampled records from September 2014 through September 2015 was obtained. From this dataset, 335 records that were originally coded as inpatient claims but later reconciled as 'observation stay' or ambulatory claims were excluded, leaving 4832 records for analysis.

At MCB, dual coding was typically done by different coders after the ICD-9-CM coded claim had been submitted. The prior ICD-9-CM coding was not available to the coders performing ICD-10-CM coding. All professional coders were internally trained in ICD-10-CM and had sufficient experience to be classified as proficient in ICD-10-CM. A deidentified version of this dually coded dataset with 5305 systematically sampled records from 2011 and 2012 was obtained. From this dataset, 94 records were excluded because of the absence of valid diagnosis codes, leaving 5211 inpatient records for analysis.

The University of California Davis Institutional Review Board (ID = 9 86 385) determined that this study did not involve human subjects at either site. Due to unavoidable differences in dual coding methods and time periods, we chose to analyse MCA and MCB data separately.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^3e8241df]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Appendix C-2. Trauma coder's guide to abuse injury coding states that trauma registry and health information coders are key stakeholders and that trauma coders must have the education and skills to accurately code abuse injuries. Coding of injuries related to abuse requires participation in the interdisciplinary assessment team to ensure that coding is accurate, reliable, and can be used to generate reports related to the abused patient. Trauma registry coders need to follow the rules of the most current NTDS Data Dictionary and ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, which give guidance on how to sequence diagnosis codes and external cause codes. Additional custom elements regarding abuse can be developed within the trauma center's registry to assist in identification of this patient population and to further the center's guidelines for pediatric abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence.

### Consensus recommendations for optimizing electronic health records for nutrition care [^681631bc]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2020). High credibility.

Nutrition diagnosis and malnutrition coding — nutrition screening and assessment identify problems requiring treatment, and the Academy's Nutrition Care Process utilizes nutrition diagnoses to standardize nutrition diagnostic terminology; a nutrition diagnosis as defined by the Academy describes a specific nutrition problem that can be improved or resolved through nutrition interventions. The domains of nutrition diagnoses include "intake", "clinical", and "behavioral-environmental" as defined on-page, while a medical diagnosis is used by health care providers and coders as described in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. Malnutrition is one nutrition clinical domain and medical diagnosis (ICD-10 code) that affects patient care as well as appropriate coding, billing, and reimbursement; patients can be diagnosed with malnutrition in any health care setting, organizations should adopt explicit malnutrition criteria that all health care professionals can apply consistently, and the Academy and ASPEN published recommended criteria for the identification of adult and pediatric malnutrition.

### Stigmatizing language in substance use-related international classification of diseases codes [^64b45e79]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Healthcare-associated stigma is a critical barrier for treatment engagement for patients with substance use disorders. Although there are efforts to combat stigmatizing language in clinical documentation, little is known about the presence of substance use-related stigmatizing language in structured diagnosis codes ubiquitous in clinical medicine.

Methods

We examined the presence of substance use-related stigmatizing terms contained within the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code descriptions. Stigmatizing terms were compiled from guidelines authored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, while ICD-10-CM codes were obtained from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Results

We evaluated 74,259 ICD-10-CM code descriptions and identified 173 substance use-related codes with stigmatizing language. The stigmatizing terms detected were "abuse" (157 code descriptions), "alcoholic" (16), and "drug abuser" (2). The term "abuse" was used in relation to multiple substances including alcohol, opioids, cannabis, sedatives, hypnotics and anxiolytics, cocaine, stimulants, hallucinogens, inhalants, other psychoactive substances, tobacco, and other medicinal products.

Conclusions

Stigmatizing language is used in multiple ICD-10-CM code descriptions. Subsequent iterations should bring ICD-10-CM code descriptions in line with current recommendations for destigmatized descriptors to avoid the perpetuation of stigma in healthcare.

### Identification of work-related injury emergency department visits using international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) codes [^832d2f59]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

As most of the work-related ED visits in this study were identified by the use of employment status and place of occurrence codes, it is important to note that these external cause of morbidity codes are not required for reimbursement by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or Kentucky statutes; ICD-10-CM coding mandates vary by state. The usefulness of external cause of morbidity codes is limited by the documentation of occupational information by healthcare practitioners. A sample of medical records from 12 EDs in one state reported 98% ICD-9-CM completion and cause of injury accuracy was 65% and 57% for work-related and non-work-related cases, respectively; only 30% of all cases had completed place of occurrence codes; medical record reviews are yet to be performed on work-related ICD-10-CM cases. Clinicians are encouraged to document adequate injury details (eg, mechanism, intent, location and preceding activity) in the medical record for accurate ICD-10-CM coding of the ED encounter by medical coders. The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists is encouraged to work with medical and professional associations to develop and deliver continuing education and training to raise awareness about the important role that health practitioners serve in work-related injury surveillance and prevention. Suggested training topics range from injury documentation and data entry to quality and completeness of population-based surveillance. Healthcare providers are integral for the accurate assignment by medical coders of ICD-10-CM work-related injuries seen in the ED.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^a5ef0d27]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

ICD-10 Classification Process

We extracted all ICD-10 codes associated with the SARS-CoV-2 testing visit for each patient by matching visit numbers. Codes specific for the outcomes (R50* for fever, R05* for cough, and R06.0* for dyspnea) were selected on the basis of the specifications suggested by the National COVID Cohort Collaborative. The asterisk (*) denotes that any code starting with the specified alphanumeric sequence would be included (ie, R06.03 is included for cough). Using this approach, the following codes were present in our data: R50.9, R50.81, R05, R06.02, R06.00, R06.03, and R06.09. Patients with at least 1 code in a given category were classified as having the symptom according to ICD-10 code.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^cc5f4bb7]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Abuse injury coding — trauma registry and coding guidance emphasizes that "Trauma registrars must have the education and skills to accurately code abuse injuries", and that "Custom trauma registry data elements can improve the trauma center's ability to identify the patient population and review management". Trauma registrars and health information coders are key stakeholders in the development of best practice guidelines for managing abuse injuries, and timely, accurate injury coding begins with the details and descriptions of the injuries documented by the health professionals. "Trauma registrar participation with the interdisciplinary assessment team to validate and clarify the injuries identified is essential for accurate injury coding", and "The registry data are used to generate reports related to abused patients and outcomes". "Trauma registrars need to follow the rules of the most current NTDS Data Dictionary and ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, found in the ICD-10-CM Official Codebook (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2018)", and "These references give guidance on how to sequence diagnosis codes and external cause codes".

### Is there a minimum caseload that achieves acceptable operative mortality in abdominal aortic aneurysm operations? [^7b2c00ea]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Studies have shown correlation between operative workload and mortality for major operations. Is there a threshold for case volume that predicts an acceptable mortality for abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery?

Methods

Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) Data for England between 1997–2002 was analysed using ICD-10 codes I71.x and OPCS-4 codes L16.x-L26.x. Mortality was identified by the method of discharge.

Results

31,078 operations on abdominal aortic aneurysms were studied in 223 NHS Trusts. 6,007 in-hospital deaths were identified in both elective and emergency cases (overall mortality rates 7.7% and 40%, respectively). Trusts with large elective workloads had reduced mortality for both elective and emergency operations. Using parabolic regression and logarithmic transformation, 14 elective operations per Trust per year was identified as a cut-off point above which the decrease in mortality rate with increasing case volume was relatively small. A similar effect was not seen with increasing emergency workload alone.

Conclusion

HES data analysis suggests increasing elective workload correlates with lower in-hospital mortality for elective and emergency operations on abdominal aortic aneurysm. Data suggests a range of hospital caseload that correlate with an acceptable elective and emergency mortality rate.

### ICD-10-CM codes infrequently used to document human trafficking in 2019 nationwide emergency department sample [^69d0278f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

People who experience human trafficking (HT) visit emergency departments (ED). The International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) introduced codes to document HT in June 2018. The aim of this study is to identify characteristics of ED patients who experienced forced labor or sexual exploitation as a documented external cause of morbidity in US visits.

Methods

Nationally representative surveillance based on patient visits to 989 hospital-owned EDs in the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample in 2019 became available in 2021. Eight ICD-10-CM codes to classify HT as an external cause of morbidity were combined into one HT variable for analysis in 2021–2022.

Results

A weighted count of 517 of 33.1 million ED visits (0.0016%) documented HT as an external cause of morbidity. Of them, sexual exploitation (71.6%) was documented more frequently than labor exploitation (28.4%). Most HT-related codes were visits by females (87.3%) from large metropolitan areas, and identified as white. Approximately 40% of visits were from ZIP codes with a median household income less than $48,000 annually. Relative to all other ED visits, patients with HT as an external cause of morbidity had higher odds of being female (OR = 6.54, 95% CI:3.59, 11.92) and being a minor (OR = 1.76, 95% CI:1.02, 3.04).

Conclusion

HT was rarely documented as an external cause of morbidity in 989 hospitals' ED visits from a nationally representative sample in 2019. Documentation of recently added HT ICD-10-CM codes does not appear to have been implemented sufficiently to yield an unbiased representation of those who experienced HT and presented in the ED. Efforts to enhance the utility of ICD-10-CM HT codes for surveillance and documentation must first address ED personnel training on identification and response to HT. In doing so, ED personnel also need to address ethical concerns (e.g. stigma, confidentiality, risk of patient harm) and allow for informed consent among trafficked patients in order to be scaled up responsibly.

### Sleep pattern, genetic susceptibility, and Abdominal aortic aneurysm in UK Biobank participants: large-scale cohort study [^653001c5]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

Details of the design and methods of the UK Biobank study have been previously described. Briefly, the UK Biobank is a large-scale biomedical database and research resource that has recruited over 0.5 million adults aged 40 to 69 between 2006 and 2010. The selection of the study participants is shown in Figure 1. In the current study, we included all participants with a Caucasian ethnic background and complete data on genetics and covariates and excluded anyone with a history of AAA, self-reported AAA, or AAA diagnosed by a physician.

Figure 1
The Flowchart for the Selection of Study Participants from the UK Biobank Cohort

AAA = abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Definition of AAA

The AAA status and related conditions were identified based on the inpatient diagnosis and death registry data provided by the UK Biobank at baseline or during follow-up. Briefly, we categorized individuals who had a main/secondary inpatient diagnosis or a postrecruitment diagnosis of an underlying cause of death by application of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision guidelines (ICD-10: I71.3, I71.4) as having incident AAA. Participants with a previous aortic aneurysm (ICD-10: I71) or atherosclerosis (ICD-10: I70) were excluded to ensure that all participants included in this study were free of AAA at baseline, whether self-reported or diagnosed as an inpatient.

### Hospitalizations for COVID-19 among US people experiencing incarceration or homelessness [^7877a93a]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Limitations

This report has some limitations. The main limitation is our ability to identify PEI and PEH from ICD-10-CM and admission codes. Our findings might not be generalizable to all PEI and PEH hospitalized for COVID-19, and ICD-10-CM codes are likely insufficient to identify all hospitalized PEI. We included admission codes in our PEI definition to broaden the scope, which provided more conservative estimates than ICD-10-CM codes alone. For PEH, ICD-10-CM codes are a more established method of identification but are underused, and hospitals might not have standardized methods for recording housing status in electronic health records. It remains unclear whether PEH identified through ICD-10-CM codes are generalizable to the broader population of hospitalized PEH. The ICD-10-CM codes for homelessness could be used preferentially for individuals who are admitted or who cannot be discharged for reasons associated with their housing status, which could bias our estimates away from the null. However, the importance of medical respite care for these populations remains. In addition, we were unable to deduplicate individuals who accessed care from multiple hospital systems; however, we expect that this small number would be offset by the large sample size. We relied on ICD-10-CM diagnoses to identify obesity and other underlying medical conditions, which likely resulted in an underestimation, but we expect that the underestimation would be similar for all 3 populations. Most hospitals did not report laboratory test results; however, the low reporting is consistent for all 3 populations, there was adequate sample size for analysis, and the findings are consistent with other outcomes (eg, IMV and mortality). Last, although payer status and underlying medical conditions were not included in the fully adjusted model, we conducted sensitivity analyses that included these variables separately and found no meaningful changes in our results (eTable 4 in the Supplement).

### Preparing for international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification implementation: strategies for maintaining an efficient workflow [^204c5163]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is required to be used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services health care billing data starting in October 2015 in the United States. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is an update to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and contains approximately 70,000 codes compared with 14,000 codes. We aimed to discuss how our institution is updating the coding system in a manner that alleviates the possible burden placed on providers including more coding information required and longer load times. We performed a simulation test including testing the diagnosis calculator, timing, and how well the new and old codes mapped. We conducted a gap analysis to ensure that coding could begin in October of 2015 with minimal service interruptions. We will describe strategies and procedures to transition between systems while maintaining efficiency and helping to improve classification.

Prior to data analysis, we adapted an antibiotic tier system originally created by Fleming-Dutra et alfrom the ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) to the ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes (eTable 1 in Supplement 1) and added first-line antibiotic choice and duration recommendations from published guidelines. In this system, tier 1 diagnoses were considered to nearly always require antibiotics, tier 2 diagnoses sometimes require antibiotics, and tier 3 diagnoses rarely ever require antibiotics. We assessed all clinician-assigned ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes for a clinical encounter and categorized them into tiers. We then assigned a single overall visit diagnosis for each encounter using the clinician-assigned ICD-10-CM diagnosis code with the lowest suitable tier. Examples of visit diagnoses that were evaluated include acne, acute and chronic sinusitis, acute otitis media (AOM), community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, Helicobacter pylori infections, lymphadenitis, otitis externa, pharyngitis, sexually transmitted infections, and urinary tract infections (UTIs) (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).

When there was a specific tier 2 diagnosis (eg, acute pharyngitis) listed with a broad tier 1 diagnosis (eg, bacterial infection), the overall visit diagnosis was then attributed to the specific tier 2 diagnosis. If there were multiple diagnoses from the same tier, priority was given to the diagnosis with the most options for optimal antibiotics listed in the guidelines and/or the longest optimal duration of therapy (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Antibiotics prescribed for clinical encounters in tiers 1 and 2 were then compared with those recommended by national guidelines to ascertain whether antibiotic choice and duration were optimal. Antibiotics prescribed for visits in tier 3 were deemed unnecessary and were always considered suboptimal for both antibiotic choice and duration (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1).
