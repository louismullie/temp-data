## Question

Treatment resistant HTN

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing treatment-resistant hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding pseudo-resistance. Then, I should verify the foundational triple therapy and optimize it. Next, I will consider fourth-line therapy, especially mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and how to monitor for safety. After that, I need to evaluate for secondary causes and adjust the regimen accordingly. Finally, I will review device-based options, special populations, and a practical follow-up algorithm, making sure each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic criteria and exclude pseudo-resistance before labeling someone as having true resistant hypertension; resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure at or above 130/80 mmHg despite maximally tolerated doses of three complementary antihypertensives, including a diuretic, or controlled BP requiring four or more agents, and I should confirm this with out-of-office measurements and verified adherence because white-coat effect and nonadherence are common mimics [^1172vRSa] [^115sNad9] [^111hrRsd].

> Wait, let me verify the measurement strategy because misclassification is frequent; I should use standardized office technique and then confirm with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring when feasible, and if ABPM is not available, home BP monitoring is an acceptable alternative, while also checking for interfering substances such as NSAIDs, decongestants, stimulants, and oral contraceptives that can raise BP or blunt therapy [^117T2KHh] [^115tUb7a] [^113LJ97t].

> Hold on, I should verify adherence rigorously rather than assume it; pharmacy refill reviews, pill counts, and self-report are insufficient, and directly observed therapy in small studies has revealed substantial covert nonadherence even among patients with pristine refill histories, so I need to consider DOT or therapeutic drug monitoring when suspicion remains high and before escalating therapy or ordering expensive tests [^117UvUnM].

> Next, I should review the foundational triple therapy and ensure it is truly optimized; the backbone should be a renin–angiotensin system blocker (ACE inhibitor or ARB), a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, and a thiazide-like diuretic such as chlorthalidone or indapamide, with doses pushed to maximally tolerated levels and, when possible, converted to single-pill combinations to improve adherence and reduce therapeutic inertia [^113LJ97t] [^1172vRSa] [^115mfqqb].

> I need to check diuretic choice and kidney function because thiazide-like agents lose potency as eGFR declines; if eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², I should substitute or add a loop diuretic, and if eGFR is 30–44, chlorthalidone may still be reasonable but I should anticipate reduced natriuretic response and consider combination with a loop diuretic when volume overload persists [^115X9Fw5] [^111Wg5Xp] [^116GEuGU].

> Let me consider fourth-line therapy now; spironolactone 25–50 mg daily is the preferred add-on based on PATHWAY-2 and multiple guidelines, with expected home and ambulatory SBP reductions of roughly 6–9 mmHg, and I should confirm potassium is 4.5 mmol/L or less and eGFR is above 45 mL/min/1.73 m² before starting, then recheck electrolytes and kidney function within 1–2 weeks and periodically thereafter [^1172vRSa] [^113LJ97t] [^1116iDo5].

> But wait, what if spironolactone is not tolerated or contraindicated; I should consider eplerenone to mitigate gynecomastia, amiloride 10–20 mg daily which was noninferior to spironolactone in PATHWAY-2, or alternatives such as a beta-blocker, alpha-1 blocker, centrally acting agent like clonidine, or a direct vasodilator, tailoring to comorbidities and monitoring for adverse effects, and I should remember that amiloride is particularly useful when hyperkalemia risk is a concern [^114auHg5] [^113ehTpj] [^112shJGr].

> I should double-check CKD-specific nuances; in eGFR below 45 or with significant albuminuria, nonsteroidal MRAs such as finerenone are reasonable given favorable potassium profiles and kidney protection signals, and if I suspect primary aldosteronism, I must delay spironolactone until after biochemical screening to avoid false negatives, then return to MRA therapy once the workup is complete [^113W8X8Z] [^1172vRSa] [^1127XjLB].

> Next, I should review secondary causes systematically because they are overrepresented in resistant hypertension; I will screen for primary aldosteronism with an aldosterone–renin ratio, evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea, renal artery stenosis, and CKD, and consider pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma or Cushing's when clinical clues are present, as treating these conditions can dramatically improve BP control and sometimes simplify medication burden [^116Xpjfg] [^1119XhEU] [^1172vRSa].

> Let me reconsider device-based therapies; renal denervation has evolving evidence and contemporary guidelines suggest it may be considered in truly resistant hypertension after shared decision-making and evaluation by a multidisciplinary team at experienced centers, with expected ambulatory SBP reductions around 4–6 mmHg off medications in trials, whereas baroreflex activation therapy remains investigational and should be limited to specialized settings pending stronger outcome data [^112KkUuC] [^114t96L4] [^115sNad9].

> I will now examine special populations; in patients with overweight or obesity, GLP-1 receptor agonists or dual GLP-1/GIP therapy can reduce weight and BP and may be adjunctive in resistant hypertension, though direct RHTN trials are limited, and in older adults I should individualize intensity and consider frailty, orthostatic hypotension, and fall risk while still aiming for evidence-based targets when tolerated [^111uHMyw] [^114RqiMh] [^113GhXGe].

> Hold on, I should verify the follow-up cadence; after any regimen change, reassess BP within 2–4 weeks, repeat electrolytes and kidney function 1–2 weeks after adding or modifying diuretics or MRAs, reinforce lifestyle measures including sodium restriction, weight loss, and exercise, and periodically reassess adherence because it can drift over time, with ABPM or HBPM guiding titration and detecting white-coat or masked effects [^117Jg3oM] [^116o6hjb] [^113GhXGe].

> Let me summarize the practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missed; confirm true resistance with out-of-office BP and verified adherence, optimize triple therapy with thiazide-like diuretics and single-pill combinations, add spironolactone as preferred fourth-line with safety monitoring, evaluate comprehensively for secondary causes, consider eplerenone, amiloride, or other classes if spironolactone is unsuitable, and reserve device therapies for carefully selected patients after multidisciplinary review, adjusting for CKD, diabetes, and comorbidities at each step [^1172vRSa] [^113LJ97t] [^112KkUuC].

---

Resistant hypertension is defined as **BP ≥ 130/80 mmHg despite adherence to three complementary antihypertensives (including a diuretic) at maximally tolerated doses, or controlled BP requiring ≥ 4 agents** [^1172vRSa] [^115sNad9]. The prevalence is approximately 12–18% among treated hypertensive patients and is associated with higher risks of cardiovascular and renal events [^115zfCff] [^1172vRSa]. Evaluation must exclude **pseudo-resistance** (white-coat effect, poor adherence, suboptimal regimens) and secondary causes (e.g. primary aldosteronism, CKD, OSA) [^1172vRSa] [^116Xpjfg]. Management centers on **optimizing triple therapy** (ACEi/ARB + CCB + thiazide-like diuretic), then adding spironolactone as the preferred fourth agent; if spironolactone is not tolerated, consider amiloride, beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, or centrally acting agents [^114auHg5] [^113ehTpj]. Lifestyle measures (sodium restriction, weight loss, exercise) and close monitoring are essential; device-based therapies (e.g. renal denervation) are reserved for select cases after shared decision-making [^11791MY7] [^112KkUuC].

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Resistant hypertension is defined as **BP ≥ 130/80 mmHg despite adherence to three complementary antihypertensives (including a diuretic) at maximally tolerated doses, or controlled BP requiring ≥ 4 agents** [^1172vRSa] [^115sNad9]. The diagnosis requires confirmation with **out-of-office BP measurements** (ABPM or HBPM) to exclude white-coat hypertension and to verify true resistance [^111hrRsd] [^117T2KHh].

---

## Prevalence and clinical significance

Prevalence is approximately 12–18% among treated hypertensive patients, with higher rates in clinical trials and specific populations such as CKD and diabetes [^115zfCff] [^116k6F8G]. Clinical significance: RH confers a **higher risk of cardiovascular events** (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure) and renal outcomes, including CKD progression and ESRD [^1172vRSa] [^115zfCff].

---

## Pathophysiology

Key mechanisms include **volume overload** — often due to inadequate diuretic therapy or excess sodium intake — and **increased sympathetic activity**, commonly associated with obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic kidney disease [^1172vRSa] [^115Et26S]. Aldosterone excess, as seen in primary aldosteronism, also contributes to resistance and is a key therapeutic target [^1172vRSa] [^111RPBUT].

---

## Evaluation and diagnostic workup

### Exclusion of pseudo-resistance

Pseudo-resistance includes **white-coat hypertension** — confirm with ABPM/HBPM — and **nonadherence** — assess with pill counts, pharmacy refill data, or directly observed therapy [^1172vRSa] [^117UvUnM]. Suboptimal regimens should be optimized by ensuring **maximally tolerated doses** and appropriate combinations [^1172vRSa] [^113LJ97t].

---

### Identification of secondary causes

- **Primary aldosteronism**: Screen with ARR; confirm with salt loading or CCT.
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Evaluate eGFR, albuminuria, and adjust diuretic therapy.
- **Obstructive sleep apnea**: Screen with STOP-BANG; refer for polysomnography.
- **Renal artery stenosis**: Consider in refractory cases with suggestive features.
- **Pheochromocytoma**: Screen if paroxysmal symptoms or labile hypertension [^1172vRSa] [^116Xpjfg].

---

## Management strategies

### Lifestyle modifications

- **Sodium restriction**: < 2 g/day.
- **Weight loss**: Aim for BMI < 25 kg/m².
- **Physical activity**: ≥ 150 min/week of moderate-intensity exercise.
- **Alcohol moderation**: ≤ 1 drink/day (women), ≤ 2 drinks/day (men).
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended [^111pXStm].

---

### Pharmacological management

#### Step 1: Optimize triple therapy

Triple therapy should include an **ACE inhibitor or ARB**, a **calcium channel blocker**, and a **thiazide-like diuretic** (preferably chlorthalidone or indapamide) [^1172vRSa] [^113LJ97t].

---

#### Step 2: Add a fourth agent

The preferred fourth-line agent is **spironolactone 25–50 mg/day**; monitor potassium and renal function closely [^1172vRSa] [^114auHg5]. If spironolactone is not tolerated, alternatives include **amiloride, beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, or centrally acting agents** (clonidine, moxonidine) [^113ehTpj] [^112shJGr].

---

#### Step 3: Consider novel therapies

Consider **renal denervation** for selected patients with persistent uncontrolled BP despite optimal medical therapy, using shared decision-making and multidisciplinary evaluation [^112KkUuC] [^114t96L4]. Emerging pharmacologic agents under investigation include **aldosterone synthase inhibitors, dual endothelin receptor antagonists, and nonsteroidal MRAs** [^1172vRSa] [^1128v5Th].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **regular BP checks** with ABPM/HBPM to guide therapy and detect white-coat or masked hypertension [^117Jg3oM] [^117T2KHh]. Laboratory surveillance should include periodic assessment of **renal function and electrolytes**, particularly after adding or adjusting diuretics or MRAs [^117Jg3oM] [^1116iDo5]. Adherence should be reassessed at each visit, with interventions to improve it as needed [^117Jg3oM] [^112qhhn2].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Prognosis and outcomes: RH is associated with **increased risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, CKD progression, and mortality** compared with nonresistant hypertension [^1172vRSa] [^115zfCff]. Effective management — achieving BP targets and addressing secondary causes — **improves outcomes** [^1172vRSa] [^114oAhFe].

---

Resistant hypertension is a high-risk phenotype requiring **structured evaluation** to exclude pseudo-resistance and secondary causes, followed by **stepwise pharmacologic therapy** anchored by optimized triple therapy and spironolactone, with lifestyle interventions and selective use of device-based options.

### Evaluation and management of resistant hypertension: core curriculum 2024 [^117BqjS3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above goal despite confirmed adherence to 3 first-line antihypertensive agents or when blood pressure is controlled with 4 or more medications at maximal or maximally tolerated doses. In addition to meeting these criteria, identifying patients with true resistant hypertension requires both accurate in-office blood pressure measurement as well as excluding white coat effects through out-of-office blood pressure measurements. Patients with resistant hypertension are at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular events and are more likely to have a potentially treatable secondary cause contributing to their hypertension. Effective treatment of resistant hypertension includes ongoing lifestyle modifications and collaboration with patients to detect and address barriers to optimal medication adherence. Pharmacologic treatment should prioritize optimizing first-line, once daily, longer acting medications followed by the stepwise addition of second-, third-, and fourth-line agents as tolerated. Physicians should systematically evaluate for and address any underlying secondary causes. A coordinated, multidisciplinary team approach including clinicians with experience in treating resistant hypertension is essential. New treatment options, including both pharmacologic and device-based therapies, have recently been approved, and more are in the pipeline; their optimal role in the management of resistant hypertension is an area of ongoing research.

### How can resistant hypertension be identified and prevented? [^112QtDes]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is highly prevalent, and is the form of arterial hypertension that is most difficult to treat. Many patients diagnosed with this disease do not have resistant hypertension, but rather have mismanaged primary hypertension. In many cases blood pressure can be controlled by directly addressing underlying causes such as primary aldosteronism, obstructive sleep apnoea, or excessive neurogenic stimulation. Clinicians should ensure that appropriate blood-pressure measurements are used to diagnose resistant hypertension, explore a variety of drug combinations, and battle clinical inertia. Patients should comply with medication schedules and dietary modifications. Correction of these factors will greatly diminish the prevalence of 'resistant' hypertension and avoid the consequences of a persistently elevated blood pressure in these patients.

### Recognition and management of resistant hypertension [^113RrpeN]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite improvements in hypertension awareness and treatment, 30%-60% of hypertensive patients do not achieve BP targets and subsequently remain at risk for target organ damage. This therapeutic gap is particularly important to nephrologists, who frequently encounter treatment-resistant hypertension in patients with CKD. Data are limited on how best to treat patients with CKD and resistant hypertension, because patients with CKD have historically been excluded from hypertension treatment trials. First, we propose a consistent definition of resistant hypertension as BP levels confirmed by both in-office and out-of-office measurements that exceed appropriate targets while the patient is receiving treatment with at least three antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic, at dosages optimized to provide maximum benefit in the absence of intolerable side effects. Second, we recommend that each patient undergo a standardized, stepwise evaluation to assess adherence to dietary and lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medications to identify and reduce barriers and discontinue use of substances that may exacerbate hypertension. Patients in whom there is high clinical suspicion should be evaluated for potential secondary causes of hypertension. Evidence-based management of resistant hypertension is discussed with special considerations of the differences in approach to patients with and without CKD, including the specific roles of diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and the current place of emerging therapies, such as renal denervation and baroreceptor stimulation. We endorse use of such a systematic approach to improve recognition and care for this vulnerable patient group that is at high risk for future kidney and cardiovascular events.

### Guideline-driven management of hypertension: an evidence-based update [^114ugJqL]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Several important findings bearing on the prevention, detection, and management of hypertension have been reported since publication of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guideline. This review summarizes and places in context the results of relevant observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and meta-analyses published between January 2018 and March 2021. Topics covered include blood pressure measurement, patient evaluation for secondary hypertension, cardiovascular disease risk assessment and blood pressure threshold for drug therapy, lifestyle and pharmacological management, treatment target blood pressure goal, management of hypertension in older adults, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, resistant hypertension, and optimization of care using patient, provider, and health system approaches. Presenting new information in each of these areas has the potential to increase hypertension awareness, treatment, and control which remain essential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the future.

### Intensive blood pressure treatment for resistant hypertension [^114oAhFe]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Perspectives

Resistant hypertension is a common clinical problem faced by both specialists and primary care clinicians. Although the management of resistant hypertension is important, evidence about the BP target in patients with resistant hypertension is currently limited. The present study demonstrated that intensive BP treatment resulted in a decreased incidence of cardiovascular events and death in patients with resistant hypertension. Similar associations between intensive BP treatment and decreased risk of cardiovascular events and death were observed in the relevant subgroups with resistant hypertension. Considering the pathogenesis of resistant hypertension associated with aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor signaling, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, specifically spironolactone, may be a highly effective BP-lowering treatment option for patients with resistant hypertension. In addition, achieving lower target BP requires a combination of treatment with antihypertensive drugs and lifestyle adjustments, such as restriction of dietary salt restriction, exercise, and weight loss. Moreover, improving adherence to BP treatment and detecting treatable causes of resistant hypertension, such as obstructive sleep apnea and primary aldosteronism, are important. Further long-term follow-up studies are required to investigate the effective management of BP in patients with resistant hypertension.

### Diagnosis and management of resistant hypertension [^1172vRSa]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure that remains above the therapeutic goal despite concurrent use of at least three antihypertensive agents of different classes, including a diuretic, with all agents administered at maximum or maximally tolerated doses. Resistant hypertension is also diagnosed if blood pressure control requires four or more antihypertensive drugs. Assessment requires the exclusion of apparent treatment resistant hypertension, which is most often the result of non-adherence to treatment. Resistant hypertension is associated with major cardiovascular events in the short and long term, including heart failure, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and renal failure. Guidelines from several professional organizations recommend lifestyle modification and antihypertensive drugs. Medications typically include an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a long acting thiazide-type/like diuretic; if a fourth drug is needed, evidence supports addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. After a long pause since 2007 when the last antihypertensive class was approved, several novel agents are now under active development. Some of these may provide potent blood pressure lowering in broad groups of patients, such as aldosterone synthase inhibitors and dual endothelin receptor antagonists, whereas others may provide benefit by allowing treatment of resistant hypertension in special populations, such as non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with chronic kidney disease. Several device based approaches have been tested, with renal denervation being the best supported and only approved interventional device treatment for resistant hypertension.

### Diagnosis and management of resistant hypertension: state of the art [^117JSpAX]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2018). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as a lack of ambulatory blood pressure response to optimized medical treatment after exclusion of secondary hypertension in patients who are fully adherent to antihypertensive therapy. Patients with resistant hypertension are at high risk of complications, particularly cardiovascular events, and optimization of medical treatment remains the cornerstone of their management. Such optimization should be based on simple algorithms and include the use of aldosterone antagonists. The available data from clinical trials do not support the use of device-based approaches such as renal denervation, baroreflex activation therapy or arteriovenous anastomosis for the treatment of resistant hypertension in the majority of patients. Therefore, device treatment remains a last-resort for patients with truly resistant hypertension in the context of clinical research in highly skilled tertiary referral centres. Future research should focus on improving understanding of the intrinsic (physiological and psychological factors) and extrinsic (environmental stressors) mechanisms that contribute to a lack of response to blood-pressure-lowering drugs in adherent patients. The use of biomarkers to identify patients with early target organ damage and new technologies, such as renal nerve stimulation, to predict blood pressure responses to renal denervation could aid the selection of patients who might benefit from device therapies.

### Management of resistant hypertension: expert consensus statement from the French society of hypertension, an affiliate of the French society of cardiology [^111DTZpH]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

To improve the management of resistant hypertension, the French Society of Hypertension, an affiliate of the French Society of Cardiology, has published a set of eleven recommendations. The primary objective is to provide the most up-to-date information based on the strongest scientific rationale and that is easily applicable to daily clinical practice. Resistant hypertension is defined as uncontrolled blood pressure on office measurements and confirmed by out-of-office measurements despite a therapeutic strategy comprising appropriate lifestyle and dietary measures and the concurrent use of three antihypertensive agents including a thiazide diuretic, a renin-angiotensin system blocker (ARB or ACEI) and a calcium channel blocker, for at least 4 weeks, at optimal doses. Treatment compliance must be closely monitored, as must factors that are likely to affect treatment resistance (excessive dietary salt intake, alcohol, depression, drug interactions and vasopressor drugs). If the diagnosis of resistant hypertension is confirmed, the patient should be referred to a hypertension specialist to screen for potential target organ damage and secondary causes of hypertension. The recommended treatment regimen is a combination therapy comprising four treatment classes, including spironolactone (12.5–25 mg per day). In the event of a contraindication or a non-response to spironolactone, or if adverse effects occur, a β-blocker, an α-blocker, or a centrally acting antihypertensive drug should be prescribed. Because renal denervation is still undergoing assessment for the treatment of hypertension, this technique should only be prescribed by a specialist hypertension clinic.

### Resistant hypertension: a review of diagnosis and management [^111RPBUT]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Resistant hypertension-uncontrolled hypertension with 3 or more antihypertensive agents-is increasingly common in clinical practice. Clinicians should exclude pseudoresistant hypertension, which results from nonadherence to medications or from elevated blood pressure related to the white coat syndrome. In patients with truly resistant hypertension, thiazide diuretics, particularly chlorthalidone, should be considered as one of the initial agents. The other 2 agents should include calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for cardiovascular protection. An increasing body of evidence has suggested benefits of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as eplerenone and spironolactone, in improving blood pressure control in patients with resistant hypertension, regardless of circulating aldosterone levels. Thus, this class of drugs should be considered for patients whose blood pressure remains elevated after treatment with a 3-drug regimen to maximal or near maximal doses. Resistant hypertension may be associated with secondary causes of hypertension including obstructive sleep apnea or primary aldosteronism. Treating these disorders can significantly improve blood pressure beyond medical therapy alone. The role of device therapy for treating the typical patient with resistant hypertension remains unclear.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^116RDsEQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — summary of guideline recommendations: The ACC/AHA guideline defines resistant hypertension as BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg with use of ≥ 3 antihypertensive medications with complementary mechanisms or when 4 or more medications are needed to achieve control, noting prior definitions of BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg despite ≥ 3 medications and the 2008 AHA addition of controlled BP < 140/90 mm Hg on ≥ 4 medications. The guideline also states that nephrologists, endocrinologists, and hypertension specialists should be utilized in management and outlines an algorithm to evaluate pseudo-resistance (nonadherence or white-coat hypertension), lifestyle factors, interfering substances (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral contraceptives), and then secondary causes of hypertension.

### Managing' resistance': is adherence a target for treatment? [^112sRcXT]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Adherence to preventive measures and prescribed medications is the cornerstone of the successful management of hypertension. The role of adherence is particularly important when treatments are not providing the expected clinical results, for example, in patients with resistant hypertension. The goal of this article is to review the recent observations regarding drug adherence in resistant hypertension.

Recent Findings

Today, the role of drug adherence as a potential cause of resistant hypertension is largely underestimated. Most studies suggest that a low adherence to the prescribed medications can affect up to 50% of patients with resistant hypertension. A good adherence to therapy is generally associated with an improved prognosis. Nonetheless, adherence should probably not be a target for treatment per se because data on adherence should always be interpreted in the view of clinical results. In our opinion, the availability of reliable data on drug adherence would be a major help for physicians to manage patients apparently resistant to therapy.

Summary

The actual development of new drugs for hypertension is slow. Thus, focusing on drug adherence to the drugs available is an important way to improve blood pressure control in the population. More emphasis should be put on measuring drug adherence in patients with resistant hypertension to avoid costly investigations and treatments.

Treatment‑resistant hypertension — definition and management approach: Resistant HTN in adults is defined as persistently elevated BP despite treatment with 3 or more antihypertensive agents of different classes, and all of these drugs should be prescribed at maximally effective doses, with at least 1 being a diuretic. Key to identifying true resistant HTN is correct office BP measurement, confirmation of adherence to current therapy, and confirmation of treatment resistance by ABPM. Management includes dietary sodium restriction, elimination of substances known to elevate BP, identification of previously undiagnosed secondary causes of HTN, optimization of current therapy, and addition of additional agents as needed; recent clinical trial data suggest that an aldosterone receptor antagonist (such as spironolactone) is the optimal additional agent in adults with resistant HTN. At present, there are no data on whether true treatment‑resistant HTN exists in pediatric patients, and strategies similar to those proven effective in adults would be reasonable in children and adolescents who present with apparent treatment resistance.

### Special article-the management of resistant hypertension: a 2020 update [^117F5f5q]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension (RH) induces higher morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease and stroke than hypertension without treatment resistance. New guidelines define RH as blood pressure (BP) ≥ 130/80 mmHg in a patient taking ≥ 3 antihypertensive agents of different classes or BP < 130/80 mmHg in a patient taking ≥ 4 antihypertensive drugs. According to the new definition, pseudo-resistance due to error in BP measurement, white coat effect and medication nonadherence must be excluded to make the diagnosis of RH. This 2020 update focuses on the lifestyle and antihypertensive drug management of RH and includes recent proof-of-principle trials of renal nerve ablation in hypertension. Stepwise evidence-based pharmacologic treatment of RH includes optimization of the 3-drug regimen, substitution of a thiazide-like for a thiazide diuretic and addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist as the fourth drug. Non-evidence-based recommendations include addition of a β-blocker as the fifth drug and switching to a minoxidil-based regimen as the final step in achieving BP control.

Resistant hypertension is a common clinical entity, defined as suboptimal blood pressure response to multiple therapies after excluding medication nonadherence and secondary forms of hypertension. Patients with resistant hypertension generally share several comorbidities. Resistant hypertension is more common in individuals of African descent. Blood pressure should be optimized using multiple strategies, including lifestyle changes and single-pill combination therapies, with the aim of reducing cardiovascular events while reducing side effects from using antihypertensive therapy. A renin/aldosterone-based diagnostic and treatment approach will help tailor therapy. The use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists or amiloride as appropriate is favored.

Description

In November 2017, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) released a clinical practice guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure (BP) in adults. This article summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2014, the ACC and the AHA appointed a multidisciplinary committee to update previous reports of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. The committee reviewed literature and commissioned systematic reviews and meta-analyses on out-of-office BP monitoring, the optimal target for BP lowering, the comparative benefits and harms of different classes of antihypertensive agents, and the comparative benefits and harms of initiating therapy with a single antihypertensive agent or a combination of 2 agents.

Recommendations

This article summarizes key recommendations in the following areas: BP classification, BP measurement, screening for secondary hypertension, nonpharmacologic therapy, BP thresholds and cardiac risk estimation to guide drug treatment, treatment goals (general and for patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and advanced age), choice of initial drug therapy, resistant hypertension, and strategies to improve hypertension control.

INTRODUCTION

Hypertension (HTN) is the most common condition seen in primary care, with a global prevalence of 41% in the general population. Uncontrolled HTN is a risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease, sources of significant morbidity and cost to society, and is therefore an important public health target. An estimated 14–16% of hypertensive patients have apparent treatment-resistant hypertension (ATRHTN). This proportion will be even higher if more stringent criteria are adopted for adequate blood pressure control. – ATRHTN is defined as inadequately controlled blood pressure despite receiving three or more adequately dosed hypertensive medications, of which at least one is a diuretic. Adherence is a key factor in ATRHTN, and according to some estimates, 50% of patients with ATRHTN do not adhere to their medication. – The most common fourth-line treatment is the addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) to the treatment regimen. In recent years, other pharmacological interventions have been developed, including darusentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, as well as various device-based strategies such as renal denervation (RDN) and central arteriovenous anastomosis (CAA).

A lack of data on the comparative effectiveness of these new treatment strategies poses challenges to the production and interpretation of relevant clinical evidence and to choosing optimal treatment strategies for patients. Direct comparison trials and conventional pairwise meta-analyses have demonstrated different conclusions regarding the efficacy of RDN, likely because of the heterogeneity in control treatments. Trials of RDN, for example, have compared RDN with standard medication therapy (no additional treatment), with a sham procedure (mimicking RDN without actually performing the intervention)and with MRA as add-on therapy. While a recent medium-sized trial showed that RDN was superior to MRA, another trial of the same size failed to show a difference in the primary endpoint. Among direct comparisons of RDN with other active treatments, results have been mixed. Three conventional pairwise meta-analyses show RDN to be superior, while a fourth meta-analysis, based exclusively on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), casts doubt on these conclusions.

Resistant hypertension — core management recommendations state that, in adults with resistant hypertension, a more detailed evaluation for secondary causes, including careful review of all medications and removal of those with interfering effects on BP, is beneficial for lowering BP and simplifying treatment (class 1, level B-NR). In adults with uncontrolled resistant hypertension who cannot tolerate or have contraindications to MRA, adding one of the following agents or classes — amiloride, BBs, alpha-blockers, central sympathetic drugs, dual endothelin receptor antagonists, or direct vasodilators — is reasonable to control BP (class 2a, level B-R).

### Renal sympathetic nerve ablation for the management of resistant hypertension: an update [^111XhqyP]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to provide clinicians with a concise update on renal sympathetic nerve ablation in the management of resistant hypertension. The review will specifically discuss the latest clinical trial findings, technological advancements in ablation modalities and expert guidelines for patient eligibility. Novel therapeutic applications beyond blood pressure (BP) control will also be discussed.

Recent Findings

Follow-up data from the Symplicity Clinical Trials Program provides further evidence for the safety of the procedure and substantiates a sustained reduction in BP in most patients with resistant hypertension. Recently published expert consensus statements recommend that only patients with resistant hypertension should undergo the procedure at this stage. Several alternative treatment modalities for renal denervation have been developed to improve efficacy, procedure time and safety. Initial findings suggest comparable BP reductions amongst technical approaches. Several pilot studies, although predominantly uncontrolled, indicate additional benefits of renal sympathetic nerve ablation on regression of hypertensive end-organ damage, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and other disturbances commonly associated with resistant hypertension.

Summary

Catheter-based renal nerve ablation is emerging as a well tolerated, effective and cost-effective treatment to control BP in patients with resistant hypertension. Further studies are required to determine the long-term impact of this novel therapeutic option.

### Resistant hypertension: diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association professional education committee of the council for high blood pressure research [^111zMofF]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

Resistant hypertension is a common clinical problem faced by both primary care clinicians and specialists. While the exact prevalence of resistant hypertension is unknown, clinical trials suggest that it is not rare, involving perhaps 20% to 30% of study participants. As older age and obesity are 2 of the strongest risk factors for uncontrolled hypertension, the incidence of resistant hypertension will likely increase as the population becomes more elderly and heavier. The prognosis of resistant hypertension is unknown, but cardiovascular risk is undoubtedly increased as patients often have a history of long-standing, severe hypertension complicated by multiple other cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. The diagnosis of resistant hypertension requires use of good blood pressure technique to confirm persistently elevated blood pressure levels. Pseudoresistance, including lack of blood pressure control secondary to poor medication adherence or white coat hypertension, must be excluded. Resistant hypertension is almost always multifactorial in etiology. Successful treatment requires identification and reversal of lifestyle factors contributing to treatment resistance; diagnosis and appropriate treatment of secondary causes of hypertension; and use of effective multidrug regimens. As a subgroup, patients with resistant hypertension have not been widely studied. Observational assessments have allowed for identification of demographic and lifestyle characteristics associated with resistant hypertension, and the role of secondary causes of hypertension in promoting treatment resistance is well documented; however, identification of broader mechanisms of treatment resistance is lacking. In particular, attempts to elucidate potential genetic causes of resistant hypertension have been limited. Recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of resistant hypertension remain largely empiric due to the lack of systematic assessments of 3 or 4 drug combinations. Studies of resistant hypertension are limited by the high cardiovascular risk of patients within this subgroup, which generally precludes safe withdrawal of medications; the presence of multiple disease processes (eg, sleep apnea, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic disease) and their associated medical therapies, which confound interpretation of study results; and the difficulty in enrolling large numbers of study participants. Expanding our understanding of the causes of resistant hypertension and thereby potentially allowing for more effective prevention and/or treatment will be essential to improve the long-term clinical management of this disorder.

### Diagnosis and management of resistant hypertension [^112QQKqM]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is a condition where blood pressure levels remain elevated above target despite changes in lifestyle and concurrent use of at least three antihypertensive agents, including a long-acting calcium channel blocker (CCB), a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system (ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker) and a diuretic. To be diagnosed as resistant hypertension, maintaining adherence to therapy is required along with confirmation of blood pressure levels above target by out-of-office blood pressure measurements and exclusion of secondary causes of hypertension. The key management points of this condition include lifestyle changes such as reduced sodium and alcohol intake, regular physical activity, weight loss and discontinuation of substances that can interfere with blood pressure control. It is also recommended that current treatment be rationalised, including single pill combination treatment where antihypertensive drugs should be provided at the maximum tolerated dose. It is further recommended that current drugs be replaced with a more appropriate and less difficult treatment regimen based on the patient's age, ethnicity, comorbidities and risk of drug-drug interactions. The fourth line of treatment for patients with resistant hypertension should include mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as spironolactone, as demonstrated in the PATHWAY-2 trial and meta-analyses. Alternatives to spironolactone include amiloride, doxazosin, eplerenone, clonidine and beta-blockers, as well as any other antihypertensive drugs not already in use. New approaches under research are selective non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as finerenone, esaxerenone and ocedurenone, selective aldosterone synthase inhibitors such as baxdrostat, and dual endothelin antagonist aprocitentan.

### A network meta-analysis of clinical management strategies for treatment-resistant hypertension: making optimal use of the evidence [^111igVPm]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

With the addition of surgical interventions to current medicinal treatments, it is increasingly challenging for clinicians to rationally choose among the various options for treating patients with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension (ATRHTN). This study aims to establish the comparative effectiveness of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), renal denervation (RDN), darusentan and central arteriovenous anastomosis (CAA) for patients with ATRHTN by performing a network meta-analysis.

Methods

Data Sources: Studies from recent meta-analyses for RDN and placebo effect were supplemented with a systematic search for MRAs in ATRHTN in the Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane databases through November 2016.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials comparing treatment options for patients with ATRHTN.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were extracted using predefined data extraction forms, including the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. A Bayesian random effects model was used to conduct a network meta-analysis. Spironolactone was used as the main comparator. Main Outcomes and Measures: Reduction in 24-h ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM).

Results

Twenty articles met our inclusion criteria, and seven treatment alternatives were compared. Compared to MRA, CAA had the highest probability of being more effective, further reducing 24-h SBP (-4.8 mmHg [-13.0, 3.7]) and 24-h DBP (-9.7 mmHg [-18, -0.63]). This difference is likely to be clinically meaningful, with a probability of 78 and 96% at a threshold of a 2-mmHg reduction in blood pressure.

Conclusions

When compared to MRA as anchor, darusentan, CAA and RDN are not more effective in achieving a clinically significant reduction in ambulatory blood pressure in individuals with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension.

### Investigation and management of resistant hypertension: British and Irish hypertension society position statement [^1125VKej]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension remains the single most important modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), disability and death in the world. An estimated 30% of adults in the UK have hypertension, and at least 1/3rd of them fail to achieve the recommended blood pressure (BP) targets despite therapeutic intervention. Such individuals have a 50% greater risk of CVD and kidney disease compared to those who achieve target BP. Although BP measurement errors, lifestyle factors, suboptimal treatment strategies and undiagnosed secondary hypertension may explain poor BP control in some individuals, a proportion of people present with true resistant hypertension (RH) and remain at increased risk of CVD.

The British and Irish Hypertension Society (BIHS) has identified suspected RH as condition for which specialist guidance may help improve rates of BP control and help clinicians identify those people who may benefit from specialist review. In this statement, we outline the BIHS recommendations for the investigation and management of adults living with RH, based on a critical review of the literature and expert opinion where evidence is lacking. Practical approaches are described to facilitate the delivery of high-quality and consistent care across the UK and Ireland.

### Proceedings from Duke resistant hypertension think tank [^1131HuwZ]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

To identify patients at increased risk for cardiovascular outcomes, apparent treatment resistant hypertension (aTRH) is defined as having a blood pressure (BP) above goal despite the use of ≥ 3 antihypertensive therapies of different classes at maximally tolerated doses, ideally including a diuretic. In light of growing scientific interest in the treatment of this group, a multistakeholder think tank was convened to discuss the current state of knowledge, improve the care of these patients, and identify appropriate study populations for future observational and randomized trials in the field. Although recent epidemiologic studies in selected populations estimate that the prevalence of aTRH is 10% to 15% of hypertensive patients, further large-scale observational studies will be needed to better elucidate risk factors. To spur the development of therapies for aTRH, the development of an "aTRH" label for pharmacologic and device therapies with a developmental pathway including treatment added to the use of existing therapies is favored. Although demonstration of adequate BP lowering should be sufficient to gain Food and Drug Administration approval for therapies targeting aTRH, assessment of improvement in quality of life and cardiovascular outcomes is also desirable and considered in Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services coverage decisions. Device trials under the aTRH label will need uniform and consistent processes for defining appropriate patient populations as well as postapproval registries assessing both long-term safety and duration of responses. Finally, patients with aTRH are likely to benefit from evaluation by a hypertension team to assure proper patient identification, diagnostic work-up, and therapeutic management before consideration of advanced or novel therapies to lower BP.

Other Limitations

There are several limitations to consider in the JNC 8 committee's approach to BP treatment (Table 2). Unlike the other professional societies' guidelines, the JNC 8 panel did not address topics outside of their chosen critical questions, specifically given the paucity of randomized trial evidence addressing such questions. While they endorsed the AHA/ACC Guideline on Lifestyle Management to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk, 50 the JNC 8 does not address lifestyle modifications or a timeline for attempting them. Another limitation is that ambulatory BP monitoring, including cut‐off values for diagnosing hypertension based on home BP readings, is not addressed.

Table 2
Recommendations for the AHA/ACC Committee

One suggestion is to confirm elevated BP with ambulatory BP monitoring, such as that recently recommended by the US Preventive Service Task Force. 51 There is in general a lack of guidance on the diagnosis of hypertension and the evaluation for secondary causes. Although the JNC 8 committee offers a titration schedule for treating hypertension, the recommendations are somewhat vague, and there is no guidance for resistant hypertension beyond referral to a hypertension specialist.

We also recommend that the AHA/ACC guideline committee focus on the benefits of the various drug classes and the situations that call for monodrug versus multidrug therapy. Another important area of focus will be the benefit of more‐intensive BP treatment, especially in the elderly and those with diabetes, and the addition of a risk‐based approach to initiating treatment (described earlier). These are all areas that can be targeted by the new AHA/ACC guideline committee.

ESC/ESH 2018 — management of resistant hypertension: Recommended treatment is reinforcement of lifestyle measures, especially sodium reduction; addition of low-dose spironolactone to existing treatment; or, if spironolactone is intolerant, addition of further diuretic therapy with either eplerenone, amiloride, a higher-dose thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, or a loop diuretic; or the addition of bisoprolol or doxazosin. A loop diuretic should replace thiazides/thiazide-like diuretics if the estimated glomerular filtration rate is < 30 mL/min. Spironolactone use should usually be restricted to patients with an eGFR > 45 mL/ min and a plasma potassium concentration of ≤ 4.5 mmol/L, and electrolytes and eGFR should be monitored soon after initiation and at least annually thereafter. Spironolactone intolerance includes antiandrogenic effects such as gynaecomastia (in ~6%). Amiloride (10–20 mg/day) has recently been shown to be as effective as spironolactone in reducing BP in the PATHWAY-2 study, whereas bisoprolol or doxazosin were not as effective as spironolactone but reduced BP significantly vs placebo when added to background treatment; direct vasodilators such as hydralazine or minoxidil are infrequently used because they may cause severe fluid retention and tachycardia.

Diagnostic approach to resistant hypertension — diagnosis requires detailed information about the patient's history (including lifestyle characteristics, alcohol and dietary sodium intake, interfering drugs or substances, and sleep history), the nature and dosing of the antihypertensive treatment, a physical examination with a particular focus on determining the presence of hypertension‑mediated organ damage (HMOD) and signs of secondary hypertension, and confirmation of treatment resistance by out‑of‑office BP measurements (i.e. ambulatory BP monitoring [ABPM] or home BP monitoring [HBPM]).

### Resistant hypertension in people with CKD: a review [^116k6F8G]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is common in the chronic kidney disease population and conveys increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and the development of kidney failure. Recently, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association published a revised scientific statement on the definition and management of resistant hypertension, which codified the long-debated differences between pseudoresistant hypertension and true resistant hypertension. We review this distinction and its importance to nephrologists, who frequently encounter patients for whom antihypertensive therapy fails due to difficulty adhering to complex multidrug regimens. Second, we discuss the evaluation of patients with resistant hypertension, including appropriate screening and diagnostic testing for causes of secondary hypertension. Third, we examine the management of established resistant hypertension, including medication optimization, recent clinical trials supporting lifestyle modifications, and the evidence behind the routine use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Special attention is given to the vital role of diuretics in the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease. We propose an algorithm for the diagnosis and management of these cases. Finally, we briefly discuss the current state of antihypertensive device therapies, including kidney denervation and baroreceptor-directed therapies.

### Medical measures in hypertensives considered resistant [^116K5ubc]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with resistant hypertension are the group of hypertensive patients with the highest cardiovascular risk.

Methods

All rules and guidelines for treatment of hypertension should be followed strictly to obtain blood pressure (BP) control in resistant hypertension. The mainstay of treatment of hypertension, also for resistant hypertension, is pharmacological treatment, which should be tailored to each patient's specific phenotype. Therefore, it is pivotal to assess nonadherence to pharmacological treatment as this remains the most challenging problem to investigate and manage in the setting of resistant hypertension.

Results

Once adherence has been confirmed, patients must be thoroughly worked-up for secondary causes of hypertension. Until such possible specific causes have been clarified, the diagnosis is apparent treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH). Surprisingly few patients remain with true TRH when the various secondary causes and adherence problems have been detected and resolved. Refractory hypertension is a term used to characterize the treatment resistance in hypertensive patients using ≥ 5 antihypertensive drugs. All pressor mechanisms may then need blockage before their BPs are reasonably controlled.

Conclusions

Patients with resistant hypertension need careful and sustained follow-up and review of their medications and dosages at each term since medication adherence is a very dynamic process.

### Novel approaches in antihypertensive pharmacotherapeutics [^1128v5Th]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The management of hypertension remains suboptimal despite the widespread use of multiple antihypertensive medication groups. We hereby aim to evaluate the novel therapeutic approaches for the management of hypertension.

Recent Findings

As the decline in SBP and/or DBP is associated with a significant decline in major adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality, the optimal management of hypertension is at most importance. The high prevalence of resistant hypertension, approximately 10% of hypertensive population, remains a major concern associated with high morbidity and mortality. Recently, multiple novel pharmacotherapeutic approaches have been implicated in the management of hypertension on various pathophysiological mechanisms, including aldosterone synthetase inhibitors, RNA-based therapies such as antisense oligonucleotides and small-interfering RNA, atrial natriuretic peptide analogs, dual endothelin antagonists, intestinal sodium-hydrogen exchanger-3 inhibitors, compound 17b and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

Summary

Pharmacotherapeutic management options for hypertension is a growing field of research with potential clinical implications for multiple agents in upcoming years. Such novel approaches have the potential to improve clinical outcomes of hypertension management.

### Revisiting resistant hypertension in kidney disease [^1133PgCn]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

According to 2017 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, nearly half of US adults have hypertension (48.1%, 119.9 million) and this prevalence is even higher, approximately 60–90%, in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hypertension is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden and mortality as well as poor kidney outcome. Lowering of blood pressure (BP) in patients with CKD results in better CVD and all-cause mortality as well as CKD progression and is a core goal for the treatment in published guidelines. However, only one in four US adults with hypertension have their BP under control for several reasons, including lack of awareness, access to healthy lifestyle, healthcare and medications. Resistant hypertension is a phenomenon that identifies subset of hypertensive patients who have inadequately controlled BP despite intensive treatment with multiple antihypertensive medications and is associated with substantially higher risk of poor outcomes. Due to complex interplay of physiologic factors and more stringent systolic BP (SBP) goals in CKD (ACC/AHA guidelines' target < 130/80 mmHg and 2021 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] guidelines' target of < 120 mmHg), the prevalence of resistant hypertension is much higher in CKD and requires increasing involvement of nephrologists to manage this condition. This review discusses the pathophysiology, definition, identification and treatment strategies for resistant hypertension in individuals with CKD.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115mfqqb]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Drug treatment strategy for hypertension — contributors to poor blood pressure (BP) control and proposed approach: Only ~40% of patients with hypertension are treated and, of these, only ~35% are controlled to a BP of < 140/ 90 mmHg; evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) shows BP control can be achieved in most recruited patients and that no more than 5–10% exhibit resistance to the selected regimen; treatment inertia contributes to suboptimal BP control with many patients remaining on monotherapy and/or suboptimal doses; adherence is a much more important factor than previously recognised; almost all patients in RCTs have required combinations of drugs, and non‑adherence rises with pill burden, being usually < 10% with a single pill, ~20% with two pills, and ~40% with three pills, with very high rates in those receiving four or more pills; consequently, the most effective evidence‑based strategy is one that encourages combination treatment in most patients, enables the use of SPC therapy for most patients, encourages adherence, and follows a simple, pragmatic algorithm with SPC therapy as initial therapy in most patients except those with BP in the high–normal range and in frail older patients.

### Emerging concepts for patients with treatment-resistant hypertension [^113aQwDW]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH) is defined as elevated blood pressure despite treatment with three properly dosed antihypertensive drugs, and is associated with adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes and increased mortality. Treatment of patients with TRH focuses on maximizing the doses of antihypertensive drugs and adding drugs with complementary mechanisms of action, including a combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide-like diuretics. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone as a fourth-line therapy for patients with TRH. Other pharmacologic considerations include adding α-blockers, combined α-β-blockers, centrally acting α-agonists, or direct vasodilators. However, a small, but important subset of patients remain hypertensive despite combination regimens with multiple antihypertensive drugs, underscoring the need for novel blood pressure-lowering therapies. Over recent years, alternative approaches for treating TRH have emerged, including agonists of natriuretic peptides, endothelin-receptor antagonists, and additional vasoactive drugs. Lastly, device-based interventions, such as renal denervation or carotid baroreflex activation, may supplement drug therapy for these patients. This review summarizes current knowledge on the management of TRH, with focus on novel therapeutic strategies designed to achieve optimal blood pressure control.

### Medical measures in hypertensives considered resistant [^114UC3ZY]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

BACKGROUND

Patients with resistant hypertension are the group of hypertensive patients with the highest cardiovascular risk.

METHODS

All rules and guidelines for treatment of hypertension should be followed strictly to obtain blood pressure (BP) control in resistant hypertension. The mainstay of treatment of hypertension, also for resistant hypertension, is pharmacological treatment, which should be tailored to each patient's specific phenotype. Therefore, it is pivotal to assess nonadherence to pharmacological treatment as this remains the most challenging problem to investigate and manage in the setting of resistant hypertension.

RESULTS

Once adherence has been confirmed, patients must be thoroughly worked-up for secondary causes of hypertension. Until such possible specific causes have been clarified, the diagnosis is apparent treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH). Surprisingly few patients remain with true TRH when the various secondary causes and adherence problems have been detected and resolved. Refractory hypertension is a term used to characterize the treatment resistance in hypertensive patients using ≥ 5 antihypertensive drugs. All pressor mechanisms may then need blockage before their BPs are reasonably controlled.

CONCLUSIONS

Patients with resistant hypertension need careful and sustained follow-up and review of their medications and dosages at each term since medication adherence is a very dynamic process.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^1175c4Cx]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — device-based treatment for resistant hypertension notes that carotid baroreceptor stimulation or baroreflex amplification therapy — externally via an implantable pulse generator or internally via an implantable device designed to increase strain on the carotid bulb — can lower BP in patients with resistant hypertension. An RCT with the first generation of an implantable pulse generator showed sustained BP-lowering efficacy with some concerns about procedural and longer term safety. A second-generation unilateral device has been developed to improve safety and sustained efficacy, and a propensity score-matched comparison of first- and second-generation systems found BP at 12 months post-implantation was similar with a better safety profile for the second-generation device; however, no RCT is currently available with this second-generation device. Implantation is described as costly and requiring a complex surgical intervention, prompting development of an endovascular carotid baroreflex amplification device using a dedicated stent-like device to stretch the carotid bulb and increase baroreflex sensitivity; preliminary human data have shown BP-lowering efficacy but ongoing RCTs are needed to understand longer-term efficacy and safety. For renal denervation, catheter-based techniques using radiofrequency, ultrasound, or perivascular injection of neurotoxic agents such as alcohol have been introduced as minimally invasive options for resistant hypertension, but the clinical evidence in support of renal denervation as an effective BP-lowering technique is conflicting.

### Medical measures in hypertensives considered resistant [^111pXStm]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

A hypertensive patient is considered resistant to treatment if he/she has uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) despite taking at least 3 antihypertensive drugs in maximally tolerated doses, one of which is a diuretic drug. Thus, in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH), ≥ 4 antihypertensive drugs are often prescribed to achieve BP control. According to another definition, a patient has refractory hypertension when BP remains uncontrolled on maximal or near-maximal therapy, which is the use of ≥ 5 antihypertensive agents of different classes, including a long-acting thiazide-like diuretic (such as chlorthalidone) and spironolactone. All general rules and guidance to treat patients with hypertension are mandatory and should be strictly applied in patients considered resistant to treatment, as this group of patients are those with the highest risk of developing complications of uncontrolled hypertension. The foundation of antihypertensive treatment is lifestyle interventions, consisting of, but not restricted to, low sodium and high potassium intake, modest alcohol consumption, weight loss if obesity is present, smoking cessation and physical exercise. In patients with resistant hypertension, these measures are, if possible, even more important than in mild and moderate hypertension because patients may then respond better to antihypertensive drugs. This review will focus on the pharmacological treatment and management of patients who are considered resistant or apparent resistant to treatment.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115sNad9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — synopsis defines resistant hypertension as BP above goal despite treatment with 3 antihypertensive medications with complementary mechanisms of action, including a diuretic at maximally tolerated doses, or BP at goal but requiring ≥ 4 medications. Based on the current BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg, the prevalence of resistant hypertension is approximately 8.5% to 20% among hypertensive US adults. Patients with resistant hypertension are known to have at least a 50% higher risk of MI, stroke, end-stage kidney disease, and cardiovascular death than patients with hypertension without resistance to treatment. Routine measurement of out-of-office BP is important because both home BP and 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) are shown to be superior to office BP in predicting cardiovascular events. In the absence of antihypertensive medications, renal denervation (RDN) induced a reduction in 24-hour ambulatory SBP by 4 to 6 mm Hg during a follow-up duration of 2 to 3 months.

### Renal denervation in the management of resistant hypertension: current evidence and perspectives [^1179dydL]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Catheter-based renal denervation has emerged as a novel treatment modality for resistant hypertension. This review summarizes the current evidence on this procedure in treatment of resistant hypertension, limitations of available evidence and questions to be answered.

Recent Findings

The SYMPLICITY studies showed that renal denervation is feasible in treating resistant hypertension, but failed to provide conclusive evidence on the size and durability of the antihypertensive, renal and sympatholytic effects, as well as the long-term safety. The definition of resistant hypertension was loose in the SYMPLICITY studies and the management of resistant hypertension was suboptimal. Future studies should have a randomized design and enroll truly resistant hypertension patients by excluding secondary hypertension, white-coat hypertension and nonadherent patients. Questions to be addressed by the ongoing and future trials include the long-term efficacy and safety of this procedure, identification of responders and uncovering of the underlying mechanisms.

Summary

Only well-designed, randomized clinical trials addressing the limitations of the SYMPLICITY studies will be able to demonstrate whether renal denervation is an efficacious treatment modality in resistant hypertension and in which patients. For now, renal denervation remains an experimental procedure and should only be offered to truly resistant hypertensive patients in a research context after careful selection.

Further uptitration of antihypertensive therapy — when BP remains uncontrolled with three-drug combination therapy, the patient is classified as having resistant hypertension and such patients should be considered for specialist evaluation. Additional treatment options include the addition of low-dose spironolactone (25–50 mg daily) or other diuretic therapy, including loop diuretics in patients with significant renal impairment (eGFR < 45 mL/min/m2), as well as beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, centrally acting agents (eg clonidine), or, rarely, minoxidil.

### Controversies in hypertension V: resistant and refractory hypertension [^113W8X8Z]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Apparent resistant hypertension, defined as uncontrolled office blood pressure despite ≥ 3 antihypertensive medications including a diuretic or use of ≥ 4 medications regardless of blood pressure, occurs in ≤ 15% of treated hypertensives. Apparent refractory hypertension, defined as uncontrolled office pressure despite use of 5 or more medications including a diuretic, occurs in ≤ 10% of resistant cases. Both are associated with increased comorbidity and enhanced cardiovascular risk. To rule out pseudo-resistant or pseudo-refractory hypertension, employ guideline-based methodology for obtaining pressure, maximize the regimen, rule out white-coat effect, and assess adherence. True resistant hypertension is characterized by volume overload and aldosterone excess, refractory by enhanced sympathetic tone. Spironolactone is the preferred agent for resistance, with lower doses. Spironolactone, potassium binders, or both, are preferred if the estimated glomerular filtration rate is below 45. If significant albuminuria, finerenone is indicated. The optimal treatment of refractory hypertension is unclear, but sympathetic inhibition (α-β blockade, centrally acting sympathoinhibitors, or both) seems reasonable. Renal denervation has shown minimal benefit for resistance, but its role in refractory hypertension remains to be defined.

### Novel therapies on the horizon of hypertension management [^114EsNDd]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The rates of uncontrolled hypertension, along with downstream cardiovascular outcomes, has been worsening in this country. Despite the plethora of antihypertensive medications on the market, the prevalence of resistant hypertension (RH) is estimated to be 13.7%. Therefore in addition to increased clinical education and focus on lifestyle management of hypertension and medication compliance, new therapies are needed to address this rise in hypertension.

Methods

A systematic review of the available medical literature was performed to identify emerging treatment options for RH.

Results

Six different pharmacologic classes and 2 procedural interventions were identified as being appropriate for review in this paper. The pharmacologic classes to be explored are non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, aminopeptidase A inhibitors, dual endothelin antagonists, aldosterone synthetase inhibitors, atrial natriuretic peptide inhibitors, and attenuators of hepatic angiotensinogen. Discussion of procedural interventions to lower blood pressure will focus on renal denervation and devices that increase carotid baroreceptor activity.

Conclusions

Promising medication and procedural interventions are being developed and studied to expand our treatment arsenal for patients with uncontrolled essential hypertension and RH.

Other Topics

Both guidelines provide recommendations for follow-up intervals, with the ACC/AHA CPG suggesting 1 year for reevaluation of adults with a normal BP, 3 to 6 months for those treated with nonpharmacological therapy, and 1 month after initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy followed by 3 to 6 months after meeting the BP goal. The ESC/ESH CPG suggests follow-up within the first 2 months after the initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy, with the caveat that the interval should depend on the severity of hypertension and urgency to achieve BP control. After the desired BP target has been achieved, an interval of a few months is suggested for BP monitoring and 2 years for reassessment of risk factors and evidence of asymptomatic target organ damage. The ESC/ESH CPG recommends achieving BP control within 3 months of initiating therapy, further emphasizing the need to consider initial therapy with combination drugs in most patients to achieve rapid BP control.

Both guidelines provide detailed guidance for detection and management of secondary hypertension, definition and management of resistant hypertension, hypertensive urgencies and emergencies, masked and white coat hypertension, hypertension in older adults, men and women, persons of different race/ethnicity, and patients with various comorbidities and conditions, including heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, CKD, peripheral vascular disease, DM and metabolic syndrome, aortic disease, and pregnancy.

Both guidelines focus considerable attention on strategies to improve adherence to therapy, emphasizing the advantage of single-pill combinations to improve adherence and overcome therapeutic inertia, and team-based care. Both guidelines also focus on implementation, that is, models for delivery of care, use of health information technology, improving quality of care, health literacy, access to care, social and community services, and a patient-specific plan of care. The ESC/ESH provides recommendations for treatment of isolated systolic hypertension, and it recommends reserving device-based treatments of hypertension for research settings. The ESC/ESH provides recommendations for managing concomitant CVD risk with specific recommendations for the use of statins, antiplatelet drugs, and oral anticoagulation (in atrial fibrillation), whereas the ACC/AHA largely defers to other ACC/AHA guidelines that cover these topics. Last, both guidelines identify gaps in evidence and provide a summary key message (ESC/ESH) or BP treatment thresholds and goals (ACC/AHA).

### Medical measures in hypertensives considered resistant [^112VJDru]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Selection of antihypertensive agents in resistant hypertension

According to American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) 2017, International Society of Hypertension (ISH) 2020 and European Society of Hypertension (ESH) 2023 Guidelines, the preferred antihypertensive drug treatment of resistant hypertension should at least include the following antihypertensive classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium antagonist (= calcium channel blocker), and thiazide diuretics. The steps recommended to apply if triple therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, and diuretic) fails to achieve optimal BP are the following (Figure 1):

Figure 1.
Assessment of apparent and true resistant hypertension. Abbreviations: ACEi, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; BP, blood pressure; CCB, calcium channel blocker; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; HT, hypertension; T/TL, thiazide/thiazide-like.

- To optimize and tailor the current treatment regimen based on individual risk factors including health behavior changes.
- Use of thiazide-like rather than thiazide diuretics, and initiation of loop diuretics for estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 or clinical volume overload.
- Add a low dose of spironolactone as the 4th line agent in patients whose serum potassium is < 4.5 mmol/l and whose estimated glomerular filtration rate is > 45 ml/min/1.73m 2 to achieve BP targets.
- If spironolactone is contraindicated or not tolerated, amiloride, beta-blocker, clonidine, doxazosin, and eplerenone are alternatives, or any available antihypertensive class not already in use.

Hypertension evaluation for resistant cases and primary hyperaldosteronism — screening and treatment guidance — states that patients should be screened if they have resistant HTN (> 140/90 mm Hg) on ≥ 3 medications, including a maximum-dose diuretic. A mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) (eg, eplerenone, spironolactone) is the rational choice for medical management of primary hyperaldosteronism and can be considered for resistant HTN in persons with T2D. More frequent laboratory monitoring of potassium and kidney function should be performed when an ACEi or ARB is combined with an MRA.

### Resistant hypertension in dialysis: epidemiology, diagnosis, and management [^114f5Raj]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Apparent treatment-resistant hypertension is defined as an elevated BP despite the use of ≥ 3 antihypertensive medications from different classes or the use of ≥ 4 antihypertensives regardless of BP levels. Among patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, using this definition, the prevalence of apparent treatment-resistant hypertension is estimated to be between 18% and 42%. Owing to the lack of a rigorous assessment of some common causes of pseudoresistance, the burden of true resistant hypertension in the dialysis population remains unknown. What distinguishes apparent treatment-resistance from true resistance is white-coat hypertension and adherence to medications. Accordingly, the diagnostic workup of a dialysis patient with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension on dialysis includes the accurate determination of BP control status with the use of home or ambulatory BP monitoring and exclusion of nonadherence to the prescribed antihypertensive regimen. In a patient on dialysis with inadequately controlled BP, despite adherence to therapy with maximally tolerated doses of a β -blocker, a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, and a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor, volume-mediated hypertension is the most important treatable cause of resistance. In daily clinical practice, such patients are often managed with intensification of antihypertensive therapy. However, this therapeutic strategy is likely to fail if volume overload is not adequately recognized or treated. Instead of increasing the number of prescribed BP-lowering medications, we recommend diet and dialysate restricted in sodium to facilitate achievement of dry weight. The achievement of dry weight is facilitated by an adequate time on dialysis of at least 4 hours for delivering an adequate dialysis dose. In this article, we review the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of resistant hypertension among patients on dialysis.

### Lifestyle management of hypertension: international society of hypertension position paper endorsed by the World Hypertension League and European Society of Hypertension [^116o6hjb]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

International perspective

Exercise as a therapy for hypertension is still not widely integrated into healthcare systems or insurance schemes worldwide. Indeed, socioeconomic and cultural barriers to structured exercise exist in many parts of the world, often combined with limited access to exercise facilities and lack of formalized physical activity guidance.

Neighbourhood safety, lack of community support, religious beliefs, financial position, employment, and social barriers may influence physical activity participation in certain groups with hypertension, especially ethnic minorities.

To overcome such barriers, individuals should be offered appropriate health education and be encouraged to use any means possible to be physically active, while creating facilities and programs that consider sensitive cultural needs. Furthermore, healthcare practitioners need to receive training to assist people to reduce sedentary behaviour and adopt lifestyle changes.

Recommendation

1 All individuals should be encouraged to be physically active for the prevention or management of hypertension and CVD.
2 Emphasis should be placed upon early-life intervention (from childhood) and health education programmes to sustain physical activity throughout the life-course (Table 1).
3 Both aerobic and dynamic resistance exercise or their combinations can be used in prevention and management of hypertension and CVD (Box 1). Box 1
4 Adults should engage in 150–300 min of moderate-intensity or 75–150 min of vigorous exercise, or an equivalent combination, weekly (Box 1 and see Supplementary Box 1 for examples).
5 The chosen type of activity/exercise should be individually tailored, consider baseline fitness, comorbidities, pharmacological treatment, situational context and be progressive in nature (i.e. start slow and gradually build the amount/intensity of activity).
6 Emphasis should be on reducing daily sedentary time and increasing movement wherever possible.
7 Any type, amount and intensity of regular exercise/activity will be beneficial with minimum recommendations for maintenance of health and CVD prevention.

Resistant hypertension — spironolactone add-on therapy: For patients with resistant hypertension (defined as those who are not adequately controlled with maximally tolerated dose of triple therapy [i.e., a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker]), we suggest adding spironolactone in those patients without contraindications (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). The mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone more effectively reduced SBP and DBP compared to placebo when added as the fourth agent to the treatment regimen of patients with resistant HTN, and in patients with a history of hyperkalemia and diminished renal function, spironolactone should be used cautiously and with frequent monitoring of potassium and renal function.

Resistant hypertension in diabetes — definition, evaluation, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) use. "Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg despite a therapeutic strategy that includes appropriate lifestyle management plus a diuretic and two other antihypertensive drugs with complementary mechanisms of action at adequate doses". "People with diabetes and confirmed resistant hypertension should be evaluated for secondary causes of hypertension, including primary hyperaldosteronism, renal artery stenosis, CKD, and obstructive sleep apnea". Recommendation 10.14 states: "Individuals with hypertension who are not meeting blood pressure goals on three classes of antihypertensive medications (including a diuretic) should be considered for MRA therapy. A" "MRAs, including spironolactone and eplerenone, are effective for managing resistant hypertension after confirming resistance during existing treatment with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, thiazide-like diuretic, or dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (88)". "In addition, MRAs reduce albuminuria in people with diabetic nephropathy (89–91)". "However, adding an MRA to a treatment plan that includes an ACE inhibitor or ARB may increase the risk for hyperkalemia, emphasizing the importance of regular monitoring for serum creatinine and potassium in these individuals, and long-term outcome studies are needed to better evaluate the role of MRAs in blood pressure management".

### Refractory versus resistant hypertension [^115Et26S]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Refractory hypertension is a recently proposed phenotype of antihypertensive treatment failure. As such it represents an extreme subtype of resistant or difficult-to-treat hypertension. Resistant hypertension is relatively common with an estimated prevalence of 10–20% of treated hypertensive patients. It is typically defined as having an uncontrolled blood pressure on three or more antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic. Refractory hypertension is rare with a prevalence of approximately 5% of patients with uncontrolled resistant hypertension. It is defined as an uncontrolled blood pressure with the use of five or more antihypertensive medications, including a long-acting thiazide diuretic, such as chlorthalidone, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist such as spironolactone.

Recent Findings

Persistent excess fluid retention is thought to commonly underlie development of resistant hypertension, recent studies suggest that refractory may be more likely attributable to heightened sympathetic output as opposed to inappropriate fluid retention.

Summary

Treatment recommendations for resistant hypertension are generally based on intensification of diuretic therapy, especially with combined use of chlorthalidone and spironolactone. Although fuller elucidation is needed, such an approach may not be appropriate for refractory hypertension, which instead, may require effective sympathetic inhibition, either with medications or device-based approaches.

### Device therapies for resistant hypertension [^111ZcUiS]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Resistant hypertension (RH) is a major and growing public health problem. While noncompliance to antihypertensive medication is a major concern in RH patients, it is estimated that even with adequate multi-drug regimens, approximately 10% of patients diagnosed with hypertension fulfill the criteria of true RH. Patients with sustained blood pressure (BP) elevation display high risk for development of target organ damage and associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. While optimized pharmacologic therapy, including the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists to guideline-based antihypertensive drug therapy, is effective for improving BP control in this patient cohort, a sizable proportion of RH patients' BP remains uncontrolled, and alternative therapeutic strategies are warranted.

Methods

In the past few years, device-based approaches have been studied extensively. Among these, robust clinical experience in patients with RH exists for renal denervation, baroreflex activation therapy, central arteriovenous anastomosis, and, to a lesser extent, deep brain stimulation. Carotid body modulation is the most recent approach under clinical investigation. The common aim of these approaches is direct targeting of relevant pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in BP control, most commonly activation of the sympathetic nervous system.

Findings

This review article briefly summarizes relevant clinical and experimental evidence and highlights the potential utility, as well as limitations, of each approach.

Implications

Several device-based approaches show promise in the treatment of RH and have been associated with improved BP control, while generally finding an acceptable side effect profile. Ongoing research is addressing relevant issues relating to patient selection and technical and procedural aspects, and will help to define the future role of device-based approaches for RH in the next few years.

### GLP-1-based therapies for the treatment of resistant hypertension in individuals with overweight or obesity: a review [^111uHMyw]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Despite the availability of a wide range of antihypertensive agents, a significant proportion of individuals with resistant hypertension (RHTN) struggle to achieve blood pressure (BP) control. Obesity ranks among the most significant modifiable risk factors for RHTN, with 56–91% of patients with RHTN classified as overweight or obese. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RAs) are a class of anti-obesity medications that have recently demonstrated efficacy in reducing BP and improving cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in individuals with overweight or obesity. Among the available GLP-1-based therapies, liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide have been approved for chronic weight management in this population. Tirzepatide, a dual GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor agonist, has the greatest effect on weight loss and BP reduction compared to GLP-1 RAs alone. To our knowledge, no trials have directly evaluated the effect of GLP-1 RAs or dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists on RHTN management. In this review article, we propose that targeting weight loss through GLP-1-based therapies should be explored as a treatment option for individuals with RHTN who are overweight or obese.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — medication contributors and foundational regimen — Approximately 20% of adults with hypertension reported regular use of over-the-counter or nonprescription medications that may directly raise BP, and these medications are associated with uncontrolled BP and should be reviewed during evaluation of patients with resistant hypertension; some prescription drugs known to elevate BP should be replaced with alternative agents that avoid hypertensive side effects, if possible. Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a diuretic, and replacing thiazide-type diuretics with thiazide-like diuretics may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 45 mL/ min/1.73 m2; the reduction in BP was greater than with addition of doxazosin or bisoprolol and greater than clonidine, yet 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects.

### Baroreceptor stimulation for resistant hypertension [^1166M9Kv]. American Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertension (HTN) is a worldwide epidemic. When untreated, HTN places patients at an elevated risk for several health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and end-organ damage. This effect is particularly pronounced in a subset of patients who experience treatment-resistant HTN despite the utilization of conventional medication and lifestyle interventions. For these challenging patients, ongoing research efforts continue to explore and develop novel nonpharmacologic therapies for resistant HTN. One such avenue is the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system, a large component of circulatory physiology. Innovative therapies have evolved to harness the ability to deliver electrical stimulation to baroreceptors in an effort to modulate the sympathetic system involvement in HTN. This review discusses baroreflex activation therapy and its role in the management of resistant HTN.

### GLP-1-based therapies for the treatment of resistant hypertension in individuals with overweight or obesity: a review [^114RqiMh]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Common risk factors for RHTN include older age, obesity, chronic kidney disease, black race, and diabetes mellitus. Obesity ranks among the most significant modifiable risk factors, with 56–91% of patients with RHTN being overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 25 kg/m 2) or obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2). Obesity is also significantly associated with a higher likelihood of exhibiting non-adherence to antihypertensive medications and developing comorbidities and CV disorders. It is likely that as the prevalence of obesity continues to increase, RHTN will also increase unless obesity is effectively treated. Current management of RHTN recommends maximizing lifestyle interventions that promote weight loss as an effective method to improve BP in individuals with overweight or obesity. However, long-term weight loss maintenance is challenging with lifestyle modification alone, and weight regain is common. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) promote greater weight loss, BP reduction, and improved CV outcomes compared to lifestyle modification. In this review article, we propose that targeting weight loss pharmacologically through GLP-1-based therapies offers a promising treatment option for individuals with RHTN who are overweight or obese.

### Renal denervation in the management of hypertension in adults. A clinical consensus statement of the ESC council on hypertension and the European association of percutaneous cardiovascular interventions (EAPCI) [^114t96L4]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Since the publication of the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension, several high-quality studies, including randomised, sham-controlled trials on catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) were published, confirming both the blood pressure (BP)-lowering efficacy and safety of radiofrequency and ultrasound RDN in a broad range of patients with hypertension, including resistant hypertension. A clinical consensus document by the ESC Council on Hypertension and the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) on RDN in the management of hypertension was considered necessary to inform clinical practice. This expert group proposes that RDN is an adjunct treatment option in uncontrolled resistant hypertension, confirmed by ambulatory BP measurements, despite best efforts at lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. RDN may also be used in patients who are unable to tolerate antihypertensive medications in the long term. A shared decision-making process is a key feature and preferably includes a patient who is well informed on the benefits and limitations of the procedure. The decision-making process should take (i) the patient's global cardiovascular (CV) risk and/or (ii) the presence of hypertension-mediated organ damage or CV complications into account. Multidisciplinary hypertension teams involving hypertension experts and interventionalists evaluate the indication and facilitate the RDN procedure. Interventionalists require expertise in renal interventions and specific training in RDN procedures. Centres performing these procedures require the skills and resources to deal with potential complications. Future research is needed to address open questions and investigate the impact of BP-lowering with RDN on clinical outcomes and potential clinical indications beyond hypertension.

### Apparent and true resistant hypertension: definition, prevalence and outcomes [^115RNX9u]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Resistant hypertension, defined as blood pressure (BP) remaining above goal despite the use of ≥ 3 antihypertensive medications at maximally tolerated doses (one ideally being a diuretic) or BP that requires ≥ 4 agents to achieve control, has received more attention with increased efforts to improve BP control rates and the emergence of device-based therapies for hypertension. This classically defined resistant group consists of patients with true resistant hypertension, controlled resistant hypertension and pseudo-resistant hypertension. In studies where pseudo-resistant hypertension cannot be excluded (for example, 24-h ambulatory BP not obtained), the term apparent resistant hypertension has been used to identify 'apparent' lack of control on ≥ 3 medications. Large, well-designed studies have recently reported the prevalence of resistant hypertension. Pooling prevalence data from these studies and others within North America and Europe with a combined sample size of > 600,000 hypertensive participants, the prevalence of resistant hypertension is 14.8% of treated hypertensive patients and 12.5% of all hypertensives. However, the prevalence of true resistant hypertension, defined as uncontrolled both by office and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring with confirmed medication adherence, may be more meaningful in terms of identifying risk and estimating benefit from newer therapies like renal denervation. Rates of cardiovascular events and mortality follow mean 24-h ambulatory BPs in patients with resistant hypertension, and true resistant hypertension represents the highest risk. The prevalence of true resistant hypertension has not been directly measured in large trials; however, combined data from smaller studies suggest that true resistant hypertension is present in half of the patients with resistant hypertension who are uncontrolled in the office. Our pooled analysis shows prevalence rates of 10.1% and 7.9% for uncontrolled resistant hypertension among individuals treated for hypertension and all hypertensive individuals, respectively.

### Secondary hypertension… [^114MNHbt]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

4 Ideally, one of the agents should be a diuretic. The other agents usually include one that interrupts the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, and a calcium channel blocker or beta blocker. The prevalence of resistant hypertension is unclear, although trials of treatment in which antihypertensive medications are forcibly titrated to reach target blood pressure suggest that it may affect as many as 20 to 30 percent of patients with hypertension.
4. It can be hard to tell if a patient is truly adherent to an optimally dosed three-drug regimen; therefore, patients with drug-resistant hypertension are considered a subset of those with difficult-to-control hypertension. Because there are scant trial data on patients with resistant hypertension, the recommendations in this article were based largely on observational studies and expert opinion.

Broadly speaking, two categories of patients were considered: those with apparently difficult-to-control hypertension and those with truly drug-resistant hypertension. NONADHERENCE TO THERAPY Evaluation of the patient with difficult-to-control hypertension should begin with an assessment of adherence to the prescribed management plan, including recommended lifestyle modifications. An initial pharmacologic step in managing patients with difficult-to-control hypertension is to ensure adequate diuretic therapy by increasing the dose of diuretic or by changing to a more potent diuretic. Consider using chlorthalidone rather than hydrochlorothiazide when possible because it was the agent used in the largest hypertension clinical trials with patient-oriented outcomes, and it provides greater blood pressure reduction.

CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE Chronic kidney disease is common in patients with difficult-to-control hypertension. Chronic kidney disease may result from hypertension, and it makes hypertension more resistant to treatment because of increased sodium and fluid retention. in treating resistant hypertension include adding one of the following: an alpha blocker; a combined alpha-beta blocker; or clonidine, guanfacine, or hydralazine.

### Management of resistant hypertension-an update… [^115zfCff]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as having either a blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg or more, despite maximally tolerated doses of 3 or more antihypertensive drugs or controlled hypertension with 4 or more antihypertensive drugs. 1 The estimated prevalence of RH was approximately 12% to 18% in population-based and clinic-based reports, with RH rates up to 38% in clinical trials, according to the 2018 American Heart Association scientific statement. Patients with RH also have an increased risk for cardiovascular events, stroke, and all-cause mortality. The risk factors for RH include Black race, older age, male sex, obesity, diabetes, and the presence of chronic kidney disease. Giacona JM, Kositanurit W, Vongpatanasin W.

### Directly observed therapy for patients with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension… [^117UvUnM]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

© 2024 Among patients with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension, 1–3 nonadherence to treatment is common. Pharmacy refill data, the Morisky scale, and pill counts are limited tests for determination of nonadherence. In this study, we aimed to assess the contribution of nonadherence to blood pressure –lowering drugs undetected by these tests by evaluating the association of directly observed therapy with treatment adherence in patients with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension. A total of 60 consecutive patients were enrolled in the study, and after exclusion of those who withdrew consent, did not attend DOT, or missed subsequent ABPM, 48 participants completed this study for the primary outcome and 46 for the secondary outcome. Baseline characteristics are reported in Table 1.

After DOT, daytime systolic BP remained 135 mm Hg or greater in 34 of 48 patients who experienced a mean decrease in systolic BP of 3 mm Hg. In contrast, in 14 participants, treatment-resistant hypertension resolved and systolic BP decreased by 26 mm Hg. This proportion was similar at 1 month in 14 of 46 patients who no longer had treatment-resistant hypertension. The results suggest that nonadherence to BP-lowering drug regimens is high among referred patients with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension, even among those who said they were adherent on questioning before DOT, had pristine pharmacy filling records, and had accurate pill counts. Moreover, this apparent nonadherence occurred despite more than 50% of these patients already having had an adverse vascular event related to uncontrolled hypertension.

The use of DOT as described here was strictly dichotomous and thus does not allow for precise assessment of the degree of nonadherence, as may be the case with therapeutic drug monitoring. 5, 6 Overall, the findings suggest that rigorous methods of adherence assessment and intervention such as DOT should be considered for patients with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension.
