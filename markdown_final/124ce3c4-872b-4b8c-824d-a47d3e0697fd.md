## Question

do sclerotic changes on xray appear more black or more white

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sclerotic changes on an X-ray appear more black or more white. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic physics of X-ray attenuation and how that translates to image brightness. Then, I should verify the radiologic definitions of "sclerotic" versus "radiolucent" and look for direct examples on radiographs. Next, I will review representative conditions that are classically described as sclerotic to ensure consistency. Finally, I will double-check for any exceptions or mimics that could confuse interpretation before concluding definitively.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: on conventional radiographs, denser materials attenuate more X-rays and therefore appear whiter, whereas less dense materials transmit more X-rays and appear darker; this is why cortical bone looks white and air looks black, and it underpins the relative concept of radiopacity in clinical imaging.

> Now, I need to check the definition of "sclerotic" in radiology; sclerotic bone changes reflect increased mineralization and radiodensity, which by the same attenuation logic should appear whiter on radiographs, and this is precisely how sclerotic lesions are described in the literature and teaching references, including classic descriptions of uniformly dense "ivory vertebrae" and other sclerotic vertebral bodies that appear markedly whiter than normal bone on plain films.

> Wait, let me verify with concrete examples to avoid overgeneralization; fibrous dysplasia in the craniofacial region typically manifests as dense, sclerotic lesions on radiographs, which are visibly whiter than surrounding bone, and bone islands (enostoses) are described as intraosseous sclerotic foci that are homogeneously dense and well-defined, again appearing whiter than adjacent cancellous bone on radiographs and CT [^111k2zH3].

> Hold on, I should review disease patterns that explicitly use "sclerotic" in their nomenclature; POEMS syndrome is associated with predominantly osteosclerotic bone lesions that are hyperdense on CT and would be expected to appear whiter on radiographs, and Paget disease in its blastic phase develops areas of sclerosis that increase radiodensity and thus appear whiter on radiographs, consistent with the underlying increase in bone density [^116YfoCp].

> I will now examine the opposite to ensure I'm not conflating terms; radiolucent lesions, by definition, are darker on radiographs because they represent decreased attenuation, such as lytic metastases or lytic mandibular lesions, which are described as radiolucent or lytic and appear more black compared with normal bone, reinforcing that sclerotic equals whiter and lytic equals darker on X-ray.

> But wait, what if there are mimics or mixed patterns that could confuse this; some lesions are mixed lytic and sclerotic, showing both darker and lighter components, and certain benign entities can have sclerotic rims with lucent centers, yet the sclerotic components themselves still appear whiter while the lytic components appear darker, so the core principle remains intact even in complex lesions [^111wxEHd].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if "sclerotic" could ever be used to describe a darker appearance, but that would contradict the physics of attenuation and standard radiologic usage; after reconsidering, I should confirm that sclerotic changes are unequivocally whiter on radiographs, whereas any darker areas within or around a lesion indicate lytic or radiolucent components, not sclerosis.

> In conclusion, I should double-check that my answer is consistent across sources and principles: sclerotic changes on X-ray appear more white because they reflect increased bone mineral density and X-ray attenuation, producing brighter radiographic signals compared with normal bone, whereas lytic changes appear darker; this aligns with disease-specific examples and the fundamental physics of radiographic contrast [^111dQcQT] [^11687Kwn].

Sclerotic changes on X-ray appear **more white** because they reflect increased bone density and mineralization, which absorb more X-rays and appear radiopaque. In contrast, **lytic lesions appear darker** due to bone loss and lower attenuation. Sclerotic lesions are typically well-defined, homogeneous, and may show a **sclerotic rim**, whereas lytic lesions are radiolucent and less dense [^111k2zH3] [^113bLwsm] [^116FcYr5]. Recognizing this pattern helps distinguish sclerotic from lytic processes and guides diagnosis and management [^113M3xgq].

---

## Radiographic appearance of sclerotic changes

Sclerotic changes on X-ray are characterized by the following:

- **Increased radiodensity**: Sclerotic lesions appear whiter or brighter on X-ray films due to their higher density and mineral content, which absorb more X-rays [^114YcBJX].

- **Well-defined margins**: Sclerotic lesions typically have well-defined, sharp margins, making them easily distinguishable from surrounding normal bone [^111k2zH3].

- **Homogeneous appearance**: Sclerotic lesions often appear homogeneous, lacking the internal trabecular pattern seen in normal cancellous bone [^111zKxFV].

- **Sclerotic rim**: Some lesions, particularly benign ones, may exhibit a sclerotic rim or border, which appears as a dense white line surrounding the lesion [^111wxEHd].

---

## Examples of sclerotic lesions on X-ray

Several conditions commonly present with **sclerotic changes** on X-ray, including:

| **Condition** | **Radiographic appearance** |
|-|-|
| Bone island (enostosis) | Small, well-defined, homogeneous sclerotic lesion with characteristic spiculated margins [^111k2zH3] |
| Osteoblastic metastases | Multiple, dense sclerotic lesions commonly seen in prostate and breast cancer [^115Xz6Kj] |
| Paget's disease | Cortical thickening, bone enlargement, and diffuse sclerosis [^116YfoCp] |
| Osteopetrosis | Generalized increased bone density throughout the skeleton [^117RckQA] |
| Chronic osteomyelitis | Patchy sclerosis with periosteal reaction and bone deformity [^115HEfz1] |

---

## Differentiation from lytic lesions

It is essential to differentiate sclerotic lesions from **lytic lesions**, which appear darker on X-ray due to bone destruction or resorption. Lytic lesions are characterized by:

- **Decreased radiodensity**: Lytic lesions appear darker or blacker on X-ray films due to bone loss and lower mineral content [^114YcBJX].

- **Ill-defined margins**: Lytic lesions often have ill-defined or irregular margins, indicating aggressive or infiltrative processes [^116FcYr5].

- **Bone destruction**: Lytic lesions are associated with bone destruction, pathological fractures, and cortical disruption [^114C8WtN].

---

## Clinical significance of sclerotic changes

Sclerotic changes on X-ray have **significant clinical implications**, including:

- **Benign vs. malignant lesions**: Sclerotic lesions can be either benign (e.g. bone island, osteoma) or malignant (e.g. osteoblastic metastases) [^111k2zH3] [^114YcBJX]. Further imaging and clinical correlation are often required to differentiate between these entities [^112w5mUe].

- **Metabolic bone diseases**: Sclerotic changes are commonly seen in metabolic bone diseases such as Paget's disease and osteopetrosis, indicating abnormal bone remodeling and increased bone density [^116YfoCp] [^116QH2Ac].

- **Response to therapy**: In some cases, sclerotic changes may indicate a response to therapy, particularly in metastatic bone disease, where sclerosis develops following successful treatment [^113KhmTV].

---

## Limitations of X-ray in detecting sclerotic changes

While X-ray is a valuable tool for detecting sclerotic changes, it has **limitations**:

- **Sensitivity**: X-ray has limited sensitivity in detecting early or subtle sclerotic changes, particularly in complex anatomical regions such as the spine or pelvis [^115Xz6Kj].

- **Specificity**: X-ray findings may be nonspecific, requiring further imaging modalities such as CT or MRI for accurate characterization and diagnosis [^117Pj93y].

- **Radiation exposure**: Repeated X-ray examinations involve radiation exposure, which may limit their use in certain patient populations, such as pregnant women or children [^notfound].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

Alternative imaging modalities, such as **CT and MRI**, provide more detailed information about sclerotic lesions:

- **CT**: CT imaging offers superior spatial resolution and can accurately characterize sclerotic lesions, including their size, extent, and relationship to surrounding structures [^114CzNnz].

- **MRI**: MRI is useful in evaluating soft tissue involvement, bone marrow changes, and differentiating benign from malignant lesions [^114CzNnz].

- **Bone scintigraphy**: Bone scintigraphy can detect metabolically active sclerotic lesions, particularly in metastatic bone disease, and is useful in assessing the extent of skeletal involvement [^114TeKwx].

---

Sclerotic changes on X-ray appear **more white** due to increased bone density and mineralization. These lesions are characterized by increased radiodensity, well-defined margins, and a homogeneous appearance. Differentiating sclerotic lesions from lytic lesions is essential for accurate diagnosis and management. While X-ray is a valuable initial tool, further imaging modalities such as CT, MRI, and bone scintigraphy may be required for comprehensive evaluation.

### Radiopaque jaw lesions: an approach to the differential diagnosis [^113M3xgq]. Radiographics (2012). Low credibility.

Radiopaque jaw lesions are frequently encountered at radiography and computed tomography, but they are usually underevaluated or underdescribed in radiology reports. A systematic approach to the evaluation of radiopaque jaw lesions is necessary to diagnose the lesion or at least provide a meaningful differential diagnosis. To evaluate a radiopaque jaw lesion, the first, most important step is to categorize the lesion according to its attenuation, its relationship to the teeth, and its location with respect to the tooth. These basic observations are essential to the evaluation of any type of jaw lesion. Once these observations have been made, it is easy to create a proper differential diagnosis. The presence of important characteristics, such as margination, a perilesional halo, bone expansion, and growth pattern, as well as whether the lesion is sclerotic, has ground-glass attenuation, or is mixed lytic and sclerotic, further narrows the differential diagnosis. It is important to note that some radiopaque jaw lesions may be entirely lucent early in their evolution. Awareness of the demographic distribution of these lesions and their associated clinical features, as well as the radiologic approach, is important to explore the "terra incognita" of radiopaque jaw lesions.

### The effect of X-rays on bone: a pictorial review [^116Uc3jv]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The deleterious effects of X-rays on bone have been recognised for almost a century and continue to be seen today because of improved survival in patients treated for malignancy with radiotherapy with or without other treatments. In this pictorial review we present the imaging features of radiation damage to bone highlighting the differences seen in the immature skeleton and post-skeletal fusion. In the former, damage is greatest to the physis resulting in growth disturbances. In the mature skeleton there is a spectrum of changes from mild osteopenia, through disordered attempts at healing with varying degrees of sclerosis, radionecrosis which may lead to acute fractures following minimal trauma and insufficiency fractures both with refractory healing to the dreaded complication of sarcomatous transformation. The imaging appearances are illustrated and the features that help distinguish malignant change from other complications stressed.

X-Ray-Based Imaging Methods

Radiography and CT demonstrate the morphological consequences of metastases that change the density of bone secondary to local changes in mineralization, as a result of osteolytic or osteoblastic activity. The poor sensitivity of radiographs, requiring up to 50% of bone to be destroyed before lytic metastases are visible, and slow or absent changes following successful therapy, are well-recognized. Similar to bone scintigraphy, CT can show an osteoblastic flare in healing metastases following successful treatment, either by showing an increase in density and sclerosis or the appearance of new, previously occult lesions.

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) plain radiography — periapical and panoramic X-rays show characteristic findings useful for diagnosis and monitoring. Periapical X-rays demonstrate thickening of lamina dura, widened periodontal ligament, a non-healing extraction site (empty socket), and jawbone changes with radiopaque and/or radiolucent bony lesions that tend to have poorly defined borders. Panoramic X-rays, in addition to periapical features, may show regional or diffused osteosclerosis that is more prominent in the alveolar process compared to the body of mandible and may extend beyond the site of sequestrum, as well as sequestrum, thickening of cortical structures (oblique ridge, lower mandibular border), prominent mandibular canal, periosteal reaction (usually in the form of proliferative osteitis) in advanced disease, osteolysis of cortical plates in advanced disease, pathologic fracture in advanced disease, and maxillary sinus involvement with opacification and blurring of the lower sinus border. These imaging modalities may help in the diagnosis and monitoring of jaw pathology without prescribing additional MRONJ-directed imaging.

Other hip artifacts

Prior history of osteosynthesis hardware. Even after removal, sclerotic changes can remain visible in the femoral neck.
Gluteal implants overlapping with bone structures. In the majority of these cases, the hip is not suitable for BMD assessment.
Hip dysplasia.
Bone metastases.
Paget's disease.
Incorrect ROI position of the hip region.
Incorrect rotation of the femur (lesser trochanter not visible).

A limitation of DXA scans is that they are based on two-dimensional projection images that measure BMD as the mass of bone per unit area, as this may underestimate true volumetric bone density in short or overestimate in tall adults. For this reason, they do not separate the effects of true bone density (i.e.g.rams of bone per unit volume) from those of bone size.

### Ring sclerosis in prostate cancer: circle of malignancy or benignity? [^112w5mUe]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Prostate cancer osteoblastic metastases may have different morphologies, and some of these may overlap with certain benign bone lesions. In this series of 5 prostate cancer patients, we describe bone lesions with central lucency and surrounding peripheral sclerosis and their varying appearances on different imaging modalities. Although prostate cancer metastases are commonly associated with sclerotic lesions, they can also present as osteolytic or lucent lesions, and these lesions should be carefully evaluated. The findings emphasize the importance of correlation with prior imaging, comparing findings on different imaging techniques and follow-up to differentiate benign disease from metastatic disease in these situations.

### Imaging metastatic bone disease from carcinoma of the prostate [^115Xz6Kj]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Imaging bone metastases from prostate cancer presents several challenges. The lesions are usually sclerotic and appear late on the conventional X-ray. Bone scintigraphy is the mainstay of lesion detection, but is often not suitable for assessment of treatment response, particularly because of a 'flare' phenomenon after therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging is increasingly used in assessment, and newer techniques allow quantitation. In addition to 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18 FDG), newer PET isotopes are also showing promise in lesion detection and response assessment. This article reviews the available imaging modalities for evaluating prostatic bony metastases, and links them to the underlying pathological changes within bone lesions.

### Fibrous dysplasia for radiologists: beyond ground glass bone matrix [^1145bFZH]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Age-related changes

In children younger than 2 years, FD lesions in the appendicular skeleton often appear heterogeneous on radiographs and lack the classic ground glass appearance. With time, mesenchymal cells that carry GNAS mutations undergo apoptosis, leading to a decreased number of FD cells and, thus, changing the classic radiographical appearance of ground glass to a more dense and sclerotic pattern (Fig. 12). Craniofacial lesions in older individuals typically become less homogeneous on CT, developing discrete radiolucent, cystic-appearing areas (Fig. 13). Rapid expansion of lesions is concerning for possible malignant transformation or ABC development.

Treatment-related changes

Bisphosphonates, which are used in the treatment of FD-related osseous pain, change the appearance of the bone and are responsible for the development of parallel sclerotic metaphyseal bands. These bands develop in any growing child treated with bisphosphonates, and are not specific to FD. Histologically, these bands are composed of horizontally arranged trabeculae containing calcified cartilage (Fig. 14).

### Radiolucent lesions of the mandible: a pattern-based approach to diagnosis [^116FcYr5]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Radiolucent mandibular lesions seen on panoramic radiographs develop from both odontogenic and non-odontogenic structures. They represent a broad spectrum of lesions with a varying degree of malignant potential. The purpose of this review is to illustrate the characteristic imaging findings — as well as the clinical and histological features — of common and uncommon radiolucent lesions of the mandible.

Methods

This review article is based on the retrospective evaluation of 11,725 panoramic radiographs seen in our institution during the past 6 years. It provides a comprehensive, practical approach to the radiological interpretation of radiolucent lesions of the mandible. To facilitate the diagnostic approach, we have classified radiolucent lesions into two groups: lesions with well-defined borders and those with ill-defined borders.

Results

Lesion prevalence, age of manifestation, location within the mandible, relationship to dental structures, effect on adjacent structures and characteristic findings at computed tomography (CT), cone beam CT (CBCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) are discussed. Pitfalls including malignant lesions mimicking benign disease and pseudo-lesions are equally addressed.

Conclusion

Knowledge of the characteristic imaging features of radiolucent mandibular lesions narrows the differential diagnosis and is crucial for the identification of those lesions, where biopsy is indicated for definitive histology.

Teaching points

- Panoramic X-rays, CT and MRI are essential for the work-up of radiolucent mandibular lesions.

- Lesion borders, location within the mandible, relationship to dental structures and tissue characteristics on cross-sectional imaging are indispensable to narrow the differential diagnosis.

- High-resolution CT and CBCT play a major role for the assessment of lesion margins and their relationship to important anatomic structures, such as the inferior alveolar nerve.

- Although most radiolucent lesions with well-defined sclerotic borders are benign, MRI may reveal clinically unsuspected malignant disease.

### Dysosteosclerosis presents as an "osteoclast-poor" form of osteopetrosis: comprehensive investigation of a 3-year-old girl and literature review [^117RAaG5]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Radiographic features of DSS

Major radiographic abnormalities in DSS that change with age include thickening and sclerosis of the calvarium and base of the skull, decreased pneumatization of paranasal sinuses and mastoids, and sclerosis of the scapula, clavicles, and ribs that are also broad and contain multiple fracture deformities. The pelvic bones are sclerotic, with the iliac bones having a nonsclerotic center or the "bone-in-bone" appearance. The vertebrae are sclerotic and flattened with anterior body wedging. Preadolescent long bone findings include dense sclerosis of epiphyses, metaphyses that are expanded and club-shaped, but midshafts that are relatively spared. There is irregularity of the physeal plates and the adjacent provisional zones of calcification. In childhood, the hand and foot bones, including the carpals and tarsals, are sclerotic, with the increased density appearing greatest at the ends of the tubular bones. The dense, expanded, Erlenmeyer flask–shaped bone ends evolve into osteopenic widened bones that include portions of the diaphysis with thin cortices. Sclerosis remains focal (largely in the metaphyses) in the long bones, but is present in much of the rest of the skeleton.

Differential diagnosis of DSS

Serial radiographs during infancy should distinguish DSS from other conditions, including various OPTs, pyknodysostosis, Camurati-Engelmann disease, and craniometaphyseal dysplasia. The especially helpful (diagnostic) feature in DSS is the flattening of vertebrae with punctate densities. Alternatively, mutation analysis is available for these other disorders.

For DSS, a severe type of OPT is the principal diagnostic consideration. The key features for diagnosis are the spinal osteosclerosis, flattening, and anterior beaking early on, as well as the sharply marginated sclerotic and expanded metaphyses. However, in older (eg, adolescent) DSS patients, osteosclerosis is replaced by radiolucency in the expanded ends of the tubular bones. Sclerosis then may involve the diaphyses and appear only focally in the metaphyses.

Eventually, DSS probably will be diagnosed by mutation analysis. DSS is considered to be an autosomal recessive trait (OMIM % 224300). However, X-linked recessive inheritance seems possible, although affected girls, such as our patient, challenge exclusivity for this pattern.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for osteoradionecrosis of the jaw, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ASCO/ISOO/MASCC 2024 guidelines recommend to characterize ORNJ as a radiographic lytic or mixed sclerotic lesion of bone and/or visibly exposed bone and/or bone probed through a periodontal pocket or fistula, occurring within an anatomical site previously exposed to a therapeutic dose of head and neck radiotherapy.

### Fibrous dysplasia for radiologists: beyond ground glass bone matrix [^111dQcQT]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Radiographs

The spectrum of bone lesions can be classified into three primary bony patterns: cystic, sclerotic and mixed. A typical FD lesion in the axial skeleton appear as an area of radiolucent ground glass matrix, which is usually smooth and homogeneous, not centrally located within medullary bone. Craniofacial FD typically demonstrates dense and sclerotic lesions (Fig. 4). FD lesions can vary in size from a small, focal abnormality to a large lesion, perhaps involving most or all of a long bone (Fig. 5). Delicate fine trabeculae can be seen within FD lesions. The lesions usually cause cortical thinning due to enlarged fibro-osseous masses within the bone. The periosteal reaction is not usually present unless it is associated with a pathological fracture. Although endosteal scalloping may be present, a smooth outer cortical contour is always maintained. The lesion may undergo expansile remodelling secondary to the enlarging mass of fibro-osseous tissue. A thick layer of sclerotic bone is known as a rind sign (Fig. 5 e). The sclerotic margins can vary in thickness and may be interrupted or incomplete. Small islands of cartilage, which later ossify and are seen as dense punctate or flocculent calcifications within FD lesions, can also be seen. This combination of enchondromata within an FD lesion, referred to as fibro cartilaginous dysplasia, is most frequently seen in the proximal femur.

### Bone within a bone [^116ZXowV]. Clinical Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The "bone within a bone" appearance is a well-recognized radiological term with a variety of causes. It is important to recognize this appearance and also to be aware of the differential diagnosis. A number of common conditions infrequently cause this appearance. Other causes are rare and some remain primarily of historical interest, as they are no longer encountered in clinical practice. In this review we illustrate some of the conditions that can give the bone within a bone appearance and discuss the physiological and pathological aetiology of each where known.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1141RmPb]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

North American Menopause Society position statement — physical examination for osteoporosis evaluation states that standing height should be measured annually, and height loss of 1.5 in (3.8 cm) or more increases the likelihood that a vertebral fracture is present, which calls for evaluation with lateral thoracolumbar radiograph or vertebral fracture assessment by DXA. Weight should be recorded to identify those women with low BMI and to track weight changes that may interfere with interpreting BMD over time, and examination in women with osteoporosis should also include skeletal assessments such as bone tenderness and joint laxity or blue sclera.

### Molecular and radiological diagnosis of sclerosing bone dysplasias [^116QH2Ac]. European Journal of Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) is a quantitative trait for which the heritability of the variance is estimated to be up to 80%, based on epidemiological and twin studies. Further illustration of the involvement of genetic factors in bone homeostasis, is the existence of an extended group of genetic conditions associated with an abnormal bone density. The group of conditions with increased bone density has long been poorly studied and understood at the molecular genetic level but recently, thanks to recent developments in molecular genetics and genomics, for some of them major breakthroughs have been made. These findings will make the molecular analysis of such patients an additional tool in diagnostics and in genetic counseling. However, the initial identification of affected patients is still largely dependent upon recognition of clinical and radiological stigmata of the disease. Therefore, in this overview of sclerosing bone dysplasias, the classical clinical and radiological signs of this group of disorders will be discussed along with the new molecular insights.

### Radiolucent lesions of the mandible: a pattern-based approach to diagnosis [^112Vd6xR]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Osteoblastoma

Osteoblastoma is a mesenchymal well-vascularised benign bone tumour with production of osteoid; it involves the skull in only 10% of cases. It is uncommon and has a predilection for the posterior mandible, affecting mainly young people with a mean age below 20 years. The clinical symptoms include pain and swelling. The radiological presentation comprises an ill-defined (rarely well-defined) radiolucent or mixed radiolucent-osteosclerotic lesion. The tumour usually measures less than 4 cm and may be partially calcified. The borders are typically coarse and sclerotic (Fig. 13). Osteoblastoma has an expansile growth pattern and may cause teeth displacement but typically never leads to fusion with cementoma, a feature allowing differentiation from cementoblastoma. On MRI, osteoblastoma displays major contrast enhancement after injection of gadolinium chelates (Fig. 13). The main differential diagnosis includes osteoid osteoma, ossifying fibroma, periapical cemental dysplasia, fibrous dysplasia, as well as other fibro-osseous lesions. Osteoid osteoma typically presents with pain and a nidus can be identified at CT or CBCT. Ossifying fibroma most commonly occurs in the posterior mandible during the 3rd–4th decades. Depending on the degree of calcification, the radiological appearance includes well-defined radiolucent, radiopaque or mixed opacity lesions. Commonly, a radiolucent margin is seen on CT or CBCT, allowing differentiation from fibrous dysplasia. Periapical cemental dysplasia typically occurs in women during the 4th and 5th decades. It is the consequence of connective tissue proliferation within the periodontal membrane; therefore, the lesions are typically located in vicinity of tooth apices. Initially, the lesions are radiolucent and with increasing maturity, there is advanced calcification. As opposed to mandibular osteoblastoma and osteoid osteoma, many fibro-osseous lesions do not cause pain despite their large size or associated teeth displacement. In addition, the age of presentation, the multiplicity of lesions and the relationship to tooth apices are further elements that help in the differential diagnosis. The treatment of choice in osteoblastoma is surgery and recurrence is rare. Some cases of spontaneous regression have been reported, especially in young patients.

### Bone reporting and data system on CT (bone-RADS-CT): a validation study by four readers on 328 cases from three local and two public databases [^112LnuDR]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study validated the Bone-RADS-CT for incidental solitary bone lesions in adults using three local and two public databases. Bone-RADS-CT demonstrated moderate inter-reader agreement between both musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal radiologists, and presented high sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy but relatively low specificity (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Histogram of diagnostic performance of Bone-RADS according to readers

The Bone-RADS-CT was validated by Park et al using a single-center dataset of 179 patients who underwent biopsy for bone lesions. Two musculoskeletal radiologists with 5 and 6 years of experience demonstrated sensitivities of 94.7% and 82.4%, specificities of 10.8% and 10.8%, and accuracies of 57.3% and 50.5% for lucent lesions, respectively; and sensitivities of 75.0% and 67.9%, specificities of 27.1% and 27.1%, and accuracies of 44.7% and 42.1% for sclerotic or mixed lesions, respectively. Our study exhibited better diagnostic performance, with sensitivities of 91.0% to 97.3%, specificities of 46.2% to 92.3%, and accuracies of 84.7% to 92.7% for lucent lesions, and sensitivities of 86.6% to 92.0%, specificities of 41.8% to 72.2%, and accuracies of 71.2% to 82.2% for sclerotic or mixed lesions. We hypothesize that the sample may partially account for the difference. The biopsy cases may be challenging to diagnose based only on imaging appearance, whereas our study included more cases with typical presentation that are educationally significant and more cases with aggressive features (cortical involvement, soft tissue extension, pathologic fracture, or aggressive periosteal reaction) that are easier to diagnose based solely on imaging examinations. Another factor contributing to the difference could be the selection of representative images for evaluation. In our study, readers assessed the key image via a PowerPoint document to determine the Bone-RADS category, instead of reading the whole image set. This can potentially improve the diagnostic performance of the readers. A revised version of Bone-RADS excluded the original criteria for lesion-related pain and history of malignancy, resulting in improvement in specificity while maintaining the sensitivity. Some benign or intermediate lesions may present with pain but are classified as Bone-RADS-4 lesions by the original system, such as osteoid osteomas, chondroblastomas, and giant cell tumors of bone. The original system placed too much emphasis on the clinical appearance of pain and the history of malignancy, while the revised system has shifted the evaluation focus, enhancing the objective assessment of imaging findings over subjective symptoms, which can vary significantly at presentation.

### Imaging chronic sclerosing osteitis of the diaphysis of tubular bones [^115H1LFU]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to report the radiographic changes seen in chronic sclerosing osteitis of the diaphysis of tubular bones during progression or healing, with CT and MRI correlation. Chronic sclerosing osteitis is an inflammatory condition of bone that can be considered a pediatric subset of the synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis (SAPHO) spectrum of disease. Previous descriptions of long-bone involvement focus predominately on metaphyseal lesions. Eleven diaphyseal lesions in seven patients (age range, 13 months-14.5 years) were followed.

Conclusion

The marked degree of cortical hyperostosis, medullary narrowing, and cortical lucencies seen in eight of 11 lesions is helpful for recognition of diaphyseal chronic sclerosing osteitis. Early identification of the disorder can prevent unnecessary repeat invasive procedures.

Radiologic findings

Radiographic skeletal surveys were available from ages 7, 11, 22, and 33 months. Right hand and wrist films were available at 30 months, left knee at 42 months, and right knee at 47 months.

A generalized skeletal disorder was revealed, where every imaged bone was abnormal (Figs. 2 through 5). Prominent findings included basilar sclerosis of the skull and modeling abnormalities (expansion) in the major long bones resembling OPT but also ovoid vertebral bodies characteristic of DSS. The sclerosis must have occurred postnatally because relatively normal iliac bones had formed in utero that subsequently became sclerotic peripherally. The changes per anatomic site are described below.

Fig. 2
Skull. (A) At age 22 months, anteroposterior view of the skull shows sclerosis that affects the periorbital region and skull base. The sinuses are opacified. (B) At age 33 months, the neurocranium appears large on lateral view, with diffuse sclerosis greatest at the base. The midface is small, and the mandibular angle is obtuse.

### Sclerotic bone lesions as a clue in the diagnosis of three generations of tuberous sclerosis complex: case report and review of literature [^117Lo4Q3]. Pediatric Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that can involve multiple organ systems. Diagnosis is based on independent clinical diagnostic criteria and genetic diagnostic criteria (pathogenic variants on TSC1 and TSC2 genes). To make a definitive diagnosis can be especially difficult in oligosymptomatic or asymptomatic patients and in those patients with genetic variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Early diagnosis and lifelong surveillance are paramount to avoid morbidity and potentially life-threatening complications. To increase diagnostic sensibility, less known manifestations of TSC can be helpful. Herein we show a case in which SBLs were used as a diagnostic clue to help diagnose three generations of oligosymptomatic TSC carrying a VUS in TSC1. SBLs are commonly detected in imaging studies of patients with TSC and have been recently included as a minor clinical diagnostic criterion. Clinicians and radiologists should be aware of their significance as they can be mistaken with osteoblastic metastases.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

PIDS/IDSA pediatric AHO — plain radiographs performance and timing of findings: A systematic review reported that sensitivity for detecting AHO on plain films ranged from 16% to 20% while specificity ranged from 80% to 100%; in a study of 183 patients at initial presentation, sensitivity was 16% and both specificity and positive predictive value were 96%, with other studies showing sensitivity ranging from 20% to 37%. Early changes include soft tissue swelling and loss of fat planes within 3–10 days, while periosteal thickening/elevation, focal osteopenia, or osteolytic lesions require > 30% to 50% bone loss and usually are not evident until 10–20 days; sclerosis is a relatively late finding (> 21 days after onset). The sensitivity of plain films thus increases over time; radiographs are readily available, have low radiation dosage and relatively low costs, and do not require sedation, and normal findings at presentation do not exclude AHO.

### Spectrum of neuropathic skeletal injuries in children: a pictorial essay [^116eC9fZ]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging findings

The thoracolumbar junction and lumbar spine are most frequently affected, with one or more segments being involved. Radiographs show lytic and sclerotic changes of the vertebrae and disc space narrowing (Fig. 6A, B). CT demonstrates sclerosis, lysis, fragmentation and height loss of vertebral bodies; displacement of fragments into paraspinal musculature and spinal canal; and paraspinal soft-tissue calcifications (Fig. 6C). MRI is essential to assess intracanal protrusion of the disc and bone fragments, radicular conflict, and spinal cord compression (Fig. 6D, E). All imaging modalities are used for diagnosis and for post-surgical follow-up and complications.

Anteroposterior (A) and lateral (B) radiographs of the dorso-lumbar spine showing lytic changes of multiple vertebrae (white arrowhead) and collapse of T12-L1 (black arrowhead). Sagittal CT (C) confirms endplate destruction from T7 to T11 (white arrowhead), L1 collapse with partial fusion of T12-L1 (black arrowhead), and intracanal bone fragments (arrow). Sagittal T2 (D) and T1 (E) MRI confirm the intracanal protrusion of the posterior wall of L1 (arrow), fragmentation and oedema of T12-L1 (white arrowhead) as well as endplate lytic changes and degenerative fatty changes of bone marrow in multiple thoracic vertebrae (asterisk)

Differential diagnosis

The involvement of all three vertebral columns with destruction of the facet joints and the multilevel extension are signs that help differentiate spine NA from osteomyelitis, in which only one column is usually involved, and sclerosis and fragmentation are limited to the adjacent end plates. Pott disease is an exception, because it presents a more extensive destruction; abscesses of the surrounding soft tissues are usually associated and help make the diagnosis. Two other differential diagnoses of osteolytic lesions and vertebral collapses in children are acute leukaemia and chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO). In acute leukaemia, diffuse bone demineralisation is frequently associated. In CRMO, other lesions in the metaphysis of long bones, particularly the tibia, may be present.

Treatment

In most cases in the literature, surgical fusion is performed to correct deformity and prevent further neurological sequelae. Progressive radiographic destruction and the need for revision surgery have been described.

### Spectrum of neuropathic skeletal injuries in children: a pictorial essay [^1165v9b7]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging findings

Plain radiographs can reveal subchondral fractures and joint effusion at early stages (Figs. 1–4) (with the exception of hip joint effusions, which are difficult to recognise on plain radiographs and more easily identified on ultrasonography). Late stages exhibit metaphyseal and epiphyseal partial collapse with fragmentation and sclerosis (Figs. 1–3, 5). In the acute phase, MRI shows bone marrow oedema and enhancement, cartilaginous damage, joint effusion and soft-tissue oedema (Fig. 4). In the chronic stage, bone marrow demonstrates a low signal intensity in the subchondral bone on both T1- and T2-weighted images and no enhancement, a finding radiographically associated with osteosclerosis (Figs. 1, 2). CT allows for accurate detection of intra-articular loose bodies to plan surgical debridement (Fig. 2C).

### Prevention and management of osteoradionecrosis in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiation therapy: ISOO-MASCC-ASCO guideline [^117XRshZ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the jaw — operational clinical characterization and classification is as follows: ORN of the jaw should be operationally characterized as: radiographic lytic or mixed sclerotic lesion of bone and/or visibly exposed bone and/or probe through a periodontal pocket or fistula (Figs 1A and 1B) occurring within an anatomical site previously exposed to a therapeutic dose of head and neck RT. To facilitate clinical implementation of the enclosed recommendations, the Panel has adopted the ClinRad classification system, which the Panel favored as "designed in order to be comprehensive enough to be used across providers and specialties" and "yet simple enough to communicate a stable intrinsic description of ORN as a recognizable disease state". Unlike other necrotic states, direct biopsy or tissue sampling is neither routinely used nor recommended by this Panel, as the biopsy or tissue excision itself might engender disease progression.

### Non-radiographic versus radiographic axSpA: what's in a name? [^117QNFXm]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Nr-axSpA, which may or may not be identified with and without bone marrow oedema as seen by MRI, may evolve over the years to r-axSpA previously known as AS, which is characterized by established changes of sclerosis, erosions and/or fusion in the sacroiliac joints and syndesmophytes or vertebral fusion in the spine in a proportion of cases. These changes are represented with the different colour grading (yellow/red) to illustrate the nr-axSpA–r-axSpA continuum. Those who will develop radiographic changes are represented as 'progressors' with risk factors such as a previously positive MRI, raised CRP and positive HLA-B27. A proportion of HLA-B27 positive subjects with negative MRIs may develop a raised CRP, placing them in the more severe or 'progressor' category. With time and a possible treatment effect, the number of 'non-progressors' can increase as shown. Fat metaplasia is represented as a post-inflammatory lesion after bone marrow oedema occurs and is a possible precursor of radiographic structural lesions. nr-axSpA: non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis; r-axSpA: radiographic axSpA.

Table 1
Clinical characteristics of CNO compared with other bone diseases

Laboratory investigations may reveal mild elevation in white blood cell count and in inflammatory parameters (C-Reactive Protein; Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate), but often these abnormalities are absent in CNO patients. Cultures of blood and bone are invariably negative, and sophisticated assays to identify evidence of a microbial etiology have been unsuccessful. Autoantibodies (antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid- factor), as well as carriage of the HLAB27 allele, have the same prevalence in CNO patients when compared to healthy individuals. At present, no specific biomarkers are available for the diagnosis or prediction of flares in CNO patients. In 2007 Jansson et al. proposed diagnostic criteria for CNO according to which diagnosis could be formulated if present 2 majors and one minor criteria or one major and three minors criteria. However, these criteria are not still internationally validated and accepted so far. A crucial role in the diagnosis of this condition is provided by imaging and biopsy.

The role of radiology

Standard radiography of bones could not reveal characteristic changes in early CNO, while the presence of osteolytic lesions with a sclerotic edge in X-ray imaging is the key feature later. Clavicular lesions and mandibular often have a more prominent sclerotic appearance.

Cortical bone is usually unaffected and thickened but there are also reports of cortical defect mimicking tumor. The involvement of the mandible is often associated with mandibular nerve canal enlargement (Fig. 1). CNO is a systemic disorder that can affect multiple skeletal sites. Isotopic bone scan and/or whole-body Magnetic Resonance (MR) are the cornerstone for confirming the multifocal pattern of CNO, even if bone scan may be falsely negative in some cases. However, if isotopic bone scan may just confirm the presence of one or more foci of inflammation, MR may also add more information concerning the types of lesions being the more sensitive and accurate radiological examination at CNO diagnosis.

Radionuclide bone scintigraphy

Radionuclide bone scintigraphy is widely considered to be a valuable technique for the diagnosis of PDB and assessment of disease extent. 71 Radionuclide bone scanning is performed after intravenous injection of the gamma‐emitting isotope Technetium‐99m (Tc 99m) linked to a bisphosphonate (most commonly as Tc 99m ‐methylene diphosphonate). When PDB involves a bone, the radiolabeled bisphosphonate accumulates in sites where there is high bone remodeling. In PDB, sites of involvement are visualized as a region of intense and homogeneous tracer uptake, which in long bones starts at the metaphysis and extends down the shaft. Although many other conditions such as fibrous dysplasia, infections, metastases, and arthritis can be associated with increased tracer uptake on bone scans, the appearances in PDB usually allow differentiation from other conditions. In certain sites, the scintigraphic features of PDB are highly specific. These are "clover" or "mickey mouse sign" and the "heart sign" when PDB affects the spine. 72, 73 This observation can be of value in the differential diagnosis with vertebral metastases but false‐positive results have been described. 74 Several investigators have compared the performance of bone scanning with plain X‐rays in the evaluation of PDB. Wellman and colleagues compared the performance of radionuclide bone scans with X‐rays in 108 PDB patients. 75 They reported that 101 lesions were detected both by X‐rays and radionuclide scans; that a further 36 lesions were detected only on radionuclide scan and not by X‐ray; and that 11 lesions were detected by X‐ray only. 75 They concluded that radionuclide bone scan was more sensitive than X‐ray in detecting sites of involvement but that scan may be negative in sclerotic ("burned out') lesions. Another study by Meunier and colleagues 76 compared the performance of X‐rays and radionuclide scans in 170 PDB patients. They reported evidence of increased tracer uptake in 863 sites of which 16 (1.9%) showed changes consistent with osteoarthritis; 6 (0.7%) with changes consistent with bone metastases, and 3 (0.35%) with changes consistent with vertebral fractures. Of the 838 sites showing scintigraphic changes consistent with PDB, 727 (86.7%) showed evidence of PDB on X‐ray. Seventy‐one (8.4%) showed changes typical of PDB on bone scan only, and in another 23 sites, radiographs were positive and bone scans were negative. The authors reported that of 863 sites detected on bone scan, 30.6% were symptomatic. The authors concluded that bone scans are more sensitive than radiographs at detecting PDB lesions but that bone scans may be negative if the disease is inactive. A further comparative study of 23 patients with PDB showed 127 sites of involvement of which 120 (94.5%) were recognized on scan compared with 94 (74%) on radiological skeletal survey. 77 Of these, 7 lesions (5.5%) were detected on X‐ray only and 33 (25.9%) on bone scan only; lesions were detected by both modalities in 87 (67.5%) sites. When data from these three studies are combined, 83.5% of bone lesions in PDB were detected by both X‐rays and radionuclide bone scans; 12.8% by bone scan only, and 3.7% by X‐ray only. The evidence summary and recommendations for the use of radionuclide bone scans in the diagnosis and assessment of patients with PDB are shown in Table 4.

Hands and feet

Sclerosis was greatest in the metacarpals, metatarsals, and distal radii and ulnas and often most in their metaphyses (Fig. 5). Nevertheless, metacarpals and metatarsals contained nonsclerotic areas. Some phalanges were almost entirely sclerotic, whereas others appeared normal. In some, metaphyseal sclerosis terminated abruptly into more normal-appearing bone, and then into a mixed sclerosis pattern. The cuboids had focal sclerosis, as did some other tarsal bones, but the carpals and distal radial epiphyses had no sclerosis. The distal radii and ulnas showed irregular physeal plates, provisional zones of calcification, and broad undertubulated, densely sclerotic metaphyses where the sclerosis terminated abruptly into more normal-appearing bone (Fig. 5 D). In addition, the sclerosis ended in a rounded or oblique shape. The second metacarpals had accessory epiphyses. The bone age at 22 months was delayed to 18 months. At 33 months, the metaphyses of the phalanges were more sclerotic, as were the epiphyses.

At age 3 years, DXA L 1 –L 4 spine BMD Z -score was +8.1.

Fractures

Fractures would occur through radiographically dense bone (Fig. 5 D) or at the junction of osteosclerosis and less remarkable bone (Fig. 5 E) and were slow to heal.

### Imaging metastatic bone disease from carcinoma of the prostate [^1114N9L4]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

The flare phenomenon on radionuclide bone scan in patients with prostate cancer has been reported at anywhere between 6 and 25% and is also a feature observed on plain film. It may be because of an increase in blood flow caused by an inflammatory response or an increased turnover of hydroxyapatite in the new bone laid down as part of the healing process. In prostate cancer, if the scan taken 3 months after introduction of therapy shows worsening of disease, there is a high probability that this is real. If, however, the patients' clinical parameters indicate a response, then flare should be considered. A follow-up scan at 6 months can resolve the issue (Figure 2).

Regardless of the flare phenomenon, the sensitivity of bone scintigraphy in detecting a response to therapy remains questionable; metastases showed by bone scintigraphy have been shown to remain stable despite other parameters indicating a response.found purely sclerotic bone metastases impossible to assess on bone scintigraphy, as increased sclerosis without scintigraphic changes occurred in the responding and non-responding patients. In the responding patients (as judged by disease in non-osseous sites), any detectable response on bone scan is often delayed by up to 6–8 months and it can take over 2 years for complete resolution of bone scintigraphy findings, even when all of the disease has been eliminated from the bone. Conversely, a stable positive scintigraphic lesion, in conjunction with a fading sclerotic lesion on radiographs in a positive scintigraphic lesion, can be a sign of progression. A further source of debate is the occurrence of a new lesion on bone scintigraphy. Previously, this was thought to rule out flare response but it has been shown that appearance of a new lesion on bone scans or plain film within 6 months of initiation of therapy can be a part of the flare response as a result of the healing of previously occult lesions (Ciray et al, 2005).

### Appearance of osteolysis with melorheostosis: redefining the disease or a new disorder? A novel case report with multimodality imaging [^1142hmip]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

We present a case report of melorheostosis with the novel radiographic finding of underlying cortical resorption. A number of radiographic patterns of melorheostosis have been described; however, the combination of new bone formation and resorption of the original cortex appears unique. Although the presence of underlying lysis has been postulated in published studies, direct radiographic evidence of bony resorption in melorheostosis has not been reported. These findings can be subtle and might go unnoticed using standard imaging. An in-depth review of the radiographic features is presented, including multimodality imaging with magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography.

### Spectrum of lytic lesions of the skull: a pictorial essay [^1162AUT8]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic granuloma

Eosinophilic granuloma (EG) is the benign form of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), a multisystemic rare disorder of unknown aetiology, mainly affecting male children, characterised by the proliferation of Langerhans cells. EG usually presents as a single skeletal lesion, often involving flat bones, with the skull being affected in more than 50% of the cases. EG is characterised by fever, localised pain, soft tissue swelling and mild peripheral eosinophilia, and it usually shows a benign clinical course, also considering its high sensitivity to radiation therapy.

On plain radiographs, EG usually appears as a well-defined round or ovoid lytic lesion, with non-sclerotic margins and a "punched out" presentation, that rarely extends across cranial sutures or determine transdural or intra-axial invasion. Due to their lytic nature, lesions could contain a small sequestrum of devascularised bone, surrounded by lucency, providing a typical "bull's eye" appearance. Furthermore, if the inner cranial table is more involved than the outer, the lesion could result in a double contour image ("hole within a hole" sign). Finally, if multiple lesions are present, they can enlarge and merge, providing a geographic skull appearance.

CT findings are similar to those evaluable on plain X-rays, providing an excellent evaluation of bone erosions, as well as a good quantification of the involvement of the surrounding soft tissues. CT images are usually acquired for surgical planning purposes, as well as to perform targeted biopsies in equivocal case presentations (Fig. 9).

Fig. 9
Eosinophilic granuloma (EG). Axial CT images with soft tissues (a) and bone (b) windows showing a right frontal lytic lesion with ill-defined margins extending in the contiguous extracranial soft tissues. Erosion of the inner cranial table is more pronounced than of the outer ("hole within a hole" sign). 18(F) FDG-PET CT examination demonstrates a moderate tracer uptake (c, d)

MRI is usually performed to obtain an accurate evaluation of the surrounding soft tissue changes, as well as the medullary extent of the lesion. EG usually appears as isointense to hypointense on T1-weighted images, slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with this hyperintensity more pronounced on short-inversion-time inversion recovery (STIR) images, and is frequently characterised by contrast enhancement after gadolinium administration (Fig. 10).

Osteonecrosis of systemic origin

Nosological context

Ischemic or avascular osteonecrosis results from impaired blood supply to the bone, causing irreversible death of bone cells (osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes) and bone marrow cells (mainly adipocytes in the knee epiphysis).

Apart from traumatic causes, osteonecrosis can occur by systemic mechanisms that are not always well understood, in subjects with various risk factors (including hypercorticism, alcoholism, hyperuricemia, lupus erythematosus, sickle cell disease, and HIV)).

Systemic osteonecrosis occurs in the epiphyses and in the diaphyseal and metaphyseal regions, particularly in or near the hips and knees. Lesions are bilateral in more than 80% of cases (Fig. 30).

Fig. 30
Distribution of osteonecrosis from systemic origin. T1-weighted MR image shows lesions characterized by bone marrow areas surrounded by a peripheral rim (asterisks). These lesions are often bilateral, epiphyseal, and diaphyseal-metaphyseal. The areas within the peripheral rims may show a normal marrow signal, corresponding to mummified but not degraded fat

Depending on the location, osteonecrosis was previously termed "avascular necrosis", "aseptic necrosis", or "ischemic necrosis" (if located in the epiphysis), or "bone infarction" (if located in the metaphysis or diaphysis). However, the term osteonecrosis is appropriate for all locations of devitalized bone.

In the absence of mechanical collapse, these lesions are generally asymptomatic (so-called silent osteonecrosis). It is when a collapse occurs that the lesion becomes symptomatic.

Radiographic appearance

Radiography is normal for early lesions. In more advanced stages, osteonecrosis appears as irregular densification with a serpentine sclerotic border, better depicted on CT (Fig. 31).

Fig. 31
Radiographic of osteonecrosis of systemic origin. a Radiograph shows areas of heterogeneous bone sclerosis, in this case particularly prominent in the condyles. b CT arthrography shows areas of irregular bone densification corresponding to osteonecrotic lesions (asterisks) surrounded by sclerotic rims. Note collapsed segments in the weight-bearing areas of inferior condylar poles (arrows) associated with fractures within necrotic areas (arrowheads)

The collapse of an epiphyseal lesion is associated with deformation or disruption of the subchondral bone plate, sometimes with separation of the subchondral bone plate from the rest of the lesion (i.e. subchondral dissection). Epiphyseal deformity may evolve towards osteoarthritis.

### Systemic treatment in breast cancer: a primer for radiologists [^114TeKwx]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

99mTc methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scintigraphy

Bone is the most common site of breast cancer metastasis. Bone scintigraphy is the most widely used modality for detecting bone metastases, and demonstrates osteoblastic activity as areas of increased radiotracer uptake. However, certain characteristic false-negative and false-positive findings on scintigraphy should be kept in mind in assessing treatment response. Scintigraphy sometimes demonstrates an apparent worsening of abnormalities, known as the "flare phenomenon", characterized by increased activity in known lesions or new lesions during the first 3 months after treatment as a result of bone repair (Fig. 8). This finding should not be confused with progression of disease, and should be followed up with another bone scan in 4 to 6 months. A finding that persists beyond 6 months, however, is more likely indicative of disease progression. The apparent worsening or new sclerotic osseous lesions should be interpreted with caution, and should not be considered new or progressive disease, particularly in the setting of improving tumour markers and clinical status and the absence of other bone progression. The concept of increased osteoblastic healing reaction was introduced as a criterion for treatment response by the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in 2004. In the revised criteria, CT and MRI are included as imaging modalities for assessing treatment response in bony metastases. The appearance of peripheral sclerosis around initial lytic lesions or sclerosis of previously undetectable lesions on CT or radiographs is considered a partial response. The rapid regression of lesions on scintigraphy was excluded as a partial response, as this finding may represent progression of lytic bony lesions. Bone scintigraphy is not sensitive for lytic osseous metastases given the low amount or absence of osteoblastic activity in these lesions. 18 F-FDG PET is more sensitive than scintigraphy in detecting lytic metastases and marrow involvement. The recently proposed PERCIST (PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumours) guidelines involve the role of FDG PET in treatment response, with an emphasis on change in tumour metabolism after therapy over anatomically based criteria.

Appendicular skeleton. At 22 (A) and 33 (B) months of age the lower extremities, and at 7 (C) and 33 (D) months of age the left upper extremity, show sclerosis greatest at the proximal and distal ends of the bones and metaphyseal expansion from tubulation failure greatest in the distal femurs. (E) There are transverse metaphyseal bands of osteosclerosis, as seen in some forms of OPT (arrows). A healing fracture featuring focal bone expansion and periosteal new bone formation is present in the distal left femur at the junction of the sclerotic and nonsclerotic bone (arrows) (A). There is a slight irregularity of the physeal plates and adjacent provisional zones of calcification (C, D, E). Sclerosis in the upper extremities has increased at the ends of the bones between 7 (C) and 33 (D) months of age. In the leg bones and distal right femur, the junction between the sclerotic and nonsclerotic bone is sharp, but not well defined in the proximal femurs or distal left femur. The junction between the sclerotic and nonsclerotic bone can have a transverse or oblique shape.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117L4fkK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease — diagnostic imaging and staging: In patients with suspected Paget's disease, we recommend obtaining plain radiographs of the suspicious regions of the skeleton, and in patients diagnosed with Paget's disease, we suggest a radionuclide bone scan to determine the extent of the disease and identify possible asymptomatic sites. Because a majority of lesions are asymptomatic, radionuclide imaging of the skeleton rather than a general x-ray survey has become the standard means to document the extent of skeletal involvement; it is the most sensitive test for detecting localized increased bone cell activity and may detect developing lesions before they are clearly apparent on x-rays. It is not recommended to repeat the radionuclide test, but if treatment is administered, uptake of pagetic lesions is usually reduced. Other radiological modalities (computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography) may be useful in individual patients — particularly if a neoplasm at a pagetic site is suspected — but they are not used routinely, and very seldom is it necessary to obtain a bone biopsy to make a definitive diagnosis.

### Clinical and radiological features of extra-pulmonary sarcoidosis: a pictorial essay [^115FfvP4]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Skeletal sarcoidosis

The skeletal system represents a rare localization of sarcoidosis. Radiological features of skeletal locations have been described for the first time in 1910 by Rieder. It occurs in a variable range of percentages, from 9% up to 39%. However, its frequency can be underestimated, because bone lesions are often asymptomatic; frequently, the disease is misdiagnosed, being interpreted as metastatic lesions.

The disease generally involves hands and feet, which have been reported in several reviews as the most affected locations. On conventional radiography, lesions produce a lacy pattern of osteolytic areas in the digits (Fig. 16); cortical erosions and pathological fractures may be observed.

MRI images show spinal cord involvement in a 54-year-old man. T2-weighted image (Fig. 15a) demonstrates an extensive area of high signal intensity in the spinal cord (white arrow). On enhanced T1-weighted acquisitions, a peripheral enhancement (white arrows) can be depicted (Fig. 15b and c), suggesting meningeal involvement

Large bones and axial skeleton involvement is uncommon; however, the disease may be encountered in ribs, long bones, skull and vertebrae. Axial skeleton disease, without pulmonary lesions, is rarely reported.

Lesions of large bone and axial skeleton can be detected as radiolucent (Fig. 17) or sclerotic areas (Fig. 18). Sclerotic areas are well depicted on CT images, consisting of hyperdense homogeneous areas, round or oval in shape (Fig. 18); osteolysis produces a hypodense appearance, and differential diagnosis from metastatic lesions is required. The MRI appearance of bone lesions is heterogeneous. Vardahanabuhuti et al. described how lesions can appear as bone marrow infiltration areas, "round, cannonball-like or intramedullary lesions"; lesions can reproduce a "starry sky appearance". Sarcoid lesions show high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, high-density proton sequences and STIR acquisitions; on T1-weighted images, lesions are generally hypointense.

### Osteoid osteoma: the great mimicker [^117Pj93y]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic imaging: typical imaging findings

Conventional radiography (CR) is the usual first-line imaging method used for osteoarticular pain, especially when OO is suspected. The typical radiographic features of OO consist of an intracortical lytic lesion, usually smaller than 1.0 cm, with variable central nidus mineralization associated with reactive surrounding sclerosis and fusiform cortical thickening; the two latter conditions are usually more marked in the pediatric population. OO is typically located at the diaphysis of long bones, and locoregional osteopenia, secondary to pain-related disuse, may occur. The nidus can be distinguished in 85% of cases, and a central area of calcification is identified in 25–50% of cases.

Some types of OO are harder to identify on X-rays, such as intraarticular and medullary OO, due to there being less marked corticoperiosteal reactions and spinal OO manifestations because of the complex anatomy and overlapping structures at the spine. In addition, lesions that affect the extremities are even smaller than usual, making the identification of the nidus challenging. When conventional radiographs are not sufficient, other imaging techniques should be used. Even when there is high suspicion of OO on the basis of radiographic and clinical features, sectional imaging studies are performed to better visualize the lesion, confirm the diagnosis and eventually determine the treatment.

CT is considered the modality of choice for OO, as the nidus can be obscured on radiographs. The central calcification may be punctate, amorphous or ring-like, and it is usually regular and centrally located. On CT scans, a "vascular groove" or "CT vessel" sign can be identified, represented by low-density grooves entering the nidus and corresponding to the enlarged vessels that arise from the periosteum to irrigate the hypervascular nidus.

The OO nidus shows variable signal intensities on MRI scans with a target-like appearance since nonmineralized vascular stromata have an intermediate/high signal intensity on T2WIs and usually presents intense gadolinium enhancement, while the mineralized portion presents a low signal intensity on all sequences and does not enhance. Surrounding sclerosis and/or inflammatory changes may be abundant and obscure the nidus, making diagnosis difficult. However, the presence of bone marrow edema may help locate the nidus, serving as a red flag and suggesting a more thorough evaluation be conducted in the area of the tumor. Edema is also useful for distinguishing OO from other pathologies that do not promote marked inflammatory changes.

### Bone up on spinal osseous lesions: a case review series [^111k2zH3]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Enostosis

Enostosis, or bone island, is a benign osteogenic tumor based on the WHO classification, is frequently encountered, and is a well-recognized entity. It represents a focus of mature compact (cortical) bone within the cancellous bone (spongiosa). It is a benign lesion, probably congenital or developmental in origin, typically incidentally found and is asymptomatic. It is often found in the pelvis, femur, and other long bones; however, it can occur anywhere in the skeleton, including the spine.

Radiographically, a bone island presents as an intraosseous sclerotic lesion with discrete margins. It is typically well-defined and homogenous and does not expand the vertebral contours.

On CT, a bone island appears as a high attenuation focus. Careful inspection of the borders will show radiating spicules at the peripheral margins, which blend into the surrounding bone. A distinguishing feature of bone islands is that they are usually "cold" on bone scans and PET/CT (Fig. 4). Thus, nuclear medicine bone scan is the primary modality of differentiating bone islands from more aggressive lesions. On MRI, it shows low signal intensity like cortical bone (Fig. 5). It is essential to recognize this entity and not mistake it for an ominous lesion.

This lesion demonstrates T1/T2 hyperintense signal (b, d, orange arrows), fat suppression (c, e, orange arrows) and no enhancement post contrast (c, e, orange arrow). This lesion is consistent with a vertebral venous vascular malformation (formerly known as a hemangioma)

### Foreign bodies: radiopaque compared to what? [^114zydEc]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The term "radiopaque" is commonly used when discussing foreign bodies and lists of radiopaque and non-radiopaque materials are sometimes created, but radiopacity is not a binary concept. A more fundamental understanding of radiopacity is necessary for the work-up of foreign bodies.

Objective

To demonstrate that "radiopaque" is a relative term.

Materials and Methods

Twenty foreign bodies of various sizes, shapes and materials were placed in a basin. Radiographs were obtained of the objects with 0, 2.5, 5 and 10 cm depth of water in the basin to simulate the appearance of a foreign body in human tissue. The progressively changing appearance of the objects was observed.

Results

All of the objects were radiographically visible in the empty basin. Different objects demonstrated different appearances when immersed in progressively deeper levels of water, illustrating the effect of the surrounding water as well as the effects of object shape, size, orientation and composition.

Conclusion

The concept of radiopacity seems simple and the term "radiopaque" is sometimes used to describe an all or none phenomenon. However, radiopacity is a comparative concept implying relative X-ray attenuation. Accurate understanding of the radiographic appearance of foreign bodies requires one to keep in mind the concepts of relative X-ray attenuation and contrast resolution.

### Bone mineral density in sclerosteosis; affected individuals and gene carriers [^116izwph]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Sclerosteosis is an autosomal recessive sclerosing bone disorder due to deficiency of sclerostin, a protein secreted by the osteocytes that inhibits bone formation. In the present study we assessed the effect of variable expression of the genetic defect on bone mineral density (BMD) in patients and carriers of the determinant gene.

Methods

We studied 25 individuals (seven patients and 18 phenotypically normal heterozygotes). BMD was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine, total hip, and distal forearm, and lateral radiographs of the skull were obtained.

Results

Individuals with sclerosteosis had markedly increased BMD at all skeletal sites (Z-score ranges: lumbar spine, +7.73 to +14.43; total hip, +7.84 to +11.51; forearm, +4.44 to +9.53). In heterozygotes, BMD was above the mean value of healthy age-matched individuals at all skeletal sites and had a wide range of normal and clearly increased values. Skull radiographs showed the typical hyperostotic changes in affected individuals and mild or no changes in heterozygotes.

Conclusions

Heterozygous carriers of sclerosteosis have BMD values consistently higher than the mean of healthy subjects without any of the bone complications encountered in homozygotes. This finding suggests that the production and/or activity of sclerostin can be titrated in vivo, leading to variable increases in bone mass without any unwanted skeletal effects, a hypothesis of obvious significance for the development of new therapeutics for osteoporosis.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1165MgyM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease of bone — monitoring response, remission targets, relapse assessment, and monostotic disease guidance includes that if there is urgency in the control of symptoms or the disease is particularly active, we suggest the use of short-term response of bone resorption markers before and shortly after treatment to indicate that an adequate therapeutic response is likely; we suggest that patients who have osteolytic lesions have a repeat x-ray approximately 1 year after radiological diagnosis, with subsequent x-rays considered in the event of persistent elevations of biochemical markers of bone turnover or the presence of bone pain and to determine when there is resolution of the lesion; to maximize the duration of remission, we suggest that bone turnover should be reduced below the midpoint of the reference range for the chosen monitoring bone turnover marker; in patients with increased bone turnover, we recommend that biochemical follow-up be used as a more objective indicator of relapse than symptoms; and for untreated monostotic disease, we suggest that amino-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP) or bone-specific ALP (BSAP) and βCterminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (βCTx) or N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (NTx) should be used for assessing activity, although these may be normal when evidence of disease activity is still clearly demonstrated on scintigraphy.

Detection of prostate cancer bone lesions with [18F]fluciclovine PET — adjunct imaging guidance: [18F]Fluciclovine accumulates in osteolytic and osteosclerotic lesions, typically with intense focal uptake in lytic osseous metastases and variable activity in sclerotic lesions. Because dense sclerotic lesions may show mild to no uptake, supplemental skeletal‑specific imaging is recommended for suspicious sclerotic lesions on CT without [18F]fluciclovine activity, and [18F]fluciclovine PET is not recommended as a replacement for bone scintigraphy or 18F‑NaF PET/CT.

### Role of diagnostic imaging in psoriatic arthritis: how, when, and why [^1142ctWb]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

MRI is highly sensitive in detecting articular, periarticular, and soft tissue inflammation. However, signs of inflammation such as synovitis, tenosynovitis and bone marrow edema, are not specific for PsA. Clinical usefulness of MRI in PsA relies on the assessment of inflammation and structural damage of PsA. Distinction between active lesions and chronic lesions is essential for an accurate management of patient's disease. Future imaging studies need to define the threshold for clinically significant inflammatory findings.

Detection on MRI of inflammation of entheses in joints felt to be clinically not inflamed, suggest that enthesitis may be the primary lesion in PsA, although this interpretation is controversial. In the spine there are fibrous entheses, at the insertion of Sharpey's fibers to the vertebral end plate (membranous bone). Imaging of early changes, as subentheseal bone marrow, is only achieved by MRI. One of the earliest signs in the spine of inflammatory spondyloarthritis is Romanus lesion. It is characterized by inflammatory changes at the insertion of the annulus of the disk to the vertebral endplate like a fibrous enthesitis. This is more often seen anteriorly but can also be posterior or a combination of both. The changes seen are progressive (Fig. 7), beginning with acute inflammatory change and erosion at the vertebral body corners (low T1 and high T2 signal), replaced by fatty signal (high T1 and T2 signal) and eventually sclerosis (low T1 and T2). Bennett and colleagues described the fatty signal Romanus lesions in the spine, and they suggest may be the post-inflammatory phase between osteitis on MRI and sclerotic bone formation on radiographs. This healing response to these inflammatory erosions appears radiographically as reactive sclerosis, which is known as the "shiny corner" sign. Just as MR imaging is better than conventional radiography in its depiction of Romanus lesions, MR imaging also provides a superior view of spondylodiscitis, since the edematous changes in early disease are not radiographically visualized.

### Pitfalls in the diagnosis of common benign bone tumours in children [^114RB8BC]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Osteoid osteoma

Osteoid osteoma is one of the most identifiable benign bone tumours when its clinical and radiological presentations are typical. It is classically a cortical lesion, located in the diaphysis or metaphysis of long bones, the femoral neck being the most common location. However it may be subperiosteal, endosteal or medullary, with most authors considering these locations to result from migration from the typical cortical origin.

The tumour is represented by a lucent nidus of vascular osteoid tissue, containing a dense sequestrum-like fragment. The absence of this dense fragment does not exclude the diagnosis (Fig. 15a–c). The central nidus, which may vary in size from a few mm to 1.5 cm, is surrounded by reactive periosteal new bone formation, which may sometimes be very dense and hide the nidus.

Fig. 15
Osteoid osteoma of the antero-lateral tibial shaft: Frontal (a) and lateral (b) X-rays of the left tibia: osteosclerotic thickening of the antero-medial diaphyseal cortex. c Axial CT slice of the tibial shaft identifies a small lucent nidus (arrow) within the intense sclerotic cortical proliferation

Although MRI and bone scans are useful to detect an anomaly, the inflammatory changes may sometimes be too diffuse and a small nidus overlooked. The most adequate technique to correctly identify the nidus is CT (Fig. 15c), which is also used subsequently to guide radiofrequency ablation therapy.

Despite the clear-cut imaging aspects in typical cases, the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma can be very challenging whenever the dense sclerotic reaction is absent or minimal. This occurs especially in the case of intra- or juxta-articular osteoid osteomas (which are often superiosteal or intramedullary). Because of the proximity to the joint, the inflammatory reaction can be so rich and the production of bone so slight that the nidus is hard to identify (Fig. 16a–e). Unexplained persistent inflammatory arthritis, resistant to treatment, should prompt the clinician and the radiologist to consider the possibility of an occult osteoid osteoma.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: treatment of metastatic carcinoma and myeloma of the femur [^1144LY6L]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Imaging findings and atypical fractures — in the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that imaging findings of lateral cortical thickening may be associated with increased atypical femur fracture risk (Strength of Recommendation: Consensus). Atypical femur fracture (AFF) radiographs typically show thickening of the lateral cortex ("beaking") in the subtrochanteric or diaphyseal femur, and a transverse radiolucency through the lateral thickening is concerning for impending fracture and is sometimes referred to as the "dreaded black line"; in 70% of patients, fracture is preceded by prodromal thigh pain. The incidence of atypical femur fractures in one large population study was 55 per 100,000 person-years, compared with 1 per 100,000 person-years in bisphosphonate-naive patients, yet an estimated 162 osteoporosis-related fractures are prevented for every 1 AFF that may be associated with antiresorptive treatment. Reported risk modifiers include that Asians may be up to 8 times more at risk for AFF than whites and that concurrent use of glucocorticoids is associated with increased risk of AFF. Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry Images (DEXA) scanning has been shown to be effective in screening for lateral cortical thickening, and because one retrospective review noted a 40% of AFFs occur in the diaphysis, it is important that screening DEXA scans are extended to include the diaphysis.

### [F] fluciclovine PET / CT: joint EANM and SNMMI procedure guideline for prostate cancer imaging-version 1.0 [^111ewvDy]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2020). High credibility.

[18F]Fluciclovine PET/CT — bone uptake interpretation and pitfalls state that focal uptake clearly present on MIP or PET images is considered suspicious for malignancy, and lytic lesions tend to have greater uptake than sclerotic lesions. If a suspicious abnormality is seen on CT such as sclerosis without uptake, this could represent a false negative finding and further evaluation with alternative imaging modalities should be considered (MRI, NaF(18F) PET/CT, conventional bone scan SPECT/CT, or PSMA if approved for use). Compared with FDG, [18F]Fluciclovine has greater physiologic bone marrow heterogeneity, and increased uptake in the bone may be present after trauma (including compression fractures). Areas of normal bone marrow regeneration may also show increased physiologic uptake; consider MRI if no clear CT correlate.

Abstract

A 66-year-old man was referred to our hospital due to a newly discovered left chest wall mass, which was diagnosed as plasmacytoma on biopsy. The patient underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning before treatment. PET imaging revealed intense FDG signal in osseous lesions, and the CT showed most of the lesions were osteoblastic. The osseous lesions were predominantly localized to the humerus, femur, tibia, and phalanx of toe.

### "Do-not-touch" lesions of bone revisited [^115KNMft]. Clinical Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Incidental bone lesions are encountered frequently in day-to-day practice. Many of these lesions are indeterminate requiring referral to specialist centres for further characterisation with or without biopsy; however, as biopsy has its own drawbacks, not all lesions can be subjected to biopsy. The primary role of a radiologist in these situations is to characterise these lesions based on their imaging appearances into aggressive lesions requiring biopsy and non-aggressive lesions that do not require a biopsy. The term "do-not-touch lesion" is used to describe a lesion with typical radiographic appearances that can be characterised based on radiographic appearances alone without needing a biopsy. With recent advances in imaging, many incidental lesions can be characterised into do-not-touch lesions based on their imaging appearances alone using a single imaging technique or using a combination of imaging techniques and, less frequently, with the additional help of serological investigations, without the need for biopsy. Hence, the definition of do-not-touch lesions of bone needs a revisit. In this article, we attempt to redefine do-not-touch lesions of bone and propose an imaging-based classification for characterisation of these lesions.

### Advanced CT bone imaging in osteoporosis [^112KFXgc]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

High-resolution CT

Another area of active research is high-resolution CT (hrCT). As described above, modern CT scanners for measurements of the axial skeleton offer isotropic spatial resolution of ∼0.5 mm. Although requiring increased radiation dose compared with vQCT, current spiral CT scanners can provide higher resolution, thin slice images, which allow better depiction of trabecular and cortical morphology, and provide improved assessment of skeletal fragility. However, given typical dimensions of trabeculae (100–400 μm) and trabecular spaces (200–2000 μm) this resolution is still borderline for a direct determination of trabecular architecture. Due to substantial partial volume artefacts, the extraction of the quantitative structural information is difficult (Fig. 3) and the results vary substantially according to the threshold and image processing techniques used. Instead of measuring structural parameters directly there is a tendency to use textural or statistical descriptors to characterize the trabecular architecture without requiring stringent segmentation of the individual trabeculae.

F. 3.
Example of image processing of hrCT images. Trabecular structure can be approximated if individual trabeculae are well separated. The upper left shows the original hrCT spine image, followed on the lower left by the 'binarized' and 'skeletonized' image processed into single-pixel-thick trabeculae displayed in white against black of the surrounding marrow and followed on the right by a 'colourized' version for which quantitative image processing can be undertaken.

Older techniques used, for instance, the trabecular fragmentation index (length of the trabecular network divided by the number of discontinuities), run-length analysis, a parameter reflecting trabecular hole area, analogous to star volume and co-occurrence texture measures. Newer approaches prefer grey-level analyses and use, for example, Minkowsky functionals or Gabor wavelets to quantify trabecular topology. Recently, structural parameters of the spine were analysed in a longitudinal in vivo study of PTH. In the treated group, all structural variables showed significant improvements with some independence from BMD. In a different cross-sectional study, vertebral trabecular structure parameters measured with hrCT could better distinguish between fractured cases and non-fractured controls than BMD measurements with DXA.

### Update on the medical management of fibrous dysplasia of the bone [^111QEZu3]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Initial diagnosis

The WHO classification of soft tissue and bone tumors defines FD as: (1) a bone lesion with compatible imaging characteristics (ground glass trabecular expansion of bone), (2) an osseous portion consisting of irregular curvilinear branching trabeculae of woven bone without apparent osteoblastic rimming on histopathology, and (3) a fibrous portion consisting of bland fibroblasts on histopathology. The presence of an activating GNAS mutation within the bone lesion provides additional confirmatory evidence of FD; however, the diagnosis of FD is frequently made on the basis of radiographic findings, without the need for biopsy. Classic radiographic features of FD include an expansile, well-defined intramedullary lesion with a ground glass appearance, cystic, sclerotic, or mixed cystic–sclerotic features, and cortical thinning with or without cortical breakthrough(Figure 1). While many of these features can be confirmed on X-ray, computed tomography (CT) is the imaging modality of choice when diagnosing FD lesions.– Lesions that may have radiographic similarities to FD include ossifying fibromas, osteofibrous dysplasia, giant cell tumors, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and aneurysmal bone cysts. In cases for which the diagnosis remains uncertain based on radiographic or clinical features, or when there is concern for underlying malignancy, a biopsy may be performed for histologic and genetic analysis testing for causative GNAS mutations. Several look-alikes of FD, including osteofibrous lesionsand fibrocartilaginous dysplasia, which has recently been classified as a form of FD, may be more accurately diagnosed on genetic testing of the lesion.

Careful staging of FD is necessary at the time of diagnosis to identify other potential sites of skeletal involvement. Nuclear medicine studies, such as 99 mTc-MDP bone scans or X-ray skeletal surveys, can help identify the distribution of FD lesions. Monostotic FD is the most common form of FD, accounting for 70%–80% of all cases. Polyostotic FD is often associated with syndromic conditions such as McCune–Albright or Mazabraud syndromes, the management of which is outside the scope of this review but are covered in the treatment guidelines. All patients with FD should be screened for endocrinopathies that are associated with MAS, as this can have a significant impact on their bone health and disease course(Figure 2).

Hormone signaling in multiple organ systems have been found to impact FD lesion growth. Therapeutic strategies targeting these systems may be helpful in controlling FD.

Extremities

The overall pattern was one of sclerosis focused primarily on the metaphyses that also were expanded (Fig. 4).

Tubulation failure was best seen in the distal femurs (Fig. 4 A, B). By 33 months, this expansion extended almost to the midshafts. The expansion, which was greatest in the metaphyses, extended into the diaphyses and from sclerotic bone into nonsclerotic bone. Between the ages of 7 and 43 months, the dense sclerosis at the ends of the bones increased appreciably in length. Some areas of metaphyseal sclerosis were sharply demarcated at the diaphysis, whereas others appeared to fade into more normal-appearing bone. There was a healing fracture in the distal left femur at the junction of the sclerotic and nonsclerotic bone, shown by periosteal new bone formation and focal expansion of the bone (Fig. 4 A). The rate at which extremity fractures healed was delayed. Fractures continued to occur. Transverse lucent areas that were small and faint were seen in the dense sclerosis of some metaphyses, such as the distal femur (Fig. 4 E).

In the proximal end of the humeral metaphyses and both distal radii and ulnas, between 7 and 33 months of age, there were well-demarcated areas of dense sclerosis that increased in length (Fig. 4 C, D). The junctions between the sclerotic and nonsclerotic bone were varied, being transverse, oblique, and rounded. The cortices in the midshafts were thickened. The proximal humeri and the distal radii and ulnas showed best the irregularity of the provisional zones of calcification at the physeal plates (Fig. 4 C, D). The epiphyses were sclerotic.

### SKIBO diseases: a concept to avoid bloody diagnostic procedures in ambiguous skeletal lesions [^1125WHiH]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

In cases with an "atypical" radiologic pattern-osteolytic as well as osteosclerotic or mixed - the radiologist should pay attention to the patient's skin. There he will often find specific changes that are the key to a correct interpretation of the radiologic abnormalities. In such cases the synopsis is of more value in differential diagnosis than more or less unspecific histologic findings. Entities with a non-arbitrary conjunction of changes of the skin and bones we call SKIBO diseases. Some of them have a high potential for mimicking malignant bone lesions, often with the consequence of unnecessary biopsies. In this article we present the typical dermatologic and radiologic signs and symptoms of neurofibromatosis, sarcoidosis and pustulotic arteroosteitis (PAO) with special focus on such skeletal lesions that may mimic malignancy.

### CT temporal subtraction method for detection of sclerotic bone metastasis in the thoracolumbar spine [^113cfC56]. European Journal of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the effectiveness of a CT temporal subtraction (TS) method on radiologists' performance in sclerotic metastasis detection in the thoracolumbar spine.

Materials and Methods

20 pairs (current and previous CTs) of standard-dose CT and their TS images in patients with sclerotic bone metastasis and 20 pairs (current and previous CTs) of those in patients without bone metastasis were used for an observer performance study. A total of 135 lesions were identified as the reference standard of actionable lesions (sclerotic metastasis newly appeared or increased in size or in attenuation). 4 attending radiologists and 4 radiology residents participated in this observer study. Ratings and locations of "lesions" determined by the observers were utilized for assessing the statistical significance of differences between radiologists' performances without and with the CT-TS images in JAFROC analysis. The statistical significance of differences in the reviewing time was determined by a two-tailed paired t-test.

Results

The average figure-of-merit (FOM) values for all but one radiologist increased to a statistically significant degree, from 0.856 without the CT-TS images to 0.884 with the images (P = 0.037). The average sensitivity for detecting the actionable lesions was improved from 60.7% to 72.5% at a false-positive rate of 0.15 per case by use of the CT-TS images. The average reading time with CT-TS images was significantly shorter than that without (150.6s vs. 166.5s, P = 0.004).

Conclusion

The use of CT-TS would improve the observer performance for the detection of the sclerotic bone metastasis in the thoracolumbar spine.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: systemic mastocytosis, version 3.2024 [^113FpKJC]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Systemic mastocytosis — imaging and bone assessment: Imaging studies (CT/MRI or ultrasound of the abdomen/pelvis) are useful to document organomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and ascites in patients with advanced SM, and chest x-ray and/or CT of the thorax may be needed to assess pleural effusions in symptomatic patients; C-findings should be confirmed with appropriate organ-directed biopsy with IHC (CD117, CD25, tryptase, and CD3 as a control T-cell marker). Osteoporosis and osteopenia are the most common bone complications in patients with SM; the risk of osteoporosis and vertebral fractures is high in ISM, higher urinary N-methylhistamine levels are associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis, and in advanced SM increased bone mineral density is associated with a more aggressive phenotype and inferior survival. Skeletal involvement with large (≥ 2 cm) osteolytic lesions with or without pathologic fractures is considered a C-finding, but one or more small osteolytic and/or sclerotic lesion(s) without other C-findings is insufficient to diagnose advanced SM and should not alone indicate cytoreductive therapy. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) to evaluate osteopenia/osteoporosis and consideration of a metastatic skeletal survey to evaluate osteolytic lesions are recommended as part of the initial workup for ISM and SSM, while whole body MRI for osteolytic lesions is still research-based.

### Low-dose CT hounsfield units: a reliable methodology for assessing vertebral bone density in radiographic axial spondyloarthritis [^114nbQ22]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we cross-sectionally tested a methodology for assessing bone density of the whole spine in patients with r-axSpA, using vertebral HU measured on ldCT scans. HU measurements were proven to be feasible with excellent inter-reader reliability at the vertebral level, from C3 to L5.

LdCT HU values were higher in the cervical vertebrae and decreased throughout the spine, with the lowest values obtained for the lumbar vertebrae. Lower HU values represent a lower ldCT attenuation. Thus, less-dense bones will likely have lower HU values. The gradient of HU is also in line with previous results in different populations (trauma patients or general population), and with findings in histomorphometry analysis of intervertebral variation in trabecular microarchitecture throughout the normal spine. The analysis of excised vertebral bodies of the complete spine (C3 to L5) in 26 autopsy cases revealed a significant intervertebral variation of trabecular microarchitecture. The density of the trabecular structure of cervical vertebrae was shown to be much higher than that of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Remarkably, the structural differences between lumbar spine at one end and cervical spine on the other end of the spine were shown to increase with age, bone mass decreasing faster caudally than cranially within spinal vertebrae. The rationale behind these differences, although poorly studied, might be due to the high dynamic forces of which cervical vertebrae are exposed to because of their mobility and small size.

Notwithstanding, in the present study, the vertebral HU values for patients with r-axSpA were on average, and for all spinal segments, lower than what was previously presented in stratified data for similar age and gender general populations. These results may indicate that, in r-axSpA, bone loss is likely locally present throughout the whole spine and not predominantly in the lumbar spine, the latter more consistent with biological systemic bone loss. Although data in other fields suggested that low-dose and standard CT scans yield equivalent HU measurements, caution is needed when comparing HU measured by different CT techniques.

Negative HU values were observed in seven vertebrae, corresponding to two patients in which medullar fat infiltration was present. These vertebrae likely do not have a major influence on the lower mean HU values. On the contrary, sclerotic lesions, were rather more frequent throughout the spine and could have slightly falsely increased the HU. In the current analysis, we decided not to exclude vertebrae with artefacts, as those are relevant for the reliability analysis.

### Radiographic findings in bisphosphonate-treated patients with stage 0 disease in the absence of bone exposure [^115wWnLe]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Radiographic features in patients with bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) are well described, but less is known in bisphosphonate-exposed individuals with stage 0 disease (clinical symptoms without exposed necrotic bone) considered at risk for BRONJ. We sought to characterize radiographic findings in a subgroup of patients with concerning clinical symptoms and bisphosphonate exposure to identify imaging features that may presage development of BRONJ.

Materials and Methods

A dental symptom survey was returned by 8,572 Kaiser Permanente Health Plan members receiving chronic oral bisphosphonate therapy, and 1,005 patients reporting pertinent dental symptoms or complications after dental procedures were examined. Those without BRONJ but with concerning symptoms were referred for clinical evaluation, including imaging. Among the subset who received maxillofacial imaging, we identified those with stage 0 disease and abnormal radiographic features.

Results

There were a total of 30 patients without exposed bone but with concerning symptoms who received maxillofacial imaging (panoramic radiography or computed tomography) in the context of clinical care. Among these 30 patients, 10 had stage 0 disease with similar radiographic features of regional or diffuse osteosclerosis in clinically symptomatic areas, most with extension beyond the involved site. Other findings in these 10 patients included density confluence of cortical and cancellous bone, prominence of the inferior alveolar nerve canal, markedly thickened and sclerotic lamina dura, uniform periradicular radiolucencies, cortical disruption, lack of bone fill after extraction, and a persisting alveolar socket. None had exposed bone develop during 1-year follow-up. The remaining 20 patients had normal or localized radiographic findings consistent with odontogenic pathology.

Conclusion

In 10 of 30 symptomatic patients referred for clinical evaluation and imaging, a consistent finding was conspicuous osteosclerosis in clinically symptomatic areas characteristic of stage 0 disease. These data support the need to better understand radiographic features associated with bisphosphonate exposure and to determine whether osteosclerosis is a specific finding indicative of the risk for progression to BRONJ.

### Tc-99m HDP bone scan showing bone changes in a case of tuberous sclerosis or Bourneville's disease [^114NrRyC]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Whole-body Tc-99m HDP scintigraphy was performed in a 25-year-old woman with known tuberous sclerosis. The scintigraphic pattern showed multiple foci of abnormal activity over the hands, phalanges, feet, tibias, fibulas, ulnas, and radii, where radiographs showed periosteal apposition, irregular cortical thickening, and cystlike lesions on the phalanges. The spine, pelvis, and ribs showed heterogeneous tracer uptake where radiographs showed patchy areas of increased bone density. This radiographic pattern is characteristic of osseous tuberous sclerosis. Although previous reports suggested the opposite conclusion, this observation indicates that an abnormal result of bone scintiscan can be observed in osseous tuberous sclerosis.

### Increasing bone sclerosis during bortezomib therapy in multiple myeloma patients: results of a reduced-dose whole-body MDCT study [^114BMFtP]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of our study was to assess the frequency, location, extent, and patterns of bone sclerosis occurring in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) during bortezomib-based therapy.

Materials and Methods

From June 2003 through December 2011, 593 whole-body reduced-dose MDCT studies were performed of 79 consecutive patients receiving bortezomib. The median surveillance time was 21 months (range, 3–67 months). Baseline studies were compared with follow-up studies during therapy (follow-up 1), at the end of therapy (follow-up 2), and 12 months after cessation of bortezomib therapy (follow-up 3). We recorded any sclerotic change occurring inside or along the margins of the osteolytic lesions, in the cancellous bone, or inside preexistent medullary or extramedullary lesions. The time point of occurrence of bone sclerosis was correlated with the best hematologic response category.

Results

Fourteen (17.7%) patients developed focal (n = 11) or diffuse (n = 3) bone sclerosis. The time window from bortezomib initiation to radiographic detection of bone sclerosis was 8 months (SD, 7 months). Sclerosis occurred at multiple sites (n = 7) or at an isolated site (n = 7). On subsequent whole-body reduced-dose MDCT studies, sclerosis further increased in seven (50%) patients. Hematologic best response during bortezomib treatment was complete response (n = 1), very good partial response (n = 2), partial response (n = 8), and stable disease (n = 3). Radiologic response at the time of sclerosis detection was partial response (n = 8), stable disease (n = 2), and progressive disease (n = 4).

Conclusion

Bone remineralization may occur during bortezomib-based therapy for MM in a substantial proportion of patients. The extent, location, and patterns of sclerosis differ among patients and are unpredictable. Sclerosis was documented even in patients showing suboptimal hematologic response.

### SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for palliative nuclear medicine therapies of bone metastases [^113xH3p6]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2023). High credibility.

Palliative nuclear medicine therapies of bone metastases — patient preparation states that prior to administration of 89Sr-chloride, 153Sm-EDTMP, or 223Ra-Cl2, the patient should have a recent radionuclide bone scan to demonstrate osteoblastic metastases (within 3 months is preferred), and a bone scan must be used to verify that sclerotic lesions on radiograph or CT have increased radiotracer uptake; osteolytic metastases should be further characterized with a bone scan, and for 223Ra-Cl2, CT of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis should be obtained to exclude visceral disease. Bone scintigraphic abnormalities should be correlated with appropriate physical examination and anatomic imaging to evaluate issues needing attention prior to radionuclide treatment; in such cases radionuclide therapies should be pursued only in conjunction with targeted therapy (local radiation or surgical treatment), and radionuclide therapies have no role in the treatment of acute presentations of these entities. Prior to therapy, clinicians should consider other sources of pain indicated by the patient's clinical history and physical examination. Given the potential treatment myelotoxicity, clinicians should discontinue myelosuppressive chemotherapy in anticipation of 89Sr-chloride, 153Sm-EDTMP, or 223Ra-Cl2 treatment (6–8 weeks for long-acting myelosuppressive chemotherapy and ~4 weeks for other myelosuppressive chemotherapy). Concomitant treatment with 89Sr-chloride, 153Sm-EDTMP, or 223Ra-Cl2 and external beam hemi-body radiation should be considered with caution as data describing combined adverse effects are lacking, and the potential for overlapping myelotoxicity from these treatments should be considered.

### Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis in neuroradiology-behavior and evolution of vertebral and mandibular lesions on imaging [^114CzNnz]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

CNO lesions most frequently affect the metaphysis of long bones, especially within the lower extremities. The pelvis and clavicles are also often involved. Vertebral lesions are variably reported in the literature, ranging from 8 to 38%. Mandibular involvement reports range from 2 to 21%. Clinically silent bone lesions can occur and may affect vertebral bodies, which is relevant given that the most common complications of CNO include platyspondyly and vertebral pathological fractures, which may be present in about 10% of patients at the time of diagnosis. The number of lesions at initial onset is quite variable, and if unifocal lesions are present, the clavicle and mandible are most likely affected.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive imaging modality for CNO lesions, permitting a better visualization of the inflammatory changes in bony structures and surrounding soft tissues, which are the most typical findings of CNO. MRI can also detect sequelae of past CNO lesions, like bone marrow adipose substitution or sclerosis. For these reasons, whole-body MRI is considered the gold standard for imaging, providing information on the distribution of lesions. Classic radiographs can be used as a fast initial screening method, detecting not only bone sclerosis and cortical thickening, but also other abnormalities in more severe cases, like sequestrum (a piece of de-vascularized bone that becomes separated from the remainder of the bone in osteomyelitis), bone destruction, and cortical erosion. For the spine, radiographs can be particularly useful in screening for vertebral body lesions with height loss. Despite this, classic radiographs may not detect early inflammatory changes, potentially delaying diagnosis. Bone scintigraphy shows abnormal tracer uptake in active and recovering lesions, even if clinically silent. Although this could be useful for screening clinically silent lesions where MRI is unavailable, scintigraphy requires radiation exposure and is less sensitive than MRI. Computed tomography (CT) also involves radiation exposure but may be complementary to MRI for better characterizing bony lesions, and better depicting mixed lytic and sclerotic changes, periosteal reaction, bony expansion, and possible fractures.

### A new familial sclerosing bone dysplasia [^114qbX44]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Osteoscleroses are a heterogeneous group of bone remodeling disorders characterized by an increase in bone density. Here we report on a consanguineous Lebanese family in which two sisters, aged 39 and 36 years, exhibit a severe genu varum, a square-face appearance, high forehead, slight proptosis of the eyes, symmetric enlargement of the jaw, protruding chin, and short stature. Bone X-rays showed the presence of hyperostosis of the cranial base and vault with increased density of the orbits, hyperostosis of the bones, thickening of the cortices, diaphyseal modeling defects, cortical thickening of the medullary cavity, mild enlargement of the medullary cavity of the short long bones, short femoral necks, increased width of the ribs, and narrow interpedicular distances of the lower lumbar spine. Osteodensitometry showed values 200% to 300% above values for age. A cervical MRI revealed the presence of a diffuse osteosclerosis with calcification of the posterior vertebral ligament and a narrow canal between C2 and T2. Blood test results were unremarkable. Serum osteocalcin levels were in the normal range, whereas high values of serum C-telopeptide were noted. A bone biopsy showed only the presence of compact bone and did not allow for histomorphometric analysis. Molecular studies excluded genes known to be involved in sclerosing bone dysplasias as the cause of this condition. In vitro analysis of osteoclast function indicated that contrary to most cases of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis, osteoclasts both formed and resorbed but exhibited a small decrease in resorptive activity compared with osteoclasts generated from normal control individuals. Differential diagnoses are discussed, and the possibility that this may be a novel clinical entity is raised.

### Skeletal involvement in Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^114C8WtN]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Imaging features of skeletal involvement

The radiographic appearance of the lesions depends on the site of involvement and the phase of the disease. The axial skeleton (skull, spine, scapula, and pelvis) and the long bones are more commonly affected. Bone involvement usually presents as a single or multiple osteolytic lesions, round or oval-shaped. Their border can appear either well or poorly defined (Fig. 5). Such an osseous involvement is very similar to that of multiple myeloma in adults. In LCH, however, periosteal reaction may be associated with osseous lesions. When present, periostitis demonstrates the appearance of a single layer of periosteal bone or a more suggestive buttressed pattern (Fig. 6). During the healing phase, sclerotic margins appear but sclerosis is usually limited. Lesions can eventually completely disappear, with no or little deformity (Fig. 7). CT and MR features are non-specific but an extensive bone marrow oedema is usually seen around bone lesions on MRI (Fig. 8).

Fig. 4
Axial FDG-PET/CT fusion images in a 71-year-old female showing elevated metabolic activity and medullary sclerosis in the long bones of the distal lower limbs (arrows)

Osteosclerosis is the most common manifestation of this disease, but rarely there is a mixed pattern with lytic and sclerotic lesions, hindering the differential diagnosis with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and Paget's disease. Nevertheless, in LCH, the presence of sharply defined lytic lesions in the axial skeleton, namely in the spine, skull and mandible, is characteristic, and in Paget's disease, areas beyond the axial skeleton are quite often affected; the involvement of the appendicular skeleton is often asymmetric.

Taking into account the age group and the sclerotic bone changes, myelofibrosis, renal osteodystrophy, osteoblastic metastases and chronic focal osteomyelitis are acquired syndromes that may mimick ECD radiographically, thus being very important in the clinical and laboratory test correlation for making the correct diagnosis.

Other differential diagnoses of bone disease include hereditary sclerosing bone disease, namely progressive diaphyseal dysplasia, characterised by endosteal and periosteal thickening and narrowing of the marrow cavity, and intramedullary osteosclerosis, which shows unilateral or bilateral asymmetric endosteal thickening confined to the diaphysis of the long bones. However, these are usually detected in young people.

### From the archives of the AFIP. radiologic spectrum of paget disease of bone and its complications with pathologic correlation [^116YfoCp]. Radiographics (2002). Low credibility.

Paget disease of bone is a common disorder affecting approximately 3%-4% of the population over 40 years of age. The pathologic abnormality in Paget disease is excessive and abnormal remodeling of bone. Three pathologic phases have been described: the lytic phase (incipient-active), in which osteoclasts predominate; the mixed phase (active), in which osteoblasts cause repair superimposed on the resorption; and the blastic phase (late-inactive) in which osteoblasts predominate. Radiographic appearance of Paget disease reflects these pathologic changes and is often characteristic. Initially, there is osteolysis, particularly affecting the skull (osteoporosis circumscripta) and subchondral long bones, with subsequent development of trabecular and cortical thickening and enlargement of bone in the mixed phase of the disease. Finally, areas of sclerosis may develop in the blastic phase. Frequent sites of involvement include the skull (25%-65% of cases), spine (30%-75%), pelvis (30%-75%), and proximal long bones (25%-30%). Bone scintigraphy typically demonstrates marked increased uptake of radionuclide in all phases of Paget disease. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging often show changes similar to those seen radiographically in noncomplicated Paget disease with maintenance of yellow marrow. Complications of Paget disease include the effects of osseous weakening (deformity and fracture), arthritis, neurologic symptoms, and neoplastic involvement. Sarcomatous transformation is the most feared complication, occurring in approximately 1% of cases, and is seen on images as focal bone destruction extending through the cortex with an associated soft-tissue mass. Recognition of the radiologic spectrum of the appearances of Paget disease usually allows prospective diagnosis and differentiation of its associated complications, which helps guide therapy and improve patient management.

### Bone up on spinal osseous lesions: a case review series [^113bLwsm]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Osteoblastoma

Osteoblastoma and osteoid osteoma are both benign osteogenic tumors that produce osteoid and woven bone. About 30–50% of all osteoblastoma occur along the spine. Osteoblastoma is most commonly seen in children, in the second and third decades, with a 2:1 male to female predominance. Patients typically present with dull, localized pain, as opposed to intense night pain seen with osteoid osteomas. Unlike osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma often presents with neurologic symptoms. Histologically, osteoblastoma is similar to osteoid osteoma but less organized. It is typically larger than osteoid osteoma (> 1.5 to 2 cm in diameter).

On CT imaging, osteoblastoma has three typical appearances. The most common appearance is that of an expansile lesion with multiple calcifications and a peripheral sclerotic rim. The second pattern is similar to an osteoid osteoma, with a lucent nidus surrounded by a rim of sclerosis; however, the key differentiating factor between these two is size, with osteoblastoma typically larger than 2 cm. Osteoblastoma typically grows slowly; however, the third subgroup of osteoblastoma can have aggressive growth, making it difficult to distinguish from osteosarcoma. These appear as aggressive lesions, with destructive changes, soft tissue infiltration, mimicking chondrosarcoma, or osteosarcoma on imaging.

### POEMS syndrome: clinical update [^11687Kwn]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sclerotic bone lesions

POEMS syndrome is associated with predominantly osteosclerotic bone lesions, which can have mixed sclerotic-lytic components, and are also referred to as osteosclerotic myeloma. Lesions are often small, and multiple; in a study of 28 patients undergoing chest and abdominal CT imaging, 68% of patients had multiple bone lesions, with 146 lesions identified in total, 97% reported as sclerotic, and 71% < 10 mm in diameter. Further imaging by 99m Tc-HMDP bone scintigraphy enabled the pick-up of additional lesions in the skull and long bones, not in the field of view of CT, demonstrating a benefit from imaging the complete skeleton, and of using dual imaging modalities. 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging can also aid diagnosis and help identify lesions suitable for biopsy. Lesions are commonly found in the pelvis, thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, and ribs, and also occur in the scapula, clavicle, sternum, skull and long bones.

Vascular endothelial growth factor

Elevated VEGF is highly specific for POEMS syndrome (though not pathognomonic) and thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of systemic features including organomegaly and volume overload. Serum VEGF levels reflect disease activity, falling with treatment and rising with disease progression or relapse. Monitoring VEGF levels may be useful as a disease prognostic marker; Misawa et al. showed that reduction in serum VEGF levels to within the normal range by 6-months post-treatment was associated with longer relapse-free survival and better outcomes.

Minor criteria

Organomegaly

Clinical and radiological studies have shown that imaging, particularly CT, has higher sensitivity in identifying organomegaly compared to clinical examination. In a retrospective cohort of 29 patients diagnosed with POEMS syndrome in India between 1983 and 2009, all had organomegaly, including hepatomegaly (28/29), splenomegaly (21/29) and lymphadenopathy (7/29). The reporting of organomegaly is variable, however, and is lower in other cohorts.

Extravascular volume overload

Fluid overload may present peripherally or centrally. In a study of 91 patients undergoing 18 FDG-PET CT, 46 had had serous cavity effusions, often affecting more than one cavity. The four most common sites were pleural, pelvic, pericardial and abdominal.

### Treatment of multiple myeloma: ASCO and CCO joint clinical practice guideline [^1129kbsu]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Imaging for myeloma bone disease — Recommendation 4.4 — specifies that whole-body low-dose computed tomography (WBCT) scan has been shown to be superior to skeletal survey with plain x-rays and is the preferred method for baseline and routine bone surveillance, with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acceptable as baseline alternatives and used in select situations (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; benefit outweighs harm; Strength of recommendation: moderate). Literature notes limited sensitivity of skeletal survey, as there must be 30% trabecular bone loss to detect lytic lesions and expert review found additional abnormalities in 23% of cases; modern techniques identified upwards of 80% more lesions, WBCT versus skeletal survey revealed up to 60% more relevant findings leading to treatment changes in up to 20% of patients, IMWG recommends WBCT as the standard diagnostic tool, MRI and FDG-PET/CT have been equivalent for detection rates, and in smoldering myeloma 30% to 50% of patients have bone marrow abnormalities on MRI.

### Imaging of Brown tumours: a pictorial review [^111uXi5V]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Imaging of skeletal involvement

Clinically, brown tumours present as a slow growing palpable bony swelling and may cause bone pain or pathological fractures. It is also possible to present with symptoms of weakness, weight loss, polyuria and recurrent stone formation associated with the hyperparathyroidism. The bone pain from the brown tumour is also comparatively milder than the radiological findings and malignant bone lesions. As a result, brown tumours are often incidental findings on plain radiograph or computed tomography (CT) for another indication. Dedicated CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often performed to assess the full extent of musculoskeletal involvement and to guide a bone biopsy if necessary. Previous case reports have identified that brown tumours are preferentially located in the mandible, ribs, clavicle and pelvis and rarely seen in the skull or associated with the nasal/paranasal sinuses. The radiological features of browns tumours in the reported cases mainly consisted of single or multiple well-defined osteolytic lesions, single or multi-lobular, usually with bone expansion and can demonstrate bony destruction and be associated with pathological fractures. There is also variability in its radiological characteristics, which can include an ill-defined lesion, mixed lytic/sclerotic lesion or margin, with adjacent soft tissue involvement. In these situations, a malignant lesion should be considered in the differential diagnosis and histologic confirmation is recommended. Further correlation with hypercalcaemia and hyperparathyroidism is also important because histologic differentiation between brown tumour and other giant cell-containing lesions can be difficult.

### Update on aneurysmal bone cyst: pathophysiology, histology, imaging and treatment [^111wxEHd]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Several classifications have been proposed based on natural history, activity and morphological appearance of ABC. In 1969, Dabska and Buraczewski were the first to reference the natural history of ABC by dividing the progression into four phases: (1) the initial osteolytic phase in which the cortices of the bone are involved with subtle periosteal reaction; (2) the growth phase characterized by progressive bone destruction with poor demarcation of the borders and no septations seen on radiographs, (3) the stabilization phase that leads to the typical ABC appearance of a well-defined, expansile lesion with sclerotic borders and internal septations and (4) the healing phase characterized by progressive ossification of the lesion.

In 1985, Capanna et al. proposed a very useful classification according to the tumor morphology that could be applied to the radiographic and gross specimen appearance. This classification divided ABC into five morphological subgroups (Fig. 1). Type I represents centrally located lesions that are well contained with no outline or slightly expanded outline (Fig. 2). These lesions are more often found in the short bones of the hand and feet. Type II comprises expansile tumors with cortical thinning involving the entire bone segment (Fig. 2). Type III represents the most common type, eccentric metaphyseal lesions, which typically involve only one cortex (Fig. 3). Type IV is the least common type of ABC. These lesions are subperiosteal and grow away from the bone. Type V corresponds to lesions based periosteally that expand peripherally and ultimately penetrate the underlying cortex (Fig. 4). In the same article, ABC was also classified based on the degree of activity in three distinct radiographic stages: (1) inactive when the tumor is contained and non-expansile, with internal septations, a sclerotic border and intact cortices; (2) active wherein the lesion becomes slightly symptomatic, as well as shows expansion, an indistinct border with cortical thinning and a distinct peripheral layer of reactive bone, and (3) aggressive when the tumor is most active and becomes rapidly expansile, causing destruction of the bone and extension into the surrounding tissues (Fig. 2).

Her BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at her first transplant in 2010, 8 months prior to parathyroidectomy in January 2018, 6 months after parathyroidectomy in March 2019 and at her 2nd transplant in March 2020 (Table 2). The trabecular bone score (TBS) and hip structural analysis (HSA) were also measured from DXA pre- and post-parathyroidectomy (Table 2). TBS is an indirect measure of cancellous bone microarchitectural integrity, and HSA provides information on cortical thickness at sites around the hip, and the buckling ratio (BR), calculated as the femoral neck radius divided by the femoral neck cortical thickness. Higher BR values are consistent with increased femoral neck instability.

### Assessment of therapeutic response in patients with metastatic skeletal disease: suggested modifications for the MDA response classification criteria [^113KhmTV]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

We would like to go a step further and comment on the MDA classification response criteria as it is our opinion that they may be improved by becoming more objective and accurate. Starting with the application of CT for assessing bone metastases, it would be very useful if the bone density in regions of metastases is measured in Hounsfield units (HU) after delineation of affected bone areas (region of interest technique, ROI). By comparing bone density measurements before, during and after treatment, researchers would be able to monitor changes of bone density objectively and follow the therapeutic response more accurately.

For osteolytic lesions an increase in bone density up to at least the level of bone density of neighbouring healthy bones would mean a complete response, whereas an increase in absolute numbers would indicate a partial response. In the case that bone density remains unaltered, stable disease should be considered. Finally, in the event that bone density decreases, disease progression should be indicated. In the case of osteoblastic lesions a decrease in bone density up to at least the level of bone density of neighbouring healthy bones would mean a complete response, whereas a reduction of bone density would mean a partial response. As in the case of lytic bone lesions, if bone density remains unchanged, stable disease should be considered, whereas when there is an increase in bone density, disease progression should be indicated. The MDA response criteria are not so objective as they are rather descriptive and do not use specific quantitative measurements. For example, a complete response is considered to be a 'normalisation of osteoblastic lesion' or a 'complete fill-in or sclerosis of a lytic lesion on CT'. A partial response is considered to be a 'partial fill-in or sclerosis of a lytic lesion on CT' or a 'regression of a measurable blastic lesion on CT', whereas in cases that no changes are observed on CT, stable disease is indicated.

### Enthesitis and dactylitis in psoriatic disease: a guide for dermatologists [^111dpU5n]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Conventional Radiography

Evidence of enthesitis by conventional radiography include bone cortex irregularities, erosions, entheseal soft tissue calcifications, and new bone formation, whereas signs of dactylitis include soft tissue swelling (Fig. 4 a). Entheseal bone changes detected with conventional radiography appear relatively late in the disease process. Furthermore, conventional radiography is not ideal for imaging the various tissue compartments affected in dactylitic digits, but can detect soft tissue swelling and underlying bone abnormalities (Fig. 4 b).

### The sclerotic vertebral body… [^111zKxFV]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Resnick D. The Sclerotic Vertebral Body. JAMA. 1983; 249: 1761–1763. doi: 10.1001/jama.1983.03330370071040 A VARIETY of disorders can produce increased radiodensity, or sclerosis, of one or more vertebral bodies. Such sclerosis can involve the entire vertebral body in a uniform fashion, the superior or inferior surface, or both, the vertebral margins, or the interior of the bone. In each instance, the resulting radiological image is distinctive and frequently allows a precise diagnosis to be offered. This communication emphasizes the radiological and gross pathological features of common disorders leading to sclerosis of the vertebral body. Uniform Sclerosis of Vertebral Body: The 'Ivory' Vertebra Uniformly distributed sclerosis of an entire vertebral body is termed the "ivory" vertebra1. The increase in radiodensity is commonly dramatic and may involve a single vertebral body or multiple vertebral bodies.

In some instances, the adjacent posterior elements of the vertebra, including the pedicles, laminae, and transverse and spinous processes, are also affected. The Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### 'Ivory vertebra' in Hodgkin's disease… [^116i8ucW]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

BONE involvement in Hodgkin's disease does not usually occur in its early stage. 1 The "ivory" appearance of the vertebra is the result of a purely sclerotic change in the bone. This occurs in 10% to 15% of cases. Local pain, when present, may disappear following radiation therapy. However, the response of the ivory vertebra to therapy has not received wide comment. We report the case of a patient with Hodgkin's disease who had an ivory vertebra. Following radiation therapy, the bone was completely restored to its normal architecture. Report of a Case A 23-year-old man had had back pain of several months' duration. Examination showed enlarged supraclavicular lymph glands. A biopsy specimen from a lymph gland showed nodular sclerotic Hodgkin's disease. A chest roentgenogram was normal. In May 1974, lymphangiography was performed. No pathologic findings were noted at that time. However, the 11th dorsal vertebra was found to be. Hertz M, Solomon A, Aghal E.

### Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy with systemic involvement… [^116cJWpz]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

We describe a patient with ESRD who rapidly developed clinically and histologically typical NFD associated with prominent soft tissue calcification. Autopsy findings suggest that systemic involvement can occur in NFD. Report of a case History. Physical examination Physical examination revealed a frail, fatigued white man who was not in acute distress. There were several very large, painful, firm, indurated plaques with irregular borders and peau d'orange textural changes along the dependent areas of posterior arms, buttocks, back, and posterior thighs with markedly decreased range of motion of all extremities. There was no ulceration. Deep incisional skin biopsy findings were consistent with NFD.

Despite a series of attempts to treat his condition with trials of hydroxychloroquine, prednisone, cyclosporine, psoralen–UV-A, and extracorporeal photopheresis in addition to zero-calcium dialysis, sevelamer hydrochloride, and physical therapy, the patient had progressive cutaneous disease with disabling limitation of movement, severe shortness of breath, and complete inability to perform the activities of daily living. An autopsy was performed. In addition to the cutaneous findings described previously, fibrosis and calcium deposition were present systemically. Gross examination of the internal organs demonstrated an indurated, gritty diaphragm. Microscopically, most of the diaphragm was replaced by fibrous tissue with extensive vascular and extravascular calcium deposition. Focal intimal calcifications were also present in the vessels of the lungs and kidneys.

Histologic sections of the rete testis and renal tubules showed extravascular calcium deposits. Other findings at autopsy included hyperplasia of 3 parathyroid glands, atherosclerosis, and markedly atrophic kidneys. The normal muscle of the diaphragm has been replaced by fibroblasts and collagen with marked calcium deposition. Comment Our patient with ESRD presented with diffuse indurated woody plaques, initially accentuated on dependent areas. Skin biopsy specimens showed focal dermal calcification and extensive fibrosis with increased dermal mucin histologically reminiscent of scleromyxedema. The patient had an elevated calcium-phosphate index and the skin changes were preceded by vascular rejection of a cadaveric renal transplant.

### A woman with blurred vision and distal paresthesias… [^113p3mcZ]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

A, Coronal computed tomographic image of the spine revealing sclerotic lesions at T5 and T9. B, Axial CT image highlighting the sclerotic lesion at T5. C, Bone marrow specimen from T5 vertebral body revealing an abnormally increased number of plasma cells. D-E, In situ hybridization of κ and λ light chains revealing an abnormal 1: 2 ratio of positivity. F, Axillary lymph node specimen with Castleman disease–like changes with an involuted germinal center, increased interfollicular distance, and increased vascular proliferation. In this patient, ANA test results were positive, but the EMG and NCS findings were not consistent with either of the above mentioned neuropathies seen in patients with lupus.

Weeks after her initial diagnostic evaluation, the patient was noted to have bilateral lower extremity edema and endorsed a few months of progressive skin hyperpigmentation on her face and distal extremities. Splenomegaly was identified on physical examination, measuring 18. 5 cm on computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Computed tomography also revealed anasarca and diffuse lymphadenopathy, but no nodes were hypermetabolic on follow-up positron emission tomography. Despite the lack of a serum or urine paraprotein and given the patient's unique EMG and NCS findings and multiorgan involvement, a serum vascular endothelial growth factor level was checked and revealed an elevated level at 6240 pg/mL. This finding led to a review of her computed tomographic scans, which identified sclerotic lesions in the T5 and T9 bodies. A biopsy of the T5 vertebral body and an axillary lymph node confirmed the diagnosis.

The sclerotic T5 lesion had increased plasma cells that comprised approximately 10% of the marrow cellularity, including occasional large nucleolated forms. In situ hybridization revealed an inverted 1: 2 ratio of κ to λ light chains, indicating a λ restricted plasma cell proliferation. The axillary lymph node had Castleman disease–like changes with involuted germinal centers, increased vascular proliferation, and increased plasma cells in the interfollicular regions. Having fulfilled all diagnostic criteria, she was diagnosed as having POEMS.
