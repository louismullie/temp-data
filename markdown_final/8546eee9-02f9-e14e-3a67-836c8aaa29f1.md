## Question

What is the doses used of ventolin and budesonide in nebs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the doses of Ventolin (albuterol) and budesonide when used in nebulizers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the drug names and formulations. Then, I should verify albuterol nebulizer dosing for adults and children. Next, I will review budesonide nebulizer dosing by age and severity, including maximum daily doses. After that, I need to check administration details and whether these two medications can be mixed in the same nebulizer. Finally, I will synthesize practical dosing ranges and highlight key safety considerations and exceptions, making sure I anchor each point to authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the drug identities and formulations so I don't misstate anything. Ventolin is the brand name for albuterol, a short-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator, and budesonide is an inhaled corticosteroid available as a nebulized suspension for maintenance therapy in asthma and related conditions, not for acute rescue, which is an important distinction I should keep in mind [^4231bd26] [^e775151d].

> Now, I will examine albuterol nebulizer dosing for adults. The FDA labeling states that for symptomatic relief of bronchospasm, the dose is 2.5 mg inhaled every 6 to 8 hours as needed, delivered over 5 to 15 minutes, with a maximum of 10 mg per day, which I should explicitly note to avoid overdose scenarios [^4231bd26] [^72156942]. Wait, let me verify the maximum; yes, the VA/DoD guideline aligns with a 10 mg/day ceiling for nebulized albuterol in adults, reinforcing that cap [^72156942].

> Next, I should review albuterol nebulizer dosing for children. The VA/DoD guideline indicates that for pediatric patients, the dose is 0.63 mg or 1.25 mg by nebulizer every 4 to 6 hours as needed, with a typical maximum of 2.5 mg per dose and not exceeding 10 mg per day, which matches common pediatric practice patterns and labeling conventions, though I should acknowledge that exact pediatric nebulizer strengths can vary by product and region, so clinicians should confirm the local formulation and labeling [^72156942].

> Hold on, I should verify the acute exacerbation context because dosing can differ when patients are in distress. For mild-to-moderate asthma exacerbations, albuterol 2.5 mg by nebulizer can be repeated every 20 minutes for the first hour, then every 1 to 4 hours as needed, which is consistent with emergency care protocols and FDA guidance for nebulized albuterol in exacerbations, though I need to ensure this is framed as acute care rather than routine maintenance dosing [^4231bd26] [^d44cb874].

> I will now examine budesonide nebulizer dosing for adults. The FDA labeling provides starting doses based on prior therapy: for patients on bronchodilators alone, 0.5 mg once daily or 0.25 mg twice daily; for those already on inhaled corticosteroids, 0.5 mg once daily or 0.25 mg twice daily up to 0.5 mg twice daily; for patients transitioning from oral corticosteroids, 0.5 mg twice daily is recommended, with downward titration to the lowest effective dose once control is achieved, and the maximum total daily dose is 1 mg, which I should emphasize to avoid overtreatment [^e775151d] [^a1b1ed9a]. Let me double-check the maximum; yes, multiple FDA sources consistently cap total daily budesonide nebulizer dose at 1 mg in adults [^e775151d] [^a1b1ed9a].

> Next, I should review budesonide nebulizer dosing for children. The pediatric starting dose is typically 0.25 mg once daily, with the option to increase to 0.25 mg twice daily or 0.5 mg once daily if needed, and in more severe cases up to 0.5 mg twice daily, again with a maximum total daily dose of 1 mg, and clinicians should titrate to the lowest effective dose once control is established, which I need to state clearly to guide safe pediatric prescribing [^e775151d] [^a1b1ed9a]. I should confirm that clinical trials in young children support efficacy down to 12 months; yes, controlled studies demonstrate symptom reduction and improved lung function across these pediatric doses [^fa48ba88].

> But wait, what about device and technique specifics that affect delivered dose. Budesonide inhalation suspension must be administered with a jet nebulizer connected to an adequate compressor, using a mouthpiece or face mask, and ultrasonic nebulizers are not recommended because they do not reliably aerosolize suspensions; moreover, budesonide should be given separately and not mixed with other nebulizer medications, as mixing can alter aerosol performance and has not been adequately studied for this formulation, which is a critical administration detail I should underscore [^e775151d] [^a1b1ed9a]. I should also note that with the Pari-LC-Jet Plus and Pari Master system, the mean delivered dose is about 17% of the nominal dose, which explains why nominal mg doses appear higher than what reaches the lungs [^8f37bdbc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about combining albuterol and budesonide in the same nebulizer. My first thought might be that mixing could save time, but I need to correct that impulse because the budesonide FDA labeling advises administering budesonide suspension separately due to inadequate data on mixing with other nebulizable drugs, even though in vitro studies suggest some nebulizers can still deliver acceptable respirable fractions when mixed; clinically, the conservative and label-concordant approach is to nebulize them sequentially rather than together [^e775151d] [^e626d4e8]. I should double-check that this applies to routine care; yes, the FDA patient counseling repeatedly instructs separate administration, so I will adhere to that guidance in practice [^e775151d] [^a1b1ed9a].

> Let me synthesize practical dosing ranges to ensure clarity. For adults using nebulizers, albuterol 2.5 mg every 6 to 8 hours as needed, not to exceed 10 mg per day, is standard, while budesonide 0.25 to 0.5 mg once or twice daily, not to exceed 1 mg per day, is typical for maintenance, with titration to the lowest effective dose once stable; for children, albuterol 0.63 to 1.25 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed, not to exceed 10 mg per day, and budesonide 0.25 mg once daily, titrated up to 0.5 mg twice daily if needed, again not exceeding 1 mg per day, are reasonable ranges aligned with labeling and guidelines [^4231bd26] [^72156942] [^e775151d] [^a1b1ed9a].

> I should confirm key safety and counseling points so I don't omit anything important. Patients should rinse the mouth after budesonide nebulization to reduce oral candidiasis risk, avoid using ultrasonic nebulizers for budesonide, and understand that budesonide is a controller that takes days to weeks for full benefit, whereas albuterol is for rapid relief; also, if albuterol use increases or becomes less effective, that signals worsening control and warrants reassessment of the asthma plan, which I need to emphasize in teaching [^e775151d] [^3883701f] [^4231bd26].

> Finally, I need to ensure I distinguish this nebulized information from fixed-dose combination pMDI therapy that includes albuterol and budesonide, because that is a different product and dosing paradigm. The FDA-approved albuterol-budesonide pMDI is an as-needed anti-inflammatory reliever with 90 mcg albuterol and either 80 or 40 mcg budesonide per actuation, used up to a maximum of 6 doses per day in adults and children, which is distinct from nebulized maintenance dosing and should not be conflated with the nebulizer regimens discussed above [^d54aefd0] [^385ff01b] [^2f8dfb9d].

Ventolin (albuterol) and budesonide nebulizer doses are **separate and sequential** [^e775151d], not mixed, because mixing can reduce budesonide delivery and efficacy [^e626d4e8]. For adults, typical nebulizer doses are **albuterol 2.5 mg every 4–6 hours as needed** [^4231bd26] and **budesonide 0.5 mg once or twice daily** [^e775151d], titrated to the lowest effective dose. For children, use **albuterol 0.63–1.25 mg every 4–6 hours as needed** and **budesonide 0.25–0.5 mg once or twice daily** [^e775151d], not exceeding 1 mg/day. Administer budesonide with a jet nebulizer [^e775151d] and rinse the mouth after use to reduce oral thrush risk [^3883701f].

Treatment

On entering the run-in period, patients discontinued preenrollment SABA and any low-dose ICS, and received single-blind placebo qid and sponsor-provided albuterol (Ventolin; GlaxoSmithKline) used as needed for symptoms during run-in; only the latter was continued throughout the randomized treatment period. Patients aged ≥ 12 years were then randomized by a centralized Interactive Web Response System 1:1:1:1:1 to qid albuterol-budesonide 180/160 μg, albuterol-budesonide 180/80 μg, budesonide 160 μg, albuterol 180 μg, or placebo via pMDI for 12 weeks. Each dose was administered as two actuations of albuterol-budesonide 90/80 μg or 90/40 μg, budesonide 80 μg, albuterol 90 μg, or placebo. Children aged 4 to 11 years were randomized 1:1:1 to qid albuterol-budesonide 180/80 μg, albuterol 180 μg, or placebo.

Randomization for patients aged ≥ 12 years was stratified by pretrial background therapy (ICS vs non-ICS), Asthma Control Questionnaire-7 (ACQ-7) score (≤ 1.5 vs > 1.5), and age (≥ 12–17 vs ≥ 18 years). Patients and trial investigators were blinded to treatment allocation. The different kit types corresponding to each of the treatment groups were visually identical, protecting the blind through their similarity in appearance.

Patients were instructed to take trial medication on waking and to distribute doses equally throughout the day, taking the final dose before going to sleep. Additional asthma medications (other than sponsor-provided albuterol for as-needed use) and spacer devices were not permitted.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended starting dose and highest recommended dose of budesonide inhalation suspension, based on prior asthma therapy, are listed in the following table.

2.1 Dosing Recommendations

Dosing recommendations based on previous therapy are as follows:

Bronchodilators alone: 0.5 mg once daily or 0.25 mg twice daily
Inhaled corticosteroids: 0.5 mg once daily or 0.25 mg twice daily up to 0.5 mg twice daily
Oral corticosteroids: 0.5 mg twice daily

In symptomatic children not responding to non-steroidal therapy, a starting dose of 0.25 mg once daily may be considered. If once-daily treatment does not provide adequate control, the total daily dose should be increased and/or administered as a divided dose. In all patients, it is desirable to downward-titrate to the lowest effective dose once asthma stability is achieved.

2.2 Directions for Use

Budesonide inhalation suspension should be administered via jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor with an adequate air flow, equipped with a mouthpiece or suitable face mask. Ultrasonic nebulizers are not suitable for the adequate administration of budesonide inhalation suspension and, therefore, are NOT recommended.

The effects of mixing budesonide inhalation suspension with other nebulizable medications have not been adequately assessed. Budesonide inhalation suspension should be administered separately in the nebulizer [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)].

Study design

This was a 180 minute, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel-group multicentre study (Study 0693). The study was performed in accordance with the ethical principles in the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, in addition to applicable local regulatory requirements, and the protocol was approved by local ethics review boards. Before any procedure relating to the study was performed, written informed consent was obtained from the patients and, where applicable, from the patient's parent or legal guardian.

The study design is shown in Figure 1. After the test of response to salbutamol (Ventolin ®, Glaxo Wellcome, UK; 100 or 200 μg [total dose 400 μg], administered using a pressurised metered-dose inhaler with a Volumatic spacer [Allen & Hanburys, UK]), eligible patients received either budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort ® Turbuhaler ®, AstraZeneca, Sweden; 320/9 μg, 2 inhalations at t = -5 minutes and a further 2 inhalations at t = 0 minutes [total dose 1280/36 μg], plus 2 inhalations of formoterol placebo containing lactose at t = -5 minutes and at t = 0 minutes) or formoterol (Oxis ® Turbuhaler ®, AstraZeneca, Sweden; 9 ug, 2 inhalations at t = -5 minutes and a further 2 inhalations at t = 0 minutes [total dose 36 μg], plus 2 inhalations of budesonide/formoterol placebo containing lactose at t = -5 minutes and at t = 0 minutes). Oral prednisolone (Approved Prescription Services, UK; 5 mg per tablet, 12 tablets [total dose 60 mg]) was administered to all patients 90 minutes after they received the second dose of study medication.

Patients were permitted to use albuterol sulfate 90 μg (Ventolin® HFA) for relief of COPD symptoms during each treatment period, if required. Patients were permitted to use albuterol MDI, ipratropium MDI, or albuterol/ipratropium combination MDI during each washout period, in accordance with recommendations from the investigator. Patients who received an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) as part of an FDC therapy containing fluticasone and salmeterol, mometasone and formoterol, or formoterol and budesonide, and had been maintained on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks, were switched to the corresponding dose of fluticasone, mometasone, or budesonide, administered as a single agent with albuterol MDI, ipratropium MDI, or albuterol/ipratropium combination MDI at the investigator's discretion. Patients who received ICS that was not administered as an FDC together with a LABA, and had been maintained on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks, were permitted to continue the ICS. Protocol-adjusted ICS therapy was continued and remained stable throughout the study. All COPD medications, including ICS, were withheld for at least 6 h prior to each clinic visit, or the visit was rescheduled as soon as was practical but within the specified visit windows.

### Beta-agonist overuse and delay in obtaining medical review in high risk asthma: a secondary analysis of data from a randomised controlled trial [^aeb2d307]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Design

This is a secondary analysis of data from a 24-week multicentre, open-label RCT of Single combination budesonide/formoterol inhaler as Maintenance And Reliever Therapy (SMART regimen) vs. fixed-dose budesonide/formoterol with salbutamol for relief (Standard regimen) in 303 adult patients with a physician's diagnosis of asthma, described previously. Patients were eligible if they had a current prescription for inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and at least one asthma exacerbation in the preceding year. An exacerbation was defined as presentation to a General Practice or Emergency Department resulting in prescription of oral corticosteroids or treatment with spacer-delivered or nebulised bronchodilator, or self-administration of prednisone for asthma for at least 3 days. Exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and current or ex-smokers with a > 10 pack-year smoking history with onset of respiratory symptoms after the age of 40.

Patients were randomised to the SMART regimen: a MDI containing 200/6 µg budesonide/formoterol (Vannair, AstraZeneca Limited, Auckland, New Zealand, which is the MDI formulation of Symbicort turbuhaler), two actuations twice daily for maintenance with one extra dose as needed for relief; or the Standard regimen: 200/6 µg Vannair MDI, two actuations twice daily for maintenance with 100 µg salbutamol MDI (Ventolin, GlaxoSmithKline Limited, Auckland, New Zealand), one to two extra actuations for relief. All participants were given written asthma action plans and verbal instructions outlining when to consult their doctor. All participants provided written informed consent and the trial was approved by the New Zealand Multi Region Ethics Committee, and prospectively registered [ACTRN 12610000515099]. The study protocol is available at

All Vannair and Ventolin MDIs incorporated an electronic monitor (Smartinhaler Tracker, Nexus6 Limited, Auckland, New Zealand), which recorded the date and time (to the nearest second) each time an inhaler was actuated. These monitors were 99·7% accurate in recording actuations in bench testingand were used in accordance with strict trial quality control processes. Participants were not aware of the exact capabilities of the monitors.

### Salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate versus fluticasone propionate plus montelukast: a randomised controlled trial investigating the effects on airway inflammation in asthma [^da9fd530]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Methods

Study population

Asthma patients aged 18–50 years, who were non-smokers and receiving a stable dose of up to 400 μg of beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) a day or equivalent ICS, but requiring further therapy, were recruited. Additional inclusion criteria included likelihood of compliance with the protocol requirements and ability, following instruction, to use an Accuhaler and mini-Wright peak flow meter. The criteria for randomisation were: a baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) of 61–85% of the predicted normal value; and a PC 20 < 8 mg/ml with methacholine challenge. In addition, all patients had to have at least one of the following: diary card recording of symptoms (score of one or more for day and night combined) on ≥ 4 of the last seven days of the run-in period; recorded use of relief medication (inhaled Ventolin) on ≥ 2 different days during the last seven days of the run-in period; and a period variation in peak expiratory flow (PEF) of ≥ 10% over the last seven days of the run in period. Patients who did not meet the latter three criteria were able to repeat the run-in period once more. Patients who fulfilled any of the following exclusion criteria did not take part in the study: were taking or had previously taken additional asthma medication, other than an ICS or short acting β 2 -agonist or oral corticosteroids in the last three months; acute respiratory infection or exacerbation of asthma within four weeks of screening, any additional underlying lung disease, or any significant disease warranting exclusion; hospitalisation or emergency treatment (for > 24 hours) for acute asthma in the last 12 months; were a smoker, had smoked in the last six months, or had a smoking history of 10 pack years or more; pregnant or lactating women, or women of child-bearing potential not using adequate contraception; evidence of alcohol, drug, or solvent abuse; hypersensitivity to any component of the study formulations, or taking medication contraindicated in combination with the study formulations; and previous entry to the study or receipt of any investigational drugs within four weeks of screening.

The study was approved by the ethics committee appropriate to each centre before any subjects were enrolled at that centre, and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects gave written informed consent before entering the study. The study ran from May 2001 to August 2002.

### Steroids in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: are nebulized and systemic forms comparable? [^06d660bf]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Systemic corticosteroids are strongly recommended in the treatment of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As COPD patients are usually elderly and are relatively immobile, side effects of systemic corticosteroids frequently outweigh their beneficial effects. On the contrary, nebulized corticosteroid solutions have a negligible systemic side-effect profile. In this review, as an alternative to systemic corticosteroids, the place of nebulized corticosteroids in exacerbation periods of COPD was summarized.

Recent Findings

The number of trials in the literature is increasing. Regarding the available data, high dose nebulized budesonide was found as effective as systemic corticosteroids in exacerbations of COPD. The side-effect profile, blood glucose level in particular, is better for nebulized budesonide.

Summary

Findings from recent studies are giving a positive impression on the role of high dose nebulized budesonide in exacerbations of COPD. However, larger and statistically high powered trials testing different types of nebulized corticosteroid solutions with varying dosages are still lacking. Before recommending the routine use of nebulized corticosteroids in exacerbations, present findings need to be confirmed with further studies of high quality.

Bronchodilators alone: 0.25 mg twice daily
Inhaled corticosteroids: 0.25 mg twice daily up to 0.5 mg twice daily
Oral corticosteroids: 0.5 mg twice daily
Once asthma stability is achieved, titrate the dose downwards.
For inhalation use via compressed air driven jet nebulizers only (not for use with ultrasonic devices). Not for injection. (Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.)

2.1 Dosing Recommendations

Dosing recommendations based on previous therapy are as follows:

Bronchodilators alone: 0.25 mg twice daily
Inhaled corticosteroids: 0.25 mg twice daily up to 0.5 mg twice daily
Oral corticosteroids: 0.5 mg twice daily

In all patients, it is desirable to downward-titrate to the lowest effective dose once asthma stability is achieved.

2.2 Directions for Use

Budesonide inhalation suspension should be administered via jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor with an adequate air flow, equipped with a mouthpiece or suitable face mask. Ultrasonic nebulizers are not suitable for the adequate administration of budesonide inhalation suspension and, therefore, are NOT recommended.

The effects of mixing budesonide inhalation suspension with other nebulizable medications have not been adequately assessed. Budesonide inhalation suspension should be administered separately in the nebulizer [see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. (Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.)].

A Pari-LC-Jet Plus Nebulizer (with face mask or mouthpiece) connected to a Pari Master compressor was used to deliver budesonide inhalation suspension to each patient in 3 U.S. controlled clinical studies. The safety and efficacy of budesonide inhalation suspension delivered by other nebulizers and compressors have not been established.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended starting dose and highest recommended dose of PULMICORT RESPULES, based on prior asthma therapy, are listed in the following table.

2.1 Dosing Recommendations

Dosing recommendations based on previous therapy are as follows:

Bronchodilators alone: 0.5 mg once daily or 0.25 mg twice daily
Inhaled corticosteroids: 0.5 mg once daily or 0.25 mg twice daily up to 0.5 mg twice daily
Oral corticosteroids: 0.5 mg twice daily or 1 mg once daily

In symptomatic children not responding to non-steroidal therapy, a starting dose of 0.25 mg once daily may be considered. If once-daily treatment does not provide adequate control, the total daily dose should be increased and/or administered as a divided dose. In all patients, it is desirable to downward-titrate to the lowest effective dose once asthma stability is achieved.

2.2 Directions for Use

PULMICORT RESPULES should be administered via jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor with an adequate air flow, equipped with a mouthpiece or suitable face mask. Ultrasonic nebulizers are not suitable for the adequate administration of PULMICORT RESPULES and, therefore, are NOT recommended.

The effects of mixing PULMICORT RESPULES with other nebulizable medications have not been adequately assessed. PULMICORT RESPULES should be administered separately in the nebulizer [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)].

A Pari-LC-Jet Plus Nebulizer (with face mask or mouthpiece) connected to a Pari Master compressor was used to deliver PULMICORT RESPULES to each patient in 3 U.S. controlled clinical studies. The safety and efficacy of PULMICORT RESPULES delivered by other nebulizers and compressors have not been established.

### Review of the unique properties of budesonide [^f417f4ca]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy for asthma is to attain high therapeutic activity in the airways while keeping the risk of systemic adverse effects relatively low. However, the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of various ICSs affect this ratio, thereby influencing their ability to fulfill the requirements of an ideal agent.

Objective

This article reviews the physical and pharmacokinetic properties of budesonide, outlining how they, safety data, and use of different inhalation devices enable budesonide to meet many of the clinical requirements of an ideal ICS for the treatment of asthma.

Results

ICS efficacy is influenced by lipophilicity, lung deposition, and retention in airway tissue, whereas the rate of elimination determines systemic activity. Budesonide is retained in the airways to a greater extent than other ICSs because of an esterification process that increases its lipophilicity. The prolonged retention of budesonide in the airways may contribute to its efficacy when administered QD. In addition to a pressurized metered-dose inhaler, budesonide is available as a dry-powder inhaler and in nebulized form, which can be used by asthma patients aged ≥ 6 months.

Conclusions

When combined with delivery devices suitable for a spectrum of patient groups, the physical and pharmacokinetic properties of budesonide lend it many of the characteristics of an ideal ICS, including favorable efficacy and tolerability profiles.

### 24-h bronchodilation and inspiratory capacity improvements with glycopyrrolate / formoterol fumarate via co-suspension delivery technology in COPD [^e18fc2e4]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and treatment

PT003011 and PT003012 were crossover, multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies conducted in the USA. The studies had similar designs, with the exception of the inclusion of an open-label tiotropium SMI arm in PT003011. In study PT003011, patients were randomly assigned to one of six treatment sequences, each comprising three 4-week periods of treatment with the following in a crossover fashion: GFF MDI 18/9.6 μg BID; placebo MDI BID; and open-label tiotropium SMI 5 μg QD. In study PT003012, patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequences, comprising two 4-week periods with GFF MDI and placebo MDI treatment administered in a crossover fashion.

Patients were required to discontinue any previous COPD medications during both studies, and were provided with Atrovent® HFA (ipratropium bromide inhalation aerosol, four times daily) and rescue Ventolin® HFA (albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol, up to four times daily as required) to control symptoms. Use of albuterol sulfate was permitted during the treatment and washout periods as rescue medication. However, ipratropium bromide was only for use during the washout periods and was replaced with study drug during treatment periods. Patients previously using an inhaled corticosteroid as part of an FDC were switched to an equivalent inhaled corticosteroid monotherapy with fluticasone, mometasone, or budesonide.

These studies were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines including the International Council on Harmonisation, the US Code of Federal Regulations, and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent prior to the performance of any screening evaluations.

Patients

Patients eligible for inclusion in PT003011 and PT003012 were 40 to 80 years of age; had moderate-to-very severe COPD (as defined by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society criteria); and were current or ex-smokers with a history of ≥ 10 pack-years. Patients who had been hospitalized due to COPD in the past 3 months, had poorly controlled COPD, had changed their smoking status during screening, or required long-term oxygen therapy for > 12 h per day were excluded. Both studies allowed patients to withdraw at any point, and investigators could request withdrawal of a patient if they met any of the pre-specified discontinuation criteria.

### Effects on aerosol performance of mixing of either budesonide or beclomethasone dipropionate with albuterol and ipratropium bromide [^e626d4e8]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Mixing of nebulized drugs is common in real life, but its consequences on aerosol output and granulometry are poorly known.

Methods

In an in vitro study I evaluated the effects on aerosol output, drug output, and aerosol particle size characteristics of mixing either beclomethasone dipropionate or budesonide with albuterol and ipratropium bromide. I tested the SideStream and VentStream-Pro nebulizers, run with the AirClinic compressor. Using the same fill volume in all experiments, I nebulized and evaluated each studied drug alone, and 2 drug mixtures: beclomethasone plus albuterol plus ipratropium; and budesonide plus albuterol plus ipratropium. I measured aerosol output via gravimetrics. I measured drug delivery by collecting the aerosol on a filter in the inspiratory limb, and the residual solution in the reservoir and the circuit after nebulization, and assayed those liquids with chromatography. I measured particle size distribution via cascade impaction.

Results

Mixing tended to reduce drug output and to increase mass median aerodynamic diameter with the SideStream, but not always with the VentStream-Pro. However, the drug output always remained satisfactory and the mass median aerodynamic diameters were within the respirable range. When nebulized alone, the respirable mass of bronchodilators ranged from 18% to 40% of the nominal dose; when mixed, it ranged from 13% to 37%. When nebulized alone, the respirable mass of corticosteroids ranged from 10% to 24% of the nominal dose; when mixed, it ranged from 10% to 17%.

Conclusions

Both the SideStream and VentStream-Pro have good aerosol performance in nebulizing budesonide or beclomethasone dipropionate alone, and when mixed with albuterol and ipratropium bromide.

### Salbutamol easyhaler provides non-inferior relief of methacholine induced bronchoconstriction in comparison to ventoline evohaler with spacer: a randomized trial [^cb7f53b8]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Salbutamol is a cornerstone for relieving acute asthma symptoms, typically administered through a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI). Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) offer an alternative, but concerns exist whether DPIs provide an effective relief during an obstructive event.

Objective

We aimed to show non-inferiority of Salbutamol Easyhaler DPI compared to pMDI with spacer in treating methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction. Applicability of Budesonide-formoterol Easyhaler DPI as a reliever was also assessed.

Methods

This was a randomized, parallel-group trial in subjects sent to methacholine challenge (MC) test for asthma diagnostics. Participants with at least 20% decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) were randomized to receive Salbutamol Easyhaler (2 × 200 μg), Ventoline Evohaler with spacer (4 × 100 μg) or Budesonide-formoterol Easyhaler (2 × 160/4.5 μg) as a reliever. The treatment was repeated if FEV 1 did not recover to at least -10% of baseline.

Results

180 participants (69% females, mean age 46 yrs [range 18–80], FEV 1%pred 89.5 [62–142] %) completed the trial. Salbutamol Easyhaler was non-inferior to pMDI with spacer in acute relief of bronchoconstriction showing a -0.083 (95% LCL -0.146) L FEV 1 difference after the first dose and -0.032 (-0.071) L after the last dose. The differences in FEV 1 between Budesonide-formoterol Easyhaler and Salbutamol pMDI with spacer were -0.163 (-0.225) L after the first and -0.092 (-0.131) L after the last dose.

Conclusion

The study confirms non-inferiority of Salbutamol Easyhaler to Ventoline Evohaler with spacer in relieving acute bronchoconstriction, making Easyhaler a sustainable and safe reliever for MC test and supports its use during asthma attacks.

### Holding chambers versus nebulisers for inhaled steroids in chronic asthma [^d89b7d5b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids are available in the form of a suspension for nebulisation, although the role of this mode of therapy in the treatment of chronic asthma is still unclear.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of inhaled corticosteroids delivered via nebuliser versus holding chamber for the treatment of chronic asthma.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trial Register (1999) and reference lists of articles. We contacted the authors of studies and pharmaceutical companies for additional studies and hand-searched the British Journal of Clinical Research, European Journal of Clinical Research and major respiratory society meeting abstracts (1997–1999). Date of last search August 2005.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing nebuliser to holding chamber in the delivery of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of chronic asthma. All age groups of patients were considered. Two reviewers assessed articles for inclusion; two reviewers independently assessed included studies for methodological quality.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer extracted data; authors were contacted to clarify missing information. Quantitative analyses were undertaken using Review Manager 4.1 with MetaView 3.1.

Main Results

Two studies were selected for inclusion (63 subjects), both concerned adults. An additional small study including 14 children was identified for the 2005 update. Methodological quality was variable. Due to design differences it was not appropriate to pool the studies. The single high quality study compared budesonide 2000–8000 mcg delivered via Pari Inhalier Boy jet nebuliser with inspiration-only inhalation to budesonide 1600 mcg via large volume spacer. The nebuliser delivery led to higher morning peak expiratory flow values (25 L/min p < 0.01), higher evening values (30L/min, p < 0.01), lower rescue beta2 agonist use and symptom scores compared to the holding chamber delivery.

Authors' Conclusions

Budesonide in high dose delivered by the particular nebuliser used in the only double-blinded study that could be included in this review was more effective than budesonide 1600 mcg via a large volume spacer. However, it is not clear whether this was an effect of nominal dose delivered or delivery system. Cost, compliance and patient preference are important determinants of clinical effectiveness that still require further assessment. Future studies are needed to evaluate the relative effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids delivered by different combinations of nebuliser/compressor compared to holding chamber. Moreover, further studies assessing these delivery methods are needed in infants and pre-school children, as these are groups that are likely to be considered for treatment with nebulised corticosteroids.

### Budesonide (budesonide inhalation) [^8f37bdbc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

11 DESCRIPTION

Budesonide, the active component of budesonide inhalation suspension, is a corticosteroid designated chemically as (RS)-11β, 16α, 17, 21-tetrahydroxypregna-1, 4-diene-3, 20-dione cyclic 16, 17-acetal with butyraldehyde. Budesonide is provided as a mixture of two epimers (22R and 22S). The empirical formula of budesonide is C25H34O6and its molecular weight is 430.5. Its structural formula is:

Budesonide is a white to off-white, tasteless, odorless powder that is practically insoluble in water and in heptane, sparingly soluble in ethanol, and freely soluble in chloroform. Its partition coefficient between octanol and water at pH 7.4 is 1.6 x 103.

Budesonide inhalation suspension is a sterile suspension for inhalation via jet nebulizer and contains the active ingredient budesonide (micronized), and the inactive ingredients sodium chloride, disodium edetate, polysorbate 80, citric acid, tri sodium citrate, and water for injection. Two dose strengths are available in single-dose ampules: 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg per 2 mL ampule. For budesonide inhalation suspension, like all other nebulized treatments, the amount delivered to the lungs will depend on patient factors, the jet nebulizer utilized, and compressor performance. Using the Pari-LC-Jet Plus Nebulizer/Pari Master compressor system, under in vitro conditions, the mean delivered dose at the mouthpiece (% nominal dose) was approximately 17% at a mean flow rate of 5.5 L/min.

The mean nebulization time was 5 minutes or less. Budesonide inhalation suspension should be administered from jet nebulizers at adequate flow rates, via face masks or mouthpieces [see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. (Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.)].

### Comparing clinical features of the nebulizer, metered-dose inhaler, and dry powder inhaler [^5e072a33]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

Topically inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These medications are delivered via jet or ultrasonic nebulizer, metered-dose inhaler (MDI), or dry powder inhaler (DPI). While the number of devices may be confusing to patients and clinicians, each device has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Most clinical evidence shows that any of these devices will work for most situations, including exacerbations and in the stable outpatient setting. There is a high rate of errors in device use with all these devices, especially the MDI. In choosing a drug/device combination for a patient, the clinician must take into account several factors, including the cognitive and physical ability of the patient, ease of use, convenience, costs, and patient preferences. Clinicians should also have a rudimentary understanding of aerosol principles in order to be able to teach appropriate use of aerosol devices to their patients.

### Expert panel consensus recommendations on the utilization of nebulized budesonide for managing asthma and COPD in both stable and exacerbation stages in Thailand [^2baeacbe]. The Journal of Asthma (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study investigated the utilization of nebulized budesonide for acute asthma and COPD exacerbations as well as for maintenance therapy in adults.

Data Sources

We conducted a search on PubMed for nebulized budesonide treatment.

Selected Studies

Selecting all English-language papers that utilize Mesh phrases "asthma", "COPD", "budesonide", "nebulized", "adult", "exacerbation", and "maintenance" without temporal restrictions, and narrowing down to clinical research such as RCTs, observational studies, and real-world studies.

Results

Analysis of 25 studies was conducted to assess the effectiveness of nebulized budesonide in asthma (n = 10) and COPD (n = 15). The panel in Thailand recommended incorporating nebulized budesonide as an additional or alternative treatment option to the standard of care and systemic corticosteroids (SCS) based on the findings.

Conclusion

Nebulized budesonide is effective and well-tolerated in treating asthma and COPD, with less systemic adverse effects compared to systemic corticosteroids. High-dose nebulized budesonide can enhance clinical outcomes for severe and mild exacerbations with slow systemic corticosteroid response. Nebulized budesonide can substitute systemic corticosteroids in some situations.

### Iloprost (Ventavis) [^0d0b882d]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

2.1	Recommended Dosing

VENTAVIS is intended to be inhaled using the I-neb®AAD®System. The recommended initial inhaled dose is 2.5 mcg (as delivered at the mouthpiece). If well tolerated, increase dosing to 5.0 mcg and maintain at that dose; otherwise maintain the dose at 2.5 mcg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. VENTAVIS should be taken 6 to 9 times per day (no more than once every 2 hours) during waking hours, according to individual need and tolerability. The maximum daily dose evaluated in clinical studies was 45 mcg (5 mcg 9 times per day).

Direct mixing of VENTAVIS with other medications in the I-neb®AAD®System has not been evaluated; do not mix with other medications. To avoid potential interruptions in drug delivery due to equipment malfunctions, the patient should have easy access to a back-up I-neb®AAD®System.

For each inhalation session, only a mouthpiece should be used. Avoid skin or eye contact with VENTAVIS solution. Do not orally ingest VENTAVIS solution.

VENTAVIS is supplied in 1 mL ampules in two concentrations: 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL.

The 20 mcg/mL concentration is intended for patients who are maintained at the 5 mcg dose and who have repeatedly experienced extended treatment times which could result in incomplete dosing. Transitioning patients to the 20 mcg/mL concentration using the I-neb®AAD®System will decrease treatment times to help maintain patient compliance.

For each inhalation session, the entire contents of each opened ampule of VENTAVIS should be transferred into the I-neb®AAD®System medication chamber immediately before use. Discard any solution remaining in the medication chamber after each inhalation session. Patients should follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning the I-neb®AAD®System components after each dose administration.

### Aerosol delivery device selection for spontaneously breathing patients: 2012 [^54700ada]. Respiratory Care (2012). Medium credibility.

AARC CPG — Small-volume nebulizer (SVN) limitations in spontaneously breathing patients include that deposition of medication into the lungs ranges from 1–15% of the dose and may vary brand to brand and unit to unit; drug delivery varies with different nebulizer types and, if specified, only the nebulizer cited on the drug label should be used; certain drugs require approved nebulizers (budesonide, tobramycin, dornase alfa, pentamidine, iloprost, treprostinil, aztreonam); smaller tidal volumes/rapid respiratory rates and smaller airway diameter reduce delivered dose; crying children receive virtually no aerosol drug to the lungs and most of the inhaled dose deposits in the upper airways and is then swallowed, and inhaled drugs should be given to infants when they are breathing quietly; fill volume affects output and it is suggested to follow the drug label or device manufacturer's product insert when devices are not labeled for a specific medication; approximately 25–50% of the initial solution remains on internal walls/reservoir after therapy, with concentration increases leading to dose retention in the jet nebulizer; aerosol is lost during expiration unless breath‑actuated or reservoir‑bag designs are used; treatment time is variable and prolonged times may reduce adherence; use is labor‑intensive and costly, the need for a power source reduces portability (particularly ambulatory, outside the home), and SVNs require preparation and cleaning.

Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a list of these medicines, if you are not sure.

Know the medicines your child takes. Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when your child gets a new medicine.

How should I use PULMICORT RESPULES?

Use PULMICORT RESPULES exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Your child must use PULMICORT RESPULES regularly for it to work.
PULMICORT RESPULES comes in three strengths. Your healthcare provider has prescribed the strength that is best for your child.
Do not stop using PULMICORT RESPULES, and do not change your child's dose of PULMICORT RESPULES without talking to your healthcare provider.
PULMICORT RESPULES is for inhaled use only. Use PULMICORT RESPULES with a jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor set up with a mouthpiece or face mask. Do not use an ultrasonic nebulizer to give PULMICORT RESPULES.
Do not mix PULMICORT RESPULES with other nebulizer medicines. If your child uses another medicine by inhalation to treat asthma, talk with your healthcare provider for instructions on when to use the other medicine.
If your child misses a dose, just give the next regularly scheduled dose when it is due. Do not use PULMICORT RESPULES more often than has been prescribed.
Improvement in the control of asthma symptoms with PULMICORT RESPULES can occur within 2–8 days. It may take up to 4–6 weeks before maximum improvement is seen.
Make sure your child always has a short-acting beta2-agonist medicine with him or her. Your child should use the short-acting beta2-agonist medicine for breathing problems between doses of PULMICORT RESPULES or if a sudden asthma attack happens. Call your healthcare provider right away if:
the short-acting rescue medicine does not work as well for relieving asthma symptoms.
your child needs to use the short-acting rescue medicines more often than usual.
your child's breathing problems worsen with PULMICORT RESPULES
Rinse your child's mouth with water and have him or her spit the water out after each PULMICORT RESPULES treatment. Do not swallow the water. This will lessen the chance of getting a fungal infection (thrush) in the mouth.
If your child has used long-term corticosteroids and the dose is now being lowered or stopped, a warning card should be carried stating that your child may need corticosteroids during times of stress or during an asthma attack that does not get better with bronchodilator medicines.
Your healthcare provider may check your child's blood, breathing and do eye exams while using PULMICORT RESPULES.
Read the Patient Information and Instructions for Use at the end of this leaflet for detailed instructions about how to use PULMICORT RESPULES.

### Once-daily inhaled budesonide for the treatment of asthma: clinical evidence and pharmacokinetic explanation [^1e439f80]. The Journal of Asthma (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Budesonide, a widely used inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with a favorable therapeutic ratio, is available via a dry powder inhaler (Pulmicort Turbuhaler) and as a suspension for nebulization (Pulmicort Respules).

Methods

MEDLINE and an AstraZeneca database were searched to identify relevant controlled clinical trials published between 1986 and 2002 using the key words budesonide OR inhaled corticosteroid, AND once daily.

Results

Thirty-four controlled clinical studies involving once-daily administration of budesonide to asthmatic patients were identified. Excluding long-term studies, this review presents data from 23 controlled studies for 4466 adults or adolescents and 1532 children with asthma and demonstrates efficacy of budesonide in both corticosteroid-naïve patients and patients previously treated with ICS. Once-daily administration of budesonide achieves clinical efficacy comparable with that of twice-daily regimens in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma and is equally effective when given in the morning or evening. Once-daily administration simplifies treatment regimens and may improve patient compliance. The tolerability profiles of budesonide once-daily via Turbuhaler or as budesonide inhalation suspension are good and comparable with those for twice-daily dosing.

Conclusions

Once-daily budesonide is effective and well tolerated as initial treatment for adults and children with mild asthma and as maintenance therapy in patients with more severe asthma once asthma control has been achieved.

### Design principles of liquid nebulization devices currently in use [^afa3bd53]. Respiratory Care (2002). Low credibility.

Liquid nebulization is a common method of medical aerosol generation. Nebulizers are of 2 types: jet (or pneumatic) small-volume nebulizer, and ultrasonic nebulizer. Jet nebulizers are based on the venturi principle, whereas ultrasonic nebulizers use the converse piezoelectric effect to convert alternating current to high-frequency acoustic energy. Important variables for both types of nebulizer are treatment time required, particle size produced, and aerosol drug output. There are several advantages to jet nebulization, including that effective use requires only simple, tidal breathing, and that dose modification and dose compounding are possible. Disadvantages include the length of treatment time and equipment size. Design modifications to the constant-output nebulizer have resulted in breath-enhanced, open-vent nebulizers such as the Pari LC Plus and the dosimetric AeroEclipse. Ultrasonic nebulizers generally have a higher output rate than jet nebulizers, but a larger average particle size. Ultrasonic nebulizers can also substantially increase reservoir solution temperature, the opposite of jet nebulizer cooling. Drug concentration in the reservoir does not increase with ultrasonic nebulization, as it does with jet nebulization. Ultrasonic nebulizers have the same advantages as jet nebulizers. Ultrasonic nebulizers are more expensive and fragile than jet nebulizers, may cause drug degradation, and do not nebulize suspensions well. Neither type of nebulizer meets the criteria for an ideal inhaler: efficient and quick dose delivery with reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and no ambient contamination by lost aerosol.

Use budesonide inhalation suspension exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Your child must use budesonide inhalation suspension regularly for it to work.
Budesonide inhalation suspension comes in two strengths. Your healthcare provider has prescribed the strength that is best for your child.
Do not stop using budesonide inhalation suspension and do not change your child's dose of budesonide inhalation suspension without talking to your healthcare provider.
Budesonide inhalation suspension is for inhaled use only. Use budesonide inhalation suspension with a jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor set up with a mouthpiece or face mask. Do not use an ultrasonic nebulizer to give budesonide inhalation suspension.
Do not mix budesonide inhalation suspension with other nebulizer medicines. If your child uses another medicine by inhalation to treat asthma, talk with your healthcare provider for instructions on when to use the other medicine.
If your child misses a dose, just give the next regularly scheduled dose when it is due. Do not use budesonide inhalation suspension more often than has been prescribed.
Improvement in the control of asthma symptoms with budesonide inhalation suspension can occur within 2 to 8 days. It may take up to 4 to 6 weeks before maximum improvement is seen.
Make sure your child always has a short-acting beta2-agonist medicine with him or her. Your child should use the short-acting beta2-agonist medicine for breathing problems between doses of budesonide inhalation suspension or if a sudden asthma attack happens. Call your healthcare provider right away if:
the short-acting rescue medicine does not work as well for relieving asthma symptoms.
your child needs to use the short-acting rescue medicines more often than usual.
your child's breathing problems worsen with budesonide inhalation suspension
Rinse your child's mouth with water and have him or her spit the water out after each budesonide inhalation suspension treatment. Do not swallow the water. This will lessen the chance of getting a fungal infection (thrush) in the mouth.
If your child has used long-term corticosteroids and the dose is now being lowered or stopped, a warning card should be carried stating that your child may need corticosteroids during times of stress or during an asthma attack that does not get better with bronchodilator medicines.
Your healthcare provider may check your child's blood, breathing and do eye exams while using budesonide inhalation suspension.

### Budesonide (Pulmicort) [^9fd54014]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In vitro testing has shown that the dose delivery for PULMICORT FLEXHALER is dependent on airflow through the device, as evidenced by a decrease in the fine particle dose at a flow rate of 30 L/min to a value that is approximately 40–50% of that produced at 60 L/min. At a flow rate of 40 L/min, the fine particle dose is approximately 70% of that produced at 60 L/min. Patient factors such as inspiratory flow rates will also affect the dose delivered to the lungs of patients in actual use [see Patient Information and Instructions for Use]. In asthmatic children age 6 to 17 (N = 516, FEV12.29 [0.97–4.28]) peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through PULMICORT FLEXHALER was 72.5 [19.1–103.6] L/min). Inspiratory flows were not measured in the adult pivotal study. Patients should be carefully instructed on the use of this drug product to assure optimal dose delivery.

### Systemic availability and lung deposition of budesonide via three different nebulizers in adults [^ba0628f5]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Budesonide is an inhaled corticosteroid widely used in the treatment of asthma. The local and systemic availability of budesonide has been determined in adults via pressurized metered-dose inhaler and dry-powder inhaler.

Objective

To estimate lung deposition and systemic availability of budesonide inhalation suspension in healthy adults.

Methods

Twelve adult volunteers entered an open, randomized, five-way crossover study and received the following treatments, with 1-week washout between treatments: separate 2-mg (nominal dose) budesonide doses via the Pari Inhalierboy (Inhalierboy; Pari GmbH, Starnberg, Germany), Pari LC Jet Plus (Jet Plus, Pari GmbH), and Maxin MA-2 (MA-2; Clinova Medical AB, Malmö, Sweden) jet nebulizers, 4 mg budesonide orally, and 0.5 mg budesonide intravenously. The plasma concentration of budesonide was measured up to 8 hours postadministration. Lung deposition and systemic availability of nebulized budesonide were estimated using pharmacokinetic evaluation.

Results

In this first study of the bioavailability of budesonide inhalation suspension in adults, there were no differences between nebulizers in lung deposition (14 to 16%) or systemic availability (15 to 17%) relative to the nominal budesonide dose. Relative to the actual dose inhaled (dose-to-subject), lung deposition and systemic availability were statistically significantly higher for the Jet Plus (58 and 63%, respectively) and MA-2 (59 and 64%, respectively) nebulizers than the Inhalierboy (36 and 44%, respectively). The Inhalierboy produced larger aerosol droplets than Jet Plus or MA-2 nebulizers (7-, 5-, and 3-microm mass median diameters, respectively) and delivered a higher dose-to-subject than the other two nebulizers.

Conclusion

Relative to the nominal dose, lung deposition and systemic availability of budesonide were similar via the three nebulizers tested.

### Single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) of asthma: a critical appraisal [^4f321321]. Thorax (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Published double-blind studies have shown that budesonide/formoterol given in the SMART regimen is more effective than budesonide alone or than lower doses of budesonide/formoterol given in conventional fashion. It is still unclear how SMART compares with guideline-recommended amounts of combination therapy taken preventively to minimise symptoms and avoid reliever need. Guideline-recommended asthma control is rarely achieved in published SMART trials, in contrast with the reported reduction of severe exacerbations. Future studies should assess which outcomes are most useful in deciding treatment adjustments for patients inadequately controlled with the strategy. The finding of increased eosinophilic airways inflammation over 1 year of treatment is of concern and calls for further long-term studies assessing inflammation and remodelling. The recruitment of poorly controlled patients with a history of recent exacerbations despite usually effective inhaled therapy may skew the results of published SMART trials and limit their application to a more typical asthma population.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^f41a3637]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Mild asthma — as-needed inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) taken with a rapid-acting bronchodilator includes three regimens and associated outcomes: As-needed ICSs were evaluated with rapid-acting bronchodilators as 1) as-needed ICS plus formoterol in a single inhaler, 2) as-needed ICS plus albuterol in a single inhaler, and 3) as-needed ICS plus albuterol in separate inhalers. In the BEST study, the as-needed combination ICS–albuterol group had fewer exacerbations and higher peak flow than SABAs alone, and in BASALT, exacerbation outcomes were similar with concomitant as-needed SABA and ICS compared with physician adjustment or FeNO-based adjustment of ICS dose every 6 weeks. Albuterol–ICS can also be used before exercise in adults with exercise-induced asthma or bronchospasm. A pragmatic trial instructed one inhalation of ICS with each inhalation of SABA, or five inhalations of ICS with each nebulized SABA treatment, resulting in a significant reduction in severe exacerbation rates compared with usual care. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved the use of as-needed combination albuterol–budesonide in asthma.

Asthma — single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) with budesonide-formoterol versus higher-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in individuals aged 12 years and older — was evaluated in three large randomized controlled trials (total N = 4662) where SMART used daily budesonide-formoterol 160/9 to 320/9 μg with up to 10 rescue puffs (total daily dose of 12 puffs or 54 μg formoterol) compared with daily budesonide 320 to 640 μg plus short-acting beta-agonist (SABA), showing a 51% RR reduction in exacerbations in one trial and 35% and 43% in two others, and collectively an RR of 0.6 (range, 0.53–0.68) favoring SMART (high certainty of evidence); validated asthma outcomes were not reported, but individual asthma control measures significantly favored SMART, and overall corticosteroid exposure was lower with SMART (two- to fourfold less for inhaled ICS treatments).

Asthma guideline — SMART implementation and dosing states SMART is appropriate for Step 3 (low-dose ICS-formoterol) and Step 4 (medium-dose ICS-formoterol) treatment; ICS-formoterol should be administered as maintenance therapy with one to two puffs once to twice daily and one to two puffs as needed for asthma symptoms; the maximum number of puffs per day is 12 (54 μg formoterol) for individuals aged 12 years and older and 8 (36 μg formoterol) for children aged 4 to 11 years, and clinicians should advise individuals or caregivers to contact their physician if they need to use more than these amounts; the calculation of the dose of formoterol was based on 4.5 μg/inhalation; ICS-formoterol should not be used as quick-relief therapy in individuals taking ICS-salmeterol as maintenance therapy; SMART is administered with a single inhaler containing both formoterol and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), primarily budesonide in reviewed studies, with one study using beclomethasone.

Question 4.3

What is the comparative effectiveness of ICS with LABA used as both controller and quick-relief therapy compared to ICS with or without LABA used as controller therapy in individuals aged 5 years and older with persistent asthma?

Recommendation 12: In individuals aged 4 years and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy compared to either a higher-dose ICS as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy or the same-dose ICS-LABA as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy.

Strong recommendation, high certainty of evidence for ages 12 years and above, moderate certainty of evidence for ages 4 to 11 years

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

In individuals aged 4 years and older, the preferred Step 3 (low-dose ICS) and Step 4 (medium-dose ICS) therapy is single-inhaler ICS-formoterol both daily and as needed. In the literature, inhaled ICS-formoterol is referred to as "single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART)." This form of therapy has only been used with formoterol as the LABA. Formoterol has a rapid onset and a maximum total daily dose that allows it to be used more than twice daily. The maximum total daily dose of formoterol should not exceed 8 puffs (36 μg) for ages4 to11 years and12puffs (54 μg) for ages12 years and above. SMART is administered with a single inhaler containing both formoterol and an ICS (primarily budesonide in the reviewed studies, but one study used beclomethasone). The regimens compared to address this key question required two inhalers: the controller (ICS or ICS-LABA) and the reliever (SABA). The recommended alternate therapy of maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy does not need to be changed if it is providing adequate control. However, patients whose asthma is uncontrolled on such therapy should receive the preferred SMART if possible before moving to a higher step of therapy.

### Croup [^40f4fc34]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Croup leads to signs of upper airway obstruction, and must be differentiated from acute epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, or an inhaled foreign body. Croup affects about 3% of children a year, usually between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, and 75% of infections are caused by Parainfluenza virus. Symptoms usually resolve within 48 hours, but severe infection can, rarely, lead to pneumonia, and to respiratory failure and arrest.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in children with: mild croup; moderate to severe croup; and impending respiratory failure because of severe croup? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 43 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, corticosteroids, dexamethasone (intramuscular, oral, single-dose oral, route of administration), heliox, humidification, intermittent positive pressure breathing, L-adrenaline, nebulised adrenaline (epinephrine), nebulised budesonide, nebulised short-acting beta(2) agonists, oral decongestants, oral prednisolone, oxygen, and sedatives.

### A randomised, double-blind trial comparing budesonide formulations and dosages for short-term treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis [^1082aa36]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Of note, comparisons between individual trials in EoE are hampered by differences in study designs, definitions of histological response, and even technical differences such as the area of high power fields among different microscopes. Nevertheless, the histological remission rates observed in our study confirm, or even seem to exceed, those from previous randomised controlled trials in adult and paediatric EoE which essentially studied swallowed nebulised corticosteroid formulations originally designed for pulmonary treatment. Interestingly, all patients in this trial who received budesonide effervescent tablet 1 mg twice daily achieved histological remission, and therefore no additional benefit could be shown for the higher dose of 2 mg twice daily. Similarly, all patients who completed treatment with the viscous suspension reached histological remission. This impressive effect could be explained by the higher dose of budesonide (2 mg twice daily) used in our study compared with previous studies examining viscous suspensions.

So far, three randomised controlled trials of budesonide in EoE have been published. Major differences between these trials include mode of drug delivery, treatment duration and patient selection. In the study by Straumann et al,18 adult or adolescent patients with EoE were exposed to a viscous budesonide suspension at a dose of 2×1 mg per day given for 15 days. The patient population (including the number of patients with previous steroid exposure), the histological remission and response rates as well as the improvement in endoscopic abnormalities were comparable with our observations. Dohil et al reported on 15 paediatric patients exposed to viscous budesonide suspension for 3 months at a daily dose of 1 mg or 2 mg depending on the patient's body weight. Importantly, all patients received concomitant lansoprazole. In that trial, 13 patients (87.5%) were classified as responders based on the mean peak eosinophil count per hpf, which may not be the optimal histological metric to determine histological response. Nevertheless, the differences to placebo were striking. Finally, Dellon et al compared topical budesonide 2×1 mg per day delivered either as viscous suspension or in a nebulised form taken orally by 25 adult, steroid-naive patients with EoE for a duration of 8 weeks. This elegant study clearly demonstrated superiority of the viscous suspension over the nebulised application form with regards to the mucosal contact time of the drug as well as histological and endoscopic responses.

Results of the 3 controlled clinical trials for recommended dosages of budesonide inhalation suspension (0.25 mg to 0.5 mg once or twice daily, or 1 mg once daily, up to a total daily dose of 1 mg) in 946 patients, 12 months to 8 years of age, are presented below. Statistically significant decreases in nighttime and daytime symptom scores of asthma were observed at PULMICORT RESPULES doses of 0.25 mg once daily (one study), 0.25 mg twice daily, and 0.5 mg twice daily compared to placebo. Use of PULMICORT RESPULES resulted in statistically significant decreases in either nighttime or daytime symptom scores, but not both, at doses of 1 mg once daily, and 0.5 mg once daily (one study). Symptom reduction in response to PULMICORT RESPULES occurred across gender and age. Statistically significant reductions in the need for bronchodilator therapy were also observed at all the doses of PULMICORT RESPULES studied.

Improvements in lung function were associated with PULMICORT RESPULES in the subgroup of patients capable of performing lung function testing. Statistically significant increases were seen in FEV1[PULMICORT RESPULES 0.5 mg once daily and 1 mg once daily (one study); 0.5 mg twice daily] and morning PEF [PULMICORT RESPULES 1 mg once daily (one study); 0.25 mg twice daily; 0.5 mg twice daily] compared to placebo.

### Add-on therapy options in asthma not adequately controlled by inhaled corticosteroids: a comprehensive review [^26fafaa9]. Respiratory Research (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay of current asthma management and should be used in all patients with persistent asthma. Many patients with persistent asthma can be controlled with regular ICS. However, a considerable proportion of patients treated with ICS remain symptomatic, despite the use of low to moderate doses (doses defined according to the ATS classification for adults: beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) 200–1000 μg/d, budesonide 200–800 μg/d or fluticasone propionate (FP) 100–500 μg/d) of ICS. Based on the differences in potency and pharmacokinetics the doses could also be defined differently. Recent treatment guidelines classify these patients as having moderate to severe persistent asthma (steps 3 and 4). According to the recent guideline the typical clinical features of step 3 asthma include symptoms daily, nocturnal symptoms at least once a week, exacerbations that may affect activity or sleep, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 60–80% of predicted or peak expiratory flow (PEF) between 60 and 80% of the personal best reading. Daily rescue therapy is usually needed. Typical findings include low values of PEF or FEV 1, a marked variation in daily PEF recordings and/or a significant response to bronchodilators. Thus, asthma is not adequately controlled, and the treatment needs to be optimized.

Interpretation

This phase 3 trial in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma confirms the contribution of both albuterol and budesonide components to the lung function efficacy of albuterol-budesonide (thus satisfying the FDA combination rule), and its well-tolerated AE profile even at regular relatively high daily doses.

### Efficacy of budesonide in moderate to severe asthma [^1895714f]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The worldwide prevalence of asthma is increasing by approximately 50% per decade. Budesonide is one of several inhaled corticosteroids available for the treatment of asthma and has been extensively evaluated in clinical trials.

Objective

This article reviews the published literature on the efficacy of budesonide in the management of adult and pediatric patients with moderate to severe asthma and compares budesonide with other inhaled corticosteroids and nonsteroidal treatment options.

Methods

All controlled, randomized studies in patients with moderate or severe asthma were considered for inclusion. Relevant studies were identified through a MEDLINE search of the period from 1980 to 2000 using the terms budesonide plus efficacy, with or without the termsfluticasone, mometasone, and beclomethasone. The manufacturer's reference database was used to identify additional publications.

Results

Budesonide is associated with a dose-response effect in adults and children with moderate to severe asthma. The data on budesonide are in line with the current recommendation for a high starting dose of inhaled corticosteroid (800 microg/d), followed by downward titration to the minimal effective dose. Budesonide administered by Turbuhaler (AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Wilmington, Del) dry-powder inhaler (DPI) was effective at a significantly lower dose than beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) administered by pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) (P = 0.009), whereas its efficacy was similar to that of BDP delivered by hydrofluoroalkane pMDI and that of fluticasone propionate administered by DPI. Inhaled budesonide therapy was shown to be oral corticosteroid sparing in patients with severe asthma, thus reducing the total corticosteroid dose and the risk of systemic side effects. Pulmicort Respules (AstraZeneca), a nebulized formulation, was effective in the treatment of moderate to severe asthma in patients aged ≥ 12 months.

Conclusions

Once- or twice-daily administration of budesonide delivered via the Turbuhaler and Pulmicort Respules systems has been shown to be well tolerated and efficacious in populations with moderate to severe asthma.

### Budesonide / formoterol or budesonide / albuterol as anti-inflammatory reliever therapy for asthma [^1b8c56d6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Overuse of reliever as short-acting beta-agonist and associated underuse of controller as inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) administered via separate inhalers results in worse asthma outcomes. Such discordance can be obviated by combining both controller and reliever in the same inhaler. So-called anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy comprises the use of a single inhaler containing an ICS such as budesonide (BUD) in conjunction with a reliever as either albuterol (ALB) or formoterol (FORM), to be used on demand, with variable dosing driven by asthma symptoms in a flexible patient-centered regimen. Global guidelines now support the use of BUD-ALB as AIR therapy to reduce exacerbations, either on its own in mild asthma or in conjunction with fixed-dose maintenance ICS-long-acting beta-agonist in moderate to severe asthma. Using BUD-FORM on its own allows patients to seamlessly move in an intuitive flexible fashion between AIR and maintenance and reliever therapy, by stepping up and down the dosing escalator across a spectrum of asthma severities. Head-to-head clinical studies are indicated to compare BUD-FORM versus BUD-ALB as AIR in mild asthma, and also BUD-FORM as maintenance and reliever therapy versus BUD-ALB as AIR plus maintenance ICS-long-acting beta-agonist in moderate to severe asthma. Patients should be encouraged to make an informed decision in conjunction with their health care professional regarding the best therapeutic option tailored to their individual needs, which in turn is likely to result in long-term compliance and associated optimal asthma control.

### Comparison of single 2000-microg dose treatment vs. sequential repeated-dose 500-microg treatments with nebulized budesonide in acute asthma exacerbations [^cb17d8ab]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

High repeated doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are recognized as having a more rapid improvement of outcomes than a single dose of ICS in severe acute asthma. However, to our knowledge, there has been no direct comparison of the early effects of single or repeated administration of the same total dosage of ICS in children with moderate to severe exacerbations of asthma.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of a single dose of 2000 microg of nebulized budesonide with 4 repeated doses of 500 microg of nebulized budesonide in 40 children with an acute asthma exacerbation.

Methods

Randomized, double-blind, parallel study that compared the efficacy of 2000 microg of nebulized budesonide, administered in a single dose, with repeated doses (4 doses of 500 microg each) during the first 90 minutes in 40 children (mean [SD] age, 10.7 [2.4] years) with an acute asthma exacerbation that required treatment with an oral corticosteroid. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second, asthma attack score, and oxygen saturation were evaluated at 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes after initial treatment. Oral corticosteroids were given to all patients at 90 minutes.

Results

There were no significant differences in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (P = 0.54) at any times between the groups. Also, asthma scores and oxygen saturation were not different in either group within 90 minutes (P = 0.51 and P = 0.64, respectively) and thereafter (P = 0.35 and P = 0.87, respectively).

Conclusion

The use of a single dose of nebulized budesonide is as effective as repeated administration of the same total dosage during the first 90 minutes before giving oral corticosteroids in children with moderate to severe exacerbations of asthma.

BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Methods and analysis

Investigational product

As-needed albuterol/budesonide pMDI was formulated as micronised albuterol and budesonide, co-suspended with spray-dried porous particles in a hydrofluoroalkane propellant. This novel co-suspension formulation (administered as two actuations of albuterol/budesonide pMDI 90/80 µg or 90/40 µg) ensures that patients will receive a consistent delivery of both drugs from each inhalation of the pMDI. Albuterol pMDI was used as a comparator, administered as two inhalations of 90 µg each.

The 180 µg albuterol dose was confirmed in two clinical trials, ANTORA and ASPEN. Dose ranging for budesonide was conducted in study PT008001 in patients with asthma (NCT02105012). The current study included budesonide doses separately investigated in the Single inhaler Maintenance And Reliever Therapy (SMART) trials (ie, 160 µg and 80 µg) in order to provide budesonide dose ranging information for as-needed albuterol/budesonide to reduce the risk of severe asthma exacerbations.

### Budesonide at different doses for chronic asthma [^70568f15]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled budesonide (BUD) is available in a range of doses for treating chronic asthma.

Objectives

To quantitatively assess the efficacy and safety of budesonide at different doses in order to establish whether a clinically significant dose response profile exists.

Search Strategy

A search was carried out for Controlled and Randomised Clinical Trials (RCTs) using the Cochrane Airways Group trial register, correspondence with trial authors and the manufacturer.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials in children and adults comparing one dose of budesonide to a second dose in the treatment of chronic asthma. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion and methodological quality.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer extracted data; authors were contacted to clarify missing information. Quantitative analyses where undertaken using Review Manager.

Main Results

24 studies were selected for inclusion in the review (3907 subjects). In non-oral steroid treated, mild to moderately severe asthma no clinically worthwhile differences in FEV1, morning PEFR, symptom scores or rescue beta2 agonist use were apparent across a dose range of 200–1600 mcg/d. However, in moderate to severe asthma there was a significant reduction in the likelihood of trial withdrawal due to asthma exacerbation with BUD 800 mcg/d compared to 200 mcg/d: RR 3.93 (95% CI, 1.4 to 10.9). This result was largely weighted by a single large high quality RCT. In a single study in patients receiving oral corticosteroids, clinically significant improvements favouring high dose BUD (1600 mcg/d) over low dose (200 mcg/d) were apparent for FEV1 and morning PEFR. In two studies there was no dose dependent oral steroid sparing effect for BUD 1600 mcg/d v 800 or 400 mcg/d. Statistically significant, dose dependent suppression of 24 hour urinary free cortisol excretion and serum cortisol post synthetic ACTH infusion over the dose range 800–3200 mcg/d were apparent but the clinical significance of these findings is unclear.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Budesonide exhibits a clinically significant dose response effect for improvement in FEV1 in severe asthma and reduction of exacerbations in moderate to severe asthma. No significant dose dependent improvements in FEV1, PEFR or symptoms are evident in non-oral steroid treated asthmatics with mild to moderate disease. Dose dependent alterations in sensitive measures of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function were evident but the clinical significance of these changes is unclear.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be administered twice daily by the orally inhaled route only. After inhalation, the patient should rinse the mouth with water without swallowing [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)].

Patients should be instructed to prime PULMICORT FLEXHALER prior to its initial use, and instructed to inhale deeply and forcefully each time the device is used.

The safety and efficacy of PULMICORT FLEXHALER when administered in excess of recommended doses have not been established.

After asthma stability has been achieved, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the possibility of side effects. For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dose after 1–2 weeks of therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, increasing the dose may provide additional asthma control.

2.1 Asthma

If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist should be taken for immediate relief.

Patients 18 Years of Age and Older: For patients 18 years of age and older, the recommended starting dosage is 360 mcg twice daily. In some adult patients, a starting dose of 180 mcg twice daily may be adequate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 720 mcg twice daily.

Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age: The recommended starting dosage is 180 mcg twice daily. In some pediatric patients, a starting dose of 360 mcg twice daily may be appropriate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 360 mcg twice daily.

For all patients, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dose after adequate asthma stability is achieved.

Improvement in asthma control following inhaled administration of budesonide can occur within 24 hours of initiation of treatment, although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks, or longer. Individual patients will experience a variable onset and degree of symptom relief.

If a previously effective dosage regimen of PULMICORT FLEXHALER fails to provide adequate control of asthma, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options (e.g., replacing the lower strength of PULMICORT FLEXHALER with the higher strength or initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered.

SECTION IV: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF INTERMITTENT ICS IN THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA

Background

Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages. Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3), published in 2007, suggested that intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings, but the evidence at that time was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond a recommendation based on expert consensus.

Definitions of terms used in this section

"Intermittent" ICS dosing in this section includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a LABA. "Intermittent ICS dosing" does not refer to a single regimen, and its definition is specified in each of the recommendations. Intermittent ICS dosing allows providers to prescribe specific doses, frequencies, and durations of ICS use. When to use intermittent ICS dosing could depend on an individual's decision (based on need, which is also known as "as-needed" or "pro re nata" dosing), a predefined index showing worsening asthma, or some other predefined criterion.

"Controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. Both controller therapy and intermittent dosing may involve daily use of a specific dose of an ICS. The terms "ICS-LABA" (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta 2 -agonist combination, typically in a single device) and "ICS-formoterol" indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler.

"Quick-relief" therapy refers to medications (eg, an inhaled SABA) used to treat acute symptoms or exacerbations. In this section, "as-needed" dosing (eg, of a SABA) is intermittent and is based on the patient's decision (Figs 2–4).

The definitions of "low-," "medium-," and "high-dose" ICS are based on the recommendations from EPR-3.

The term "puff" refers to a single actuation and inhalation of a medication delivered through any type of inhaler.

"Recurrent wheezing" as used for the studies included in this section is defined as three or more episodes of wheezing triggered by apparent respiratory tract infections in a child's lifetime or two episodes in the past year.

### The dose-response characteristics of inhaled corticosteroids when used to treat asthma: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^11b24e50]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids form the cornerstone of treatment for most patients with asthma. A range of compounds are available with a wide range of prescribable doses. In this overview, we summarize the findings from a number of Cochrane systematic reviews that have examined the relative benefits of different doses of beclometasone dipropionate, budesonide and fluticasone propionate when used to treat children and adults. The key findings are that all inhaled corticosteroids demonstrate a dose-response relationship for efficacy measures, but most of the benefit in mild-to-moderate severity disease is gained in the low-to-moderate dose range of each drug. In this group, high doses of fluticasone lead to small improvements in measures of control at the expense of a steep increase in the incidence of oral side-effects. In patients with severe disease who are dependent on oral steroids, there may be appreciable benefit in reducing oral steroids from very high compared with high doses of fluticasone.

### Add-on therapy options in asthma not adequately controlled by inhaled corticosteroids: a comprehensive review [^4bb9a90d]. Respiratory Research (2004). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Mean change from baseline in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) in patients treated with placebo or various doses of budesonide. A significant dose-response effect is seen. However, it should be noted that the difference between placebo and low-dose budesonide is greater than the difference between low-dose budesonide and high-dose budesonide and that there is no statistically significant difference between the various doses of budesonide. Reproduced from reference 33 with permission.

The dose-relationship of budesonide in the treatment of chronic asthma is a subject of a recent Cochrane review. In this meta-analysis including both children and adults (n = 3907) in non-oral steroid-treated mild to moderately severe asthmatics no clinically worthwhile differences in FEV 1, morning PEF, symptom scores or rescue β 2 -agonist use were apparent across a dose range of 200–1600 μg/d. However, in moderate to severe asthma there was a significant reduction in the likelihood of trial withdrawal due to asthma exacerbation with budesonide 800 μg/d compared with budesonide 200 μg/d. The reviewers also conclude that budesonide exhibits a significant improvements favouring high dose (1600 μg/d) over low dose (200 μg/d) for improvement in FEV 1 in severe asthma. Another recent meta-analysis combining 3 placebo-controlled studies with at least two different budesonide doses demonstrated a statistically significant dose-response for morning PEF and FEV 1 but not for evening PEF.

### Therapeutic margin of budesonide in patients with mild to severe asthma [^6a02d1f9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The therapeutic margin of a drug is the difference between the optimal effective dose and the dose at which unacceptable adverse effects occur. This margin is particularly important in the case of therapies that are used long term for the control of chronic illnesses, such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) in the treatment of asthma. Because data from controlled clinical studies indicate that the available ICSs have similar clinical efficacy, the safety profile is central to differentiating between them on the basis of their therapeutic margins. The main safety concern with long-term use and high doses of ICSs is systemic exposure that could result in such unwanted effects as cortisol suppression, a reduction in the final adult height of pediatric patients, and decreased bone mineral density.

Objective

This article reviews data from clinical trials, including long-term prospective studies, to compare the therapeutic margin of budesonide with those of other second-generation ICSs and to determine whether there are variations in the therapeutic margin with different delivery devices, severities of disease, or patient age.

Results

Based on the tolerability data for budesonide from short-term (6–12 wk) and long-term (1–9 y) studies in patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma, the dose-response and dose-tolerability curves for budesonide delivered by dry-powder inhaler can be plotted in parallel. The margin between these curves-the therapeutic margin-is favorable and consistent in pediatric and adult patients and at all degrees of asthma severity. Fewer tolerability data are available for other ICSS.

Conclusion

Whereas budesonide has clinical efficacy similar to that of other currently available ICSs, it has a good safety profile-and hence a favorable therapeutic margin-that is supported by long-term clinical data. Budesonides favorable therapeutic margin is probably a result of its pharmacokinetic and physical properties.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^bf7d6afb]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma Step 4 MART dosing — In Step 4, the MART regimen can be prescribed with medium-dose maintenance budesonide-formoterol or beclometasone-formoterol by increasing low-dose ICS-formoterol to 2 inhalations twice-daily; the reliever remains 1 inhalation of low-dose ICS-formoterol as needed. The usual dose for MART with budesonide-formoterol is 200/6 mcg metered dose (160/4.5 mcg delivered dose) and for beclometasone-formoterol is 100/6 mcg metered dose (delivered dose 84.6/5 mcg for pMDI and 81.9/5 mcg for DPI), and for Step 4 each is prescribed as two inhalations twice-daily plus one inhalation whenever needed for symptom relief. As in Step 3, the maximum recommended total dose of budesonide-formoterol in a single day (total of maintenance-and-reliever doses) gives 72 mcg metered dose (54 mcg delivered dose) of formoterol; based on this evidence, GINA suggests the same maximum total dose should also apply for MART with beclometasone-formoterol (maximum total 12 inhalations, total metered dose 72 mcg), and most patients need far fewer doses than this.

Data extraction

Extraction of data was based on reported data summaries. These included counts and proportions of the number of participants in each treatment arm with a categorical outcome of interest. For continuous variables, we extracted means and standard deviations and the number of participants with these outcomes. The standard deviations, when not explicitly reported, were derived from reported standard errors or confidence intervals. The primary efficacy outcome variable for this analysis was risk of severe exacerbations, defined as the reported number of participants with at least one exacerbation, divided by the number of participants randomised to the treatment regimen, and with severe exacerbations defined according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) criteria. Secondary outcome variables were a measure of asthma control (preferably the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score), a measure of lung function (preferably the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and budesonide/formoterol doses.

### Role of budesonide inhalation suspension in children with asthma [^1b007ce9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of budesonide inhalation suspension (BIS) in the treatment of children with asthma.

Data Sources

Literature identified through Medline (1966-November 2000) and references obtained from selected articles. Search terms included budesonide and asthma.

Data Synthesis

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects approximately 4.8 million children in the US. By reducing inflammation, corticosteroids decrease symptoms and improve lung function. As the first nebulized corticosteroid, BIS offers an important treatment option for children with persistent asthma.

Conclusions

BIS is effective in reducing symptoms and improving lung function in children with asthma. It should be used in children ages 1–8 years with moderate to severe persistent asthma who are unable to effectively use a metered-dose inhaler with or without a spacer or a dry-powder inhaler.

Asthma — SMART versus same-dose inhaled corticosteroid–long-acting beta-agonist (ICS-LABA) controller therapy in ages 12 years and above — was evaluated in four blinded and two unblinded randomized controlled trials that collectively showed a 32% reduction in exacerbations with SMART (high certainty of evidence), with two studies using the Asthma Control Questionnaire 5-item (ACQ-5) showing clinically significant improvements; across three blinded studies (total 7555 participants) SMART used 160/9 or 320/9 μg budesonide-formoterol daily with up to 10 rescue puffs (total daily dose of 12 puffs or 54 μg formoterol) versus rescue SABA and significantly reduced exacerbations, while another blinded study (N = 1813) using beclomethasone-formoterol 100/6 μg two puffs daily with up to six rescue puffs (total daily dose of 48 μg formoterol) found severe exacerbations and systemic corticosteroid use were significantly lower with SMART but asthma control scores (ACQ-7) did not differ; an unblinded trial enrolled 2143 participants and reported a 20% RR decline with SMART using budesonide-formoterol 640/18 μg versus fluticasone/salmeterol 500/100 μg, and a reanalysis in 4,044 participants showed a 38% RR reduction.

### Albuterol-budesonide fixed-dose combination rescue inhaler for asthma [^2f8dfb9d]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

As asthma symptoms worsen, patients typically rely on short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA) rescue therapy, but SABAs do not address worsening inflammation, which leaves patients at risk for severe asthma exacerbations. The use of a fixed-dose combination of albuterol and budesonide, as compared with albuterol alone, as rescue medication might reduce the risk of severe asthma exacerbation.

Methods

We conducted a multinational, phase 3, double-blind, randomized, event-driven trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of albuterol-budesonide, as compared with albuterol alone, as rescue medication in patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma who were receiving inhaled glucocorticoid-containing maintenance therapies, which were continued throughout the trial. Adults and adolescents (≥ 12 years of age) were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three trial groups: a fixed-dose combination of 180 μg of albuterol and 160 μg of budesonide (with each dose consisting of two actuations of 90 μg and 80 μg, respectively [the higher-dose combination group]), a fixed-dose combination of 180 μg of albuterol and 80 μg of budesonide (with each dose consisting of two actuations of 90 μg and 40 μg, respectively [the lower-dose combination group]), or 180 μg of albuterol (with each dose consisting of two actuations of 90 μg [the albuterol-alone group]). Children 4 to 11 years of age were randomly assigned to only the lower-dose combination group or the albuterol-alone group. The primary efficacy end point was the first event of severe asthma exacerbation in a time-to-event analysis, which was performed in the intention-to-treat population.

Results

A total of 3132 patients underwent randomization, among whom 97% were 12 years of age or older. The risk of severe asthma exacerbation was significantly lower, by 26%, in the higher-dose combination group than in the albuterol-alone group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62 to 0.89; P = 0.001). The hazard ratio in the lower-dose combination group, as compared with the albuterol-alone group, was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.71 to 1.00; P = 0.052). The incidence of adverse events was similar in the three trial groups.

Conclusions

The risk of severe asthma exacerbation was significantly lower with as-needed use of a fixed-dose combination of 180 μg of albuterol and 160 μg of budesonide than with as-needed use of albuterol alone among patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma who were receiving a wide range of inhaled glucocorticoid-containing maintenance therapies.

inhalation aerosol, formulated as a pressurized metered dose inhaler that delivers a combination of either 40 or 80 micrograms of budesonide and 90 micrograms of albuterol sulfate per actuation. The Applicant has developed 2 dosing regimens and strengths: for patients 12 years of age and older, the. Applicant proposes to market a dose of 2 inhalations of 80 micrograms budesonide and 90 micrograms albuterol sulfate, resulting in 160 micrograms of budesonide and 180 micrograms of albuterol per dose. For patients 4 to 11 years of age, the Applicant proposes 2 inhalations of 40 micrograms budesonide and. 90 micrograms albuterol, resulting in 80 and 180 micrograms, respectively, per dose. For both populations, the recommended maximum usage is not to exceed 6 doses or 12 inhalations in 24 hours. The indication proposed by the Applicant is "for the as-needed treatment or prevention of. old. Subjects 4 to 11 were randomized 1: 1 to either low dose BDA or albuterol only.

During the screening period, all subjects replaced their pre-enrollment reliever treatment with Applicant-provided Ventolin HFA but controller medications were not adjusted; throughout both the screening and treatment periods, subjects continued their background controller medications, listed in the bottom. times daily, and during the treatment period subjects used the investigative product four times daily on top of background Applicant-provided Ventolin HFA. All subjects were followed for an additional 2 week safety follow up period. Slide 19 The DENALI population was consistent with a mild asthma population, correlating approximately with GINA guideline steps 1 through 2 in terms of background treatment. The left column lists the key inclusion criteria, which included parameters for baseline medications. FEV1, and screening-period Ventolin use.

In Step 1, the recommendation for as-needed, low-dose ICS–formoterol for adults and adolescents with symptoms less than twice per month is supported by indirect evidence for a large reduction in the risk of severe exacerbations, compared with as-needed SABA alone. Extension of this recommendation to Step 1 was also supported by several important considerations:

- Historically, recommendations for as-needed SABA alone were never supported by evidence of long-term safety or efficacy; early guidelines had assumed that patients with mild asthma would not benefit from ICS and were concerned about its risks based on experience with OCS.
- The past distinction between eligibility for Step 1 and Step 2 treatment based on symptom frequency (e.g. ≤ or > 2 d/wk) was arbitrary, not evidence-based.
- The use of as-needed ICS–formoterol markedly reduces severe exacerbations, compared with as-needed SABA, even in patients with SABA use less than or equal to two times per week at baseline (so-called intermittent asthma).
- A single day with more than two, more than four, more than six, or more than eight doses of as-needed budesonide–formoterol reduced the short-term (21-d) risk of severe exacerbations, compared with as-needed SABA alone (post hoc analysis). A similar effect was seen with ICS–formoterol MART in Steps 3–4.
- Even modest overuse of SABA (e.g. dispensing three or more albuterol canisters per year, i.e. average of ⩾1.6 puffs/d) is associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations and, in one study, higher asthma mortality.
- Even occasional short courses of OCS (e.g. four to five courses over 7 yr [i.e. less than one course per year]), are associated with significant short-term risks and cumulative risks of long-term adverse effects such as osteoporosis and diabetes.
- Regular, daily, low-dose ICS treatment is highly effective in reducing asthma symptoms and risk, including in patients with infrequent symptoms, but poor adherence to ICS is common, exposing patients to the risks of SABA-only treatment.
- As-needed budesonide–formoterol is well tolerated in mild asthma.
- Starting treatment with SABA alone trains the patient to regard it as their primary asthma treatment.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^27f9adbd]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Beclometasone-formoterol MART maximum daily formoterol dosing is supported by randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses in approximately 40,000 patients showing as-needed budesonide-formoterol up to a maximum total of 72 mcg formoterol (54 mcg delivered dose) in a single day for adults and adolescents, and GINA suggests the same maximum total dose of formoterol (with ICS) in a single day (72 mcg metered dose) should also apply for adults and adolescents prescribed MART with beclometasone-formoterol 100/6 mcg, i.e. a maximum total of 12 inhalations in a single day; for children 6–11 years on MART with budesonide-formoterol, the maximum recommended total dose is 48 mcg metered dose (36 mcg delivered dose).

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^824f2c71]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma — SMART in milder asthma and in children aged 4 to 11 years — was assessed in post hoc analyses showing that among 1239 participants aged 12 years and older with milder asthma (daily maintenance ICS dose equal to 400 μg or less budesonide equivalent), SMART reduced exacerbations overall, but in those with the mildest asthma at enrollment (rescue SABA use of ≤ 1 inhalation/d) benefit was marginal and statistically nonsignificant; in a pediatric analysis of 224 children aged 4 to 11 years on medium to high ICS doses (200–500 μg daily), SMART used budesonide-formoterol 80/4.5 μg once daily with up to seven additional rescue puffs (total daily dose of 36 μg formoterol) versus budesonide 320 μg daily with SABA, yielding a 57% drop in the RR for a composite exacerbation measure, significantly fewer nighttime awakenings, lower daily ICS dose (average 123 vs 320 μg), and improved growth rates (adjusted mean difference of 1 cm compared with fixed-dose budesonide).

### Tiotropium-what role in asthma? [^501a5753]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2015). Low credibility.

Tiotropium solution for inhalation (Spiriva Respimat - Boehringer Ingelheim) is the first long-acting muscarinic antagonist to be marketed in the UK for the management of asthma. It is licensed as add-on maintenance bronchodilator treatment in adults with asthma who are using an inhaled corticosteroid (≥ 800μg budesonide/day or equivalent) and a long-acting beta2 agonist, and who have had one or more severe exacerbations in the previous year. This corresponds to use at step 4 of both the British asthma guideline and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) strategy for the treatment of asthma in adults. Here we consider the evidence for tiotropium in the management of asthma and whether it offers any advantages over existing therapeutic options at step 4.

Intermittent ICS use — background, scope, and key questions: Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages, and although intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings, prior evidence was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond expert consensus; in this update, given the range of options and the number of comparisons embedded in the three key questions for this priority topic, the Expert Panel made five recommendations, with most studies using comparative efficacy designs and with evidence insufficient to support recommendations for all of the comparators; additionally, the Expert Panel did not address the efficacy and safety of types of intermittent ICS treatment not mentioned in the key questions, specifically as-needed ICS-formoterol versus as-needed SABA in Step 1 (intermittent asthma) or Steps 5 and 6 (severe asthma) treatment.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^e1ab6369]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Budesonide-formoterol reliever therapy (SMART) — comparative evidence is summarized as follows. In participants aged 12 years and older, daily budesonide-formoterol (640/18 μg) plus SMART was compared with daily fluticasone-salmeterol (1000/100 μg) plus SABA, and daily budesonide-formoterol (320/9 μg) plus SMART was compared with either daily budesonide-formoterol (640/18 μg) or daily fluticasone-salmeterol (500/100 μg) plus SABA. These trials showed significant reductions in exacerbations with SMART, but the studies found no differences between groups in asthma control or quality of life; SMART also resulted in statistically significant reductions in corticosteroid use but had no significant effect on asthma quality of life or asthma control, and as a result the recommendation was conditional. Data were insufficient to make a recommendation regarding whether SMART is superior to daily higher-dose ICS-LABA with SABA for quick-relief therapy in children aged 4 to 11 years. The systematic review also identified five open-label, real-world trials comparing daily budesonide-formoterol (160–320/4.5–9 μg) plus SMART with conventional best practice (total N = 5056), and in general the real-world studies confirmed the results from the RCTs that used SMART.
