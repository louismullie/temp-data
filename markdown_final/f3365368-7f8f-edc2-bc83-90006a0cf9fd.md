## Question

ESR less than 1

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) less than 1 mm/hr means, how to interpret it, and what actions to take next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the normal reference ranges for ESR and whether less than 1 mm/hr is physiologically plausible. Then, I should verify technical and pre-analytical factors that could artifactually depress ESR. Next, I will consider rare clinical contexts where a very low ESR might be meaningful. After that, I should review the test's limitations and when to trust versus repeat or replace it. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, context-driven recommendation for interpretation and follow-up, including when to ignore, repeat, or escalate evaluation.

> Let me first confirm the normal ranges and whether less than 1 mm/hr is even possible. Typical adult ESR reference ranges are about 0–22 mm/hr for men and 0–29 mm/hr for women, with method- and lab-specific cutoffs, so an ESR less than 1 mm/hr is technically within normal but extremely low and unusual in routine practice [^fe6b28fa]. Wait, let me verify the method dependency: the Westergren method is the reference standard, and automated or modified methods can introduce variability, which matters when interpreting an outlier like this [^82781704].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check for pre-analytical and technical issues that can artifactually lower ESR. Improper tube orientation, vibration, temperature extremes, delayed processing, or nonstandard methods can impair rouleaux formation and depress sedimentation; using fresh blood controls and ensuring proper Westergren technique improves reliability, so a repeat ESR with attention to method and timing is prudent when the value is implausibly low [^82781704] [^f5d7048e]. I should also confirm whether the lab reported units correctly and whether the specimen was handled per standardization guidance before concluding anything clinical from a value this low [^82781704].

> Next, I should review whether a very low ESR ever carries clinical meaning. In the absence of inflammation, ESR is determined largely by plasma proteins such as fibrinogen and globulins, and by red cell factors like size and hematocrit; in inflammation-free cohorts, sex and fibrinogen, hemoglobin, globulin, and triglycerides explain much of ESR variance, and age did not independently drive ESR in that specific analysis, which helps frame why an ESR near zero can occur in health [^a3c06741]. But wait, what if the patient is profoundly hypofibrinogenemic or has polycythemia vera with markedly increased red cell mass and impaired rouleaux? Those are rare scenarios where a very low ESR could reflect altered plasma proteins or red cell properties, so I should consider the full blood count and clinical context before attributing significance [^f5d7048e].

> I will now examine the clinical contexts where ESR is actually useful, to avoid overinterpreting an isolated low value. ESR is nonspecific and influenced by many factors; in suspected temporal arteritis, a normal ESR meaningfully lowers the likelihood of disease, but even there, a subset can have normal ESR at presentation, so a very low ESR does not absolutely exclude disease and must be integrated with symptoms and exam [^6bb3a535] [^a2305f9e]. In prosthetic joint infection, normal ESR and CRP together provide a strong negative likelihood, yet guidelines still caution that normal values do not rule out infection, reinforcing that a very low ESR alone cannot be used to exclude disease [^63e560ba] [^a8356f60]. In pediatric musculoskeletal infection, ESR lacks discriminatory utility for diagnosis and is not recommended for routine differentiation of bacterial from nonbacterial arthritis, so a very low ESR should not reassure in that setting either [^c37454da] [^1e13da98].

> Let me consider the test's limitations more broadly, because that shapes how much weight to give an outlier ESR. ESR rises and falls more slowly than CRP, is affected by age, sex, anemia, renal function, and low albumin, and can be discordant with CRP; importantly, up to 40–45% of patients with active inflammatory disease can have normal ESR, so a normal or very low ESR never rules out pathology when pretest probability is high [^f5d7048e] [^afb6175e] [^d87e3693] [^9589bcf3]. I should double-check whether CRP was measured and whether it aligns with the clinical picture, because CRP is more sensitive to acute inflammation and less confounded by some of these factors [^6128ec2b].

> Now, I should synthesize interpretation and next steps. An ESR less than 1 mm/hr is most often a technical or biological variant within normal, especially if the patient is asymptomatic and other labs are unremarkable; repeating the ESR with attention to method and timing is reasonable if the result is unexpected or discordant with the clinical picture [^82781704] [^f5d7048e]. If symptoms or signs suggest inflammation or infection, I should not be reassured by a very low ESR; instead, I should order CRP, assess the history and exam, and proceed with disease-specific diagnostics as indicated, recognizing that normal inflammatory markers do not exclude serious disease when suspicion is high [^63e560ba] [^c37454da] [^6bb3a535]. Conversely, if the patient is well and the rest of the evaluation is normal, no further action is needed beyond documentation and, if uncertainty remains, repeating the test under optimal conditions [^f5d7048e].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is specific, like suspected giant cell arteritis or prosthetic joint infection? In those scenarios, I should confirm that ESR and CRP were both obtained and interpret them in combination with pretest probability, because a very low ESR alone cannot safely exclude disease when the stakes are high, and guidelines explicitly warn against relying on a single normal inflammatory marker to rule out infection or vasculitis [^6bb3a535] [^63e560ba] [^a8356f60]. If the ESR remains implausibly low on repeat and the clinical question persists, I should verify the laboratory method, consider alternative explanations such as hypofibrinogenemia or marked polycythemia, and escalate evaluation based on the suspected condition rather than anchoring on the ESR value [^f5d7048e].

---

An ESR less than 1 mm/hr is **physiologically possible** but extremely rare, typically reflecting **technical error** or **low plasma protein states** (hypofibrinogenemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, polycythemia, or marked leukocytosis) [^f5d7048e] [^a3c06741]. It is not associated with specific diseases and should prompt **verification of the method**, specimen quality, and clinical context before interpretation [^82781704] [^f5d7048e]. If confirmed, it generally indicates **absence of inflammation** and no immediate clinical concern, but persistent very low ESR with compatible symptoms may warrant evaluation for plasma protein disorders [^f5d7048e].

---

## Physiological basis of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)

ESR measures the rate at which red blood cells settle in a vertical column over one hour, driven by rouleaux formation from acute-phase proteins (fibrinogen, immunoglobulins) [^c4b6655e]. Normal ESR reflects a balance between pro- and anti-rouleaux factors; **very low ESR** implies minimal rouleaux-promoting proteins or altered RBC properties [^a3c06741].

---

## Clinical significance of extremely low ESR values

An ESR less than 1 mm/hr is **exceedingly rare** and not linked to specific diseases. It may reflect:

- **Technical error**: Improper tube orientation, vibration, temperature, or delayed processing can artifactually lower ESR [^f5d7048e].
- **Low plasma protein states**: Hypofibrinogenemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, or marked leukocytosis can reduce rouleaux and sedimentation [^a3c06741].
- **Altered RBC properties**: Polycythemia or spherocytosis can impair settling [^f5d7048e].

---

## Conditions associated with extremely low ESR values

Although no disease specifically causes ESR < 1 mm/hr, **associated contexts** include:

| **Condition** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Hypofibrinogenemia | Reduced rouleaux formation |
| Hypogammaglobulinemia | Reduced immunoglobulins |
| Polycythemia vera | Increased RBC mass impeding settling |
| Marked leukocytosis | RBC crowding |
| Technical errors | Artifactual depression |

---

## Clinical implications and management

An ESR less than 1 mm/hr is **not clinically concerning** in isolation; management focuses on:

- **Verification**: Repeat ESR using standardized Westergren method and ensure proper specimen handling [^82781704] [^f5d7048e].
- **Clinical context**: Interpret alongside symptoms, signs, and other labs (e.g. CRP, plasma proteins) [^afb6175e].
- **Further evaluation**: If persistent with compatible symptoms (e.g. recurrent infections), assess for plasma protein disorders (immunoglobulins, fibrinogen) [^a3c06741].

---

## Limitations and considerations

ESR is nonspecific and influenced by multiple factors; **very low values** are more often technical than pathological. Always correlate with the **clinical picture** and consider repeating the test or using **alternative markers** (e.g. CRP) when results are discordant [^afb6175e] [^6128ec2b].

---

An ESR less than 1 mm/hr is **rare and usually reflects technical issues or low plasma protein states** rather than disease. Confirm the result, assess the clinical context, and pursue targeted testing only if indicated.

### Why shouldn' T we determine the erythrocyte sedimentation rate? [^a4d81e04]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

A test that is meant to measure a given parameter is more likely to detect changes in that parameter if it is not affected by factors other than those which it is intended to quantitate. The clinical use of the laboratory test for determining the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is backed by nearly a century of experience. Although its nonspecificity is acknowledged, it has been used to quantitate the inflammatory process that underlies infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic disorders. I believe that this venerable test is affected by too many factors in addition to that which we think we are measuring, to the point that its clinical usefulness is severely compromised.

### What are the optimal cutoff values for ESR and CRP to diagnose osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes-related foot infections? [^c82aca29]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Distinguishing osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection of the foot is important because osteomyelitis is associated with more operations, amputation, and prolonged antibiotic exposure. Both erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are routinely ordered inflammatory biomarkers for evaluating foot infection. When initial evaluation is inconclusive, advanced imaging is indicated, and high clinical or radiographic suspicion of osteomyelitis may indicate bone biopsy to identify organisms and antibiotic sensitivity. Although ESR and CRP levels are helpful for distinguishing osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infections in patients with diabetes-related foot infections, parameters regarding optimal cutoff values for those tests have not, to our knowledge, been defined.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What are the optimal cutoff values for ESR and CRP to differentiate osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection in patients with diabetes-related foot infection? (2) Can a diagnostic algorithm be derived to guide interpretation of ESR and CRP to improve recognition of osteomyelitis in the setting of diabetic foot infection?

Methods

The medical records of 1842 patients between 18 and 89 years of age treated at our institution between January 1, 2010 and February 6, 2017 for foot infection were reviewed. For inclusion, patients must have had a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, moderate or severe infection, ESR and CRP values within 72 hours of admission, either advanced imaging (MRI or single-positron emission computed tomography/computed tomography [SPECT/CT]) or bone biopsy during admission and must not have had comorbidities that could affect ESR and CRP, such as autoimmune disorders. As such, 1489 patients were excluded, and 353 patients were included in the study. Osteomyelitis was diagnosed by positive bone culture or histopathology. Osteomyelitis was considered to be absent if there was a negative MRI or SPECT/CT result, or negative bone culture and histology findings if imaging was inconclusive. We identified 176 patients with osteomyelitis and 177 with soft-tissue infection. A blinded investigator performed the statistics. Optimal cutoffs of ESR and CRP were determined using receiver operative characteristic (ROC) analysis. A diagnostic algorithm was determined using epidemiologic principles of screening evaluations.

Results

An ESR of 60 mm/h and a CRP level of 7.9 mg/dL were determined to be the optimal cutoff points for predicting osteomyelitis based on results of the ROC analysis. The ESR threshold of 60 mm/h demonstrated a sensitivity of 74% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67-80) and specificity of 56% (95% CI, 48-63) for osteomyelitis, whereas the CRP threshold of 7.9 mg/dL had a sensitivity of 49% (95% CI, 41-57) and specificity of 80% (95% CI, 74-86). If the ESR is < 30 mm/h, the likelihood of osteomyelitis is low. However, if ESR is > 60 mm/h and CRP level is > 7.9 mg/dL, the likelihood of osteomyelitis is high, and treatment of suspected osteomyelitis should be strongly considered.

Conclusions

While ESR is better for ruling out osteomyelitis initially, CRP helps distinguish osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection in patients with high ESR values. Further prospective studies addressing the prognostic value of ESR and CRP are needed, and a more comprehensive diagnostic algorithm should be developed to include other diagnostic tests such as probe-to-bone and imaging.

IWGDF/IDSA—Inflammatory biomarkers for suspected diabetes-related foot osteomyelitis (DFO): a 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis found that procalcitonin (PCT) had the highest diagnostic test accuracy with sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 0.85, 0.67 and 0.844 at a cut-off value of 0.33 ng/mL; a large single-centre study reported that ESR >60 mm/hr plus CRP ≥80 mg/L had a high positive predictive value but a modest negative predictive value for DFO; another study showed that elevated ESR (>43 mm/h) with a positive probe-to-bone (PTB) test had a high correlation with positive bone culture and/or histology; overall, neither plain x-ray, inflammatory biomarkers nor probe-to-bone tests can solely and reliably rule in or rule out DFO, and when diagnostic doubt persists after the clinical assessment and review of plain X-rays of the foot, we recommend testing for ESR, CRP, or PCT, noting that this recommendation is conditional and based on low-quality and inconsistent diagnostic accuracy evidence.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP)—diagnostic role and limitations in pediatric ABA: Blood markers of systemic inflammation, such as CRP, can aid in distinguishing ABA (particularly caused by S. aureus) from transient nonbacterial synovitis, though the serum CRP is usually, but not always, elevated at presentation. CRP alone, or when used with clinical history and examination, has insufficient specificity or sensitivity to confirm or rule-out ABA; however, obtaining a CRP at presentation is useful because, if elevated, it can be used to monitor appropriate response to management. A systematic review identified three prospective cohort studies and one retrospective case-control study assessing CRP diagnostic test accuracy in children with symptoms suspicious for musculoskeletal infections (2005 to 2022), which suggested very limited value for CRP as a confirmatory diagnostic test, with numeric cut-off levels varying and none establishing a definitive CRP value above which ABA should be suspected or below which it could be excluded. A recent prospective study reported an a posteriori optimal cut-off of 23.8 mg/L (2.38 md/dL) that has not been validated; another prospective cohort evaluated two CRP cut-offs, 100 and 500 mg/L (10 and 50 mg/dL); a third required abnormal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or CRP (>10 mm/hr and >100 mg/L respectively), and no evaluation of the children without elevated markers was reported.

### Erythrocyte sedimentation rate as an independent prognostic marker for mortality: a prospective population-based cohort study [^d2ece7ff]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is usually an indication of underlying pathology. Additionally, a moderately elevated ESR may also be attributable to biological ageing. Whether the ESR is a prognostic factor for mortality, regardless of age, has been scarcely investigated. Therefore, the objective was to analyse the association between elevated ESR levels and the risk of mortality in a prospective cohort of the general population.

Methods

We studied data from the Rotterdam Study (1990-2014). ESR levels were measured at baseline and individuals were followed until death or end of study. Associations between moderately (20-50 mm h -1 ) and markedly (>50 mm h -1 ) elevated ESR levels and all-cause mortality were assessed using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models.

Results

In total, 5226 participants were included, and the mean age was 70.3 years. During a median follow-up time of 14.9 years, 3749 participants died (71.7%). After adjustment, both a moderately elevated ESR and a markedly elevated ESR were associated with a significantly higher risk of overall mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-1.35 and HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.38-2.60, respectively]. Although the ESR becomes higher with age, in a group aged above 75 years, without any comorbidities, an ESR > 20 mm h -1 remained associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality (HR 1.29, 95%CI 1.01-1.64).

Conclusion

An elevated ESR is an independent prognostic factor for mortality. Despite the fact that ESR increases with age, it remains associated with an increased risk of mortality and warrants close follow-up.

### Quantitative target values of predictors of mortality in rheumatoid arthritis as possible goals for therapeutic interventions: an alternative approach to remission or ACR20 responses? [^23332422]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Predictors of longterm mortality in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) include patient questionnaire measures, grip strength, walk time, physician and patient assessment of global status, joint examination abnormalities, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and morning stiffness. In the rheumatology literature, these measures have been analyzed primarily according to mean values in groups or regression analyses, which are valuable to recognize that mortality in RA is predicted by more severe disease, but do not provide the clinician with specific goals of therapy. Goals for therapeutic intervention are often expressed either as complete remission or as statistically significant differences versus a placebo, as in a 20% or even 50% response of a measure such as the American College of Rheumatology Core Data Set. Remission may be too stringent, while statistically significant efficacy of a drug compared to placebo may not necessarily indicate effectiveness to control longterm damage. An alternative approach might be to identify possible target values for therapeutic efficacy that markers of a poor prognosis be "near normal" rather than necessarily at normal or remission levels, as has been explored in management of hypertension and diabetes. However, it remains uncertain whether the goal of therapy should be a "near normal" or entirely normal values for a clinical marker. Better control of quantitative markers that predict early mortality could provide a valuable approach to improving outcomes in RA.

### Very late relapses in Hodgkin lymphoma treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy: linear pattern and distinct prognostic factors [^5007f0e4]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The present study provided novel observations in an attempt to shed light on some of the questions raised above, which remained unanswered even after the large GHSG study.

First, we demonstrated that the linear pattern of VLRs continues beyond 20 years up to 25–30 years. Interestingly, we recorded the latest VLR at 35.1 years and recorded 8 cases beyond the 20th year.

Second, patients who did not receive RT were more likely to experience VLRs. If this is validated, it may impact the long-term results of recent randomized trials, which are awaited with great interest, because non-inferiority of CT vs. CMT may be affected.

Third, elevated ESR ≥ 50 mm/h was associated with lower VLR risk despite the marginally positive association of its strong correlates (stage and B-symptoms) with VLRs (HR ~1.2–1.5). Elevated ESR denotes biologically active, more aggressive disease, which may have a different biology related to PR/ER but also with some kind of long-term plateau and lower risk of VLR. Thus, some patients with advanced disease, probably those with delayed diagnosis and less inflammatory background reflected by lower ESR, may be more prone to the development of VLR. This hypothesis is supported by the progressively decreasing percentage of ESR ≥ 50 mm/h in patients with PR/ER, LR and VLR (Supplementary Table 1).

### The erythrocyte sedimentation rate in male adolescents and subsequent risk of Parkinson's disease: an observational study [^686e9fe3]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

SD standard deviation, BMI body mass index, BP blood pressure, PD Parkinson´s disease, ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate, EVF erythrocyte volume fraction

Individuals with higher ESRs were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with PD, as ESR was inversely associated with risk of PD. The hazard ratio (HR) for PD with basic adjustments (age at conscription, year of conscription, test center and EVF) was 0.94 (P = 0.02, 95% CI 0.89–0.99) per log 2 increase in ESR, corresponding to a two-fold increase in ESR (Table 2). Further adjustments for potential confounders (parental education, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and IQ) resulted in very small changes to the HR. In addition, ESR was modeled as a restricted cubic spline (Fig. 2). The association between ESR and PD risk was similar for increases in ESR up to 15 mm/h, leveled off for ESRs > 15 mm/h, and became non-significant at ESR values > 20 mm/h.

### Consensus document for the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infections: a joint paper by the EANM, EBJIS, and ESR (with ESCMID endorsement) [^a6ba7d1f]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

3. CRP and ESR should always be performed in patients with suspected prosthetic joint infection. A normal value does not rule out PJI.

Level of evidence: 2.

Patients presenting with clinical signs of prosthetic joint infection (i.e. fever, unexplained pain at the site of arthroplasty, prosthetic loosening, or a sinus tract) should be subjected to screening for inflammatory markers in serum. C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are good preliminary tests. Screening of these markers can be performed rapidly, inexpensively, and with minimal inconvenience. Although there is considerable variation in sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) for both CRP (SE 21–100%, SP 20–96%) and ESR (SE 58–97%, SP 33–90.9%), in general they show good diagnostic value, and are of relevance particularly for therapy follow-up. A threshold of 10 mg/l for CRP and 30 mm/h for ESR of is recommended for diagnostic purposes. One level 1 study and 32 level 2 studies addressed the diagnostic efficacy of CRP and ESR in serum [,–]. However, when testing for CRP and ESR, one should keep in mind that both markers can be influenced by numerous factors (i.e. neoplastic and inflammatory conditions, age, and technical details). Furthermore, CRP is produced in the liver, and especially in low-grade chronic PJI, levels may not be elevated. Therefore, a careful history and physical examination are mandatory. Several studies suggest using the combination of ESR and CRP. In any case, if one of these markers is above the threshold, further diagnostic tests should be performed. Low CRP and ESR do not rule out PJI.

### Assessment of placebo response in objective and subjective outcome measures in rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials [^b1e1bba0]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that objective and subjective outcome measures in rheumatoid arthritis trials improved to a clinically meaningful extent within the 5 trials in this analysis, showing that the placebo responses observed in this study are more than a psychological placebo effect. Correlation analyses of baseline level to placebo response showed moderate correlations; however, correlation between mean of baseline and week 12 and placebo response was poor or nonexistent. This low level could be caused by inclusion biased toward high baseline values, for example, minimum disease severity.A recent systematic review reinforces this view, finding increased placebo responses in clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis over the past 30 years and partly attributing these to inflated baseline measures.On the other hand, a meta-analysis suggested that the method of placebo delivery (eg, oral vs intra-articular) has a significant effect on placebo response in osteoarthritis trials,showing that the psychological dimension of the placebo response cannot be dismissed. Minimum levels at enrollment for these trials were between 0.63 and 1.47 mg/dL for CRP level or between 28 and 30 mm/h for ESR,,,,, which might be the main factors affecting these findings. A minimum pain level was not set as an inclusion criterion for any of the trials; however, the mean baseline level of 59 mm can be considered high and is linked to inflammation severity. Patients were stable with DMARD therapy across trials 1 to 4, while potentially naive patients were introduced to DMARDs in trial 5. Thus, we expected a higher response in the placebo arms of these trials due to the drug effect of DMARDs. We performed a separate analysis excluding this trial, yet the results stayed significant. While the magnitude of placebo response was clinically meaningful across pain, CRP level, and ESR, these findings are not necessarily in the same patients: correlations between improvement of pain and CRP level and ESR were only approximately 0.25. Even for the 2 objective inflammation markers (ESR and CRP level), the correlation was below 0.5. The correlation between week 12 and week 24 was moderate to high, showing that natural history, standard of care, and within-patient variability might explain another important part of the placebo response.

The clinical phase of rheumatoid arthritis in its natural history progresses slowly,making it difficult to compare with progression within a clinical study. However, CRP levels seem to increase even before clinical manifestation,, and improvement of the degree found in this study seems unlikely to happen as spontaneous, untreated remission.

### Diagnosis and prevention of periprosthetic joint infections [^63e560ba]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)—if both ESR and CRP were negative, the combined tests were strong at ruling out PJI (negative LR=0 to .06), and if both were positive they were useful for ruling in PJI (positive LR range=4.34 to 13.5). There is concern that ESR and CRP may be elevated in the early postoperative period, and three included studies evaluated these biomarkers for PJI in the early postoperative period. In hip and knee patients within 3 months of surgery, CRP (13.5mg/L) was reported as a weak test (positive LR=3.52; negative LR=0.24). Another moderate quality study in hip and knee patients showed CRP (23.5mg/L) to be a strong rule in test (positive LR=14.5) and a moderately good rule out test (negative LR=.14) within 4 weeks of surgery; in the same study ESR (54.5 mm/hr) was a strong rule in test (positive LR=11.4) but a weak rule out test (Negative LR=.21) for early PJI. A low-quality study of hip patients found ESR (44 mm/hr) was a moderately good rule out test within six weeks of surgery but was poor for ruling in PJI (positive LR=1.96; negative LR=.15), and in the same study CRP was a strong rule in test (positive LR=66.76).

### The erythrocyte sedimentation rate in male adolescents and subsequent risk of Parkinson's disease: an observational study [^0c744f60]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Systemic inflammation may be implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Since PD occurs usually in later life, most studies of causal factors are conducted in older populations, so potentially important influences from early life cannot be adequately captured. We investigated whether the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in early adulthood is associated with the subsequent development of PD in men. As part of Swedish national conscription testing conducted from 1968 through 1983 (N=716,550), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, as a measure of inflammation, was measured in 659,278 young men. The cohort was observed for subsequent PD events (N=1513) through December 2016. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CI with adjustment for potential confounders. Individuals with higher ESRs were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with PD, as ESR was linearly and inversely associated with PD risk. The magnitude of the association between ESR and PD risk was similar for increases up to 15 mm/h, leveled off thereafter, and was non-significant for ESR values>20 mm/h. The HR for PD with basic adjustments (age at conscription, year of conscription, test center and erythrocyte volume fraction) was 0.94 (95% CI 0.89-0.99, P=0.02) per log 2 increase in ESR, corresponding to a two-fold increase in ESR. Further adjustments for potential confounders (parental education, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and IQ) scarcely altered the HR. The results suggest a prospective association between high ESR and reduced risk for PD.

### The level of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis is determined early and remains stable over the longterm course of the illness [^a8d64443]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the level of inflammatory activity, determined by the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), changes over the longitudinal course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA); whether the level of inflammatory activity identified early in RA predicts longterm inflammatory status; and whether RA "bums out" after many years of inflammatory activity.

Methods

A total of 21,866 consecutive ESR determinations from 1,897 patients with RA were analyzed to determine the association of inflammatory activity, as estimated by ESR, with duration of disease. Data were modeled by generalized estimating equations and random selection fractional polynomial regression models, controlling for age, sex, and calendar date.

Results

In a nonlinear fashion, ESR decreased by 4 mm/h over the first 10 years of disease, remained stable over the next 25 years, and increased slightly thereafter. Patients treated more recently had lower ESR values. Patients with recent onset of RA, when stratified in quartiles of ESR, maintained their position over time.

Conclusion

Although ESR decreases by 4 mm/h over the first 10 years of disease, it remains stable or rises thereafter. The course of RA, as modeled by the ESR, appears to be "set" early in the disease and good and bad prognosis groups can be identified within the first 2 years. There is no evidence of general "burned out" RA or a lessening of disease activity with long duration of disease. Our findings tend to suggest that the ("usually treated") natural history of RA prior to introduction of antitumor necrosis factor agents is toward some degree of improvement in the early years. If the newer and combination therapies are indeed substantially better than what has been available, they must show a shifting of the curve downward, not just in the early years where it has occurred historically, but over the entire course of the illness.

### Premature therapeutic antimicrobial treatments can compromise the diagnosis of late periprosthetic joint infection [^870fc9e4]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In the absence of positive cultures and draining sinuses, the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) relies on laboratory values. It is unknown if administration of antibiotics within 2 weeks before diagnostic evaluations can affect these tests in patients with PJI.

Questions/Purposes

The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation of antibiotic administration with (1) fluctuations in the synovial fluid and serology laboratory values; and (2) sensitivity of the diagnostic tests in patients with late PJI (per Musculoskeletal Infection Society [MSIS] criteria).

Methods

Synovial white blood cell (WBC) count, polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) percentage, and serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) as well as culture results were investigated in 161 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty with late PJI diagnosed with the MSIS criteria. Depending on whether presampling antibiotics were used, patients were divided in two groups (53 [33%] patients were on antibiotics). The median laboratory values and the false-negative rates were compared between the two groups.

Results

The median of all variables were lower in the antibiotic group compared with the other group: ESR (mm/hr): 70 versus 85, difference of medians (DOM) = 15 mm/hr, p = 0.018; CRP (mg/L): 72 versus 130, DOM = 58 mg/L, p = 0.038; synovial WBC (cells/μL): 29,170 versus 46,900, DOM = 17,730, p = 0.022; and synovial PMN%: 88.5% versus 92.5%, DOM = 4%, p = 0.012. Furthermore, using the MSIS cutoffs, the false-negative rates of several parameters were higher in the antibiotic group; ESR: 19.2% (nine of 47) versus 6.1% (six of 99) (relative risk, 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-8.3; p = 0.020); CRP: 14.9% (seven of 47) versus 2.00% (two of 100) (relative risk, 7.4; 95% CI, 1.6-34.4); PMN%: 23.1% (12 of 52) versus 9.4% (10 of 106) (relative risk, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.2; p = 0.027). Patients in the antibiotic group also had higher rates of negative cultures: 26.4% (14 of 53) versus 12.9% (14 of 108) (relative risk, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.05-3.9; p = 0.046).

Conclusions

It appears that premature antibiotic treatments are associated with lower medians of diagnostic laboratory values. Thus, and in line with the guideline recommendations of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, patients with suspected late-PJI should not receive antibiotics until the diagnosis is reached or refuted.

### How to use the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in paediatrics [^f5d7048e]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) has become a ubiquitously used technique in medicine as a marker of systemic illness. The test involves placing anticoagulated whole blood into an upright test tube and monitoring the rate at which red blood cells (RBC) fall over time. Negative charges keep RBC from sticking together. If this charge is neutralised, RBC stack into chains, or rouleaux, and fall more rapidly. ESR can be measured with a variety of tests: Westergren and modified Westergren; Wintrobe; micro-ESR. The Westergren is the most commonly used method of performing the ESR. Technical factors, such as temperature, time from specimen collection, tube orientation and vibration, can affect the results. RBC size, shape and concentration impact the ESR. Plasma characteristics are also important determinants of the ESR. Other factors that can change ESR include age, sex, race, medications and disease states, such as obesity, hypofibrinogenaemia and congestive heart failure. Other acute-phase reactants besides the ESR include C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, complement, ferritin, plasma viscosity, serum amyloid A and albumin. When clinical suspicion for infection or inflammation is low, a normal ESR can reassure that there is no active disease. The slow rise (48h) and fall of the ESR relative to other acute-phase reactants may make it superior for monitoring inflammation in more chronic conditions. In conjunction with physical findings and other laboratory values, the ESR value can be used to screen for disease or disease complications, aid in disease diagnosis or assess disease activity or response to therapy.

### Erythrocyte sedimentation rate in patients with renal insufficiency and renal replacement therapy [^3b17a2eb]. Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Determination of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a simple diagnostic tool for estimating systemic inflammation. It remains unclear whether ESR is influenced by renal disease or renal replacement therapy (RRT).

Objective

To report the incidence and extent of ESR elevations in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the possible impact of RRT.

Methods

We performed a single-center, retrospective study in inpatients with or without renal disease and in those with RRT, comparing ESR levels and other laboratory and clinical information.

Results

A total of 203 patients were included. On average, ESR was elevated (mean [SD], 51.7 [34.6] mm/h), with no statistically significant difference between the patient groups. Only those receiving PD showed significantly higher ESR (78.3 [33.1] mm/h; P< .001).

Conclusions

ESR testing can be used without restriction in patients with CKD and in patients undergoing hemodialysis and who have received kidney transplantation; however, this measurement should be monitored carefully in patients with PD.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^c37454da]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in acute bacterial arthritis (ABA)—interpretive value and limitations: The Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) is usually, but not always, elevated in children with ABA at presentation and is usually higher in ABA than in transient nonbacterial synovitis or acute rheumatic fever, but overlap of ESR ranges precludes discriminatory utility, and the ESR often does not normalize until the fourth week after initiation of therapy; therefore, the Guideline Panel does not see value in the routine inclusion of ESR testing in children evaluated for suspected ABA to differentiate bacterial from non-bacterial causes of joint inflammation, the ESR does not substantially assist in pathogen assessment, and it has not been helpful for assessing adjacent musculoskeletal infection to determine need for extended antimicrobial therapy.

### ESR guidelines for the communication of urgent and unexpected findings [^917930b4]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

The timely communication of radiological findings is important for patient care. When imaging reveals abnormalities that require urgent action, or shows significant unexpected findings, the usual methods of communication may not be reliable enough to ensure that those responsible for clinical care of the patient act promptly. These guidelines suggest methods for improving communication in these circumstances, using clear protocols and procedures agreed between imaging units and referrers.                         Main Messages                      • Communicating critical radiological findings will enable urgent or appropriate action to be taken.                      • Good communication helps to improve patient safety.                      • Clear departmental protocols become familiar to referrers within the organisation.                      • Referrers should be aware of their responsibility to read and act on radiological reports.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2021 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in pediatrics [^1e13da98]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis—Historically, case series have described ESR elevation in 90% to 100% of children with AHO, but rates as low as 70% to 87% also have been reported, and ESR combined with CRP may slightly improve sensitivity and negative predictive value for the diagnosis of AHO, but specific thresholds and the overall clinical utility of using both CRP and ESR for diagnostic purposes remain uncertain. The ESR tends to rise more slowly than CRP in acute infection and to decrease more slowly than CRP in an appropriately treated infection; the ESR is no longer used routinely to diagnose AHO in children.

### Which measure of inflammation to use? A comparison of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein measurements from randomized clinical trials of golimumab in rheumatoid arthritis [^6128ec2b]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess clinical utility of measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP) versus Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in evaluating patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

Data from 3 randomized clinical trials of golimumab involving 1247 patients with RA in which ESR and CRP were obtained at baseline and Week 24, along with standard measures of clinical disease activity [swollen and tender joint counts, global disease activity assessment, composite Disease Activity Scores (DAS) and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)], were utilized. Result. Both ESR and CRP were significant predictors of swollen joint count (p < 0.001 for each). Only 4.5% of patients with no swollen joints had elevated CRP and normal ESR, but 15.2% had elevated ESR and normal CRP. ESR and CRP correlated significantly (Pearson r = 0.59, p < 0.001) with each other. DAS-ESR and DAS-CRP were highly correlated (r = 0.96, p < 0.001) with each other, although DAS-ESR values were slightly lower than the DAS-CRP values at the upper end of the range (DAS > 8). Both ESR and CRP were significantly associated with CDAI (p < 0.001 for each).

Conclusion

It is not necessary to obtain both ESR and CRP measures for clinical disease activity assessment in clinical trials of RA. Neither test adds significantly to clinical measures of disease activity including joint counts and global assessments. Where available, the CRP alone may be preferred for disease activity assessment as a simple, validated, reproducible, non age-dependent test.

### Systemic inflammation and intelligence in early adulthood and subsequent risk of schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses: a longitudinal cohort and co-relative study [^a4b1a8a3]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Baseline characteristics

Of the total sample of 638 213 Swedish men, at baseline 470 923 (73.79%) had an ESR level of 0–3 mm/h, 112 089 (17.56%) of 4–6 mm/h, 35 023 (5.49%) of 7–10 mm/h, and 20 178 (3.16%) of ⩾11 mm/h. ESR groups differed significantly in age at conscription, migration status, winter birth, parental socioeconomic status, and household crowding (all p < 0.05; Table 1). In total, 5398 (0.85%) and 5133 (0.80%) individuals in this population-based sample developed schizophrenia or ONAP until follow-up, respectively.

Table 1. 
Baseline characteristics of the sample

Associations between IQ, schizophrenia, and ONAP

With each one-point increase in IQ, risk decreased for schizophrenia (unadjusted HR = 0.963, 95% CI 0.961–0.964; adjusted HR = 0.961, 95% CI 0.960–0.963), and for ONAP (unadjusted HR = 0.974; 95% CI 0.972–0.976; adjusted HR = 0.973, 95% CI 0.971–0.975). Evidence for these associations remained after excluding individuals hospitalised within 2 years after conscription (online Supplementary Table 1).

Association between ESR and IQ

Higher ESR was associated with lower IQ at the time of conscription in a dose-response function (Table 2). When compared with ESR of 0–3 mm/h, there was a small but robust decrease in IQ for groups with higher ESR levels. After adjusting for potential confounders these associations attenuated, but remained significant. We explored whether the dose–response relationship observed using ESR as a categorical variable could be more parsimoniously explained using ESR as a continuous variable. Comparing these models using a log-likelihood test revealed no significant difference between two models (p = 0.62) suggesting that categorical classification of ESR is not superior to a linear description of the ESR-IQ association (online Supplementary Table 2).

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the laboratory evaluation of functional diarrhea and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in adults (IBS-D) [^399dc3bf]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA guideline—screening for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C‑reactive protein (CRP): “Recommendation 2: In patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, the AGA suggests against the use of erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C‑reactive protein to screen for IBD. Conditional recommendation; low-quality evidence.” Evidence summary shows that for CRP, “using a value of 5–6 mg/L as a threshold,” pooled sensitivity was “0.73 (95% CI, 0.64–0.80)” and pooled specificity was “0.78 (95% CI, 0.58–0.91),” whereas ESR thresholds “10–15 mm/h… resulted in lower estimates of diagnostic accuracy for IBD.” A pragmatic note states that “if testing for fecal lactoferrin or calprotectin are either not available or not covered by insurance, the use of CRP might be considered to be a reasonable option to screen for IBD.”

### Inflammation, as measured by the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, is an independent predictor for the development of heart failure [^21ceca74]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our objective was to explore inflammation, measured as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), as a predictor for the development of heart failure (HF).

Background

In recent years, evidence of the importance of inflammation in the pathophysiology of HF has emerged, and various inflammatory markers have been found to predict future HF. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is an inexpensive and easily accessible marker of systemic inflammation, but to this date it is unknown whether ESR predicts subsequent HF.

Methods

In a community-based prospective study of 2,314 middle-aged men free from HF, myocardial infarction, and valvular disease at baseline, ESR was analyzed in multivariable models together with established risk factors for HF (hypertension, diabetes, electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy, smoking, obesity, and serum cholesterol) and hematocrit.

Results

A total of 282 men developed HF during a median follow-up time of 30 years. In Cox proportional hazards analyses, ESR was an independent predictor of HF (hazard ratio 1.46 for highest quartile vs. the lowest, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 2.06). This observation remained significant when also adjusting for interim myocardial infarction during follow-up.

Conclusions

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was a significant predictor of HF, independent of established risk factors for HF, and interim myocardial infarction after three decades of follow-up in a population-based sample of middle-aged men. Our findings indicate that inflammation occurs early in the process leading to HF and that ESR could be used to evaluate this process.

### Laboratory tests in adults with monoarticular arthritis: can they rule out a septic joint? [^52f91926]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

It is difficult to differentiate septic arthritis from other causes of monoarticular arthritis solely with a history and physical examination. The clinician must rely on ancillary tests to make a diagnosis, such as the white blood cell count of peripheral blood (WBC), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and the white blood cell count of the joint fluid (jWBC) obtained from arthrocentesis. Although it is known that septic arthritis is associated with abnormalities in these tests, the majority of the data are based on studies in the pediatric population. In addition, although several emergency medicine texts indicate that a jWBC greater than 50,000 cells/mm(3) is "positive," it is known that septic arthritis can occur in patients with low jWBCs.

Objectives

To determine whether specific ancillary tests have sufficiently high sensitivities to rule out septic arthritis in adults.

Methods

This was a retrospective consecutive case series of patients from an urban emergency department (ED). Patients at least 18 years old who had septic arthritis confirmed by positive arthrocentesis culture or operative findings were included in the study. WBC greater than 11,000 cells/mm(3), ESR greater than 30 mm/hr, and jWBC greater than 50,000 cells/mm(3) were considered elevated.

Results

Seventy-three patients met the inclusion criteria. The sensitivities of an elevated WBC, ESR, or jWBC in adults who had septic arthritis were 48%, 96%, and 64%, respectively. There were broad ranges of WBC, ESR, or jWBC among the patients. More than one third of adult patients with septic arthritis had jWBCs less than 50,000 cells/mm(3). All patients had an abnormality in at least one of these tests.

Conclusions

The WBC, ESR, and jWBC are extremely variable in adults with septic arthritis. Laboratory tests do not rule out septic arthritis with accuracy.

### ESR concept paper on value-based radiology [^d93208ad]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Value measurements are based on a three-tiered framework (Table 1). Each tier contains two levels, each with one or more dimensions related to the state of health reached by the patient during and after treatment. The lowest tier (tier 1) measures “sustainability of health” (with “care-induced illnesses” and “recurrences” as internal dimensions); tier 2 relates to the “process of recovery” (internal dimensions are “diagnostic or treatment mistakes and their complications”, as well as “time to return to normal activities”); tier 3 is defined as “health status achieved or retained” (and its internal dimensions are “degree of health recovery” and “overall survival”).

Table 1 
Measuring value-based care

Measurements of both outcomes and costs are not easy. Teams of experts, including physicians, health economy experts and representatives from patients’ organisations, are working to identify metrics that allow measurement of the “significant outcomes” within each of the steps of the value frame. The International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurements (ICHOM) has already published a series of 20 outcome measurement sets for 20 different clinical situations (such as breast, colon and lung cancer, stroke, dementia, coronary heart disease, and others). Other sets are under preparation. The organisation aims to publish standard sets to cover more than 50% of the global disease burden by the end of 2017.

Simultaneously, health economists are working on the measurement of the costs of each step of the process, comprising materials, time, professional fees, etc.

This may all seem sensible, but the value-based healthcare concept, as presently structured, is fundamentally flawed, not by what it seeks to achieve, but by what it does not even consider. Significantly, no radiologist has been involved in any of this work, and radiology is not even considered in the value-based healthcare concept. The framework used to measure health outcomes, in fact, starts only at the beginning of treatment (after most of the work of the radiologist has already been done). The entire diagnostic process, as a whole, is only considered as affecting tier 2, in case of errors or complications, and then is only considered as having a negative effect on outcomes; that is, when something goes wrong. Thus, a correct diagnosis seems to be taken for granted, as if it were a commodity, and as if the work of a radiologist was analogous to that of a machine for measuring blood biochemistry.

### Very late relapses in Hodgkin lymphoma treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy: linear pattern and distinct prognostic factors [^e113d7bb]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Individual graphs refer to the whole patient population overall (A) and according to histologic subtype (cHL classical Hodgkin lymphoma, MC mixed cellularity, NLPHL nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma) (B), radiotherapy (RT) administration (C) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (D). In addition, cumulative incidence of very late relapses and competing-risks-adjusted cumulative incidence at different time-points from diagnosis in patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma treated with ABVD or equivalent regimens (E, F) and according to histologic subtype (cHL classical Hodgkin lymphoma, MC mixed cellularity) (G), radiotherapy (RT) administration (H), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (I) and age (J).

Univariate and multivariate prognostic factor analysis is provided in Table 1. In univariate analysis of all patients, age ≥45 years and MC were associated with higher probability of VLRs, while ABVDeq vs. MOPPeq CT ± RT and CMT vs. CT alone were associated with lower VLR incidence (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2 and Fig. 1C). Clinical stage and B-symptoms were of borderline significance (p = 0.11 and 0.13; Table 1); interestingly however, elevated ESR ≥ 50 mm/h was inversely associated with the incidence of VLR (Table 1 and Fig. 1D). Focusing on histology, MC was associated with higher VLR incidence compared to non-MC cHL, mainly driven by the favorable effect of NS, while NLP was marginally associated with more VLRs compared to non-MC cHL (Table 1 and Fig. 1B). In multivariate analysis (Table 1), independent protective factors for VLRs were CMT vs. CT (HR = 0.35, p < 0.001) and elevated ESR (≥50 vs. <50 mm/h; HR = 0.46, p = 0.008), while MC was independent adverse factor (HR = 2.19, p = 0.004). If ESR (with associated missing values) was not considered, ABVDeq CT vs. MOPP-type was protective against VLRs (HR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.27–0.94, p = 0.032) in the presence of other significant predictors (CMT/CT and MC) (data not shown).

### Procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children [^d37aac19]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In children with urinary tract infection (UTI), only those with pyelonephritis (and not cystitis) are at risk for developing long-term renal sequelae. If non-invasive biomarkers could accurately differentiate children with cystitis from children with pyelonephritis, treatment and follow-up could potentially be individualized. This is an update of a review first published in 2015.

Objectives

The objectives of this review were to 1) determine whether procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can replace the acute DMSA scan in the diagnostic evaluation of children with UTI; 2) assess the influence of patient and study characteristics on the diagnostic accuracy of these tests, and 3) compare the performance of the three tests to each other.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, DARE, Web of Science, and BIOSIS Previews through to 17th December 2019 for this review. The reference lists of all included articles and relevant systematic reviews were searched to identify additional studies not found through the electronic search.

Selection Criteria

We only considered published studies that evaluated the results of an index test (PCT, CRP, ESR) against the results of an acute-phase 99 Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan (conducted within 30 days of the UTI) in children aged 0 to 18 years with a culture-confirmed episode of UTI. The following cut-off values were used for the primary analysis: 0.5 ng/mL for procalcitonin, 20 mg/L for CRP and 30 mm/hour for ESR.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently applied the selection criteria to all citations and independently abstracted data. We used the bivariate model to calculate pooled random-effects pooled sensitivity and specificity values.

Main Results

A total of 36 studies met our inclusion criteria. Twenty-five studies provided data for the primary analysis: 12 studies (1000 children) included data on PCT, 16 studies (1895 children) included data on CRP, and eight studies (1910 children) included data on ESR (some studies had data on more than one test). The summary sensitivity estimates (95% CI) for the PCT, CRP, ESR tests at the aforementioned cut-offs were 0.81 (0.67 to 0.90), 0.93 (0.86 to 0.96), and 0.83 (0.71 to 0.91), respectively. The summary specificity values for PCT, CRP, and ESR tests at these cut-offs were 0.76 (0.66 to 0.84), 0.37 (0.24 to 0.53), and 0.57 (0.41 to 0.72), respectively.

Authors' Conclusions

The ESR test does not appear to be sufficiently accurate to be helpful in differentiating children with cystitis from children with pyelonephritis. A low CRP value (< 20 mg/L) appears to be somewhat useful in ruling out pyelonephritis (decreasing the probability of pyelonephritis to < 20%), but unexplained heterogeneity in the data prevents us from making recommendations at this time. The procalcitonin test seems better suited for ruling in pyelonephritis, but the limited number of studies and the marked heterogeneity between studies prevents us from reaching definitive conclusions. Thus, at present, we do not find any compelling evidence to recommend the routine use of any of these tests in clinical practice.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) monitoring in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) are characterized by postoperative CRP rises “on the order of 3 to 15 mg/dL (30 to 150 mg/L)” peaking “on the second to third postoperative day,” while “The ESR peaks similarly to CRP but normalizes more slowly” and, in uncomplicated cases, “usually occurs within 3 to 4 weeks.” Within these limits, “the panel suggests sequential monitoring of CRP as an adjunctive measure” and notes “There are no data to support a particular frequency of CRP monitoring,” but “Measurement every 2 to 3 days during the early therapeutic course, rather than daily, followed by weekly or other periodic measurement until normalization (or a clear trend toward normal is evident) is an acceptable approach.” The guideline cautions that “The interpretation of persistent elevation of the CRP in the face of apparent clinical improvement is uncertain” and that “no specific thresholds of CRP concentration have been well validated for specific clinical interventions or decisions regarding the duration of therapy.”

### Distinguishing rheumatoid arthritis from psoriatic arthritis [^16e4cd58]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Serological features of RA and PsA

RA is a seropositive arthropathy, with approximately 80% of patients having a positive test result for RF or CCP antibodies.CCP antibodies are a more specific marker for RA than RF, but both biomarkers are considered to be distinct and complementary predictors of disability and joint erosion.

In contrast, PsA is a seronegative inflammatory arthropathy. RF and CCP are absent in most patients with PsA, and if patients do have positive test findings for RF or CCP, the titres are usually low.In a study comparing patients with RA or PsA and controls, the mean RF and anti-CCP titre values were substantially higher in patients with RA compared with PsA (RF titre: 56 vs 11 U/mL; anti-CCP titre: 14 vs 2 U/mL).Titres in patients with PsA were similar to values in controls.Although the presence of serum RF or CCP antibodies is generally not used to exclude diagnosis of non-rheumatic diseases (eg, fungal infections), data suggest that at anti-CCP titre values ≥11.6 U/mL, it is highly probable that patients have RA rather than PsA.In both patients with RA and PsA, the presence of anti-CCP antibodies is associated with bone destruction, suggesting that the osteocatabolic effect of anti-CCP antibodies is not found only in RA as previously thought.

C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are markers of acute-phase inflammatory responses in patients with RA and PsA, but more so in patients with RA.In a systematic literature review of RA disease activity parameters, ESR and CRP levels were a significant predictor of radiographic progression in most studies.The acute-phase response is correlated with synovial inflammation, radiographic disease progression and erosive joint damage.On average, patients with PsA have significantly lower CRP and ESR levels than patients with RA.However, elevated ESR and CRP levels are significantly correlated with the number of swollen joints and with ultrasound abnormalities in PsA.ESR, in particular, is considered to be one of the best predictors of damage progression in PsA. It has been suggested that a low ESR is protective, while rates >15 mm/hour are associated with increased risk for mortality.Changes in ESR and CRP correspond with clinical outcomes and can be used to track response to treatment.

Increased ESR and CRP levels are markers of inflammation, but not necessarily just in RA.Other rheumatological diseases associated with elevated ESR and CRP levels include polymyalgia rheumatica, Sjögren’s syndrome and ankylosing spondylitis.

### ESR statement on the stepwise development of imaging biomarkers [^7bf10e2e]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Standardisation

Standardisation relates to the establishment of norms or requirements about technical aspects. In the development of imaging biomarkers, two main aspects should be considered.
Standardisation of image acquisition : similar acquisition parameters should be used across imaging platforms, when these parameters affect the results of the biomarker. For example, the calculation of ADC depends on the number and choice of the gradient “b” values. A collaborative paper by Padhani et al. lays the foundation for acquisition standardisation, notably by recommending that monoexponential assessments of ADC should use two b values above 100 mm 2 /s. Moreover, DW-MRI is very sensitive to motion. Motion correction schemes are thus advised for DW-MRI acquisition. However, it is still unclear which scheme is optimal. As an example for upper abdominal studies, some consider that free breathing acquisition produces reliable enough data, even with a better reproducibility than breath-hold, and that a respiratory-triggered scheme produces less reproducible data, while others recommend using tracking-only navigator techniques.
Standardisation of image analysis : volume and region of interest (ROI) determinations and parameter calculation (mathematical models) should be standardised. In tumour perfusion imaging, it has been shown that the ROI placements in the vascular input and in the tumour influence the results and reproducibility of the parameter measurements. To take motion into account, rigid and non-rigid registration of images at different time points can be used. In heterogeneous lesions such as tumours, imaging biomarkers are frequently calculated as parametric maps with spatial resolution. We need to define how to handle the histogram that displays the obtained values. Descriptive statistics such as mean value, standard deviation, and range can be directly obtained from the histogram. The main drawback with this approach is the clear tendency to underestimate the changes in body tissues and organs, since the values indicative of disease, or its most relevant manifestations, are minimised. For this reason, percentiles are used in some settings to obtain a better relationship with the most relevant predictive clinical variables. The optimal type of approach must be defined for each problem (complete histogram, partial histogram in quartiles, partial histogram in deciles). A further approach involves the analysis of the heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of a biomarker provided by its parametric image. To this end, some distribution asymmetry statistics such as kurtosis can be used. Finally, the choice of the mathematical model that is used to calculate the quantitative parameters has also a major influence on the results that are obtained. Standardisation procedures are currently being developed. It is important that standardisation be a collaborative effort of academia and industry. Standardisation of data reporting should also be performed. For example, to describe the liver elasticity in cirrhosis, different units (Young modulus in kPa, shear modulus in kPa, wave speed in m/s) and different cut-off values are currently used. Standardisation of these data would improve the communication between research groups.

### Routine diagnostic tests for periprosthetic joint infection demonstrate a high false-negative rate and are influenced by the infecting organism [^35c23ab0]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) as the first-line testing for evaluation of suspected periprosthetic joint infection, in addition to synovial white blood-cell (WBC) count and polymorphonuclear percentage. However, the sensitivity and other diagnostic measures of these tests using a standardized definition of periprosthetic joint infection and the influence of organisms on these inflammatory markers remain inadequately investigated.

Methods

A retrospective review of an institutional database of 549 periprosthetic joint infection cases and 653 aseptic total joint arthroplasty revisions was performed. Periprosthetic joint infection was defined using major criteria from the International Consensus Meeting (ICM) on Periprosthetic Joint Infection. The mean inflammatory marker levels were compared among organisms with Student t tests and the proportions of elevated laboratory levels were compared among organisms with chi-square analyses. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to calculate new cutoffs, sensitivities, and specificities for each organism and overall for serum CRP and ESR and synovial WBC and polymorphonuclear percentage.

Results

The sensitivity of these markers for diagnosing chronic periprosthetic joint infection was 0.85 for ESR, 0.88 for CRP, 0.83 for WBC count, and 0.78 for polymorphonuclear percentage. For ESR, antibiotic-resistant organisms had higher mean values (84.3 mm/hr) than culture-negative cases (57.4 mm/hr), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (68.3 mm/hr), and Streptococcus species (66.1 mm/hr); Staphylococcus aureus (81.0 mm/hr) was higher than culture-negative cases (57.4 mm/hr). For CRP, culture-negative cases had lower mean values (41.0 mg/L) than gram-negative organisms (87.4 mg/L), antibiotic-resistant organisms (86.0 mg/L), S. aureus (112.2 mg/L), and Streptococcus species (114.6 mg/L); S. aureus (112.2 mg/L) was higher than coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (66.0 mg/L). For WBC count, culture-negative cases had lower mean values (27,984.5 cells/mL) than S. aureus (116,250.0 cells/mL) and Streptococcus species (77,933.7 cells/mL). For polymorphonuclear percentage, there were no significant differences in mean values among all organisms.

Conclusions

It appears that serological markers, namely ESR and CRP, have a higher false-negative rate than previously reported. Synovial markers similarly exhibit high false-negative rates. Furthermore, the sensitivity of these tests appears to be related to organism type. Surgeons should be aware of the high rate of false-negatives associated with low-virulence organisms and culture-negative cases.

### Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: use of fresh blood for quality control [^82781704]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) remains the most widely used laboratory test for monitoring the course of infections, inflammatory diseases, and some types of cancer. Several test methods have been developed recently, and as a result the safety and reliability of ESR testing procedures have improved. The method recommended by the International Council for Standardization in Haematology and the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards for ESR measurement is based on the traditional Westergren method, using EDTA-anticoagulated samples without dilution. In clinical laboratories, reliable methods for calibration and the use of appropriate control materials are requiredfor monitoring the accuracy and precision of the routine method. We describe and evaluate a procedure for achieving the daily quality control of ESR and for establishing the limits of agreement between working and reference methods. Data from routine patient samples were used to calculate the daily cumulative mean and to monitor its reproducibility over time. Finally, to monitor analytic performance, a comparison was made between results from the measurement of ESR in specimens stored at 4 degrees C for 24 hours and results obtained in fresh samples.

### Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein for the prediction of severity of acute pancreatitis [^397512e9]. Pancreas (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the performance of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) for predicting severe acute pancreatitis (AP).

Methods

Fifty patients with AP were prospectively enrolled. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and CRP were measured at admission and every 12 hours for 48 hours after admission.

Results

The patients' mean age was 50 ± 2.2 years, 64% were male, and 30% developed severe AP. Patients with severe AP had higher levels of ESR (77 ± 4.7 vs 50 ± 4.8 mm/h; P = 0.002) and CRP (218 ± 30.7 vs 97 ± 12.1 mg/L; P <0.001) at 36 hours after admission compared with those with mild AP. Erythrocyte sedimentation rates of 60 mm/h or greater predict severe AP at 36 hours with a sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 86%, 57%, and 48% and 90%, whereas CRP of 150 mg/L or greater provided the results of 86%, 87%, and 75% and 93%, respectively. Elevation of either ESR or CRP at 24 hours increased the sensitivity and negative predictive value to 100%, and elevation of both ESR and CRP increased the specificity and PPV to 100%.

Conclusions

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate can predict severe AP with a slightly inferior performance to CRP. Combined ESR and CRP at 24 hours can predict severe AP accurately.

### ESR statement on the validation of imaging biomarkers [^8dd7f421]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Patient summary

In a number of areas of medicine, tests such as blood or urine sampling can measure certain characteristics by which a particular disease or biological process can be identified – these characteristics specific to a disease or biological process are called biomarkers. In medical imaging, it is difficult to produce reliable biomarkers because of complexities involved in collecting and analysing data from images. Equipment (scanners) from different manufacturers or the use of different methodologies for data analysis means that the measurements from different institutions or even within the same institution are often difficult to compare. Hence, despite technological advances, his lack of standardisation has prevented imaging biomarkers from significantly impacting clinical practice. This paper discusses how imaging biomarkers can be clinically validated based on metrology - the science of measurement – to ensure that variability between centres is minimised. This should enable imaging biomarkers to be used for diagnosis, prognosis or treatment response, with the ultimate aim of improving clinical workflows and patient care.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^92d77137]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn’s disease—laboratory markers in suspected disease: Anemia and an elevated platelet count are the most common changes seen in the complete blood count; C-reactive protein is elevated in a subset of patients with a short half-life of 19 hours, making CRP a useful marker to detect and monitor inflammation; erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be useful in an individual patient, but it is not predictive of IBD and does not discriminate patients with IBD from those with IBS in healthy controls; up to 40% of patients with IBD with mild inflammation may have a normal CRP and ESR, limiting the usefulness of these markers in monitoring some patients.

### Elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels reflects renal interstitial inflammation in drug-induced acute tubulointerstitial nephritis [^f508cb2f]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical relevance of the SIS in D-ATIN patients

Of the 81 D-ATIN patients, the ESR was elevated in 70 (86.4%), with an average level of 61.0 mm/hr. CRP was elevated in 44 patients (54.3%), with a median value of 9.7 mg/L (Table 2). SISs evaluated by both ESR and CRP levels were positively correlated with sCr values at renal biopsy (r = 0.440; P < 0.001), leukocyturia (r = 0.366; P = 0.001) and C3 levels (r = 0.533; P < 0.001) (Additional Table 1).

Based on the SIS values, there were 23 patients in the low-SIS group, 24 in the medium-SIS group and 34 in the high-SIS group. There was no significant difference in age, sex, allergic manifestations, or causal medications among the three groups of patients. Patients in the low-SIS group had the mildest kidney injuries, with the lowest sCr levels at renal biopsy (median value: 151 μmol/L, P < 0.001), lowest RRT rate (4.3%, P = 0.023) and highest hemoglobin concentration (114.7 ± 14.0 g/L, P = 0.001). It is interesting to note that patients in the medium-SIS group tended to have higher peak sCr levels (median 417 vs 358 μmol/L) and RRT rates (37.5% vs 23.5%) than those in the high-SIS group, yet their disease courses were relatively longer (median 30 vs 17 days) with lower levels of sCr at biopsy (median 274 vs 321 μmol/L). In addition, patients in the high-SIS group had significantly higher C3 levels (1.3 ± 0.2 vs 1.1 ± 0.2 mg/L, P < 0.001) with a greater prevalence of leukocyturia (79.4% vs 45.8%, P = 0.002) than those in the medium-SIS group (Table 2).

### Limited value of elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate as an indicator of malignancy [^fa36b548]. Family Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are often suspected of having malignant disease and are subjected to extensive investigations. Thus, the finding of an elevated ESR can result in considerable costs and might even be dangerous for the patient if invasive studies are ordered.

Objectives

Our aims were to establish (i) the prevalence of malignant diseases in hospitalized patients and out-patients with elevated ESR; and (ii) the long-term incidence of malignant diseases in patients during 5 years after unsuccessful investigation for elevated ESR.

Methods

A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 128 patients admitted to the Department of General Internal Medicine, University of Kiel and in 94 out-patients under the care of a GP. A retrospective cohort study of 50 patients was also carried out by contacting GPs of patients discharged from hospital after unsuccessful investigation.

Results

In the hospitalized patients, the ESR was elevated in 53.1% (68/128) and was normal in 46.9% (60/128). Malignancy was found in 25.0% (17/68) of patients with elevated ESR and in 15% (9/60) of patients with normal ESR (P = 0.16). Of the out-patients, 94 patients with elevated ESR were investigated, of whom 8.5% (8/94) had malignancies (P = 0.004 compared with hospitalized patients). In the follow-up study of 50 patients who had been discharged with the diagnosis "elevated ESR of unknown origin", follow-up information was available from 38 individuals. Of these, 71.0% (27/38) had not developed signs or symptoms of any disease at the time of investigation. Malignant disease had developed in only 5.3% (2/38).

Conclusion

The prevalence of malignancy in patients with elevated ESR is low, in both the clinical and the general practice setting. Elevation of ESR is not an early sign of malignant disease and does not justify extensive investigation in a patient who has no symptoms which are suggestive of a tumour.

### AAOS systematic literature review: summary on the management of surgical site infections [^8cd7d150]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). High credibility.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for surgical site infection (SSI) diagnosis—Limited strength evidence does not support the use of ESR, alone, to rule in and rule out surgical site infections due to conflicting data, with the Strength of Recommendation: Limited. Multiple high-quality studies have demonstrated moderate to weak ability of ESR as a solitary test to diagnose or exclude surgical site infection, and it is felt to be too variable with respect to time from surgery and in the presence of other confounding factors to be considered an accurate tool in diagnosis alone; ESR may be considered as a tool to be used in conjunction with other tests. There is no risk with implementation of this test/recommendation; however, ESR should rarely be considered in isolation, and ESR should be used in combination with other tests to mitigate the risk of incorrect diagnoses. Future investigations will likely examine the use of ESR in combination with other diagnostic markers.

### Discordance between erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein measurements: clinical significance [^afb6175e]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are common measures of systemic inflammation. Our goal was to identify clinical factors associated with CRP/ESR discordance.

Methods

We identified patients with ESR and CRP results at our academic hospital over six months. We matched individuals with discordant results (one measure in highest tertile, other in lowest), by age and sex to those with non-discordant results, and reviewed medical records for laboratory and clinical factors. We employed analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi squared tests to compare these variables in discordant and non-discordant subjects. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the relative risk of CRP/ESR discordance associated with each variable.

Results

2,069 patients had CRP and ESR measured on the same day; 87 had discordant results, 55 (2.6%) with elevated ESR/low CRP, 32 (1.5%) with elevated CRP/ low ESR. Underlying infection was associated with > 14 fold risk of elevated ESR/low CRP discordance (p < 0.001). Renal insufficiency was associated with increased risk of elevated ESR/low CRP discordance, (p = 0.003). RA patients were slightly less likely to have elevated ESR/low CRP, (p = 0.008, NS after Bonferroni correction). Low serum albumin was associated with both kinds discordance.

Conclusion

Infection, renal insufficiency, and low albumin were associated with having elevated ESR/low CRP; low albumin predicted elevated CRP/low ESR and elevated ESR/low CRP discordance. RA patients were less likely to have elevated ESR/depressed CRP. ESR as a measure inflammation in systemic rheumatic disease may be limited in settings of infection, renal insufficiency, and low albumin.

XII. Systemic inflammatory markers and MRI for assessing treatment response in native vertebral osteomyelitis—We suggest monitoring systemic inflammatory markers (ESR or CRP) in patients with NVO after approximately 4 weeks of antimicrobial therapy, in conjunction with a clinical assessment (weak, low), and we recommend against routinely ordering follow-up MRI in patients with NVO in whom a favorable clinical and laboratory response to antimicrobial therapy was observed (strong, low). We suggest performing a follow-up MRI to assess evolutionary changes of the epidural and paraspinal soft tissues in patients with NVO who are judged to have a poor clinical response to therapy (weak, low). Patients with at least a 25%–33% reduction in systemic inflammatory markers after receipt of approximately 4 weeks of antimicrobial therapy may be at reduced risk of treatment failure, and NVO patients with a 50% reduction in ESR after 4 weeks rarely develop treatment failure; conversely, after 4 weeks of treatment, ESR values >50 mm/ hour and CRP values ≥2.75 mg/dL may confer a significantly higher risk of treatment failure. NVO patients who demonstrate favorable clinical and laboratory response to therapy do not need to undergo follow-up MRI, follow-up imaging performed <4 weeks after the baseline exam may falsely suggest progressive infection, and improvement in paravertebral and epidural soft tissue on follow-up MRI correlates best with improvement in clinical status and outcomes; in patients with worsened soft tissue findings on MRI 4–8 weeks after diagnosis, microbiologically confirmed treatment failure rates as high as 44% are reported.

### Determinants of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the era of microinflammation: excluding subjects with elevated C-reactive protein levels [^a3c06741]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can be used to identify low-grade inflammation that contributes to future vascular events. ESR determinants, however, have not been explored in the absence of a subclinical or microinflammatory response. The ESR was determined in a large cohort of apparently healthy participants, excluding subjects with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentrations more than 5 mg/L (47.62 nmol/L). Linear regression models were used to identify the determinants of the ESR. The study population comprised 6,237 subjects. The main laboratory variables found to affect ESR were levels of fibrinogen, hemoglobin, globulin, and triglycerides (all P < .001; R2 = 0.34 and 0.44 for men and women, respectively). Sex was found to affect ESR alone and in combined interactions with most other variables. Age did not affect ESR. The main determinants of ESR in an inflammation-free cohort are sex and levels of fibrinogen, hemoglobin, globulins, and triglycerides.

### Raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate signals heart failure in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^10b6ba49]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammatory markers are associated with heart failure. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have twice the risk of heart failure compared with people without rheumatoid arthritis.

Objective

To assess whether heart failure in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is preceded by an inflammatory activation as shown by erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), a systemic marker of inflammation.

Methods

A population-based inception cohort of 575 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, free of heart failure at their rheumatoid arthritis incidence date, was followed up longitudinally until death or 2001. During 15 years of follow-up, they had a median of 15 ESR tests, and 172 patients had new-onset heart failure (Framingham Heart Study criteria). The follow-up period, beginning with the rheumatoid arthritis incidence date and ending with date of the last follow-up, was divided into 6-month intervals. The proportions of patients with at least one ESR value >/=40 mm/h and with anaemia (haemoglobin <11 g/dl) within each 6-month interval were plotted against time from fulfilment of heart failure criteria. A binomial test was used to compare proportions.

Results

In patients with rheumatoid arthritis who developed heart failure, the proportion with ESR >/=40 mm/h was highest (23%) during the 6-month period immediately preceding the new-onset heart failure, as compared with the average ESR during the entire remaining follow-up period, both before and after heart failure (10.6%; p<0.01). The proportion of patients with anaemia peaked (54%) during the 6-month period after heart failure.

Conclusions

Inflammatory stimuli may be involved in the initiation of heart failure among patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

### Medical imaging in personalised medicine: a white paper of the research committee of the European Society of Radiology (ESR) [^2bdc912e]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Evaluation of treatment response

Imaging plays an important role in the assessment of therapeutic response. Classically decreased morbidity, e.g. relief of symptoms, and mortality have been endpoints for treatment evaluation. In most diseases treatment response can be evaluated more objectively, reproducibly and earlier with imaging than by monitoring symptoms. An early and accurate therapeutic response evaluation is critical in PM as it can influence the decision on discontinuation of treatment, treatment adjustment and/or additional treatment. Imaging can spare patients from prolonged exposure to ineffective treatments and allow alternative therapies to be applied sooner. Imaging not only plays a role in assessing response to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and/or targeted therapies, but also in the monitoring of changes after image-guided intervention.

Timing of response evaluation can differ according to clinical needs. To prevent aggressive treatment — which could be accompanied by severe side effects or expensive treatment in non-responders — it is crucial to evaluate early response in order to discontinue treatment and consider a second-line treatment that is potentially more effective. However, final treatment response evaluation is needed to decide on subsequent surgical treatment or neo-adjuvant treatment after presurgical chemoradiotherapy.

Crucial in the evaluation of treatment is the assumption that early tumour response is related to the final treatment response and that both early and final treatment responses are related to overall survival and/or progression-free survival. Multiple studies have already been performed that demonstrated these relationships. It is now time to integrate and translate these findings into clinical trial design and clinical guidelines, which describe the clinical decisions based on the results of imaging tests. This is especially the case with the further expansion of cancer management based on PET imaging. For example:
In colorectal cancer, PET of the liver could predict tumour response to chemotherapy in liver metastasis, and PET of the pelvis during or after (chemo)radiotherapy could predict the final tumour response and overall survival.
Patients with advanced oesophageal cancer and no evidence of response to neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy on PET imaging, which occurs in 50 % of the patients, have a worse prognosis after surgical resection than patients who respond, even after radical surgical resection.
For both limited stage and advanced stage Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple studies have demonstrated that interim PET imaging has a high negative predictive value and a moderate positive predictive value for progression-free survival. Multiple trials are evaluating the effect of treatment adaption based on early PET evaluation on progression-free survival. These studies will determine whether therapy can be safely escalated or reduced based on treatment response evaluation.

### Laboratory tests to assess patients with rheumatoid arthritis: advantages and limitations [^9589bcf3]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests provide the most definitive information for diagnosing and managing many diseases, and most patients look to laboratory tests as the most important information from a medical visit. Most patients who have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a positive test for rheumatoid factor and anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). More than 30% 40% of patients with RA, however, have negative tests for rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies or a normal ESR or CRP. More than 30% of patients with RA, however, have negative tests for rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies, and 40% have a normal ESR or CRP. These observations indicate that, although they can be helpful to monitor certain patients, laboratory measures cannot serve as a gold standard for diagnosis and management in all individual patients with RA or any rheumatic disease. Physicians and patients would benefit from an improved understanding of the limitations of laboratory tests in diagnosis and management of patients with RA.

Improvement in Pain Severity, C-Reactive Protein Level, and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate in Placebo Arm of 5 Randomized Clinical Trials

Values are means for pain (measured by a visual analog scale with values 0-100 mm) (A) and geometric means for C-reactive protein level (B) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (C) to account for log-normal distribution. All mean changes were significant (P <.001).

Figure 2. 
Improvement in Pain Severity, C-Reactive Protein Level, and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate for Placebo Arms of Trials 1 Through 4

Values are means for pain (measured by a visual analog scale with values 0-100 mm) (A) and geometric means for C-reactive protein level (B) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (C) to account for log-normal distribution. All mean changes were significant (P <.001).

Correlations between week 12 and week 24 outcomes were moderate to high (pain: r = 0.73, CRP: r = 0.39, ESR: r = 0.59), and those between subjective and objective improvement were lower than those between objective measures (pain/CRP: r = 0.27, pain/ESR: r = 0.25, CRP/ESR: r = 0.48). While correlations between change and baseline were moderate (pain: r = 0.47, CRP: r = 0.39, ESR: r = 0.25), correlations between change and average of baseline and week 12 assessment were poor to nonexistent (pain: r = 0.16, CRP: r = 0.08, ESR: r = 0.02).

In the mixed-effects models, previous treatment with DMARDs (naive vs stable) was identical for all but 1 trial (trial 5) and could therefore not be disentangled from random study effects (Table 2). For all outcomes, baseline values showed a significant influence on the outcome at both weeks 12 and 24. No other variables tested had statistically significant effects, except for washout length, which had an unexpectedly high effect on both CRP level and ESR at week 24 only. This result could be biased: washout length was associated in this data set with earlier use of DMARDs, the only study with no previous use of DMARDs making up 61% of the group of patients with a shorter washout length.

### An open-label prospective randomized multicenter study of intensive versus weekly granulocyte and monocyte apheresis in active Crohn's disease [^ced841f7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Changes in leucocyte count, and inflammation markers

In spite of randomized assignment of enrolled patients, baseline leucocyte count (normal range: 4000–9000/μL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (normal range: < 10 mm/hr (male); < 15 mm/hr (female)) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (normal range: < 0.3 mg/dL) concentration were found to be significantly higher in the intensive GMA group compared with the weekly GMA group, 8005/μL vs 7100/μL (P = 0.0273), 54.5 mm/hr vs 24.5 mm/hr (P = 0.0146) and 1.90 mg/dL vs 0.90 mg/dL (P = 0.0478), respectively. However, only in the intensive GMA group, leucocyte count (P = 0.0461) and ESR (P = 0.0059) were significantly reduced. Likewise, CRP level had decreased from 1.90 mg/dL to 0.80 mg/dL (P = 0.0941). In the weekly GMA, CRP level was significantly (P = 0.0277) decreased from 0.90 mg/dL at baseline to 0.35 mg/dL (P = 0.0277), but, leucocyte count and ESR level were not significantly affected (Table 2).

### Giant cell arteritis: laboratory predictors of a positive temporal artery biopsy [^1311e0f1]. Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To identify laboratory predictors of a positive temporal artery biopsy.

Design

Cross-sectional study using retrospective electronic data base review.

Participants

There were 3001 patients who had a temporal artery biopsy.

Methods

The electronic database of a large health maintenance organization was searched for all patients who had a temporal artery biopsy performed from 1997 to 2006.

Main Outcome Measures

Odds ratios for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP), and platelet count values associated with a positive temporal artery biopsy.

Results

Four hundred fifty-nine cases of biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis were identified. The odds of a positive biopsy were 1.5 times greater with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 47 to 107 mm/hr, 5.3 times greater with a CRP >2.45 mg/dL, and 4.2 times greater with platelets >400,000/μL.

Conclusions

In this largest population-based giant cell arteritis study in the United States to date, we reaffirm Hayreh's finding of the significance of a CRP level >2.45 mg/dL in predicting a positive biopsy. Our findings support the literature suggesting that CRP and thrombocytosis may be stronger predictors of positive biopsy than erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

Key points

Unlike blood or urine analysis where the samples are obtained by simple extraction or excretion, in radiology the acquisition of the sample (the images) is heterogeneous by design, since complex equipment from different vendors is used.
The validation of developed analytical methods must be based on a technical performance validation (precision - repeatability and reproducibility - and accuracy assessment) and clinical validation.
Metrology is the scientific domain in which imaging biomarkers must be validated, as with other measurement devices.

### The association of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and diabetic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes [^7d984036]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Basic characteristics

A total of 1210 patients with T2DM were included in the current analysis, of whom 265 had DKD. Comparison of the characteristics were listed in Table 1. Compared with patients without DKD, patients with DKD showed higher ESR value (12.0 [7.0 ~ 22.0] mm/h vs 23.0 [12.0 ~ 41.5] mm/h, P <  0.001) and higher hsCR P value (2.90 [1.80 ~ 5.60] mg/L vs 3.60 [2.20 ~ 7.65] mg/L, P <  0.01).

Table 1 
Characteristics of patients with or without diabetic kidney disease

Besides, compared with patients without DKD, those with DKD has higher ACR (12.56 [7.04 ~ 27.38] mg/g vs 394.49 [96.64 ~ 1316.90]mg/g, P <  0.001) and lower eGFR (92.04 [78.10 ~ 101.72] ml/min/1.73m 2 vs 75.69 [48.13 ~ 95.18] ml/min/1.73m 2, P <  0.001), as well as higher GLB, TC, TG, LDL and lower HDL, ALB levels (Table 1). The use of aspirin (p = 0.021) and metformin (p <  0.001) between two groups also reached statistical significance.

Laboratory findings

Creatinine levels on admission were similar between the groups, suggestive of no significant difference in the number of patients with acute kidney injury at presentation, as defined by normal ranges for age and gender (Table 3). MIS-C patients were noted to have significantly lower sodium levels on admission than COVID-19 patients, and finding that consistent with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), as hyponatremia has been previously reported in the disease as well. Albumin, transaminase, brain natriuretic peptide, and troponin levels were similar in COVID-19 and MIS-C patients.

Table 3 
Laboratory and echocardiography results

Inflammatory markers on admission differed significantly between all groups. Median initial C-reactive protein (CRP) was 4.6 mg/dL (IQR 1.4–11.1) in total COVID-19 patients compared to 15.9 mg/dL (IQR 11.2–23.1) in total MIS-C patients. This significant difference was also seen between median values of 9.2 mg/dL (IQR 1.4–11.9) in severe COVID-19 patients and 17.7 mg/dL (IQR 12–27.6) in severe MIS-C patients. Erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESR) on admission were also different between groups, with an initial median value of 25 mm/hr. (IQR 9–40) in total COVID-19 patients, compared to 48 mm/hr. (IQR 38–58) in total MIS-C patients, and 19 mm/hr. (IQR 12.5–35) in severe COVID-19 patients versus 41 mm/hr. (IQR 38–58) in severe MIS-C patients. Lower values in severe disease is consistent with coagulopathy often seen in MAS. There was a significant difference between median procalcitonin levels on admission between total COVID-19 (0.8 ng/mL (IQR 0.4–2.6)) and total MIS-C patients (11.5 ng/mL (IQR 4.3–24.4)) (p = 0.0004) and among the severe COVID-19 (1.3 ng/mL (IQR 0.8–2.6)) and severe MIS-C patients (13.5 ng/mL (IQR 8.4–32)) (p = 0.0013).

### Variability in phenotype and response to treatment in chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis ; the Irish experience of a national cohort [^01d7bc24]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Laboratory data

Twenty-six patients (59.1%) had an elevated ESR at presentation. Of these, ESR was mildly elevated (< 50 mm/hr) in 19/26 (73.1%), moderately elevated (50-100 mm/hr) in 6/26 (23.1%) and highly elevated (> 100 mm/hr) in 1/26 (3.8%). In the six patients who presented systemically unwell with fever, ESR was normal in 1/6, mildly elevated in 2/6, moderately elevated in 2/6 and highly elevated in 1/6. CRP was less frequently elevated than ESR; 9/10 patients with a raised CRP also had a raised ESR and one did not have an ESR result available. CRP was elevated in 4/6 of the patients who were febrile at presentation. Total white cell count (WCC) was normal in all but one patient; that patient had highly elevated ESR and CRP with a mildly elevated white cell and neutrophil count. Six patients (15.7%, n = 38) were HLA-B*27 positive compared to 8.4% of the Irish population.

### An evidence-based approach to laboratory tests in usual care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^cff64fcb]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests often are regarded as the most important information in clinical care by patients and doctors, and dominate clinical decisions in many chronic diseases such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Most patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a positive test for rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP). However, about a third of RA patients, have negative tests for rheumatoid factor or ACPA, and more than 40% have a normal ESR or CRP at presentation ('false-negative' results). Furthermore, many normal people have a positive test for rheumatoid factor or ACPA but do not have RA, even among those with extensive musculoskeletal pain ('false-positive' results). Abnormal laboratory tests are the most significant predictor of high levels of radiographic progression, and therefore regarded as indicators of 'poor prognosis RA'. By contrast, laboratory tests are far less predictive of severe long-term outcomes such as work disability and premature mortality than functional difficulties reported on a patient questionnaire. A patient questionnaire score is abnormal in 89% of RA patients at presentation, and therefore more useful than ESR or CRP to document subsequent clinical improvement or deterioration. In clinical practice, patient questionnaire scores and RAPID3, an index of physical function, pain, and patient global estimate of status, identify incomplete responses to methotrexate more effectively than ESR. Improved understanding of the limitations of laboratory tests in diagnosis and management of individual patients with RA (and all rheumatic diseases) could improve patient care and outcomes.

### ESR statement on the stepwise development of imaging biomarkers [^80adb797]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Genetic biomarkers indicate whether a disease may occur, but they are usually inefficient to assess the presence and stage of a disease. Similar to molecular biomarkers, imaging biomarkers can be used for early detection of diseases, staging and grading, and predicting or assessing the response to treatment. Accordingly, because of their relative lower cost compared with imaging, molecular biomarkers may be more appropriate for disease screening and early detection than imaging biomarkers. With their high sensitivity, molecular biomarkers could also detect subclinical stages of disease before any morphological or functional change is detectable on imaging. In contrast, imaging biomarkers are often more useful than molecular biomarkers for disease staging, and also grading and for assessing tumour response, because localised information is crucial.

Similar to new drugs, the development of biomarkers has to pass along a pipeline going from discovery, through verification in different laboratories, validation and qualification before they can be used in clinical routine. Validation includes the determination of the accuracy and the precision (reproducibility) of the biomarker and standardisation concerns both acquisition and analysis. Qualification, defined as a “graded, fit-for-purpose evidentiary process linking a biomarker with biological processes and clinical end-points”, is a validation process in large cohorts of patients involving multiple centres, similar to phase III clinical trials, to obtain regulatory approval as surrogate endpoints. A more extensive path to biomarker development has been reported. The first step is the proof of concept, which defines any specific change relevant to the disease that can be studied using the available imaging and computational techniques. The relationship between this change and the presence, grading and response to treatment of the disease constitutes the proof of mechanism. The images needed to extract the biomarker must be appropriate (in terms of resolution, signal and contrast behaviour). Preparation of images relates to improving the data before the analysis (such as segmentation, filtering, interpolation or registration). The analysis and modelling of the signal by computational numerical adjustment of a mathematical model allow extracting the needed information (such as structural, physical, chemical, biological and functional properties). After this voxel-by-voxel computation, the spatial distribution of the biomarker can be depicted by parametric images, defined as derived secondary images which pixels represent the distribution values of a given parameter. Multivariate parametric images obtained by statistical modelling of the relevant parameters allow the reduction of data and a clear definition of the defined disease target. The abnormal values should be defined and measured through histogram analysis. A pilot test on a small sample of subjects, with and without the disease, has to be performed to validate the process—also called proof of principle—and to evaluate the influence of potential variations related to age, sex or any other source of biases. Finally, proofs of efficacy and effectiveness on larger and well-defined series of patients will show the ability of a biomarker to measure the clinical endpoint (Fig. 1).

### Early features of Kawasaki disease with pyuria in febrile infants younger than 6 months [^794c6dbb]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

KD group showed longer duration of fever (before admission and total) compared to UTI group (P < 0.01). KD group also showed a significantly higher platelet count (P = 0.04), C-reactive protein (CRP) level (P < 0.01), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (P < 0.01) than UTI group.

UTI group showed higher presence of positive urine nitrite test (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, haemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransaminase, albumin, sodium, total bilirubin, and urine β2-microglobulin (β2-MG) (Table 2).

We calculated the optimal cut-off values of platelet count, CRP, and ESR for differentiating KD with pyuria from UTI, by drawing ROC curves (Fig. 1). The cut-off value of platelet count to predict KD with pyuria was 509 k/μL with 58.3% sensitivity, 76.5% specificity, 98.3% negative predictive value, and 7.3% positive predictive value (P = 0.064). The cut-off value of CRP was 60 mg/L with 66.7% sensitivity, 76.1% specificity, 98.6% negative predictive value, and 8.2% positive predictive value (P < 0.001). The cut-off value of ESR was 68 mm/H with 72.7% sensitivity, 85.3% specificity, 99.0% negative predictive value, and 13.8% positive predictive value (P < 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.674 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.625–0.720, P = 0.064) for platelet count, 0.749 (95% CI: 0.703–0.791, P < 0.001) for CRP, and 0.846 (95% CI: 0.804–0.882, P < 0.001) for ESR. Subjects with ESR > 68 mm/hr had a nine-folds higher odds of KD compared to those with lower ESR level (odds ratio: 8.963, 95% confidence intervals: 1.936–41.493, P = 0.005) (Table 3).

### Laboratory investigations useful in giant cell arteritis and Takayasu's arteritis [^a2305f9e]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

A raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is considered a hallmark for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA). The American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for GCA include ESR greater than or equal to 50 mm/h as one of the five criteria. Although the presence of a normal ESR made GCA less likely, the results of a population-based study showed that the occurrence of a low/normal value in GCA at diagnosis is not rare. Pre-treatment ESR may be a prognostic indicator for duration of treatment. C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) may be more sensitive indicators of disease activity than ESR in GCA patients. However, it is unclear whether the use in clinical practice of CRP and IL-6 has some apparent advantage over ESR. ESR is the most often used tool to assess disease activity in Takayasu's arteritis (TA). However, some studies have found that ESR and CRP are not able to differentiate patients with clinically active and inactive TA. Furthermore, histopathological studies have shown that over 40% of patients thought to be in clinical remission with normal acute phase reactants have active arteritis. IL-6 could be a promising marker of disease activity in TA; however, further studies are required to confirm its usefulness in clinical practice. Other laboratory investigations could be useful in the diagnosis or follow-up of GCA and TA, but more studies are required.

### Modifications of metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors after weight loss induced by laparoscopic gastric banding [^b5457390]. Obesity Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The well-known inverse relation between life expectancy and BMI, particularly in morbid obesity, is presumably in large part due to multiple cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. Severely obese patients treated with laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding (LASGB) were evaluated for such risk factors before and 1 year after LASGB.

Methods

130 individuals (age 20-66, BMI 34-59 kg/m2) who underwent LASGB between 1996 and 2000 were studied; 50 of them were available for reevaluation 12 months after surgery. The presence and severity of diabetes (DM), hypertension (HTN), hypercholesterolemia (HC) and hypertriglyceridemia (HT) were assessed before and after surgery. In 18 of them erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were also measured.

Results

Comorbidities were highly prevalent at the initial evaluation: DM 10%, HTN 32%, HC 37%, HT 27%. In the subgroup reevaluated after surgery, prevalence of DM decreased from 15% to 6%, HTN from 37% to 25%, HC from 36% to 25%, and HT from 29% to 13%, with an average BMI loss from 44.1 to 35.9. ESR decreased from a preoperative value of 36.7 +/- 22.6 mm/hr to 18.3 +/- 11.9 mm/hr at 1 year (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Morbidly obese subjects respond to LASGB with an impressive reduction of comorbidities which is sustained for at least 1 year, well after the initial acute negative energy balance and when weight tends to stabilize. The high prevalence of elevated ESR, which has been considered a strong predictor of coronary mortality, confirms previous reports of its association with obesity, and the clear tendency to normalization with weight loss may represent a further element contributing to lower morbidity.

### Simultaneous testing of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein: increased expenditure without demonstrable benefit [^d0f98f7f]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

We analyzed the practice of paired erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein testing when evaluating fever or inflammation. In our hospital, this resulted in additional charges of $250000-$400000/year without demonstrable added benefit to patient care. Extrapolating our results, we estimate reducing this practice could save up to $300000000 nationally.

### Time-course analysis of gene expression during the Saccharomyces cerevisiae hypoxic response [^93edf423]. G3 (2017). Low credibility.

ESR data

All of the ESR gene expression data were obtained from the Gasch study. The data presented in this paper are displayed in the following order: 37° heat shock (5, 15, 30, and 60 min); 20 min 37° heat shock (from 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, and 37°), 0.32 mM hydrogen peroxide (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 120, and 160 min); 1 mM menadione (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80, 105, 120, and 160 min); 2.5 mM DTT (15, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 min); 1.5 mM diamine (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 90 min); 1 M sorbitol (5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min); amino acid starvation (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hr); nitrogen depletion (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 120 hr); diauxic shift (seven consecutive time points); YPD (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 120 hr); carbon source (ethanol, galactose, raffinose, sucrose, and fructose); and temperature (15, 17, 21, 25, 29, and 36°). A gene was considered to be part of the ESR if the gene was either originally called by the Gasch study or changed more than twofold in 10 or more of the 13 different treatments.

### The erythrocyte sedimentation rate in male adolescents and subsequent risk of Parkinson's disease: an observational study [^c4b6655e]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

The ESR is a simple, non-specific screening test that indirectly measures the presence of inflammation in the body. It calculates the rate of sedimentation of red blood cells within a 200-mm vertical tube of anticoagulated blood. The process of erythrocyte sedimentation is largely influenced by the initial aggregation of red blood cells, which is facilitated by the presence of plasma proteins of high molecular weight. Thus, a high concentration of certain plasma proteins, e.g. fibrinogen and immunoglobulins, causes a high ESR. The blood concentration of fibrinogen, which is an acute phase reactant, is increased in inflammatory situations. It is important to note that the ESR may not correlate fully with the levels of other inflammatory biomarkers. Most studies that have addressed the association between the levels of inflammation and disease in patients with PD have defined inflammation using the plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Until we can identify people with PD earlier in the course of their disease, we will not be able to establish definitively whether inflammation is an etiologic factor or a resultant process in the pathophysiology of the disease.

It is possible that our results indicate that a high ESR protects against PD. Fibrinogen can activate microglia, and it has been debated whether microglial activation protects against or exacerbates neuronal loss. Microglia could increase neuronal survival through the release of trophic and anti-inflammatory factors. In PD, the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons is associated with microglial activation, which could be seen as an epiphenomenon rather than having a direct involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease. Moderately activated microglia appear to play a homeostatic role in the CNS and form the first line of defense against, for example, inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, by regulating immunological and inflammatory responses.

An alternative explanation is that individuals who later develop PD have a weaker ability to produce a high ESR. An unpublished study from our group shows that patients with PD have weaker antibody responses to Varicella Zoster Virus, as compared to age-matched controls. Additional indications of an altered immune response in PD are that patients with PD display reduced number of T-helper and B lymphocytes. Individuals with a reduced ability to produce antibodies should be more prone to infections. It has been shown that patients with PD have a higher infection burden.

### Impact of antiinflammatory treatment on the onset of uveitis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: longitudinal analysis from a nationwide pediatric rheumatology database [^10e31435]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

High disease activity has been reported to be associated with a higher risk of uveitis occurrence in JIA 53, 63, but the subsequent clinical course of uveitis appears to be quite independent of arthritis activity 64. The C‐HAQ score is a sensitive tool for evaluating functional outcomes in children with chronic arthritis 65. In our study, patients with a high C‐HAQ score at initial documentation revealed a significantly higher risk for uveitis onset during further followup. Such a correlation was also found for the JADAS (also including the ESR as a parameter) and the cJADAS in our study. Indeed, the risk for uveitis occurrence during followup was nearly twice as high for patients with a cJADAS >10 at first documentation than for those with a lower JADAS (HR 1.64, P = 0.047).

Apart from demographic and clinical data, further biomarkers to predict uveitis risk for an individual patient are highly desirable. Interestingly, ESR has been shown to correlate well with the risk for uveitis 66, 67, 68, 69. In our study, an ESR >35 mm/hour at first documentation was associated with a significantly higher risk for uveitis onset during followup (OR 2.0, P < 0.001; univariate analysis) (Table 1). This is even more interesting considering that these children were treated more frequently with DMARDs (data not shown).

Although there are indications that DMARDs may reduce the risk for uveitis in JIA 29, 49, such an effect was not clearly confirmed in other studies 70, which showed a nearly stable uveitis prevalence despite more frequent use of DMARDs. In our large cohort, we found a significantly lower risk for uveitis onset in patients with MTX as a monotherapy than in patients not taking any DMARDs. This effect was even stronger if MTX was initiated at an early stage of disease (Figure 2) or when combined with a TNF inhibitor (Figures 1 and 2), and even more pronounced in the subgroup analysis for patients at high risk for uveitis, namely RF‐negative polyarthritis and oligoarthritis, persistent or extended.

### Complement lectin pathway protein levels reflect disease activity in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a longitudinal study of the nordic JIA cohort [^8e42df09]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Correlation between markers of disease activity, treatment, disease status and lectin pathway protein levels

The protein levels at baseline were compared to ESR, JADAS71 or cumulative joint count at baseline. M-ficolin was positively correlated to the ESR levels (Table 3); however, the correlation found was weak. At baseline, elevated ESR (> 20 mm/hr) was observed in 55/238 (23.1%) of patients investigated for lectin pathway proteins. Participants with elevated ESR had significantly higher M-ficolin levels than those with normal values (median 3.43 μg/mL (IQR 2.86–4.46) versus median 2.85 μg/mL (IQR 2.35–3.59) (p < 0.001)). Conversely, for MASP-1 and MASP-3 there was a tendency towards higher levels in patients with normal ESR compared to elevated ESR but the difference did not reach significance (p = 0.12 and p = 0.08, respectively) (data not shown).

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^2e56a6b6]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) response monitoring—In children with presumed or confirmed ABA receiving antimicrobial therapy with or without surgical intervention, in addition to serial clinical evaluation, we suggest performing C-reactive protein (CRP) at initial evaluation followed by sequential monitoring of CRP to assess response to therapy, rather than relying solely on clinical evaluation (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence); Serial clinical examination that assess the febrile response, pain and musculoskeletal function remain the primary means of monitoring response to treatment. Gradual clinical improvement including resolution of fever over 2 to 4 days is generally expected; CRP typically has a peak on day 2–3 in uncomplicated infection and returns to the normal range in about 9 to 12 days. The consensus of the Guideline Panel is that CRP may be evaluated every 2 or 3 days until the concentration begins to drop consistently, and once the CRP concentration has decreased substantially in the context of ongoing clinical improvement, further measurement is not necessary. A declining CRP concentration can be used to provide information supplementary to the clinical course for determining when a child may be transitioned to oral antimicrobial therapy and/or discharged home, and successful transition to oral therapy after good clinical response plus CRP decline by 50% or more has been described. If serial CRPs fail to trend downward or resume an upward trend, particularly with recurrent symptoms, children should be carefully evaluated for persistent ABA or adjacent osteomyelitis and may require advanced imaging such as MRI. The role of other inflammatory markers, such as serum procalcitonin (PCT), has not been established; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) has limited utility and in one study took a mean of 18 days to normalize; normalization or substantial decline in the blood white blood cell (WBC) count over the first few days is consistent with response but has not been prospectively evaluated adequately as a biomarker of recovery.

### The prognostic value of markers of inflammation in patients with troponin T-negative chest pain before discharge from the emergency department [^3f885c14]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the prognostic value of markers of inflammation for rule-out purposes in patients admitted to the emergency department with troponin T-negative chest pain.

Methods

Patients presenting to the emergency department within 6 hours of symptom onset and who had a normal or nondiagnostic electrocardiogram were eligible. The standard rule-out protocol, which included serial creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB measurements, was applied, and markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and total white blood cell count and differential count) were measured. The study group comprised patients with negative serial troponin T results (<0.06 microg/L) who were discharged home after unstable coronary artery disease was ruled out. Endpoints during the 6-month follow-up were cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization for unstable angina.

Results

A total of 382 troponin T-negative patients were discharged, of whom 2 died, 2 had a myocardial infarction, and 7 were rehospitalized for unstable angina. A positive C-reactive protein test result (>0.3 mg/dL) was associated with future clinical events (hazard risk [HR] = 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2 to 17.0; P = 0.03), as was a positive test (>13 mm/h) for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (HR = 5.6; 95% CI: 1.5 to 22.2; P = 0.01). Patients with positive results for both tests were at highest risk of clinical events (9.3%) compared with patients with other combinations of test results (1.1% to 2.1%; HR = 7.5; 95% CI: 2.2 to 25.5; P = 0.001).

Conclusion

The combination of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate had prognostic value in patients with troponin T-negative chest pain and a normal or nondiagnostic electrocardiogram in whom unstable coronary artery disease was ruled out.

### Are poor prognostic factors a realistic basis for treatment decisions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis? Lessons from the IMPROVED study [^c91644b6]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) recommend the use of poor prognostic factors (PPFs) in treatment decisions.PPFs are: (1) persistent moderate/high disease activity after conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), (2) high C reactive protein (CRP)/erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels at baseline, (3) high swollen joint counts (SJC) at baseline, (4) presence of Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and/or Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibodies (ACPA), especially at high levels, (5) presence of early erosions or (6) failure of two or more csDMARDs.PPFs are associated with an increased risk of radiographic damage over time. It is recommended, if a treatment target is not achieved with the first csDMARD strategy, to treat patients without PPFs with a second csDMARD, but to switch to treatment with a biological DMARD (bDMARD) if PPFs are present. These considerations are based on expert opinion, and an investigation into the association between stratification and treatment outcomes is recommended.We aim to explore the presence of PPFs in early RA and to investigate their relationship with treatment response after failure of the first csDMARD strategy.

### Prognostic value of erythrocyte sedimentation rate in ST segment elevation myocardial infarction: interaction with hyperglycaemia [^533703ce]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Many inflammatory markers are associated with an adverse prognosis after ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Hyperglycaemia may exacerbate this inflammatory response. We investigated whether the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was associated with an adverse prognosis and whether this was mediated by glucose levels.

It concerns a post hoc analysis of a prospective randomised trial. In 346 patients with STEMI treated with reperfusion therapy, we investigated long-term outcome. Patients with ESR in the upper quartile (>14 mm h(-1)) were compared to patients with a normal ESR. Hyperglycaemia was defined as admission glucose >or=7.8 mmol L(-1). Median follow up was 7.4 years (range: 5.7-8.3).

Main Outcome Measures

All cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, sudden death, death as a result of heart failure.

Results

Both elevated ESR and hyperglycaemia were associated with a worse prognosis and increased mortality. Elevated ESR was particularly associated with an increased risk of sudden death (OR: 3.3, 17% vs. 6%, P < 0.01) whereas hyperglycaemia was especially associated with an increased risk of death because of heart failure (OR: 6.5, 8% vs. 1%, P < 0.01). There was no association between increased ESR and elevated glucose levels. Multivariate analysis did reveal that both elevated ESR and admission glucose were independent predictors of long-term mortality.

Conclusions

Elevated ESR and admission glucose are independent predictors of mortality in STEMI patients treated with reperfusion therapy. There is no association or interaction between glucose levels and the inflammatory response as reflected by ESR.

### Predictive value of inflammatory markers for cancer diagnosis in primary care: a prospective cohort study using electronic health records [^00963d1a]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Index tests

Three inflammatory marker tests were analysed: CRP, ESR and PV. The index date was defined as the first date of inflammatory marker blood testing in 2014; controls were allocated the same index date as their matched case. As different laboratories use different thresholds to define abnormality, we used the mean upper limit of normal from laboratories within our study to define a raised inflammatory marker. For CRP this mean was 6.8 mg/l, therefore we rounded to a conservative threshold of 7 mg/l. For PV the upper limit of normal was 1.72 mPa.s. For ESR, we used the mean reported upper limit of normal, stratified by gender and in 10-year age bands, which varied from 11 mm/h for women under 40, to 23 mm/h for men over 80 (see supplementary table 1). For those with the same inflammatory marker test coded more than once on the same day (n = 231), the highest value was retained. For patients with more than one type of inflammatory marker on the same day a binary variable was generated for ‘any raised inflammatory marker’, which was positive if any of CRP, PV or ESR were raised.

Outcome variables

The primary outcome was the one-year cancer incidence; we also examined two-year incidence, lest there be a delayed effect. All new cancer diagnoses, excluding benign and in situ cancers and non-melanomatous skin cancers, were identified by searching the CPRD records for any of the 2120 cancer-related codes (available from the authors on request). This code list has been developed using published methodsand validated in several studies: it is collated into 22 common cancer sites. New cancer diagnoses were also extracted from the cancer registry by CPRD staff. Patients were included as having cancer if a diagnosis was recorded in either CPRD or the cancer registry, with the earliest record of cancer assigned to be the date of diagnosis.

In order to identify the main symptoms associated with inflammatory marker testing, we searched the CPRD for codes in the 28 days prior to and including the index date. We retained the 200 most frequently occurring codes in those with raised inflammatory markers, normal inflammatory markers and untested controls. After removing non-clinical administrative codes we used frequency counts to identify the most commonly occurring symptoms, categorised according to the International Classification of Primary Care.We then used methods described previouslyto generate complete code lists for each of these symptoms.

### Consensus document for the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infections: a joint paper by the EANM, EBJIS, and ESR (with ESCMID endorsement) [^3bb17031]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Early infection is often easy to recognize by acute pain in the wound area, redness, swelling, wound leakage, heat, and fever. Late infection is often caused by haematogenous spread, with symptoms from both the affected joint and the primary infection site. The main diagnostic problem is the delayed, often low-grade infection with mostly nonspecific symptoms. In all PJIs, a delay in starting an appropriate antibiotic regimen and surgical treatment has an important impact on the chance of saving the prosthesis and joint function. Therefore, early diagnosis is of utmost importance.

There is no single routine test available that can diagnose PJI with sufficient accuracy. Cultures, biopsies, serum inflammatory markers, and imaging techniques all have their pros and cons. C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and leukocyte count are not sensitive or specific enough to detect or exclude a PJI. Joint aspiration itself involves a risk of infection, and its sensitivity is highly variable. In general, a combination of clinical, laboratory, microbiological, and imaging tests are performed based on personal experience, techniques available in the institute, and cost aspects. Indeed, most signs and symptoms that might indicate the presence of a PJI may be simply related to an aseptic loosening of the prosthesis or to a soft tissue infection. Since loosening, soft tissue infection without osteomyelitis, and PJI require different treatment strategies (NSAIDs, antibiotic therapy, or surgery for explant and re-implant), the correct differential diagnosis among these clinical situations is crucial.

The development of biofilms plays a strategic role in the pathogenesis of PJI. Microorganisms adhere to the implant and form a biofilm, within which they are protected from the host immune system and most antibiotics. The most frequent etiologic agents are staphylococci, accounting for more than 50% of PJIs. Staphylococcus aureus is most commonly isolated in early infection, whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci are more frequent in late infection.

Other commonly isolated organisms in late infections are streptococci (9–10%), enterococci (3–7%), and anaerobes (2–4%). Gram-negative bacteria, mostly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp. and Proteus spp. even if relatively uncommon agents, have an important clinical impact because of the difficulty in treating them. Overall, about 20% of PJIs are polymicrobial and 7–11% are culture-negative. Unusual pathogens such as Candida spp. Brucella spp. and mycobacteria have also been reported.

### Systemic inflammation is associated with depressive symptoms differentially by sex and race: a longitudinal study of urban adults [^fe6b28fa]. Molecular Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Using refrigerated whole blood (5 ml) stored in EDTA buffer, ESR was tested within 24 h of blood draw using automated modified Westergren photochemical capillary stopped flow kinetic analysis. Based on the Mayo clinic reports, ESR’s reference range is 0–22 mm/hr for men and 0–29 mm/hr for women. Similarly, hsCRP was analyzed with an immunoturbidimeter (Siemens/Behring Nephelometer II), utilizing 0.5–1 ml of plasma. A range of 1–3 mg/dL suggests average and 3–10 mg/dL high cardiovascular risk while hsCRP > 10 mg/dL reflects putative infection or chronic inflammation. Moreover, after collecting 0.5–1 ml sample of plasma prepared with heparin and refrigerated for < 30 days, albumin was measured using spectrophotometry (expected reference range: 3.6–5.1 g/dL). Finally, 0.5–1 ml of fasting serum was collected for iron determination, which was transported at room temperature (with heparin added), followed by refrigeration or freezing. Serum iron was determined with spectrophotometry, and reference ranges are age and sex-specific, [Men aged ≥ 30 y: 50–180 µg/dL; Women aged 20–49 y (40–190 µg /dL) and women aged 50 + y (45–160 µg/dL)].

Cytokines

All available cytokines were used in our present study. Blood sample aliquots were frozen at −80 °C and stored for later use. Interleukin (IL) cytokines were assayed in one batch by Aushon Ciraplex® ULTRA Ultrasensitive Assays in femtogram/ml (fg/ml) detection levels. The serum samples were collected from HANDLS participants for studies of DNA repair and age-related microRNA changes. Cytokines selected for this study included IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-18 (in pg/ml), as they were previously linked with depressive symptoms.

### How to manage accidental and unintended exposure in radiology: an ESR white paper [^f93028b3]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Significant dose events

Too high exposures of patients undergoing a specific procedure, imaging of a wrong body part or imaging the wrong patient are rare but may happen everywhere at any time. The term “significant events” is a summary of the definition given by the EU-BSS for unintended and accidental overexposures in Article 4 (99):

medical exposure that is significantly different from the medical exposure intended for a given purpose.

In case of diagnostic and interventional radiology, this is related to unnecessary overexposures of individual patients with the risk of deterministic effects, high effective doses or high organ doses (individual approach) or a group of patients with the risk of stochastic effects (collective approach). These two approaches were discussed at a Heads of the European Radiological protection Competent Authorities (HERCA) Working Group “Medical Applications” meeting, in Paris 2016. The collective approach involves exposure of a larger number of patients with low doses well below the threshold of deterministic effects. Reasons may be technical errors of a modality or human errors in the application of examination protocols or the use of the equipment. Chest radiograms of many patients over several days with missing aluminium/copper filter or incorrect antiscatter grid position could be an unintended collective overexposure if dose criteria for “significant” are met.

The individual approach involves exposure of one patient to doses that result in deterministic effects (such as skin injuries) or high effective doses or organ doses. Reasons may be technical errors of a modality or human errors in the application of an examination protocol or the use of the equipment. The individual approach also involves exposing a wrong patient due to confusion or a wrong organ or body side (e.g. wrong arm or leg). Interventional procedures with too many imaging series or excessive fluoroscopy time without changing the X-ray skin entrance field would be an unintended individual overexposure.

Radiation protection and patient safety require all efforts to prevent such incidents. If they occur, the first step should be in any case a local workup involving the practitioner, staff members, medical physics experts and radiation protection officer/expert. Referrer and patient should be informed about the incident. The definition of incidents may include near misses where an error was detected before performing a procedure with patient exposure. A summary of all possible errors, their causes and consequences for avoiding repetition can be found in.

### Plasma D-dimer does not anticipate the fate of reimplantation in two-stage exchange arthroplasty for periprosthetic joint infection: a preliminary investigation [^bbc3dded]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory markers such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels have always been a part of the diagnostic criteria for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), but they perform poorly anticipating the outcome of reimplantation. D-dimer has been reported in a small series as a potential marker to measure infection control after single-stage revisions to treat PJI. Nonetheless, its use to confirm infection control and decide the proper timing of reimplantation remains uncertain.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What is the best diagnostic threshold and accuracy values for plasma D-dimer levels compared with other inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP) or what varying combinations of these tests are associated with persistent infection after reimplantation? (2) Do D-dimer values above this threshold, ESR, CRP, and varying test combinations at the time of reimplantation indicate an increased risk of subsequent persistent infection after reimplantation?

Methods

We retrospectively studied the electronic medical records of all 53 patients who had two-stage revisions for PJI and who underwent plasma D-dimer testing before reimplantation at one of two academic institutions from November 22, 2017 to December 5, 2020. During that period, all patients undergoing two-stage revisions also had a D-dimer test drawn. The minimum follow-up duration was 1 year. We are reporting at this early interval (rather than the more typical 2-year time point) because of the poorer-than-expected performance of this diagnostic test. Of these 53 patients, 17% (9) were lost to follow-up before 1 year and could not be analyzed; the remaining 44 patients (17 hips and 27 knees) were studied here. The mean follow-up was 503 ± 135 days. Absence or persistence of infection after reimplantation were defined according to the Delphi criteria. The conditions included in these criteria were: (1) control of infection, as characterized by a healed wound without fistula, drainage, or pain; (2) no subsequent surgical intervention owing to infection after reimplantation; and (3) no occurrence of PJI-related mortality. The absence of any of the aforementioned conditions until the final follow-up examination was deemed a persistent infection after reimplantation. Baseline patient characteristics were not different between patients with persistent infection (n = 10) and those with absence of it after reimplantation (n = 34) as per the Delphi criteria. Baseline patient characteristics evaluated were age, gender, self-reported race (white/Black/other) or ethnicity (nonHispanic/Hispanic), BMI, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status, smoking status(smoker/nonsmoker), and joint type (hip/knee). The optimal D-dimer threshold to differentiate between persistence of infection or not after reimplantation was calculated using the Youden index. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to test the accuracy of D-dimer, ESR, CRP, and their combinations to establish associations, if any, with persistent infection after reimplantation. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (free of infection after reimplantation) with a log-rank test was performed to investigate if D-dimer, ESR, and CRP were associated with absence of infection after reimplantation. Survival or being free of infection after reimplantation was determined as per Delphi criteria. Alpha was set at p < 0.05.

Results

In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, with an area under the curve of 0.62, D-dimer showed low accuracy and did not anticipate persistent infection after reimplantation. The optimal D-dimer threshold differentiating between persistence of infection or not after reimplantation was 3070 ng/mL. When using this threshold, D-dimer demonstrated a sensitivity of 90% (95% CI 55.5% to 99.7%) and negative predictive value of 94% (95% CI 70.7% to 99.1%), but low specificity (47% [95% CI 29.8% to 64.9%]) and positive predictive value (33% [95% CI 25.5% to 42.2%]). Although D-dimer showed the highest sensitivity, the combination of D-dimer with ESR and CRP showed the highest specificity (91% [95% CI 75.6% to 98%]) defining the persistence of infection after reimplantation. Based on plasma D-dimer levels, with the numbers available, there was no difference in survival free from infection after reimplantation (Kaplan-Meier survivorship free from infection at minimum 1 year in patients with D-dimer below 3070 ng/mL versus survivorship free from infection with D-dimer above 3070 ng/mL: 749 days [95% CI 665 to 833 days] versus 615 days [95% CI 471 to 759 days]; p = 0.052). Likewise, there were no associations between high ESR and CRP levels and persistent infection after reimplantation, but the number of events was very small, and insufficient power is a concern with this analysis.

Conclusion

In this preliminary series, with the numbers available, D-dimer alone had poor accuracy and was not associated with survival free from infection after reimplantation in patients who underwent two-stage exchange arthroplasty. D-dimer alone might be used to establish that PJI is unlikely, and the combination of D-dimer, ESR, and CRP should be considered to confirm PJI diagnosis in the setting of reimplantation.Level of Evidence Level IV, diagnostic study.

### Non-invasive and minimally invasive management of low back disorders [^e17723d7]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Low back algorithm—evaluation of subacute, chronic, or slow‑to‑recover low back pain begins with “Patients with activity limitations due to low back symptoms not improving or slow to resolve over 4 to 6 weeks.” If there are no “Neurologic symptoms in lower limbs?” and symptoms are “Primarily low back symptoms,” then “Evaluate for specific suspected conditions, especially AP/lateral x-rays. Consider also urinalysis, CBC, ESR, bone scan, hepatic enzymes, amylase.” If “Test results positive?” and not “Age-related changes only?,” then “Evaluate as indicated,” with disposition “Exit Algorithm or Go to Algorithm 6 if chronic back-related disorder”; if either “Age-related changes only?” or tests are negative, “Go to Algorithm 5.” If neurologic symptoms are present, assess whether “Significant (e.g., limiting work ability) sciatica present >4 weeks?”; if not, “Go to Algorithm 2.” If yes, determine “Obvious level of nerve root dysfunction on physical exam?”; if not, obtain “EMG. For new radicular pain, wait at least 3 weeks from onset.” If there is “Evidence of nerve dysfunction on EMG?,” then “Consult and/or choose CT or MRI to define nerve root compression.” If there is “Physiologic and anatomic evidence of nerve root compression?,” proceed to “Go to Algorithm 4”; if not, “Go to Algorithm 5.” The figure caption clarifies scope as “evaluation of subacute, chronic, or slow-to-recover patients with low back pain unimproved or slow to improve (symptoms >4 weeks).”

### Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, or rheumatoid factor are normal at presentation in 35%-45% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis seen between 1980 and 2004: analyses from Finland and the United States [^d87e3693]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and rheumatoid factor (RF) tests in 2 databases of consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over 25 years between 1980 and 2004, in Finland and the USA.

Methods

Databases of 1892 patients of 7 rheumatologists in Jyväskylä, Finland, and 478 of one author in Nashville, TN, USA, seen in usual care, were reviewed for the first recorded ESR and CRP, and all RF tests.

Results

Median ESR at presentation was 30 mm/h at both sites. Mean ESR was 36 mm/h in Jyväskylä and 35 mm/h in Nashville. ESR was < 28 mm/h in 45% and 47% of patients at the 2 sites, respectively. CRP was normal in 44% and 58%, and all RF tests were negative in 38% and 37%, respectively. Both ESR and CRP were normal in 33% and 42% of patients, and all 3 tests were normal in 15% and 14% of patients in whom they were assessed. All 3 tests were abnormal in only 28% in Jyväskylä and 23% in Nashville.

Conclusion

A majority of patients with RA seen between 1980 and 2004 had abnormal ESR, CRP, or RF. However, more than 37% of patients had ESR < 28 mm/h, normal CRP, or all negative RF tests. Similarities of laboratory test data at 2 sites on different continents with different duration of disease suggest generalizability of the findings. Normal ESR, CRP, and RF are seen in a substantial proportion of patients with RA at this time.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^ba49dbb2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Osteomyelitis—diagnostic evaluation is typically based on clinical suspicion with confirmation by imaging and laboratory methods, and inflammatory markers are often elevated: the peripheral white blood cell count may be elevated; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are often elevated as well. Establishing an etiologic diagnosis nearly always requires obtaining bone for microbiologic evaluation unless blood cultures are positive in the context of convincing radiographic findings, which can be accomplished by imaging-guided or surgical sampling. As much specimen as possible should be submitted to the laboratory; specimens may include pieces of intact bone, shavings, scrapings, and/or excised or aspirated necrotic material. Swabs are not recommended and cultures of sinus tracts are generally not recommended, because recovered organisms, aside from Staphylococcus aureus, do not correlate well with those found in deep cultures. In adults, imaging-guided aspiration or open biopsy is typically necessary, and those with underlying diabetes mellitus or vascular insufficiency are at particular risk for osteomyelitis.

### ESR / ERS white paper on lung cancer screening [^47215c28]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Increasing knowledge about the CT phenotypes of screen-detected pulmonary nodules with different biologic behaviours will lead to a better estimation of their probability of malignancy, and help to decrease the amount of additional follow-up scans and workup examinations, e.g. perifissural nodules were demonstrated to have a high likelihood of being benign.

For the invasive diagnostic work-up of small nodules, the value of white light fibrebronchoscopy is very limited, but newer diagnostic endoscopic techniques, such as endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy with mini probe or electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, might be more promising. For some peripheral nodules (> 1 cm), transthoracic CT-guided biopsy or primary resection by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for diagnostic and therapeutic reasons may be recommended. The risk of serious complications (pneumothorax requiring drainage, cardiorespiratory complications during anaesthesia, infection or haemorrhage) not only relates to the invasiveness of the diagnostic procedure itself, but also to the patient’s functional status. Subjects eligible for LDCT screening will present themselves mostly with a high comorbidity risk, due to COPD or chronic cardiovascular disease.

Adhering to a certified high quality radiology plan for LDCT screening will minimise radiation exposure for screening participants. Further, the adherence to a pulmonary nodule management plan based on nodule diameter, volume and growth rate will help to increase safety for lung cancer screening participants, mostly by decreasing the total amount of diagnostic investigations they will need to undergo in order to determine the nature of their screen-detected lung nodules. Moreover, a lower amount of false-positive lesions with a decreased number of additional diagnostic investigations may finally help to decrease participant’s anxiety and psychological stress during lung cancer screening.

Radiation exposure

The vast majority of lung cancer screening trials were designed more than a decade ago. The LDCT protocols were simply achieved by reducing the fixed tube load of diagnostic CT from typically 100–300 mAs to 10–40 mAs. A CT dose index (CTDI vol) of 2–3 mGy was used as a target for NLST. Similar values were used in the NELSON and the various other European trials. The resulting effective dose is roughly 40 % of these values for males and 50 % for females, resulting in 1–1.3 mSv for a CTDI vol of 2.5 mGy. The organ dose (mSv) to the lung or to the breast can be roughly estimated using 1.5 × CTDI vol. Precise numbers vary depending on scanner type, and in particular on the pre-filtering of the X-ray spectrum.

### Cervical epidural abscess associated with massively elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [^fb47c64f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

We present a case of an elderly woman who presented with neck pain, low-grade fever, bandemia, and a massively elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) who had a cervical epidural abscess. We believe that the selective use of ESR assisted in narrowing the differential diagnosis, as the patient had no neurological deficits and no predisposing factors such as distal infection, immunosuppression, trauma, or recent surgery. Furthermore, in the literature, an elevated ESR is consistently found in patients with epidural abscesses, whereas clinical findings such as fever, leukocytosis, and neurological deficits are only variably present.

### Declines in erythrocyte sedimentation rates in patients with rheumatoid arthritis over the second half of the 20th century [^ea4703ae]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze baseline erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESR) in cohorts of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which had been included in a review concerning longterm mortality, in reports published between 1973 and 2008, with baseline observations between 1954 and 2000.

Methods

A computer search and complementary review of the literature had identified 84 unique cohorts with RA for which mortality over 5-40 years was reported. Baseline ESR data were available for 23 of the 84 cohorts. Mean and median ESR, age, disease duration, and rheumatoid factor (RF) status were compiled and analyzed in tertiles according to first year of patient recruitment.

Results

Among 7 cohorts recruited initially between 1954 and 1980, median ESR at baseline was 47 mm/h (mean 50 mm/h, range 43-66), compared to median 38 mm/h (mean 41 mm/h, range 34-64) among 8 cohorts recruited between 1981 and 1984, and median 36 mm/h (mean 35 mm/h, range 28-42) among 8 cohorts recruited between 1985 and 1996. The lowest mean ESR among 7 cohorts with baseline in 1980 or earlier was 43 mm/h, and the highest reported mean ESR among 8 cohorts recruited after 1985 was 42 mm/h. In 3 cohorts recruited after 1985 from Sweden, Finland, and Spain, mean baseline ESR was < 30 mm/h.

Conclusion

Mean ESR fell by 30% in cohorts of patients with RA recruited before 1981 compared to cohorts recruited after 1984. This decline may reflect changes in both the natural history and approaches to therapy of RA.

Data Extraction Both authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, abstracted data using a standardized instrument, and classified study quality using predetermined criteria.

Data Synthesis The prevalence of TA in the general population is less than 1%. However, in our 21 core studies, 39% of patients referred for temporal artery biopsy. artery abnormality was the only clinical factor that modestly reduced the likelihood of disease. Predictive physical findings included temporal artery beading, . prominence, and tenderness. Normal ESR values indicated much less likelihood of disease. Conclusions A small number of clinical features are helpful in predicting the likelihood of a positive temporal artery biopsy among patients with a clinical suspicion of disease; the most useful finding is a normal ESR, which makes TA unlikely.

### Promoting appropriate utilisation of laboratory tests for inflammation at an academic medical centre [^b8fb73ca]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Strategy

Prior to developing our interventions, we conducted an email survey of selected physician leaders in groups with high ESR utilisation rates to investigate reasons for the current practice. Five open-ended questions explored: (A) perceived drivers of combined ESR/CRP testing, (B) potential negative impact of reducing ESR testing, (C) clinical situations in which ESR would be preferable to CRP, (D) potential barriers to change and (E) anticipated impact of EMR CDS on the clinical practice of their group.

We performed an informal thematic analysis of survey results, which identified several recurring themes. Surveyed physicians across different specialties indicated low awareness that CRP was a more sensitive and specific test for acute phase inflammation and that the American Society for Clinical Pathology recommended against ordering an ESR in this clinical scenario. Clinical habit and ease of test ordering were identified as key drivers of ESR overuse. In addition, several surveyed physicians identified specific disease states or clinical scenarios where they felt ESR provided additive or more accurate clinical information than CRP, and thus, completely eliminating ESR use would not be a clinically prudent or feasible goal. One surveyed physician indicated that she preferred ESR because she (mistakenly) believed it was a less expensive test than CRP. As anticipated, there was a general concern that EMR changes would make it more difficult to order appropriate tests.

In Study WA28119 (NCT01791153), 251 screened patients with new-onset or relapsing GCA were randomized to one of four treatment arms. Two subcutaneous doses of ACTEMRA (162 mg every week and 162 mg every other week) were compared to two different placebo control groups (pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen over 26 weeks and 52 weeks) randomized 2:1:1:1. The study consisted of a 52-week blinded period, followed by a 104-week open-label extension.

All patients received background glucocorticoid (prednisone) therapy. Each of the ACTEMRA-treated groups and one of the placebo-treated groups followed a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen with the aim to reach 0 mg by 26 weeks, while the second placebo-treated group followed a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen with the aim to reach 0 mg by 52 weeks designed to be more in keeping with standard practice.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving sustained remission from Week 12 through Week 52. Sustained remission was defined by a patient attaining a sustained (1) absence of GCA signs and symptoms from Week 12 through Week 52, (2) normalization of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (to < 30 mm/hr without an elevation to ≥ 30 mm/hr attributable to GCA) from Week 12 through Week 52, (3) normalization of C-reactive protein (CRP) (to < 1 mg/dL, with an absence of successive elevations to ≥ 1mg/dL) from Week 12 through Week 52, and (4) successful adherence to the prednisone taper defined by not more than 100 mg of excess prednisone from Week 12 through Week 52. ACTEMRA 162 mg weekly and 162 mg every other week + 26 weeks prednisone taper both showed superiority in achieving sustained remission from Week 12 through Week 52 compared with placebo + 26 weeks prednisone taper (Table 9). Both ACTEMRA treatment arms also showed superiority compared to the placebo + 52 weeks prednisone taper (Table 9).

### Inflammation in young adulthood is associated with myocardial infarction later in life [^c17c8e31]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is evidence that atherosclerosis begins in childhood. There is also evidence that inflammatory markers measured in middle and old age predict risks of cardiovascular disease. In this report, we test whether an inflammatory marker measured in young adult men is associated with risk of myocardial infarction in middle age.

Methods

During Swedish national conscription tests from 1969 through 1978, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, as a measure of inflammation, was measured in 433,577 young Swedish men. The cohort was observed for subsequent myocardial infarction events through December 2009.

Results

During an average follow-up time of 35 years, a total of 8,081 first-time myocardial infarctions occurred within the cohort. After adjustments for potential confounders and known risk factors for myocardial infarction, men with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (≥15 mm/h) had a 1.7 times increased risk of myocardial infarction during follow-up (95% CI 1.4-2.1) compared with men with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 1 mm/h. This relationship was dose dependent for each unit increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P for trend < .001).

Conclusions

In this cohort of young Swedish men, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was associated with risk of myocardial infarction 35 years later after control of the available data on other coronary risk factors. These data add important relevant information to the existing evidence that atherosclerosis begins in childhood.

14.3 Giant Cell Arteritis – Subcutaneous Administration

The efficacy and safety of subcutaneously administered tocilizumab was assessed in a single, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study in patients with active GCA. In Study WA28119 (NCT01791153), 251 screened patients with new-onset or relapsing GCA were randomized to one of four treatment arms. Two subcutaneous doses of tocilizumab (162 mg every week and 162 mg every other week) were compared to two different placebo control groups (pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen over 26 weeks and 52 weeks) randomized 2:1:1:1. The study consisted of a 52-week blinded period, followed by a 104-week open-label extension.

All patients received background glucocorticoid (prednisone) therapy. Each of the tocilizumab-treated groups and one of the placebo-treated groups followed a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen with the aim to reach 0 mg by 26 weeks, while the second placebo-treated group followed a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen with the aim to reach 0 mg by 52 weeks designed to be more in keeping with standard practice.

Tocilizumab 162 mg weekly and 162 mg every other week + 26 weeks prednisone taper both showed superiority in achieving sustained remission from Week 12 through Week 52 compared with placebo + 26 weeks prednisone taper (Table 8). Both tocilizumab treatment arms also showed superiority compared to the placebo + 52 weeks prednisone taper (Table 8).
