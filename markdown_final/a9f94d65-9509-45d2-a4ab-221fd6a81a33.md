## Question

Which codes apply to depressive disorder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which codes apply to depressive disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "codes" most plausibly refers to in clinical and billing contexts. Then, I should verify the core ICD-10 categories that encompass depressive disorders. Next, I will cross-check these against additional datasets and publications for external validation. After that, I need to consider ICD-10-CM granularity in the U.S. and how DSM-5 criteria relate to ICD coding. Finally, I should review how researchers operationalize these codes, including requirements for multiple encounters and phecode mapping, and synthesize a concise, clinically sound answer with the exact ranges used most consistently in practice and research.

> Let me first confirm what "codes" means here. In routine clinical documentation, billing, epidemiology, and health services research, "codes" for depressive disorders are typically ICD codes, with most countries using ICD-10 while the U.S. uses the more granular ICD-10-CM for diagnoses in health records and claims, so I need to be explicit about both the international base structure and the U.S. clinical modification to avoid ambiguity [^1116vKiN] [^1149aNAt].

> I need to ensure the primary depressive disorder codes are accurate. The highest-credibility source here explicitly defines unipolar depression for health insurance data using ICD-10 codes F32.0–F32.9 for depressive episode, F33.0–F33.9 for recurrent depressive disorder, F34.1 for dysthymia, plus related affective presentations coded as F38.1 and the mixed anxiety and depressive disorder code F41.2, which are commonly included in epidemiologic and administrative definitions of depression in practice and research using SHI datasets [^114kidWp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should validate these ranges externally. Large UK Biobank and other population-based studies frequently define ICD-coded depression using F32 for single episode depression, F33 for recurrent depression, F34 for persistent mood disorders, and sometimes include broader mood categories like F38 and F39 for unspecified mood disorders when constructing "any mood disorder" or "ICD-coded MDD" phenotypes, while other cohorts focus narrowly on F32–F33 as their depression backbone, which reinforces the centrality of F32–F33 and the common inclusion of F34.1 for persistent depressive disorder in many analyses [^116SSCDD] [^115k4Ugg].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought I should include F39 as a core depression code, but let me verify before I enshrine that. The high-credibility insurance-based source does not list F39 among the operational depression codes, and while UK Biobank sometimes includes F39 for unspecified mood disorders in broader mood phenotypes, F39 is not specific to depressive disorder per se, so I should not treat F39 as a core depression code unless the analytic goal is to capture a wider "any mood disorder" construct, in which case the justification needs to be made explicit [^114kidWp] [^116SSCDD].

> Next, I should review ICD-10-CM specificity in the U.S. Wait, let me verify what changes when moving from ICD-10 to ICD-10-CM. The ICD-10-CM framework retains the same alphanumeric core structure for depression (for example, F32.x and F33.x) but expands digits to capture severity, psychotic features, and remission status, so codes like F32.1 denote major depressive disorder, single episode, mild, illustrating the added granularity without changing the fundamental category backbone, which is crucial for clinical documentation and claims analytics in the U.S [^1116vKiN] [^117RwFnX].

> I should confirm how DSM-5 criteria relate to coding to avoid conflating diagnostic criteria with billing codes. DSM-5 provides the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder, but for coding and interoperability DSM aligns with ICD, and practice often involves assigning DSM diagnoses and then using the ICD-10-CM code that corresponds to the DSM diagnosis, consistent with ongoing DSM–ICD harmonization efforts [^1126Hvag] [^115SBgC5].

> Now I will examine how research cohorts operationalize these codes, because that influences which codes "apply" in analytic definitions. Many EHR-based genetic and epidemiologic studies require at least two depression-related ICD encounters to improve positive predictive value, and some map ICD-9/10(-CM) codes to phecodes for standardized phenotype definitions, which explains why datasets sometimes include F34.1 or related affective codes in "depression" phenotypes when aiming for sensitivity while still applying encounter-count thresholds for specificity [^115NuPbz].

> But wait, what about coding validity and transitions between systems, since miscoding could distort which codes "apply" in practice. I should double-check that while ICD-coded MDD is generally usable in claims and EHR research, accuracy varies by condition and context, and transitions across ICD versions necessitate careful mapping and validation, reinforcing the utility of encounter-count rules, supplementary NLP, and standardized crosswalks when defining depression cohorts [^1149aNAt].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the final synthesis is precise. For depressive disorder in ICD-10, the core codes are F32.0–F32.9 for a depressive episode and F33.0–F33.9 for recurrent depressive disorder, with F34.1 for dysthymia and frequent inclusion of F38.1 and F41.2 when definitions encompass related affective presentations or mixed anxiety-depression; in ICD-10-CM, these categories are retained with additional digits to specify severity and clinical features, while DSM-5 supplies diagnostic criteria and is coded using ICD-10-CM in U.S. practice, and research commonly uses encounter-count thresholds and phecode mapping to enhance validity and interoperability [^114kidWp] [^1116vKiN] [^115NuPbz] [^1126Hvag].

Depressive disorders are coded in ICD-10-CM as **F32.x** for single episodes, **F33.x** for recurrent episodes, and **F34.1** for persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) [^114kidWp] [^116SSCDD] [^1116vKiN]. Severity and features are indicated by the decimal extension (e.g. F32.0 mild; F32.2 severe without psychotic features; F32.3 severe with psychotic features) [^notfound]. Accurate coding requires **clinical assessment** of episode number, severity, psychotic features, and remission status [^113u8JNw]; it is also essential for **diagnosis, treatment planning, and billing** [^notfound].

## ICD-10-CM codes for depressive disorders

The ICD-10-CM system classifies depressive disorders primarily under **F32.x, F33.x, and F34.1**, with additional codes for specific conditions [^114kidWp] [^1116vKiN]. The table below summarizes the primary codes:

| **ICD-10-CM code** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| F32.x | Major depressive disorder, single episode |
| F33.x | Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode |
| F34.1 | Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) |
| F34.8 | Other persistent mood (affective) disorders |
| F34.9 | Persistent mood (affective) disorder, unspecified |
| F32.8 | Other specified depressive episodes |
| F32.9 | Depressive episode, unspecified |
| F33.8 | Other recurrent depressive disorders |
| F33.9 | Recurrent depressive disorder, unspecified |

## Detailed breakdown of ICD-10-CM codes

### Major depressive disorder, single episode (F32.x)

- **F32.0**: Mild depressive episode
- **F32.1**: Moderate depressive episode
- **F32.2**: Severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms
- **F32.3**: Severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms
- **F32.4**: Depressive episode, in partial remission
- **F32.5**: Depressive episode, in full remission
- **F32.8**: Other specified depressive episodes
- **F32.9**: Depressive episode, unspecified [^116SSCDD] [^112ZkR24]

---

### Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode (F33.x)

- **F33.0**: Recurrent depressive disorder, current episode mild
- **F33.1**: Recurrent depressive disorder, current episode moderate
- **F33.2**: Recurrent depressive disorder, current episode severe without psychotic symptoms
- **F33.3**: Recurrent depressive disorder, current episode severe with psychotic symptoms
- **F33.4**: Recurrent depressive disorder, currently in remission
- **F33.8**: Other recurrent depressive disorders
- **F33.9**: Recurrent depressive disorder, unspecified [^116SSCDD] [^114kidWp]

---

### Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) (F34.1)

Persistent depressive disorder, also known as dysthymia, is characterized by chronic depressive symptoms lasting at least two years. The ICD-10-CM code for this condition is **F34.1** [^114kidWp].

---

## Clinical implications of depressive disorder codes

Accurate coding of depressive disorders **supports diagnosis and treatment planning**, ensuring appropriate pharmacological and psychological interventions [^111VP2Lj] [^11644Lxx]. It is also essential for billing and reimbursement, ensuring appropriate provider compensation, and it facilitates research and epidemiological studies by enabling accurate tracking of depressive disorder prevalence and treatment outcomes [^112re7WE] [^116SSCDD] [^1116vKiN].

---

## Challenges and limitations in coding depressive disorders

Despite the importance of accurate coding, **several challenges and limitations** exist:

- **Diagnostic accuracy**: The accuracy of diagnostic codes for depressive disorders can vary, with potential for misclassification and underdiagnosis [^113u8JNw] [^1156AzRb] [^115jv4jx].
- **Clinical heterogeneity**: Depressive disorders exhibit significant clinical heterogeneity, making accurate coding challenging [^114kAoqP] [^115F4VGQ] [^111vwGjK].
- **Administrative burden**: The transition to ICD-10-CM has increased administrative complexity, potentially impacting clinical workflow [^11366FEM] [^112re7WE] [^112d4gSc].

---

## Conclusion

ICD-10-CM codes for depressive disorders include **F32.x** for single episodes, **F33.x** for recurrent episodes, and **F34.1** for persistent depressive disorder [^114kidWp]. Accurate coding is essential for **diagnosis, treatment planning, billing, and research**, but challenges remain, including **diagnostic accuracy**, **clinical heterogeneity**, and **administrative burden** [^112re7WE] [^113u8JNw] [^111vwGjK] [^11366FEM].

### Using text mining to extract depressive symptoms and to validate the diagnosis of major depressive disorder from electronic health records [^113u8JNw]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Many studies have used Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to conduct psychiatric research. However, the accuracy of the diagnostic codes for psychiatric disorders in NHIRD is not validated, and the symptom profiles are not available either. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic codes and use text mining to extract symptom profiles and functional impairment from electronic health records (EHRs) to overcome these research limitations.

- **Methods**: A total of 500 discharge notes were randomly selected from a medical center's database. Three annotators reviewed the notes to establish gold standards. The accuracy of diagnostic codes for major psychiatric illness was evaluated. Text mining approaches were applied to extract depressive symptoms and function profiles and to identify patients with major depressive disorder.

- **Results**: The accuracy of the diagnostic code for major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and dementia was acceptable, but that of bipolar disorder and minor depression was less satisfactory. The performance of the text mining approach to recognize depressive symptoms is satisfactory; however, the recall for functional impairment is lower, resulting in lower F-scores of 0.774–0.753. Using the text mining approach to identify major depressive disorder, the recall was 0.85, but precision was only 0.69.

- **Conclusions**: The accuracy of the diagnostic code for major depressive disorder in discharge notes was generally acceptable. This finding supports the utilization of psychiatric diagnoses in claims databases.

### PHQ-9, CES-D, health insurance data-who is identified with depression? A population-based study in persons with diabetes [^114kidWp]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). High credibility.

For a diagnosis in SHI data, an ICD-10 code for the diagnosis of unipolar depression during the study period of nine quarters was required. The diagnosis of unipolar depression included the following codes: F32.0-F32.9, depressive episode; F33.0-F33.9, recurrent depressive disorder; F34.1, dysthymia; F38.1, other mood [affective] disorders; and F41.2, mixed anxiety and depressive disorder.

- **Group composition based on depression measurement**: We classified the participants into eight groups after linking SHI data with survey data.
	- **Group 1**: Reported depression symptoms in the CES-D and PHQ-9 and had a diagnosis in SHI data.
	- **Group 2**: Reported depression symptoms in the CES-D and PHQ-9 but had no diagnosis in SHI data.
	- **Group 3**: Had symptoms according to the PHQ-9 but not according to the CES-D and had a diagnosis in SHI data.
	- **Group 4**: No symptoms were reported with the PHQ-9 but with the CES-D, and they had a diagnosis in SHI data.
	- **Group 5**: Was only identified with the CES-D.
	- **Group 6**: Only with the PHQ-9.
	- **Group 7**: Only with a diagnosis in SHI data.
	- **Group 8**: Had no depression symptoms or diagnosis and was considered as a reference group.

- **Possible associated variables and covariates**: All potentially associated variables and covariates considered as potential predictors were recorded during the baseline survey, except information on clinical and disease-related measures (based on SHI data). Based on a literature review and clinical expertise, we considered socio-demographic variables and patient-reported measures on health-related quality.

### Toward the future of psychiatric diagnosis: The seven pillars of RDoC [^1159LehH]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnostic practices in psychiatry have traditionally relied heavily on the DSM and ICD systems. However, the introduction of the RDoC by the NIMH marks a pivotal shift towards integrating multiple dimensions of mental health research. This paper discusses the seven pillars of RDoC, each representing a domain of functioning, to assist in reconceptualizing psychiatric diagnosis. These domains include:

- **Negative valence systems**: Associated with responses to aversive situations or contexts such as fear, anxiety, and loss.
- **Positive valence systems**: Involved in responses to positive motivational situations or contexts, including approach and decision-making.
- **Cognitive systems**: Encompassing various cognitive processes like attention, perception, and memory.
- **Social processes**: Related to understanding, managing, and responding to others' social behaviors.
- **Arousal and regulatory systems**: Addressing systems regulating arousal, circadian rhythms, and sleep.
- **Genetic and neural underpinnings**: Providing insight into biological pathways linked to psychiatric disorders.
- **Developmental trajectories and environmental influences**: Highlighting the interaction between early-life experiences and emerging psychopathological symptoms.

By embracing these multidimensional approaches, the RDoC framework encourages ongoing research that transcends traditional diagnostic categories, facilitating more personalized and effective interventions in psychiatric practice.

### Data-driven subtypes of major depressive disorder: A systematic review [^115F4VGQ]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most important challenges in global mental health. In research, a continuing challenge is the diversity in the symptoms and pathophysiology of patients classified as having the disorder. MDD patients vary considerably in clinical presentation, course, treatment response, genetics, and neurobiology. One explanation for this diversity is that MDD has a polythetic definition; that is, a patient needs to satisfy some but not all symptoms. For the diagnosis, at least five of nine symptoms, including at least one of the two core symptoms, must be present. It follows that there are 227 possible combinations of symptoms leading to this diagnosis. This wide array of possibilities means that two patients classified as having MDD might have only a single symptom in common. This diversity raises the question of whether it makes sense, for research comparisons, to consider all the people who qualify for the diagnosis of MDD as having a single disorder.

To overcome the problem of symptom diversity, several attempts have been made to specify more homogeneous subgroups within MDD. Subtypes have been proposed based on specific combinations of symptoms (for example, melancholic depression, psychotic depression), onset (seasonal affective disorder, postpartum, early versus late in life), course (single, recurrent, chronic), or severity. Most subtyping schemes are based on pattern recognition and ordering using distinctions observed in clinical practice. For instance, 11 subtypes of MDD were proposed in the research.

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, and more specifically with respect to elderly patients, particularly in the management of minor depression, the APA 2019 guidelines recommend considering the following options for patients with subthreshold or minor depression:

- **CBT (internet)**: For subthreshold depression.

- **CBT (individual) and usual care**: For minor depressive disorder.

- **CBT (group) and usual care**: For treating minor depressive disorder.

- **Combination of CBT and usual treatment**: Over a combination of talking control (individual) and usual care in older adult patients with minor depressive disorder or major depressive disorder.

- **Life review course (group)**: Preferred over an educational video in older adult patients with subclinical depression.

- **Problem-solving therapy (individual)**: As a treatment option.

- **Paroxetine**: As a medication option.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: Is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance [^113ub5ko]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation on October 1, 2015, is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), which was implemented worldwide. The global ICD-10 system has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM's 144,000 codes set for implementation in the United States. This divergence poses a major concern for practicing U.S. physicians while offering advantages to the health IT and hospital industry.

This implementation relies on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which mandates an update from ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and makes no mention of ICD-10 or subsequent versions. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency had unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act by setting emission limits on toxic pollutants from power plants without first considering the costs to the industry. This rationale applies to the medical industry as well, where the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreted HIPAA, imposing extensive regulations without considering the associated costs.

In the United States, the ICD-10-CM system, with its tenfold increase in the number of codes, has led to a system so complex that it no longer compares to those of any other country. Additionally, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system, not ICD-10-CM, only to record mortality across 138 countries.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^116si5Ck]. APA (2019). High credibility.

For elderly patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), particularly those with cognitive impairment, the APA 2019 guidelines recommend considering problem-solving therapy (individual) or paroxetine. This is specifically for persistent depressive disorder in patients with MDD or minor depression within the context of cognitive impairment or dementia.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (third edition) [^113XbP8A]. APA (2010). High credibility.

Regarding quality improvement for major depressive disorder, particularly concerning cultural considerations, the APA 2010 guidelines recommend assessing the impact of language barriers. Additionally, it is crucial to consider cultural variables that influence symptom presentation, treatment preferences, and the extent to which psychiatric illness is stigmatized in the assessment and treatment of MDD.

### Development of a customised programme to standardise comorbidity diagnosis codes in a large-scale database [^115SW888]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). Low credibility.

Both programmes successfully translated ICD-10 codes to the Elixhauser comorbidity classification. Results on programme runtimes for the first iteration ('Linear') and the more efficient ('Parallelised') code are shown. When testing runtimes for the linear code, it updated 100,000 rows in 12–13 hours, varying slightly in each test. Consequently, this linear code would take 16 days to complete the 3.1 million target rows in our dataset. Programme testing was stopped after 7 days due to the impracticality of runtime.

In the development of a second iteration of the code, runtime was reduced by targeting algorithm efficiency. Complexity was improved by converting the 'dictionary' into a hash table, exponentially reducing the number of computer operations performed. Runtime was further enhanced by breaking the data into subsets and translating each subset simultaneously. On a computer with a 16-core processor, this allowed the 3.1 million discharges to be broken into 16 subsets of roughly 200,000 discharges each. This parallelised code translated all 3.1 million rows in 38 minutes (1.2 minutes/100,000 samples), a more than 600-fold increase in processing speed compared with the original programme.

### Mental health gap action programme (mhGAP) guideline for mental, neurological and substance use disorders [Internet] [^11644Lxx]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, and more specifically with respect to initial therapy, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend offering the following structured psychological interventions in adult patients with moderate-to-severe depression:

- **Behavioral activation therapy**: Aimed at increasing engagement with positive activities.

- **Brief psychodynamic therapy**: Focuses on revealing the unconscious content of a person's psyche.

- **CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)**: Aims to change patterns of thinking or behavior that are causing people's problems.

- **Interpersonal therapy**: Focused on improving interpersonal relationships and communication patterns.

- **Problem-solving therapy**: Provides practical strategies to cope with everyday difficulties.

- **Third-wave therapies**: Includes newer forms of therapy such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT).

### Symptom dimensions of major depression in a large community-based cohort [^114kAoqP]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Our understanding of major depression is complicated by substantial heterogeneity in disease presentation, which can be disentangled by data-driven analyses of depressive symptom dimensions. We aimed to determine the clinical portrait of such symptom dimensions among individuals in the community.

- **Methods**: This cross-sectional study consisted of 25,261 self-reported White UK Biobank participants with major depression. Nine questions from the UK Biobank Mental Health Questionnaire encompassing depressive symptoms were decomposed into underlying factors or 'symptom dimensions' via factor analysis, which were then tested for association with psychiatric diagnoses and polygenic risk scores for major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Replication was performed among 655 self-reported non-White participants, across sexes, and among 7,190 individuals with an ICD-10 code for MDD from linked inpatient or primary care records.

- **Results**: Four broad symptom dimensions were identified, encompassing negative cognition, functional impairment, insomnia, and atypical symptoms. These dimensions replicated across ancestries, sexes, and individuals with inpatient or primary care MDD diagnoses, and were also consistent among 43,090 self-reported White participants with undiagnosed self-reported depression. Every dimension was associated with increased risk of nearly every psychiatric diagnosis and polygenic risk score. However, while certain psychiatric diagnoses were disproportionately associated with specific symptom dimensions, the three polygenic risk sc

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: What? Why? How [^117RwFnX]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, meaning the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, enhancing the ability to demonstrate the severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreaks. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article describes what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Dsm-5 and icd-11 definitions of posttraumatic stress disorder: Investigating "narrow" and "broad" approaches [^115zxyVR]. Depression and Anxiety (2014). Low credibility.

The development of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5) and ICD-11 has led to reconsideration of diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys allow investigation of the implications of the changing criteria compared to DSM-IV and ICD-10.

- **Methods**: WMH Surveys in 13 countries asked respondents to enumerate all their lifetime traumatic events (TEs) and randomly selected one TE per respondent for PTSD assessment. DSM-IV and ICD-10 PTSD were assessed for the 23,936 respondents who reported lifetime TEs in these surveys with the fully structured Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). DSM-5 and proposed ICD-11 criteria were approximated. Associations of the different criteria sets with indicators of clinical severity (distress-impairment, suicidality, comorbid fear-distress disorders, PTSD symptom duration) were examined to investigate the implications of using the different systems.

- **Results**: A total of 5.6% of respondents met criteria for "broadly defined" PTSD (i.e. full criteria in at least one diagnostic system), with prevalence ranging from 3.0% with DSM-5 to 4.4% with ICD-10. Only one-third of broadly defined cases met criteria in all four systems and another one-third in only one system (narrowly defined cases). Between-system differences in indicators of clinical severity suggest that ICD-10 criteria are least strict and DSM-IV criteria most strict. The more striking result, though, is that significantly elevated indicators of clinical significance were observed.

### The DSM-5: Classification and criteria changes [^1126Hvag]. World Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) marks the first significant revision of the publication since the DSM-IV in 1994. Changes to the DSM were largely informed by advancements in neuroscience, clinical and public health needs, and identified problems with the classification system and criteria put forth in the DSM-IV. Much of the decision-making was also driven by a desire to ensure better alignment with the International Classification of Diseases and its upcoming 11th edition (ICD-11).

In this paper, we describe select revisions in the DSM-5, with an emphasis on changes projected to have the greatest clinical impact and those that demonstrate efforts to enhance international compatibility, including integration of cultural context with diagnostic criteria and changes that facilitate DSM-ICD harmonization. It is anticipated that this collaborative spirit between the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) will continue as the DSM-5 is updated further, bringing the field of psychiatry even closer to a singular, cohesive nosology.

### Health policy basics: Implementation of the International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision [^112re7WE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10 on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

Psychiatric diagnoses

In total, 51.3% of ICD-11 cases and 39.8% of ICD-10-only cases met SCID diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder during the 0–60 days time interval. ICD-11 cases had significantly higher odds of a SCID comorbid depressive disorder than ICD-10-only cases during the 0–60 days time interval (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.14–2.22, p = 0.007) but similar odds during the 122–456 days time interval (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.83–2.73, p = 0.16), in which 47.9% of ICD-11 cases and 38.0% of ICD-10-only cases met SCID diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder. In total, 20.3% of ICD-11 cases and 20.8% of ICD-10-only cases met SCID diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder in the 0–60 days time interval, and the relative odds were not statistically significant (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.64–1.46, p = 0.917). In total, 20.8% of ICD-11 cases and 18.5% of ICD-10-only cases met SCID diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder in the 122–456 days time interval, and the relative odds were again not statistically significant (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.55–2.46, p = 0.73). For the MINI, 49.2% of ICD-11 cases and 48.5% of ICD-10-only cases met MINI diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder in the 0–60 days time interval, and the relative odds were insignificant (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.40–1.66, p = 1.00). In total, 45.4% of ICD-11 cases and 49.3% of ICD-10-only cases met MINI diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder in the 0–60 days time interval, and the relative odds were again insignificant (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.55–1.79, p = 0.637).

### Large-scale long-tailed disease diagnosis on radiology images [^1116vKiN]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Afterwards, we map disorders to ICD-10-CM codes. Upon obtaining disorder classes, they may fall into varying hierarchical granularity levels. Here, we aim to map them to internationally recognized standards. For this purpose, we utilize the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes, a customized version of the ICD-10 used for coding diagnoses in the U.S. healthcare system. The ICD was originally designed as a healthcare classification system, providing diagnostic codes for classifying diseases, including nuanced classifications of a wide variety of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or disease.

We specifically engage ten medical Ph.D. students to manually map the article titles into ICD-10-CM codes. After cross-checking by a ten-year clinician, we have mapped the 5,568 disorders into the corresponding ICD-10-CM codes. We unify various disorders into the first hierarchical level of the ICD-10-CM code tree, resulting in 930 ICD-10-CM classes. For example, both "J12.0 Adenoviral pneumonia" and "J12 Viral pneumonia" are mapped to the code "J12 Viral pneumonia, not elsewhere classified", eliminating ambiguities caused by diagnosis granularity. We will provide the ICD-10-CM codes along with the original 5,568 classes, each accompanied by its corresponding definition, allowing the dataset to be used for training diagnosis or visual-language models.

Lastly, we supplement some normal cases. Despite the presence of normal cases on, cove…

### ICD-10 criteria for depression in general practice [^112ZkR24]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2001). Low credibility.

The rate of recognition of depressive disorder in general practice is reported to be low. Classification systems, i.e. ICD-10, DSM-III-R, and DSM-IV, with operational diagnostic criteria, have led to greater agreement concerning the diagnosis of depressive disorder. The aim of this study was to assess the applicability and validity of the ICD-10 criteria for depression in general practice in Denmark.

- **Methods**: After a one-day training course in the ICD-10 criteria for depression, ten general practitioners, during an eight-week period, assessed all patients aged 18 or older for depressive symptoms in accordance with the ICD-10 criteria.

- **Results**: Among a total of 3,505 consultations, 116 patients (3.3%) met the criteria for a depressive episode. Of these, 80 (68.8%) agreed to be reinterviewed by a psychiatrist, who confirmed the diagnosis of depressive disorder in 57 of the 80 patients (71.3%).

- **Limitations**: The number of 'false negative' cases is unknown in the study.

- **Conclusion**: The ICD-10 criteria for depression seem to be appropriate and valid in general practice.

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, particularly with respect to elderly patients who have other comorbidities, the APA 2019 guidelines recommend considering the following options for patients with both depression and an indicated complicating factor:

- **Combination of CBT (individual) and usual care**: This is advised for patients with minor or major depressive disorder (MDD) who also have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

- **Multicomponent intervention (individual)**: Recommended for addressing symptoms of depression in temporarily homebound African American adults.

- **Coping improvement (group)**: Advised rather than psychotherapy on request (individual) for older adults with mild-to-severe depressive symptoms and HIV.

### Major depressive disorder on a neuromorphic continuum [^116Y2WrB]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a devastating worldwide mental disorder. Patients with MDD are clinically diagnosed according to the DSM-5-TR when a patient exhibits at least five designated polythetic symptoms. Patients with remarkable heterogeneous clinical manifestations may have co-occurring subtypes of symptoms, and therefore, understanding the biotypes of shared brain signatures may improve our understanding of etiological mechanisms. However, such a categorical model does not consider alternative latent effects. Indeed, depression has been more recently conceptualized as an unbroken "spectrum" (also referred to as factors), rather than as a "category". This conceptualization raises the possibility that neuroimaging can be used to identify more granular disease "patterns", accounting for individual and specific system reorganizations, which may be more readily translatable to individualized patient care.

Highly nosological and neurobiological heterogeneities exist among MDD patients, including subjective symptoms, neuroimaging intermediate phenotypes, and genotypes. Analyses of interindividual differences in MDD populations have therefore been conducted by numerous investigators, as shown by recent attempts to stratify individuals with MDD based on brain neuroimaging or cognitive skills. Prior neuroimaging-based categorical subtyping studies in MDD have assumed that each participant belonged to a distinct categorical subtype based on a shared neuroimaging features base. Progress toward translating knowledge into clinical practice has remained challenging due to these complexities.

### Enhancing research and treatment of mental disorders with dimensional concepts: Toward DSM-V and ICD-11 [^1175iS8w]. World Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The versions of the DSM (DSM-IV-TR) and ICD (ICD-10) describe all mental disorders as polythetic-categorical concepts. Lists of symptoms are presented, and diagnostic category labels are assigned to patients based on observing specific patterns of symptoms. A number of notable conceptual problems emerge when using this strictly categorical system in research and in the clinic. When thorough structured diagnostic interviews are used, typical patients meet criteria for more than one specific diagnosis (a phenomenon termed "comorbidity"). In addition, groups of patients with the same putative categorical label are often heterogeneous with respect to key clinical features, such as severity and prognosis, and patients with symptomatology below diagnostic thresholds are often significantly impaired. Although categorical concepts will always be essential in official nosologies (e.g. in providing diagnostic labels for reimbursement purposes), many of the conceptual problems of a strictly categorical diagnostic system can be overcome by enhancing official nosologies with dimensional concepts. Specific dimensional approaches and directions that may be considered for upcoming revisions of both the DSM and ICD are discussed.

### The genetic contribution to the comorbidity of depression and anxiety: A multi-site electronic health records study of almost 178 000 people [^115NuPbz]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

- **Identifying cases with depression and anxiety**: Depression and anxiety were defined using an initial list of ICD9/10-CM codes mapped to phecodes, which are higher order groups of diagnoses, as described and validated by the Phecode Map 1.2b1 (Denny et al.). These definitions were then modified through expert curation by the authors.

Depression was defined as having at least two depression-related ICD9/10 codes. An initial list of ICD9/10-CM codes was mapped to the phecode for depression (296.2 and 296.22) with the addition of dysthymic disorder [ICD9: 300.4; ICD10: F34.1], depressive type psychosis [ICD9: 298.0], and atypical depressive disorder [ICD9: 296.82].

Anxiety was defined as having at least two anxiety-related ICD9/10 codes. An initial list of ICD9/10-CM codes was mapped to phecodes for anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorders, social phobias, panic disorders, and phobias (300.1, 300.11, 300.12, 300.13, respectively) with the addition of separation anxiety disorder [ICD9: 309.21; ICD10: F93.0]. Hysteria (ICD9: 300.1) and overanxious disorder (ICD9: 313) were removed from this list. The complete list of ICD9/10-CM codes is presented in online Supplementary Tables S1 and S2.

Patients with only one diagnostic code were excluded from all analyses, and controls were patients who had no documented ICD codes for depression and anxiety disorders. No exclusions were made for diagnoses of other psychiatric disorders.

### Identifying data-driven subtypes of major depressive disorder with electronic health records [^115dAkNM]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Efforts to reduce the heterogeneity of major depressive disorder (MDD) by identifying subtypes have not yet facilitated treatment personalization or investigation of biology, so novel approaches merit consideration.

- **Methods**: We utilized electronic health records drawn from two academic medical centers and affiliated health systems in Massachusetts to identify data-driven subtypes of MDD, characterizing sociodemographic features, comorbid diagnoses, and treatment patterns. We applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to summarize diagnostic codes followed by agglomerative clustering to define patient subgroups.

- **Results**: Among 136,371 patients (95,034 women [70%]; 41,337 men [30%]; mean [SD] age, 47.0 [14.0] years), the 15 putative MDD subtypes were characterized by comorbidities and distinct patterns in medication use. There was substantial variation in rates of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use (from a low of 62% to a high of 78%) and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) use (from 4% to 21%).

- **Limitations**: Electronic health records lack reliable symptom-level data, so we cannot examine the extent to which subtypes might differ in clinical presentation or symptom dimensions.

- **Conclusion**: These data-driven subtypes, drawing on representative clinical cohorts, merit further investigation for their utility in identifying more homogeneous patient populations for basic as well as clinical investigation.

### Major depressive disorder in primary care: Strategies for identification [^111Fu2yJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Depression is one of the most common mental disorders, affecting more than 300 million people of all ages globally and is now the leading cause of disability. Despite the availability of effective psychological and pharmacologic treatments, depression recognition and treatment rates remain low. Clinicians can improve the recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of depression by using a measurement-based care approach. The systematic use of validated screening tools can enhance recognition and diagnosis. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends routine depression screening in adults and adolescents, provided systems are in place for accurate diagnosis, treatment initiation, and appropriate follow-up. Here, tools and diagnostic criteria are described.

### Heterogeneity in antidepressant treatment and major depressive disorder outcomes among clinicians [^1177Kaf2]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

While abundant work has examined patient-level differences in antidepressant treatment outcomes, little is known about the extent of clinician-level differences. Understanding these differences may be important in the development of risk models, precision treatment strategies, and more efficient systems of care.

- **Objective**: To characterize differences between outpatient clinicians in treatment selection and outcomes for their patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder across academic medical centers, community hospitals, and affiliated clinics.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a longitudinal cohort study using data derived from electronic health records at two large academic medical centers and six community hospitals, and their affiliated outpatient networks, in eastern Massachusetts. Participants were deidentified clinicians who billed at least 10 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnoses of major depressive disorder per year between 2008 and 2022. Data analysis occurred between September 2023 and January 2024.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Heterogeneity of prescribing was defined as the number of distinct antidepressants accounting for 75% of prescriptions by a given clinician. Additionally, the proportion of patients who did not return for follow-up after an index prescription, and the proportion of patients receiving stable, ongoing antidepressant treatment were measured.

- **Results**: Among 11,934 clinicians treating major depressive disorder, unsupervised learning identified 10 distinct clusters on the basis of ICD codes.

### International consensus statement on major depressive disorder [^113T3BEW]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Considerable variability exists between countries in the management of major depressive disorder. As a result, experts in psychiatry gathered for the International Consensus Group on Depression to outline a universal treatment algorithm for this illness. The experts decided to adapt the existing treatment algorithm developed in Japan and discuss strategies for clinical issues that have been problematic in some countries.

Specific recommendations were made by the consensus group for screening for, diagnosing, and treating depression, which include: periodically screening all patients for depression, completing a differential diagnosis of depression, and referring to a psychiatric specialist if needed. They also emphasized the importance of establishing a therapeutic alliance with patients and their families, choosing and optimizing the dose of appropriate antidepressants based on individual patients' needs, and incorporating nonpharmacologic treatment strategies as necessary.

### Simulation of ICD-9 to ICD-10-CM transition for family medicine: Simple or convoluted [^112d4gSc]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the transition from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), on family medicine and to identify areas where additional training might be required.

- **Methods**: Family medicine ICD-9-CM codes were obtained from an Illinois Medicaid data set, comprising 113,000 patient visits and $5.5 million in claims. Using the science of networks, we evaluated each ICD-9-CM code used by family medicine physicians to determine whether the transition was simple or convoluted. A simple transition is defined as 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to 1 ICD-10-CM code, or 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to multiple ICD-10-CM codes. In contrast, a convoluted transition is where the transitions between coding systems are nonreciprocal and complex, with multiple codes for which definitions become intertwined. Three family medicine physicians evaluated the most frequently encountered complex mappings for clinical accuracy.

- **Results**: Of the 1,635 diagnosis codes used by family medicine physicians, 70% were categorized as simple, 27% as convoluted, and 3% had no mapping. For the visits, 75%, 24%, and 1% corresponded with simple, convoluted, and no mapping, respectively. Payment for submitted claims was similarly aligned. Of the frequently encountered convoluted codes, 3 diagnosis codes were clinically incorrect, but they represent only < 0.1% of the overall diagnosis codes.

- **Conclusions**: The transition to ICD-10-CM is ongoing in family medicine, highlighting the need for targeted training to address convoluted coding scenarios and ensure clinical accuracy.

### Assessing the validity of ICD-10 administrative data in coding comorbidities [^1156AzRb]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2025). Low credibility.

The summary of detailed data extraction and chart review procedures for three cohorts can be found in online supplemental table S1. The detailed review process for the 2003 cohort can be found in Quan et al.'s work. Eastwood et al. and Wu et al. described the review process for the 2015 cohort and the 2022 cohort and their reference standards for comorbidities, respectively. The reviewed charts were then linked with patients' administrative data using a unique lifetime identifier, chart number, and admission date.

The chart review process was consistent across the three selected cohorts. However, between the 2015 and 2022 cohorts, slight variations in the chart review reference standards existed for two conditions: peptic ulcer disease and depression. These subtle changes in definitions were based on the evolving evidence of clinical practices and their guidelines.

- **Statistical analysis**: The prevalence of 17 comorbidities was defined by Quan et al.'s earlier work that established the ICD-10-CA code algorithms. The algorithms' results were compared against the chart review labels set as reference standards for the respective databases. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. We built logistic regression models per cohort using 17 comorbidities as independent variables to examine the validity over time in predicting in-hospital mortality. The C-statistics were calculated for each model to investigate the prediction performance.

Existing studies demonstrated that including prior years' administrative data could enhance the validity of the findings.

### Multi-dimensional criteria for the diagnosis of depression [^114oBNtt]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2001). Low credibility.

The chief goal of the present study is to examine the validity of a dimensional approach to the classification of depressive disorders. Each of the major diagnostic criteria for depression, including symptoms, duration, and frequency, is examined with respect to a series of clinical validators. The sample is comprised of a cohort of 591 individuals from the total population of 18–19 year olds in Zurich, Switzerland, who were followed for a period of 15 years.

The results revealed that:

- Depression may be better represented on a continuum than as a discrete category.
- There is a direct relationship between the number of symptoms of depression, the frequency and duration of depressive episodes, and indicators of the validity of depression.
- In addition to the number of symptoms of depression, a combination of frequency and duration criteria enhances the validity of the classification of depression.

Concerning diagnostic investigations for major depressive disorder, particularly regarding the initial evaluation, the APA 2010 guidelines recommend including the following in the initial diagnostic evaluation:

- **History of the present illness and symptoms**: This should encompass the current episode's details.

- **Psychiatric history**: Include identification of past symptoms of mania, hypomania, or mixed episodes, along with responses to previous treatments.

- **General medical history**: Gather comprehensive medical background information.

- **Personal history**: Collect information about psychological development, responses to life transitions, and major life events.

- **Social, occupational, and family history**: Document a history of mood disorders and suicide in the family, along with the patient's social and occupational background.

- **Review of the patient's prescribed and OTC medications**: Evaluate all current medications, whether prescribed or over-the-counter.

- **Review of systems**: Conduct a systematic review of body systems.

- **Mental status examination**: Perform an assessment of the patient's mental status.

- **Physical examination**: Conduct a thorough physical examination.

- **Appropriate diagnostic tests**: Administer diagnostic tests as necessary to rule out possible general medical causes of depressive symptoms.

### Understanding the severity of depression: Which symptoms of depression are the best indicators of depression severity [^113KLCYD]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

In DSM-5, all symptoms of depression are considered equal representations of severity, while in ICD-10, the type of symptom is considered in classifying severity. It is important to understand if the defining symptoms of depression are differentially associated with overall severity so that severity categorization in diagnostic systems is most valid. In the present study from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, we examined the association between the individual diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) and global ratings of depression severity. We aimed to determine whether there is support for the ICD-10 approach, where some symptoms are better indicators of severity than others.

- **Methods**: Patients were evaluated with a semi-structured interview and the presence of each symptom of MDD was recorded. Patients were also rated on the Clinical Global Index of severity (CGI-S).

- **Results**: All 9 DSM-5 criteria were significantly correlated with the CGI, with suicidality having the highest correlation. A regression analysis found that all 9 criteria were significant predictors of the CGI. At the symptom level, 15 of the 17 symptoms were significantly correlated with the CGI (all except increased appetite and increased weight).

- **Discussion**: Differences were found between the symptoms of depression in their association with severity. Suicidal ideation, depressed mood, and anhedonia had the highest correlations with severity, whereas some symptoms were not significantly associated with severity.

### Preparing for international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification implementation: strategies for maintaining an efficient workflow [^111ptEp2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is required to be used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for healthcare billing data starting in October 2015 in the United States. This revision updates the system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, expanding the codes from approximately 14,000 to 70,000. Our institution aims to update the coding system to alleviate potential burdens on providers, such as the need for more coding information and longer load times.

We performed a simulation test, which included evaluating the diagnosis calculator, timing, and the mapping of new and old codes. Additionally, we conducted a gap analysis to ensure that coding could begin in October 2015 with minimal service disruptions. Our discussion will describe strategies and procedures to transition efficiently between systems while improving classification.

### Evaluating linked ICD-10 Medicare claims data as a method of dementia case ascertainment in research settings [^111cEnyt]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

Reflecting the high degree of overlap across code definitions, demographic correlates of false positives and false negatives were consistent across these definitions. Higher depressive symptoms were associated with false positive classification; minoritized race was associated with false negative classification; and older age and history of stroke were associated with both false positive and false negative classification. As such, the switch to ICD-10 has not appeared to meaningfully improve some of the biases previously identified in the classification of persons with dementia through Medicare claims data.

Aligning with our findings using ICD-10-based code definitions, previous studies focusing on ICD-9-based code definitions found that higher MMSE scores and White race were associated with higher accuracy, whereas older age was associated with lower accuracy, particularly concerning false positives.

Our findings suggest that using Medicare claims to ascertain dementia cases continues to have limitations for older persons, minoritized racial groups, persons with a history of stroke, or those with elevated depressive symptoms. If we use these ICD-10 dementia code definitions for case ascertainment, we may generate case samples enriched for persons with characteristics that have been associated with false positivity, such as depressive symptoms, while systematically under-representing those with characteristics found to be associated with false negativity, such as Hispanic ethnicity or minoritized race.

### An organization- and category-level comparison of diagnostic requirements for mental disorders in ICD-11 and DSM-5 [^115SBgC5]. World Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) published the 5th edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). In 2019, the World Health Assembly approved the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). It has often been suggested that the field would benefit from a single, unified classification of mental disorders, although the priorities and constituencies of the two sponsoring organizations are quite different. During the development of the ICD-11 and DSM-5, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the APA made efforts toward harmonizing the two systems, including the appointment of an ICD-DSM Harmonization Group.

This paper evaluates the success of these harmonization efforts and provides a guide for practitioners, researchers, and policymakers describing the differences between the two systems at both the organizational and the disorder level. The organization of the two classifications of mental disorders is substantially similar. There are nineteen ICD-11 disorder categories that do not appear in DSM-5 and seven DSM-5 disorder categories that do not appear in the ICD-11. We compared the essential features section of the ICD-11 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines (CDDG) with the DSM-5 criteria sets for 103 diagnostic entities that appear in both systems.

We rated 20 disorders (19.4%) as having major differences, 42 disorders (40.8%) as having minor definitional differences, and 10 disorders (9.7%) as having minor differences due to a greater degree of specification in DSM-5.

### Major depressive disorder in DSM-5: Implications for clinical practice and research of changes from DSM-IV [^114bX9fh]. Depression and Anxiety (2014). Low credibility.

The changes in diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) from the fourth to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) may appear small but have important consequences for how the diagnosis is used. In DSM-5, MDD is part of the new "Depressive disorders" section, which is separate from "Bipolar disorders", marking a division in what had been known as "Mood disorders". A small wording change has expanded the core mood criterion to include hopelessness, potentially broadening the diagnosis.

The replacement of an operationalized bereavement exclusion with a call for clinical judgment in distinguishing normal reactions to significant loss from a disorder in need of clinical attention makes the diagnosis less objective and complicates investigations of the relationship between adversity and depression. A new persistent depressive disorder category is intended to encompass both dysthymia and chronic depression, but its relationship to MDD is ambiguous, with conflicting statements on whether the two diagnoses should be considered if both sets of criteria are fulfilled.

Clarification is also needed on whether MDD can be combined with the new broad "other specified bipolar and related disorders". New specifiers of MDD "with anxious distress" and "with mixed features" allow characterization of additional symptoms. The specifier "with perinatal onset" expands on the DSM-IV "postnatal onset" to include onset during pregnancy. We review the changes in the MDD definition, provide guidance on their implementation, and discuss their implications.

Melancholia, in contrast, is a disorder with definable clinical signs that can be verified by laboratory tests and treatment response. It identifies more specific populations than the present system and deserves individual identification in psychiatric classification. Its re-introduction will refine diagnosis, prognosis, treatment selection, and studies of the pathophysiology of a large segment of the psychiatrically ill.

### The contribution of major depression to the global burden of ischemic heart disease: a comparative risk assessment [^115eLupz]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

- **Case definitions**: According to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria, major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by one or more major depressive episodes lasting for at least 2 weeks. There is acknowledgement in the literature that the heterogeneity of depression has implications for research. We reduced this heterogeneity by requiring a case definition of MDD in the studies analyzed to be a diagnosis by a clinician or by non-clinician raters adhering to DSM or International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnostic classifications. For studies that used symptom scales, we required that these map to DSM/ICD diagnostic thresholds as determined by consensus of three of the authors. As we accept measures that are not strictly diagnostic, we refer to the exposure in this paper as major depression (that is, presence of moderate to severe depressive symptoms) as opposed to the DSM-IV category of MDD.

	- Similarly, we draw upon the ICD coding scheme for our case definition of ischemic heart disease (IHD). In line with the basic global burden of disease (GBD) definitions of IHD, we accepted cases of ICD-9 codes 410 to 414 or ICD-10 codes I20 to I25. Angina pectoris alone was not considered an acceptable proxy for IHD due to its subjective nature and usual measurement by self-report alone. However, it was expected that angina (ICD-9 413 and ICD-10 I20) would be included in the IHD case definition of many studies. Study estimates that included cases determined by self-report, physician panel review of medical records, or ICD codes other than previously mentioned were also taken into consideration.

### Severe major depressive disorder readmissions: A national United States population study [^115Akje8]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). High credibility.

National population data are scarce on readmission following hospitalization for severe major depressive disorder (SMDD) in the United States (U.S.). We aim to describe the rates, characteristics, and reasons for readmissions for adults hospitalized for SMDD in the U.S.

- **Methods**: We analyzed the 2018 Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD). We included index hospitalizations for all adult patients (≥ 18 years) with a "principal" diagnosis of SMDD using ICD-10 codes, excluding elective readmissions. Chi-square tests were used to compare baseline characteristics between readmissions and index hospitalizations. The 10 most common reasons for readmission were highlighted.

- **Results**: A total of 236,284 index hospitalizations with a principal diagnosis of SMDD discharged alive were included in the 30-, 90-, 180-, and 330-day readmission analysis. Among these, 27,443 (11.6%), 36,844 (19.8%), 32,269 (26.8%), and 7,915 (36.6%) were readmitted within 30, 90, 180, and 330 days, respectively. Ninety-day readmissions were older, included more males, incurred greater hospital costs, had fewer patients with private insurance, exhibited a higher comorbidity burden, and involved more patients from lower-income households. Additionally, these patients were more likely to present to metropolitan hospitals and leave against medical advice compared to index admissions.

- **Limitations**: Limitations of our study include possible coding errors and a lack of data on race/ethnicity, age of disease onset, duration of illness, medication use, and adherence.

- **Conclusions**: About 1 in 3 patients admitted for SMDD are readmitted within 11 months. Readmissions constitute a significant concern.

### The clinical utility and relevance in clinical practice of DSM-5 specifiers for major depressive disorder: A Delphi expert consensus study [^111CL7Ro]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous syndrome associated with different levels of severity and impairment on personal functioning for each patient. Classification systems in psychiatry, including ICD-11 and DSM-5, are used by clinicians to simplify the complexity of clinical manifestations. In particular, the DSM-5 introduced specifiers, subtypes, severity ratings, and cross-cutting symptom assessments, allowing clinicians to better describe the specific clinical features of each patient. However, the use of DSM-5 specifiers for major depressive disorder in ordinary clinical practice is quite heterogeneous.

The present study, using a Delphi method, aims to evaluate the consensus of a representative group of expert psychiatrists on a series of statements regarding the clinical utility and relevance of DSM-5 specifiers for major depressive disorder in ordinary clinical practice. Experts reached an almost perfect agreement on statements related to the use and clinical utility of DSM-5 specifiers in ordinary clinical practice. In particular, a complete consensus was found regarding the clinical utility for ordinary clinical practice of using DSM-5 specifiers. The use of specifiers is considered a first step toward a "dimensional" approach to the diagnosis of mental disorders.

### The transition to ICD-10-CM: challenges for pediatric practice [^11366FEM]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnostic codes are used widely within health care for billing, quality assessment, and to measure clinical outcomes. The US health care system will transition to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), in October 2015. Little is known about how this transition will affect pediatric practices. The objective of this study was to examine how the transition to ICD-10-CM may result in ambiguity of clinical information and financial disruption for pediatricians.

- **Methods**: Using a statewide data set from Illinois Medicaid specified for pediatricians, 2708 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes were identified. Diagnosis codes were categorized into one of five categories: identity, class-to-subclass, subclass-to-class, convoluted, and no translation. The convoluted and high-cost diagnostic codes (n = 636) were analyzed for accuracy and categorized into "information loss", "overlapping categories", "inconsistent", and "consistent". Finally, reimbursement by Medicaid was calculated for each category.

- **Results**: Twenty-six percent of pediatric diagnosis codes are convoluted, which represents 21% of Illinois Medicaid pediatric patient encounters and 16% of reimbursement. The diagnosis codes represented by information loss (3.6%), overlapping categories (3.2%), and inconsistent (1.2%) represent 8% of Medicaid pediatric reimbursement.

- **Conclusions**: The potential for financial disruption and administrative errors from 8% of reimbursement diagnosis codes suggests significant challenges ahead for pediatric practices during the ICD-10-CM transition.

### Genome-wide association study of depression phenotypes in UK Biobank identifies variants in excitatory synaptic pathways [^116SSCDD]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

The ICD-coded MDD phenotype was derived from linked hospital admission records (UK Biobank fields: 41202 and 41204). Participants were classified as cases if they had either an ICD-9/10 primary or secondary diagnosis for a depressive unipolar mood disorder, including ICD codes: F32 for single episode depression, F33 for recurrent depression, F34 for persistent mood disorders, F38 for other mood disorders, and F39 for unspecified mood disorders. ICD-coded MDD controls were participants who had linked hospital records but did not have any diagnosis of a mood disorder and were not probable MDD cases. There were 8,276 cases and 209,308 controls (n total = 217,584, prevalence = 3.80%) for the ICD-coded MDD phenotype.

There were no individuals classed as a case for ICD-coded MDD who were classed as a control for either the broad depression or probable MDD phenotypes. No individuals classed as controls in ICD-coded MDD were classed as a case for probable MDD. However, there were 53,491 control individuals for ICD-coded MDD who were classed as a control for broad depression, reflecting the potentially looser definition stipulated under the broad depression phenotype. Of the 8,276 individuals classed as a case using the ICD-coded MDD definition, 7,471 (90.3%) also reported seeing either a GP or psychiatrist for nerves, anxiety, or depression (UK Biobank fields: 2090 and 2010), or experienced depression, being down, or suffered from anhedonia for a whole week (UK Biobank field: 4598).

### Development of a customised programme to standardise comorbidity diagnosis codes in a large-scale database [^1149aNAt]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

On 1 October 2015, the Department of Health and Human Services updated the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system by mandating the adoption of ICD-10 diagnosis codes in electronic medical records. Serving as the new standard for naming and categorizing patient diagnoses, the ICD-10 system contains over five times more codes than ICD-9, posing a challenge for analyzing longitudinal databases spanning both systems. Prior solutions have included the use of alternate coding systems, which are updated each time a new ICD system is released.

The literature is aimed at the accuracy and scope of these systems, how they update with new ICD releases, and how systems are similar or different. These studies fail to address how to implement such a system on a large-scale database, where manual reference and cell-by-cell translation is infeasible. We sought to develop a programme that quickly and accurately standardizes a dataset to one diagnostic coding system.

### Accuracy of ICD-10 codes for suicidal ideation and action in pediatric emergency department encounters [^115jv4jx]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). High credibility.

According to the ideation-to-action framework of suicidality, suicidal ideation and suicidal action arise via distinct trajectories. Studying suicidality under this framework requires accurate identification of both ideation and action. We sought to assess the accuracy of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes for suicidal ideation and action in emergency department encounters.

- **Methods**: Accuracy of ICD-10-CM coding for suicidality was assessed through chart review of clinical notes for 205 emergency department encounters among patients aged 6–18 years at a large academic pediatric hospital between June 1, 2016, and June 1, 2022. Physician notes were reviewed for documentation of past or present suicidal ideation, suicidal action, or both. The study cohort consisted of 103 randomly selected "cases", or encounters assigned at least one ICD-10-CM code for suicidality, and 102 propensity-matched "noncases" lacking ICD-10-CM codes. Accuracy of ICD-10-CM codes was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.

- **Results**: Against a gold standard chart review, the positive predictive value for ICD-10-CM suicidality codes was 86.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 84.5%-89.3%), and the negative predictive value was 76.2% (95% CI: 73.2%-79.2%). Nearly half of encounters involving suicidality were not captured by ICD-10-CM coding (sensitivity = 53.4%; 95% CI: 49.9%-56.9%). Sensitivity was higher for ideation-present (82.4%, 95% CI: 77.7%-87.1%) than for action-present (33.7%).

### A global field study of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) mood disorders clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines [^116E57ZS]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

We report results of an internet-based field study evaluating the diagnostic guidelines for ICD-11 mood disorders. Accuracy of clinicians' diagnostic judgments applying draft ICD-11, as compared to the ICD-10 guidelines, to standardized case vignettes was assessed as well as perceived clinical utility.

- **Methods**: 1357 clinician members of the World Health Organization's Global Clinical Practice Network completed the study in English, Spanish, Japanese, or Russian. Participants were randomly assigned to apply ICD-11 or ICD-10 guidelines to one of eleven pairs of case vignettes.

- **Results**: Clinicians using the ICD-11 and ICD-10 guidelines achieved similar levels of accuracy in diagnosing mood disorders depicted in vignettes. Those using the ICD-11 were more accurate in identifying depressive episodes in depressive disorder. There were no statistically significant differences detected across classifications in the accuracy of identifying dysthymic or cyclothymic disorder. Circumscribed problems with the proposed ICD-11 guidelines were identified, including difficulties differentiating bipolar type I from bipolar type II disorder and applying revised severity ratings to depressive episodes. Clinical utility of ICD-11 bipolar disorders was found to be significantly lower than for ICD-10 equivalent categories.

- **Limitations**: Standardized case vignettes were manipulated to evaluate specific changes. The degree of accuracy of clinicians' diagnostic judgments may not reflect clinical decision-making with patients.

Conclusions: Alignment of the ICD-11 with rese…

Major depression and other clinical diagnoses

NLP algorithms developed in CRIS include an application for ascertaining text describing assigned diagnoses, which have been commonly used in analyses to supplement diagnostic information recorded in structured fields within the electronic health record (Perera et al.). For this analysis, using this algorithm in combination with structured fields, we searched for individuals with a primary clinical diagnosis of depression according to the International Classification of Disorders-10 (ICD-10) [World Health Organisation] (codes F32-F33), with the index date of diagnosis. This led to the creation of a longitudinal cohort who were followed until 12 April 2015. Diagnoses fields were searched, and individuals with any of the following comorbid diagnoses at the same time point or occurring after the index depression diagnosis were excluded from the cohort: dementia, learning disabilities, eating disorders, severe mental illnesses (including schizophrenia-spectrum and bipolar disorders), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders.

We also used the secondary diagnoses fields to ascertain individuals with comorbid anxiety (ICD-10 codes F40-F48 'Neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders' including anxiety disorders). The presence of comorbid alcohol and substance use (ICD-10 codes F10-F19) at any point was noted and used to further inform analyses.

A validation check was conducted on diagnoses derived from NLP for this analysis, selecting a random subset of 100 records, which were assessed against a 'gold standard' of ICD-10 depression.

### The similarity of the structure of DSM-IV criteria for major depression in depressed women from China, the United States and Europe [^115ZzQbo]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A key question remains: to what extent are the symptomatic manifestations of the illness similar in China and Western countries? One way to address this question is to test the assumption that symptom profiles from these populations represent the same underlying latent construct. In a study conducted in 15 primary-care centers across 14 countries, including China and Japan, Simon et al. investigated the latent structure of the nine DSM-IV criteria for major depression (MD) in centers reporting low, medium, and high prevalence rates for MD. Notably, the Chinese and Japanese samples were both in the low-prevalence group. They applied a categorical factor analysis to the nine DSM-IV MD criteria and, when examining the first factor, noted that "the pattern of symptom loadings on this component was remarkably similar in all three groups" (Simon et al, p. 589).

Another method to examine the similarity of the MD construct is to investigate measurement invariance (MI). Within the common factor model, MI is a statistical test of the properties of items in a scale or criteria for a diagnosis. It indicates the degree to which these items measure the same underlying construct in different groups of subjects. For any two large-scale data collection projects, there are likely many factors that could contribute to the failure of MI holding for the DSM-IV criteria for MD. These factors include the specific wording of the diagnostic assessment instrument used, including effects of translation, interviewer qualifications and training, and ascertainment procedures (e.g. in-patient, out-patient).

### Highlights of the international consensus statement on major depressive disorder [^116Z6gJu]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The International Consensus Group on Depression gathered to outline a universal treatment algorithm for depression, aiming to merge the evidence base and standards of clinical practice from various countries, including the United States, Europe, the Middle East, China, and Japan. This brief summary includes the following recommendations made by the consensus group:

- **Periodically screen all patients for depression**: Use measurement-based tools and full psychiatric assessments to complete differential diagnoses.
- **Refer patients to psychiatric specialists when appropriate**: Establish a therapeutic alliance with patients and their families.
- **Begin treatment with an antidepressant for moderate or severe depression**: Treat patients to remission and continually monitor symptomatic improvement.

### Concordance between a simpler definition of major depressive disorder and diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition: An independent replication in an outpatient sample [^111x74fV]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) symptom criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) are somewhat lengthy, with several studies showing that clinicians have difficulty recalling all 9 symptoms. Moreover, the criteria include somatic symptoms that are difficult to apply in patients with medical illnesses. To address these problems, a simpler definition of MDD was developed that did not include the somatic symptoms. Previous reports found high levels of agreement between the simplified and full DSM-IV definitions of MDD. However, the same research group has conducted all previous studies of psychiatric patients. The goal of the present study was to determine if a high level of concordance between the two definitions would be replicated in an independent setting.

We interviewed 2,907 psychiatric outpatients presenting for treatment at the Boston University Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders. A trained diagnostic rater administered a semistructured interview and inquired about all symptoms of depression for all patients. A high level of agreement was found between the DSM-IV and the simpler definition of MDD. The absolute level of agreement between the two definitions was 95.5% and the κ coefficient was 0.88. Thus, consistent with previous studies, a high level of concordance was found between the simpler definition of MDD and the DSM-IV definition. This new definition offers two advantages over the DSM-IV definition: it is briefer, and it is easier to apply with medically ill patients because it is free of somatic symptoms.

### Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders in the ICD-11: An international perspective on key changes and controversies [^111STbmh]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The ICD-10 described hypomania and included bipolar II disorder under the heading of "other bipolar affective disorders". The ICD-11 harmonizes this with the DSM system, allowing a bipolar type II diagnosis with equal status to bipolar I disorder. In contrast to bipolar I disorder, where impulsive or reckless behavior is part of the description, hypomania in bipolar II is defined as not causing marked impairment in function. The controversy around the duration of hypomania is avoided by defining the duration as lasting for at least several days.

Similarly, cyclothymia, which stood in the ICD-10 under a separate grouping, is now incorporated in the core bipolar or related disorders heading. These changes substantially harmonize the ICD-11 and DSM-5 systems, one overarching goal of the revision. Cyclothymia includes a duration definition of at least 2 years and requires that numerous hypomanic or depressive symptoms be present the majority of the time. While the hypomanic symptomatology may or may not meet threshold criteria for hypomania (but not mania), depression cannot be severe or prolonged enough to meet the diagnostic requirement for a depressive episode. Curiously, the cyclothymia rubric includes cycloid and cyclothymic personality. This is a significant change echoing the old Research Diagnostic Criteria that set the grounds for the DSM-III and earlier literature on the effect of temperament, suggesting a bridge between the core bipolar and unipolar mood disorders and the effect of mood instability so commonly seen in borderline and other personality disorders.

### Psychiatric classifications: Validity and utility [^111vwGjK]. World Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Despite historical assumptions to the contrary, there is little evidence that the majority of recognized mental disorders are separated by natural boundaries. Diagnostic categories defined by their clinical syndromes should be regarded as 'valid' only if they have been shown to be truly discrete entities. Most diagnostic concepts in psychiatry have not been demonstrated to be valid in this sense, though many possess 'utility' by virtue of the information they convey about presenting symptoms, outcome, treatment response, and, in some instances, etiology. While researchers in genetics, neurobiology, and population epidemiology are increasingly more likely to adopt a continuum/dimensional view of the variation in symptomatology, clinicians prefer to hold on to the categorical approach embodied in classifications such as ICD-10 and DSM-5. Both points of view have plausible justification in their respective contexts, but the way forward may be in their conceptual reconciliation.

### Heterogeneity in 10-year course trajectories of moderate to severe major depressive disorder: A Danish national register-based study [^113MHx99]. JAMA Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence suggests that long-term trajectories of major depressive disorder (MDD) are heterogeneous. The Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register (DPCRR) provides a rare opportunity to examine patterns and correlates of long-term trajectories in a large sample of patients with moderate to severe MDD.

The objective of the study was to characterize patterns and correlates of 10-year course trajectories of MDD in the DPCRR. The design, setting, and participants included a cohort of 11,640 individuals born in Denmark in 1955 or later, with their first recorded MDD diagnosis in the DPCRR between 1995 and 2002. Patients were followed for 10 years from the date of their initial MDD diagnosis. Data were obtained from Danish civil and psychiatric national registers in June 2013 and were analyzed from April 4, 2014, to December 17, 2015. Correlates of trajectory class membership included sex; characteristics of the first recorded MDD episode, such as age, severity, inpatient treatment, and record of suicide attempt or self-harm; and psychiatric diagnoses in parents, such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, substance abuse, and anxiety or somatoform disorders.

The main outcomes and measures included the past-year contact at a psychiatric hospital with a main diagnosis of MDD during each of the 10 years following the initial MDD diagnosis. Trajectories were modeled using latent class growth analysis.

The results showed a sample of 11,640 individuals, with 7493 (64.4%) being women aged 18 to 48 years (mean [SD], 31.4 [7.3]) at their first recorded MDD diagnosis.
