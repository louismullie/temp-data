## Question

what is initial workup for suscicion for lupus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the initial workup for suspected systemic lupus erythematosus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical foundation and when to suspect SLE. Then, I should verify the core laboratory screening panel and how to interpret ANA. Next, I will examine organ-specific assessments, especially renal and neuropsychiatric, and when to biopsy. After that, I need to check for antiphospholipid syndrome and thrombotic microangiopathy. Finally, I will consider special populations, documentation and classification tools, and follow-up cadence, while continuously validating each step against guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical foundation, because SLE remains a clinical diagnosis supported by serology rather than defined by a single test. I need to ensure a thorough history and review of systems covering constitutional symptoms, mucocutaneous features, arthritis, serositis, renal, neuropsychiatric, hematologic, and cardiopulmonary manifestations, and I should document family history and medications, including photosensitizers and biologics, since these shape pretest probability and attribution of findings [^f3b4dcf7] [^213c876d] [^e4124cc6].

> Wait, let me verify the physical examination priorities. I should examine for malar or discoid rashes, oral ulcers, photosensitivity, alopecia, synovitis, serosal rubs, and signs of organ involvement such as edema, effusions, or neurologic deficits, because these findings materially increase the likelihood of SLE and guide targeted testing and urgency of referral [^f3b4dcf7] [^213c876d].

> Next, I should review the core laboratory screening panel. I need to check CBC with differential for cytopenias, a comprehensive metabolic panel including creatinine and eGFR, liver enzymes, urinalysis with microscopy and a spot protein-to-creatinine ratio, inflammatory markers such as ESR and CRP recognizing CRP can be blunted in SLE, and complements C3 and C4 to assess activity and support immune complex disease, while remembering that complements are dynamic and should be interpreted in clinical context [^7b3d3b93] [^3a7d528b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ANA. I should confirm that ANA is the appropriate screening test when clinical suspicion is meaningful, but I must interpret a positive result cautiously because ANA is sensitive but nonspecific, with about 95% sensitivity in SLE yet present in roughly 5% of healthy adults; thus, a positive ANA supports but does not establish SLE, whereas a negative ANA makes SLE substantially less likely and should prompt reconsideration of alternative diagnoses [^fbb1668b] [^659fc9da].

> I will now examine more specific autoantibodies. I should double-check for anti-dsDNA and anti-Smith, which are highly specific for SLE and carry prognostic implications, and I should consider anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, and anti-RNP when clinically indicated, while remembering that anti-Ro/La and anti-RNP are less specific and can be seen in other autoimmune diseases, so I must correlate with the phenotype and avoid overcalling SLE on these alone [^a933a197] [^b5845b68].

> Let me consider renal involvement carefully, because missing lupus nephritis has major consequences. I should confirm that any proteinuria above 0.5 g/g, hematuria with dysmorphic RBCs or casts, or unexplained eGFR decline warrants expedited evaluation and consideration of kidney biopsy, and I need to ensure anti-dsDNA and complements are trended since they track activity; importantly, histologic activity can be present even with modest proteinuria, so a low threshold for biopsy is justified in the right clinical context [^c3787941] [^846d236f] [^9a232c4f].

> But wait, what if neuropsychiatric symptoms are present. I should confirm that new-onset seizures, psychosis, delirium, or unexplained cognitive changes prompt neuroimaging, CSF analysis when indicated, and careful attribution to SLE after excluding infection, drugs, and metabolic causes; this is especially critical in hospitalized patients where delays are common and misattribution risks harm [^f7d54a55] [^11fda975].

> I need to ensure I screen for antiphospholipid syndrome in all patients with suspected or confirmed SLE, because this changes management toward anticoagulation if thrombotic. I should obtain lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgG/IgM, and anti-β2-glycoprotein I IgG/IgM, and if positive, repeat in 12 weeks to confirm persistence before labeling APS, while also assessing for obstetric APS history in women of childbearing potential [^5283c6f0] [^29fbb13b].

> Hold on, I should verify thrombotic microangiopathy considerations when there is hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and organ dysfunction. I need to check ADAMTS13 activity and antibodies urgently and initiate plasma exchange with glucocorticoids if ADAMTS13 is severely deficient, whereas if ADAMTS13 is normal with positive antiphospholipid antibodies, I should consider APS nephropathy and anticoagulation strategies, and if ADAMTS13 is normal with negative antiphospholipid antibodies, I should consider complement-mediated TMA and evaluate for eculizumab [^067baf18] [^ece4d025].

> Let me think about special populations. In children and adolescents, I should maintain a higher index of suspicion for severe disease including nephritis and neuropsychiatric involvement, and in early-onset disease, especially age 5 or younger, I should consider monogenic lupus or lupus mimics and discuss genetic testing when presentation is atypical, severe, or refractory to standard therapy [^93d8a42b] [^367ab2ed] [^15a1421c].

> I should double-check pregnancy-related planning. In women with SLE or suspected SLE who are pregnant or planning pregnancy, I need to measure anti-Ro/anti-La because of neonatal lupus risk and coordinate obstetric-rheumatology care, and I should also reassess antiphospholipid antibodies given their obstetric implications and the need for prophylactic anticoagulation in selected cases [^1b845f70] [^5283c6f0].

> Next, I should review documentation and classification tools. While diagnosis remains clinical, I can use the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria as an adjunct to structure the evaluation, recognizing that a score of 110 or more supports classification but is not itself diagnostic; I should also record disease activity using SLEDAI-2K or a physician global assessment and document baseline damage to enable longitudinal care and treat-to-target strategies [^552797ff] [^75663996] [^32fac1a8].

> I will now examine follow-up cadence and monitoring. In active disease, I should confirm that visits every 1 to 3 months with blood pressure, urinalysis, renal function, anti-dsDNA, complements, CBC, and LFTs are appropriate, whereas in stable low disease activity or remission, less frequent monitoring is reasonable; I also need to ensure annual assessment of disease damage and cardiovascular risk factors, and I should incorporate patient-reported outcomes to capture quality of life and symptoms that labs may miss [^2837fe03] [^c3c2afdd] [^75663996] [^62643e54].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to include anti-CCP routinely, but I should correct that. Anti-CCP is specific to rheumatoid arthritis and is not part of the initial SLE workup, so I should avoid ordering it unless I am evaluating for overlapping RA or differentiating inflammatory arthritis etiologies, keeping the focus on SLE-specific serologies and organ-directed tests instead [^notfound].

> Finally, I need to ensure timely referral and coordination. If multisystem involvement is present, if there is major organ threat such as nephritis or neuropsychiatric disease, or if the diagnosis remains uncertain after initial evaluation, I should refer to rheumatology promptly, and I should communicate clearly with primary care and other specialists to streamline care and reduce the well-documented delays that worsen outcomes in SLE [^722bb82e] [^a7b5804e].

The initial workup for suspected lupus should be **structured and organ-focused**, starting with a detailed history and exam to identify multisystem features, then ordering targeted labs: ANA with reflex anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, and ENA panel; CBC, metabolic panel, urinalysis with microscopy and protein-to-creatinine ratio, and complements C3/C4 [^7b3d3b93]. Add **antiphospholipid antibodies** (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, anti-β2-glycoprotein I) at baseline [^5283c6f0] [^29fbb13b], and screen for latent TB before immunosuppression [^7ebd8bbc]. Use the **EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria** to structure evaluation, but remember they are for classification, not diagnosis [^552797ff] [^ca8651cf]. If proteinuria is > 0.5 g/day or eGFR is unexplained, arrange a kidney biopsy [^c3787941] [^846d236f]; if neuropsychiatric symptoms are present, obtain brain MRI and CSF analysis [^f7d54a55]. Early, coordinated care and prompt rheumatology referral are essential to reduce diagnostic delay and organ damage [^722bb82e] [^a7b5804e].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A thorough **clinical history and physical examination** are essential to identify multisystem involvement and guide targeted testing [^f3b4dcf7] [^213c876d].

- **Constitutional symptoms**: Fever, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats.
- **Mucocutaneous manifestations**: Malar rash, discoid rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, alopecia.
- **Musculoskeletal symptoms**: Arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia.
- **Renal symptoms**: Hematuria, proteinuria, edema, hypertension.
- **Neuropsychiatric symptoms**: Seizures, psychosis, mood disorders, cognitive dysfunction.
- **Cardiopulmonary symptoms**: Chest pain, pleurisy, dyspnea, Raynaud's phenomenon.
- **Hematologic symptoms**: Easy bruising, bleeding, recurrent infections.

On **physical examination**, assess for malar or discoid rash, oral ulcers, synovitis, serosal rubs, edema, neurologic deficits, and signs of organ involvement [^f3b4dcf7].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

Laboratory testing is critical to confirm the diagnosis, assess disease activity, and identify organ involvement [^7b3d3b93].

| **Test category** | **Recommended tests** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Autoantibodies | - ANA (screening test) <br/> - Anti-dsDNA <br/> - Anti-Sm <br/> - Anti-Ro/SSA <br/> - Anti-La/SSB <br/> - Anti-RNP <br/> - Antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, anti-β2-glycoprotein I) | - ANA: sensitive but not specific <br/> - Anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm: specific for SLE <br/> - Antiphospholipid antibodies: assess thrombotic risk [^5283c6f0] [^29fbb13b] |
| Hematologic assessment | - CBC with differential <br/> - Reticulocyte count <br/> - Coombs test | Identify cytopenias, hemolytic anemia |
| Renal assessment | - Serum creatinine and eGFR <br/> - Urinalysis with microscopy <br/> - Urine protein-to-creatinine ratio or 24-hour urine protein | Detect renal involvement, proteinuria, hematuria, casts [^3a7d528b] |
| Hepatic assessment | - Liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT) <br/> - Bilirubin <br/> - Albumin | Assess hepatic involvement, drug-induced liver injury |
| Inflammatory markers | - ESR <br/> - CRP | Assess inflammation, monitor disease activity |
| Complement levels | - C3 <br/> - C4 | Low levels indicate active disease, immune complex formation [^a933a197] |
| Additional tests | - TSH <br/> - Lipid profile <br/> - Glucose <br/> - HbA1c | Assess comorbidities, cardiovascular risk [^5dccf570] |

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging studies are **not routinely indicated** but may be necessary based on clinical presentation [^2adb4cf3].

- **Chest X-ray**: Suspected pleural effusion, pneumonitis, or interstitial lung disease.
- **Echocardiography**: Suspected pericarditis, valvular disease, or pulmonary hypertension.
- **Brain MRI**: Neuropsychiatric symptoms, seizures, or cognitive dysfunction [^f7d54a55].
- **Joint ultrasound**: Suspected synovitis or arthritis.

---

## Specialized tests and biopsies

Specialized tests and biopsies are indicated for specific organ involvement. Kidney biopsy is indicated for **proteinuria > 0.5 g/day** or unexplained impaired renal function [^c3787941] [^846d236f], and skin biopsy is considered for **atypical or ambiguous rashes** to distinguish lupus from other dermatologic conditions [^05d7446b].

---

## Classification criteria

The **EULAR/ACR 2019 classification criteria** provide a structured approach to evaluate suspected SLE, incorporating clinical and immunologic features [^552797ff]. These criteria are intended for classification rather than diagnosis but can guide clinical evaluation [^ca8651cf].

---

## Initial management and follow-up

Initial management focuses on confirming the diagnosis, assessing disease activity, and initiating appropriate therapy. Hydroxychloroquine is **recommended for all patients** unless contraindicated [^3c1e36b6] [^01f68064]. Glucocorticoids are used for initial control of inflammation and during flares, with tapering as soon as possible [^3c1e36b6]. Immunosuppressive agents are introduced early for ongoing disease activity to achieve remission or low disease activity [^3c1e36b6]. Regular monitoring of disease activity, organ damage, and comorbidities is essential [^75663996] [^32fac1a8].

---

## Conclusion

The initial workup for suspected lupus should be **comprehensive and organ-focused**, integrating clinical evaluation, laboratory testing, and selective imaging or biopsies. Early diagnosis and coordinated care are critical to prevent organ damage and improve outcomes [^722bb82e].

### Diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus: has the time come? [^d8f33cd6]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multiorgan disease with protean manifestations. Because SLE is uncommon and heterogeneous, its diagnosis can pose a considerable challenge, especially for clinicians with limited expertise of the disease. This is particularly true at the early stages of SLE, when an inadequate number of features to secure the diagnosis might be present, and for patients presenting with uncommon features, which can nonetheless be severe and require prompt treatment. Furthermore, the suboptimal performance of immunological testing in patients referred for possible SLE has been highlighted. As a result, SLE remains largely a clinical diagnosis that is made after excluding alternative diagnoses. Diagnostic criteria can expedite diagnosis and treatment, but are not available for SLE. Thus, SLE classification criteria are often used, but strict adherence to these criteria could delay diagnosis. Therefore, while eagerly awaiting diagnostic criteria for this disease, we propose interim potential solutions to facilitate its diagnosis.

Introduction

SLE is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease with multiple and heterogeneous clinical phenotypes and variations in disease severity and damage accrual across the whole spectrum of patients with SLE. Earlier diagnosis and treatment advances have resulted in improved outcomes over the past decades. However, increased morbidity and mortality persists in SLE, indicating that several unmet needs impact the optimal management of the disease. Among the most significant are the excessive diagnosis delay and the common lack of coordinated care for SLE. A patient pathway (PP) is the patient experience from the first symptom through the initial referral for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, and includes diverse aspects of disease management, such as holistic support and prevention of complications. According to the European Pathway Association, a care pathway is a complex intervention for mutual decision making and organisation of care processes for a well-defined group of patients during a well-defined period. The general concept behind that of PP is that the healthcare systems should ensure faster diagnosis and, for patients diagnosed with SLE, result in a rapid initiation of treatment through streamlined, standardised strategies. Clinical studies have long proven that patient-centred PPs reduce variability in clinical practice, improve outcomes and reduce the overall cost of disease management. In the context of SLE, early diagnosis is both a priority and a challenge, as prolonged diagnostic delay may lead to worse outcomes, including damage accrualand socioprofessional disinsertion. The paradigm of primary healthcare, under which general practitioners (GPs) are involved in the initial diagnosis and therapeutic management of symptoms, is largely challenged by the rare and highly polymorphic nature of the disease. Also, virtually all patients with SLE have significant levels of ANA, but this essential laboratory test is not specific to the diagnosis, yielding a high number of inappropriate referral to secondary-care or tertiary-care specialists. Several attempts to optimise the care of patients with SLE have resulted in the implementation of several national and international guidelines, but individual trajectories of autoimmune patients within healthcare systems remain largely suboptimal. Both diagnosed and undiagnosed patients with SLE typically present complex problems, often requiring multiple interventions provided concurrently from several partners in their care. This emphasises the need for an integrated and holistic approach to SLE diagnosis and treatment.

The aim of the present study was to analyse PPs in SLE in order to overcome organisational challenges in the management of suspected and confirmed SLE cases.

### Presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus in emergency department [^b6ef1028]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem inflammatory disease that is often difficult to diagnose in the emergency department. It is an autoimmune disease with great variability in presentation and course. Moreover, the atypical or incomplete presentation is common in children and can result in delay in diagnosis. Consideration of the possibility of SLE is important when evaluating a patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting multisystem disease. The emergency physician must maintain a high degree of suspicion for the early diagnosis and management of this important condition. We present 3 children who presented to emergency department with different initial manifestations of SLE.

Systemic lupus erythematosus general treatment strategies — good practice statements emphasize that people with active SLE symptoms should be diagnosed and treated promptly, with severity of lupus activity guiding intensity and choice of therapy, and that when multiple organ systems are involved at onset or during a flare of SLE, therapy should be directed toward all manifestations but should prioritize areas at greatest risk for irreversible damage. They further note that organ- or life-threatening SLE should be treated urgently/emergently with aggressive therapy (e.g., pulse/high-dose glucocorticoid and immunosuppressive therapy), including consideration of combination therapies, as time may not permit sequential therapy; the clinical situation and patient's preference should guide the specific combination therapy, that when interventions, procedures, and surgeries beyond the scope of rheumatology practice are considered, the decision to proceed requires multidisciplinary discussion between the rheumatologist and the relevant specialists/proceduralists/surgeons, and that when clinical or serologic findings suggest an additional diagnosis or overlap with SLE, therapy should be adjusted if necessary in consultation with the relevant specialist(s).

### Systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosis and management [^529cfba5]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

SLE presents many challenges for clinicians. The onset of disease may be insidious, with many different symptoms and signs, making early and accurate diagnosis challenging. Tests for SLE in the early stages lack specificity; those that are useful later often appear only after organ damage is manifest. Disease patterns are highly variable; flares are not predictable and not always associated with biomarkers. Children with SLE may have severe disease and present special management issues. Older SLE patients have complicating co-morbid conditions. Therapeutic interventions have improved over recent decades, but available drugs do not adequately control disease in many patients, and successful outcomes are limited by off-target effects; some of these become manifest with longer duration of treatment, now in part revealed by improved rates of survival. Despite all of these challenges, advances in understanding the biological basis of SLE have translated into more effective approaches to patient care. This review considers the current state of SLE diagnosis and management, with a focus on new approaches and anticipated advances.

### Lupus spectrum ambiguity has long-term negative implications for patients [^7ab796d2]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Lupus is a complex, heterogeneous disease for which no diagnostic criteria exist. As a result, patients may see multiple providers and spend months or years seeking an accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic delays and errors have vast consequences for patients with lupus. Moving to a spectrum definition of lupus might address some of these challenges. By drawing on insights from experienced rheumatologists and other practitioners who specialise in lupus care, implementing a spectrum definition may help bridge knowledge gaps related to diagnoses, reduce time to diagnosis and lessen the overall burden on the patient.

### Unusual presentations of systemic lupus erythematosus: a narrative review [^4f0f0dfc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by an almost 10:1 female predominance, the presence of deleterious nuclear autoantibodies, a tendency for flare, and striking protean manifestations. Early diagnosis is associated with less damage accrual, lower costs, and improved quality of life due to timely treatment. However, early disease may not uncommonly show nonspecific presentation, a single classification criterion, or an unusual organ involvement contributing to frequent, often substantial diagnostic delays. We reviewed the literature (1982–2022) to accumulate and classify all reports of rare, atypical, and unusual presentations. These can involve almost every organ and system, and thus, present to physicians in every discipline and setting. Increasing physicians' awareness of the potential of occult SLE to appear in varied, diverse, and unexpected presentations, may encourage the inclusion of SLE in the differential. Informed history and examination focusing on systemic and joint symptoms and mucocutaneous involvement, and basic tests (focusing on leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and proteinuria; followed by antinuclear antibodies and complement levels) will correctly diagnose most patients on presentation or within the following months and enable timely treatment.

### Characteristics and genetic analysis of patients suspected with early-onset systemic lupus erythematosus [^15a1421c]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

During the past decades, treatment for SLE has moved from corticosteroids alone to a combination of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, immunosuppressants and biologics. A treat-to-target strategy was recently proposed for lupus, leading to individualized, patient-tailored regimens with multitargeted therapies. With rapid expansion of treatment options, early identification of patients with lupus mimics and those with causative mutations from sporadic lupus is necessary for precise and tailored treatment. Recently, it is proposed that genetic testing are recommended for those with disease onset at a young age; severe, life-threatening or organ-threatening presentation; aggressive disease course, rapid deterioration and/or accumulation of organ damage; and poor response to standard treatment. Due to the rarity of early-onset SLE, we are unable to enroll large enough case number in the study to reflect the clinical significance of individualized treatment. International and multi-central collaboration is needed to better address the issue. In the coming era of precision medicine, patients with SLE will likely be stratified by their immunophenotypes or their genetics as technology advances. Revealing the molecular genetic diagnosis of SLE, especially among those early-onset cases, can promote personalized medical care with targeted therapies and monitoring.

Diagnostic delays

Diagnosing lupus is considerably challenging, particularly early in the disease process where patients present with inadequate or non-specific sequelae. Moreover, pathognomonic diagnostic tools are lacking the molecular prowess necessary to support diagnosticians in clinical decision-making. We recognise that when patients present clinically without cardinal features of lupus (ie, ANA positivity, photosensitivity, etc), incomplete SLE or probable lupus, making a clear diagnosis might prove challenging, even for the more skilled and experienced specialist. Still, consequences of diagnostic delays, especially in patients with major organ involvement, are vast and include higher disease activity, higher rates of damage accrual, fatigue and a lower quality of life over the long term. An in-depth understanding of causes for delays in diagnosis may drive the development of solutions that promote earlier diagnosis, intervention and better long-term outcomes.

Limited exposure and experience among primary care physicians

Primary care physicians (PCPs) and emergency room doctors are the gatekeepers to specialty care and often the first providers to encounter a patient with lupus. However, non-specialists often have difficulty interpreting non-specific symptoms and signs of potential lupus that should, but often do not, result in referral to dermatologists, nephrologists or other physicians specialising in rheumatological care.LFA global patient survey data demonstrated that only 20% of respondents who initially reported their symptoms to a PCP recall any mention of lupus from the doctor at the first visit. Respondents reported that a probable lupus diagnosis was mentioned among rheumatologists and dermatologists at a higher rate (58% and 49%, respectively) compared with a PCP. These findings support observations in a community-based survey showing that rheumatologists are four times as likely to accurately diagnose lupus compared with primary care providers. Short of conducting exhaustive lupus education for PCPs, there may be opportunities to develop an acronym or other resource outlining subtle features of lupus to help the public and non-specialists identify 'red flag' symptoms that indicate possible or incomplete lupus. Marketing and advocacy campaigns that raise awareness about 'red flag' lupus symptoms would be instrumental in improving quality of care. The development of risk prediction models that identify people at risk of lupus may also be useful for reducing delays in diagnosis and treatment.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: primary care approach to diagnosis and management [^41272b48]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that affects many systems, including the skin, musculoskeletal, renal, neuropsychiatric, hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and reproductive systems. Family physicians should be familiar with the manifestations of lupus to aid in early diagnosis, monitoring patients with mild disease, recognizing warning signs that require referral to a rheumatologist, and helping to monitor disease activity and treatment in patients with moderate to severe disease. The American College of Rheumatology has 11 classification criteria for lupus. If a patient meets at least four criteria, lupus can be diagnosed with 95% specificity and 85% sensitivity. All patients with lupus should receive education, counseling, and support. Hydroxychloroquine is the cornerstone of treatment because it reduces disease flares and other constitutional symptoms. Low-dose glucocorticoids can be used to treat most manifestations of lupus. The use of immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents depends on the body systems affected. Patients with mild disease that does not involve major organ systems can be monitored by their family physician. Patients with increased disease activity, complications, or adverse effects from treatment should be referred to a rheumatologist. To optimize treatment, it is important that a rheumatologist coordinate closely with the patient's family physician to improve chronic care as well as preventive health services.

### Incomplete systemic lupus erythematosus: what remains after application of American College of Rheumatology and systemic lupus international collaborating clinics criteria? [^26435641]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Incomplete systemic lupus (iSLE) is an acknowledged condition of patients with clinical signs of lupus who do not fulfill classification criteria for SLE. Some patients with iSLE have persistent mild disease, but others have serious organ involvement, and up to 55% progress to established SLE. Research on this subject could reveal predictive or diagnostic biomarkers for SLE. Ideally, it would become possible to discern those patients with critical organ involvement or a high risk for progression to SLE. This high-risk group might benefit from early treatment, which would preferably be confirmed in randomized controlled trials. This process would, however, require agreement on a definition of iSLE. The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) classification criteria was composed in order to diagnose SLE earlier. The present review outlines the clinical characteristics of iSLE after introduction of SLICC criteria and furthermore proposes a definition of iSLE with the aim of discriminating the high-risk group from those with a lower risk.

### Characteristics and genetic analysis of patients suspected with early-onset systemic lupus erythematosus [^367ab2ed]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with heterogenous clinical manifestations. Characterized by immune dysregulation and production of autoantibodies against self-antigens, the disease can affect nearly any tissue or organ systems. To date, no diagnostic criteria for SLE is available. To facilitate the suspicion of lupus and to compare between other autoimmune disorders, SLE classification criteria were established since 1972 and subsequently revised in 1982, 1997, 2012 and 2019 for refinement. As the diagnosis of SLE mostly depend on clinical and serological clues, diagnosis of lupus can be challenging, especially among those with atypical manifestations and extreme phenotypes.

Women of childbearing age are typically predisposed to developing SLE. Disease development before the age of 5 is relatively uncommon. According to a nationwide study in Taiwan, the prevalence of SLE under the age of 5 was lower than 5/100,000. As genetic, hormonal and environmental factors are all known to contribute to disease development, through a large-scale multiracial SLE cohort study, Webb et al. found that the onset of lupus during childhood is predicted by a higher genetic risk and is associated with a more severe phenotype. Moreover, considering the early-onset nature of "monogenic lupus" and some "SLE mimickers", special attention and additional workup may be needed to assist the diagnosis of lupus in children before school age. For decades, whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing have assisted in the identification of lupus-mimickers and rare monogenic variants associated with SLE with high penetrance. Recognition of causative mutations in patients with early-onset lupus or lupus-mimics may provide crucial insights into the pathogenesis and improve personalized treatment.

To explore the clinical manifestations and causative mutations in patients suspected with early-onset SLE (age ≦ 5 years old) and lupus mimics in Taiwan, WES was performed with special attention on genes potentially responsible for lupus. Patient's clinical features and treatment responses were also carefully reviewed.

### Diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus [^d63ec048]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem inflammatory disease that is often difficult to diagnose. Before the diagnosis can be established, four of 11 clinical and laboratory criteria must be met. Antinuclear antibody titer is the primary laboratory test used to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus. Because of the low prevalence of the disease in primary care populations, the antinuclear antibody titer has a low predictive value in patients without typical clinical symptoms. Therefore, as specified by the American College of Rheumatology, this titer should be obtained only in patients with unexplained involvement of two or more organ systems. Patients with an antinuclear antibody titer of 1:40 and characteristic multiorgan system involvement can be diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus without additional testing; however, patients with an antibody titer of 1:40 who fail to meet full clinical criteria should undergo additional testing, including tests for antibody to double-stranded DNA antigen and antibody to Sm nuclear antigen. While an antinuclear antibody titer of less than 1:40 usually rules out systemic lupus erythematosus, patients with persistent, characteristic multisystem involvement may be evaluated for possible antinuclear antibody-negative disease.

### Antinuclear antibody testing for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus [^659fc9da]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune inflammatory condition that may involve multiple organ systems. Although the antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is positive in nearly every case of SLE, it is not specific for this disease and must be interpreted in the appropriate clinical context. Key features that warrant ANA testing include unexplained multisystem inflammatory disease, symmetric joint pain with inflammatory features, photosensitive rash, and cytopenias. ANA staining patterns and more specific autoantibody testing may be helpful in diagnosis of suspected SLE or ANA-associated disease. For patients with nonspecific symptoms, such as malaise and fatigue, ANA testing is of limited value.

### Algorithmic approach with clinical pathology consultation improves access to specialty care for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^222d9322]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Harris Health System (HHS) is a safety net system providing health care to the underserved of Harris County, Texas. There was a 6-month waiting period for a rheumatologist consult for patients with suspected systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The objective of the intervention was to improve access to specialty care.

Methods

An algorithmic approach to testing for SLE was implemented initially through the HHS referral center. The algorithm was further offered as a "one-click" order for physicians, with automated reflex testing, interpretation, and case triaging by clinical pathology.

Results

Data review revealed that prior to the intervention, 80% of patients did not have complete laboratory workups available at the first rheumatology visit. Implementation of algorithmic testing and triaging of referrals by pathologists resulted in decreasing the waiting time for a rheumatologist by 50%.

Conclusions

Clinical pathology intervention and case triaging can improve access to care in a county health care system.

Overview of the journey to diagnosis of patients with lupus

Lupus is a complex disease with interpersonal and intrapersonal symptom variability across a patient's lifespan. In addition, clinical presentation with non-specific signs and symptoms that mimic other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or undifferentiated connective tissue disease complicates the diagnostic journey for many patients. This, in turn, can lead to a delay in access to healthcare providers well versed in lupus and subsequent access to appropriate lupus treatments. At present, there are no clear, validated diagnostic criteria for lupus, and SLE classification criteria are often used as a reference to determine if a patient is indeed presenting with SLE. In this meeting report, we outline the patient perspective on barriers to diagnosis, how they impact patients, and provide recommendations for reducing time to diagnosis by recognising and defining lupus as a spectrum disorder.

Reports from a global patient-reported survey found that 27%–37% of people with lupus were diagnosed within 1 year from the onset of their symptoms, while an average one-third of patients were diagnosed after 5 years, with the median reported delay being 2 years. Even more striking are results from a study of 2527 patients with lupus in the UK that showed an average delay in diagnosis of over 6 years, and that 47% of respondents were originally misdiagnosed.

Introduction

SARDs are a heterogeneous group of conditions with autoimmune dysregulation, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory myositis, that cause characteristic systemic and musculoskeletal manifestations. The prevalence of SARDs has been growing over the last several decades and is a significant burden on patients, their families, and healthcare systems –. Pathogenesis of SARDs is driven by a complex combination of environmental factors and genetic predisposition, resulting in heterogeneous clinical presentations and overlapping syndromes –. A lack of healthcare providers specializing in SARDs contributes to missed or delayed diagnoses in patients. Consequently, undiagnosed patients endure long and difficult diagnostic journeys, sometimes taking years if not decades to receive a diagnosis –. During this time, many are misdiagnosed with symptoms commonly attributed to anxiety, mental illness, stress, or lifestyle factors. Misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis of SARDs lead to poorer clinical outcomes and greater mortality.

In some individuals with SARDs, autoantibodies generated by plasma cells are key to pathogenesis and detectable for diagnostic purposes. These autoantibodies can target self-antigens, mark cells for immune-mediated destruction, impede cellular function, and incite inflammatory responses that cause tissue injury. In individuals with suspected SARDs, serum autoantibody testing can help support a diagnosis. For example, anti-citrullinated peptides (anti-CCP) and rheumatoid factor (RF) antibodies are useful in predicting and diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis. When performed by primary care providers, autoantibody testing can serve as an important first step in the diagnostic workup that triggers a referral to rheumatology for a thorough SARD evaluation. These steps are critical for a timely diagnosis of SARDs and to initiate morbidity- and mortality-reducing treatment; thus, support for timely diagnosis remains a major unmet need. A systematic data-driven approachto identify individuals with high suspicion for SARDs who would benefit from autoantibody testing and rheumatology consultation could improve the diagnosis and care of patients.

The management of a patient with SLE presents the OMS with a challenging array of decisions to make in regards to treatment sequencing. Careful reviews of the patient's medical history, the presentation of the illness, and the medication profile, and an open discourse with medical colleagues are necessary to ensure the safety of patients. By becoming comfortable with the medical treatment the patient is undergoing as well as having a firm understanding of where the patient is along the cascade of disease severity (see Fig. 7), appropriate decisions can be made in regards to the patient's outcome and prognosis. Proceeding into surgical treatment without following these guidelines could potentially result in catastrophic consequences for the patient.

### Lupus spectrum ambiguity has long-term negative implications for patients [^b8f55d2d]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Lupus is a complex disease that is often difficult to diagnose. Risks of diagnostic delays include non-specific signs and symptoms that mimic other diseases and a lack of diagnostic criteria and referral pathways for non-specialists. To address these issues, we convened a series of virtual meetings with members of our Addressing Lupus Pillars for Health Advancement clinical care team. Meeting participants included lupus physicians, treatment developers from biotechnology, patient advocacy group representatives from the Lupus Foundation of America and advocacy/government consultants. Causes and consequences of ambiguity in diagnosis and diagnostic delays were evaluated through historical, experiential and evidence-based accounts (survey data, literature reviews and patient testimonials). Discussions highlighted the need for a clearer understanding of the definition of lupus, the natural history of the disease and the need for advancements in biotechnology to support an accurate and timely diagnosis with the potential development of a lupus spectrum.

Requirement of consensus definition for iSLE

Currently, researchers use various definitions for iSLE, which hinders comparability between different studies. Ideally, a classification system would include patients who are at the highest risk of developing SLE or serious organ damage and exclude those who have prolonged mild symptoms or develop other autoimmune diseases. Prospective documentation of a consistent group of patients with iSLE is required in order to better define the high‐risk group and to determine predictive biomarkers. We therefore ask for the development of a consensus on the definition of iSLE in order to, ideally, combine forces and start prospective documentation of patients with iSLE.

Definition of iSLE involves a very heterogeneous group of patients and should include patients at the highest risk of developing SLE. Mucocutaneous symptoms, serositis, renal symptoms, anticardiolipin antibodies, low complement, and anti‐dsDNA are all associated with progression to SLE. Table 3 shows our proposed definition of iSLE, which aims at including patients with a high risk of developing SLE or serious organ involvement. ANA positivity at a titer ≥ 1:80 should be present in order to be classified as iSLE, as this is a key feature of SLE. A recent systematic review and metaregression 22 on the diagnostic value of ANAs reported 97.8% sensitivity and 74.7% specificity for ANA at a titer ≥ 1:80. Also, in an observational study 23 on 616 patients who were referred due to possible SLE, 99.5% of patients with early SLE were ANA positive. The ACR/EULAR international collaboration on development of new classification criteria for SLE has also reached consensus on using positive ANA at a titer ≥ 1:80 as entry criterion 5.

### Finding lupus in the ANA haystack [^5f9ea26d]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Establishing a diagnosis of SLE is currently based on clinical acumen, laboratory testing and adaptive use of criteria that were designed to classify participants for clinical research. A young woman presenting with a photosensitive malar rash, non-erosive arthritis and typical autoantibodies would not stump an experienced rheumatologist or dermatologist. Complicated diagnostic algorithms in such a scenario are unnecessary. However, the problem of lupus diagnosis extends far beyond this type of presentation on both sides of the equation, the patient and the provider. On the patient side, early detection of SLE remains a challenge. Recent analyses suggest that many patients with SLE present with non-specific symptoms such as fever, myalgia, fatigue or arthritis, rather than more typical lupus findings such as malar rash. On the provider side of the equation, such patients are most likely to present to primary care physicians or advanced practice providers who are unlikely to be thinking of a rare disease like SLE, and who may not see a need for rheumatological consultation. Delay in getting such a patient to a rheumatologist or lupus specialist is further complicated by the poor performance of the ANA which is the major screening diagnostic. The ANA is extremely sensitive for lupus, but has a high prevalence in the normal populationmaking it too non-specific to be very useful as a screening test. When an ANA-positive patient is referred to a busy rheumatology practice, there is no sense of urgency if other lupus-suggestive symptoms or laboratory tests are not present. In some rheumatology practices, more than 10%–15% of incoming requests for consultation are for evaluation of ANA positivity, so this is not a small problem. Some of these ANA-positive individuals are in an early stage of an evolving lupus syndrome, but identification of those who are at risk is not readily accomplished with available laboratory tests. Therefore, during what can be a long wait time to evaluation, it is likely that some of these ANA-positive patients will have evolution of disease with development of damage at the time of presentation to the lupus specialist. Even nephropathy has been seen in a significant proportion of early lupus cohorts.

### 2019 European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus [^552797ff]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "EULAR/ACR classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus" for systemic lupus erythematosus and cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

The EULAR/ACR (European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology) classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of SLE. The target patient population includes individuals with suspected SLE, a complex autoimmune disease with a wide range of clinical manifestations.

The primary components of the EULAR/ACR classification criteria for SLE include a variety of clinical and laboratory features. The presence of anti-nuclear antibodies at a titer of ≥ 1:80 on HEp-2 cells or an equivalent positive test is an entry criterion. Constitutional symptoms, hematologic features, neuropsychiatric presentations, mucocutaneous involvement, serosal involvement, musculoskeletal involvement, renal involvement, presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, complement proteins, and SLE-specific antibodies are all considered in the scoring system. Each of these components is assigned a specific value, and the cumulative score is used to determine the likelihood of SLE.

The diagnostic criteria for SLE are met if the cumulative score is ≥ 110. If the score is < 110, the diagnostic criteria for SLE are not met. The EULAR/ACR classification criteria for SLE provides a structured approach to the diagnosis of SLE, incorporating a broad range of clinical and laboratory features that reflect the multisystem nature of the disease.

The EULAR/ACR classification criteria calculator is designed to evaluate the likelihood of diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) by assigning scores based on a variety of clinical and laboratory findings. It begins with requiring positive anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) at a titer of ≥ 1:80, which contributes 100 points to the score, serving as a crucial entry criterion. Absence of this test awards no points.

The following features each add specific point values to the overall score:

- **Constitutional Symptoms**:
- **Fever**: 2 points

- **Hematologic Features**:
- **Leukopenia**: 3 points
- **Thrombocytopenia**: 4 points
- **Autoimmune hemolysis**: 4 points

- **Neuropsychiatric Presentations**:
- **Delirium**: 2 points
- **Psychosis**: 3 points
- **Seizure**: 5 points

- **Mucocutaneous Involvement**:
- **Non-scarring alopecia**: 2 points
- **Oral ulcers**: 2 points
- **Subacute cutaneous or discoid lupus**: 4 points
- **Acute cutaneous lupus**: 6 points

- **Serosal Involvement**:
- **Pleural or pericardial effusion**: 5 points
- **Acute pericarditis**: 6 points

- **Musculoskeletal Involvement**:
- **Joint involvement**: 6 points

- **Renal Involvement**:
- Proteinuria > 0.5 g/24 hours: 4 points
- **Renal biopsy Class II-V lupus nephritis**: 8 points
- **Renal biopsy Class III-IV lupus nephritis**: 10 points

- **Antiphospholipid Antibodies**:
- **Present**: 2 points
- **Absent**: 0 points

- **Complement Proteins**:
- **Low C3 or C4**: 3 points
- **Low C3 and C4**: 4 points

- **SLE-Specific Antibodies**:
- **Present**: 6 points
- **Absent**: 0 points

The total score is the accumulation of points from these selected features. A score of 110 or above indicates the diagnostic criteria for SLE are met, while a score below 110 suggests they are not met.

Conclusion

Skin biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that can add valuable data to help with accurate diagnosis in some patients with SLE who develop rashes. An important next step for individual clinicians is to determine what specific clinical scenarios would warrant a biopsy; we suggest biopsies for cases in which the clinical appearance of a rash is ambiguous. It is worth performing a biopsy of clinically ambiguous rashes in patients with SLE as a significant percentage may show discordant results between clinical and histopathological diagnosis, which may impact subsequent treatment choices. This data further support the importance of the involvement of dermatologists in the care of patients with SLE with cutaneous abnormalities.

Overview of ACR 1997 criteria and SLICC 2012 classification criteria for SLE a

Some patients with lupus symptoms still do not fulfill any of the current classification criteria for SLE. For example, some patients could have cutaneous lupus and detectable autoantibodies but lack other features. Some patients have gradual disease onset and over time develop serious organ involvement, while others continue to have milder manifestations of the disease. Several terms have been used to qualify this heterogeneous group. The term "undifferentiated connective tissue disease" (UCTD) is used if autoimmunity features do not resemble 1 specific autoimmune disease. However, when patients have typical features of SLE without fulfilling the classification criteria, the terms "latent lupus", "early lupus", "potential lupus", "incomplete lupus", and "incomplete SLE" have all been used 6. The terms "latent lupus" and "early lupus" suggest that there will be progression to SLE, while this is not necessarily the case. "Potential lupus" could be an accurate term in reference to some patients, but for patients with a clear form of lupus (for example, cutaneous lupus), this label would not be appropriate, as they would already have lupus of the skin. We decided to use the term "incomplete SLE" (iSLE), as this can include both stable mild disease as well as more severe disease that is still not classifiable as SLE.

Investigating iSLE is of significant relevance, as it could reveal immunologic changes that occur when the disease progresses to SLE. Furthermore, longitudinal follow‐up of these patients potentially reveals predictive biomarkers that enable stratification of the risk for progression to established SLE. This investigation of iSLE would improve patient care by allowing high‐risk patients to be followed up more intensively and to possibly start treatment earlier; low‐risk patients could be exempted from intensive follow‐up and be reassured about disease progression. Additionally, patients with iSLE might benefit from inclusion in clinical trials. However, because patients with iSLE are probably an even more heterogeneous group than those with SLE, a consensus definition is of great importance for future research.

In the present review, the characteristics of iSLE before and after introduction of SLICC criteria are outlined. Moreover, clinical and serologic risk factors are described in order to ultimately better define this patient group, especially those patients at high risk of progression to SLE or severe organ involvement.

### First diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in hospitalized patients: clinical phenotypes and pitfalls for the non-specialist [^11fda975]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Prompt recognition of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in hospitalized patients presenting with severe disease is essential to initiate treatment. We sought to characterize the phenotype of hospitalized patients with new-onset SLE and estimate potential diagnostic delays.

Methods

An observational study of 855 patients ("Attikon" SLE cohort). Clinical phenotype was categorized according to the leading manifestation that led to hospitalization. Disease features, time to diagnosis, classification criteria, and the SLE Risk Probability Index (SLERPI) were recorded for each patient.

Results

There were 191 patients (22.3% of the total cohort) hospitalized due to manifestations eventually attributed to SLE. Main causes of admission were neuropsychiatric syndromes (21.4%), cytopenias (17.8%), nephritis (17.2%), and thrombotic events (16.2%). Although 79.5% of patients were diagnosed within 3 months from hospitalization, in 39 patients diagnosis was delayed, particularly in those with hematological manifestations. At hospitalization, a SLERPI > 7 (indicating high probability for SLE) was found in 87.4% of patients. Patients missed by the SLERPI had fever, thrombotic or neuropsychiatric manifestations not included in the algorithm. Lowering the SLERPI threshold to 5 in patients with fever or thrombotic events increased the diagnostic rate from 88.8% to 97.9% in this subgroup, while inclusion of all neuropsychiatric events yielded no additional diagnostic value.

Conclusion

One in five patients with new-onset SLE manifest disease presentations required hospitalization. Although early diagnosis was achieved in the majority of cases, in approximately 20%, diagnosis was delayed. A lower SLERPI cut-off (≥ 5) in patients with fever or thrombosis could enhance early diagnosis.

### Transition to severe phenotype in systemic lupus erythematosus initially presenting with non-severe disease: implications for the management of early disease [^9236f4bd]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease with protean clinical manifestations and an unpredictable course. Although prognosis has significantly improved over the years due to earlier diagnosis and more effective treatments, patients with SLE still demonstrate increased mortality and morbidity compared with the general population. Patients' phenotype at disease onset may vary from mild to severe or life-threatening, with striking differences among patients from different racial backgrounds. Lupus nephritis (LN) is more common in Hispanics and African–Americans, the latter also exhibiting an up to twofold increased risk of neuropsychiatric involvement, compared with Caucasians.

Several cohort studies around the world have documented the natural history and morbidity of the disease, contributing substantially to increased awareness. More recently, emphasis has been put on the patterns of disease activity and targets of therapy, with remission and low disease activity emerging as new frontiers. Moreover, management recommendations have attempted to decrease the heterogeneity in lupus care, by providing evidence-based and expert opinion-based guidance. However, among patients who present with a certain phenotype, there is a paucity of data regarding potential changes of severity over time, that is, whether the disease will remain mild throughout its course or progress to a more severe form. Such data may have clinical and therapeutic implications for early disease.

The aim of this study was to describe the severity patterns of a Caucasian SLE cohort in a tertiary SLE referral centre, based at 'Attikon' University Hospital, Athens, Greece. We explored possible baseline prognostic factors related to a 'transition in severity' as well as cumulative damage accrual over the course of the disease. Our data suggest that, despite significant advances in therapy, transition of disease occurs in a considerable proportion of patients.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus classification and diagnosis [^ca8651cf]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Since the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology 2019 classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were published, they were externally validated by groups worldwide. In particular, the new criteria worked well also in East Asian and pediatric cohorts. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) as an entry criterion were critically discussed, but the group of ANA-negative patients is small (< 5%) worldwide. Specificity of the criteria is dependent on correct attribution only of those criteria that are not better explained by other causes. Although the classification criteria should not be used for diagnosis, many novel aspects inform diagnostic considerations.

Under "Is there evidence of abnormal proteinuria or urine sediment", abnormal proteinuria is defined by dipstick protein " ≥ 2+ (any level of specific gravity)", dipstick protein "1+ (low specific gravity)", or "spot PCR > 500 mg/g (50 mg/mmol)", and sediment criteria include dysmorphic red blood cells "(≥ 5%), red blood cell casts or white blood cell casts"; if present, clinicians should "Quantify proteinuria" and assess "Is 24-hour proteinuria ≥ 500 mg/d?" with "Yes" leading to "Consider kidney biopsy" and "No" to "Repeat testing and follow the progress" and "No further urine testing". In parallel, for "Is there evidence of decreased or decreasing GFR", examples include "abnormal eGFR that is below the expected level based on age and clinical history, or decreasing eGFR, with no attributable cause other than systemic lupus erythematosus", with "Yes" directing to "Consider kidney biopsy" and "No" to "No further kidney function testing", with repeat testing; figure caption states "eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate".

### Utility of the AVISE connective tissue disease test in predicting lupus diagnosis and progression [^1bd4cf38]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is an autoimmune condition that can damage multiple organ systems. Classification criteria, including clinical and immunological criteria, have been developed by SLICC and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) to help identify patients with SLE. Despite these criteria, initial diagnosis of SLE can be challenging due to symptoms that are non-specific, do not meet classification criteria or overlap with other connective tissue diseases (CTDs). In fact, up to 50% of patients with CTDs have an unclassifiable profile at disease onset. Because early diagnosis of SLE decreases rates of flares, hospitalisations and healthcare costs, the development of new diagnostic tests for SLE has become a key area of interest.

Scoring systems have also been developed to assess disease activity in SLE based on the presence of certain clinical features attributable to SLE. The Systemic Lupus Activity Measure, European Community Lupus Activity Measure and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) calculate global indices, while the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group, which separates activity by organ systems, is based on the physician's intention to treat. Organ damage in SLE, defined as irreversible damage present for at least 6 months, is evaluated by the SDI.

### Systematic review of the reporting of extrarenal manifestations in observational studies of Saudi patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^4ade7a66]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by diverse clinical manifestations, potentially involving multiple organs and systems. Due to genetic, environmental or perhaps even ethnic reasons, this disease has high variability and heterogeneity. In Saudi Arabia, the incidence rate of SLE stands at an estimated 19.28 cases in every 100 000 people. In this region, SLE is more commonly found among women, indicated by a 12.5 to 1 ratio of males to females.SLE manifestations and symptoms have been studied widely in Saudi Arabia. Such studies have provided crucial insights into SLE diagnosis, management and prognosis in Saudi Arabia. Studies have also reported morbidity and mortality rates related to SLE in Saudi Arabia, with renal involvement recognised as a significant indicator of poor prognosis. While the primary aim of this study is to explore the prevalence and patterns of extrarenal manifestations among Saudi patients, it also indirectly addresses diagnostic delays by highlighting the variability in disease presentation across regions. Understanding these patterns is crucial for improving early recognition, timely diagnosis and management strategies, ultimately reducing the diagnostic gap in this population. Significant delays in diagnosing SLE often occur, primarily because of initial evaluations being conducted by non-specialists and the need for multiple consultations with physicians before patients are referred to a rheumatologist. It is concerning that only 33.4% of patients are able to see a rheumatologist within 1 month of their initial clinical presentation, and some patients have to wait for over a year. These delays have been linked to poorer outcomes, particularly in patients with severe organ involvement. In contrast, patients under the care of lupus specialists tend to have less active diseases and receive more effective treatment plans, underscoring the significance of specialised care. Timely diagnosis of SLE is crucial for improving clinical outcomes and is cost-effective, as it helps reduce healthcare costs. By facilitating early and accurate diagnosis, followed by appropriate immunosuppressive therapy, the quality of life can be significantly enhanced, and the development of early damage can be prevented. Understanding the clinical manifestations of SLE in Saudi Arabia holds broader significance, contributing to the global knowledge of this autoimmune disease. It is important to consider factors such as diagnosis delay, hospital facilities and the type of city to provide effective care. They also highlight the urgent need for early diagnosis and specialised care. Recommendations for future research and emphasis on appropriate management strategies aim to improve health outcomes for Saudi patients with SLE. Healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia should use these insights to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of SLE and design management strategies that are both effective and culturally appropriate. This study aimed to evaluate the variation in prevalence rates of extrarenal manifestations across Saudi Arabian cities, present findings on extrarenal manifestations from observational studies involving Saudi patients with SLE and highlight the significance of setting up a national registry for a better understanding of overall disease burden in the region.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) — diagnosis and monitoring of lupus nephritis (LN): Figure 85 suggests testing kidney markers at initial SLE presentation or flares and recommends consideration of biopsy if proteinuria is > 500 mg/d or if eGFR is worsening. The threshold level for isolated proteinuria is noted as lower than ACR 2012 LN guidelines. Biopsy cohorts show significant histologic disease even at low proteinuria: 92% of patients with < 1 g/g proteinuria had ISN/RPS class III, IV, V, or mixed histology, and De Rosa et al demonstrated ~ 85% with proteinuria < 0.5 g/d and ~ 75% with < 0.25 g/d had ISN/RPS class III, IV, or mixed histology. Because LN is frequently asymptomatic, SLE patients should be monitored every 3–6 months with creatinine, urinalysis, and UPCR, with high-risk patients requiring frequent monitoring, especially in the first 5 years of SLE diagnosis.

### Imaging findings in systemic lupus erythematosus [^2adb4cf3]. Radiographics (2004). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an unusually complex autoimmune disease that is encountered in every radiology subspecialty because of its multisystem involvement and the wide age range of affected patients. There are no universally accepted diagnostic imaging criteria for SLE, and in fact, many SLE patients present with systemic findings and laboratory abnormalities and do not require imaging. Nevertheless, radiology plays an ancillary role in the diagnosis and management of this often insidious disease, and knowledge of the spectrum of radiologic findings in SLE and its complications is crucial for proper image interpretation. Imaging is often performed in patients with a known diagnosis of SLE to determine the extent and severity of disease, which depend on the extent of organ involvement, and to monitor complications. In addition, imaging may be important in selected patients with diseases such as pneumonia who present with atypical symptoms due to immunosuppressive therapy.

### Recommendations for the use of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies in the diagnosis and follow-up of systemic lupus erythematosus – A proposal from an expert panel [^3a755e3f]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Anti-dsDNA autoantibodies are listed as one of the classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and are relatively effective indicators for monitoring disease activity and treatment response. Therefore, clinicians rely on them to diagnose and adjust medication and treatment strategies for SLE patients. However, the use of anti-dsDNA antibodies is not free from controversy. Part of this controversy stems from the fact that anti-dsDNA antibodies are found in several disorders, besides SLE. In addition to this, anti-dsDNA antibodies are a heterogeneous group of antibodies, and their determination still lacks proper standardization. Moreover, anti-dsDNA testing specificity and diagnostic performance change depending on the population under study. These and other issues result in inconsistency and encumber the clinical use of anti-dsDNA antibodies. A panel of medical laboratory and clinical experts on SLE discussed such issues based on their clinical experience in a first meeting, establishing a series of recommendations. The proceedings of this first meeting, plus an exhaustive review of the literature, were used to compose a paper draft. The panel subsequently discussed and refined this draft in a second meeting, the result of which is this paper. This document is relevant to clinical laboratories as it guides to improving diagnosis and monitoring of SLE. Simultaneously, it will help laboratories compile more informative reports, not limited to a mere number. It is also relevant to clinical doctors who wish to better understand laboratory methods so that they can do a more efficient, better-aimed laboratory test ordering.

### Infectious facade of autoimmunity: when SLE masquerades as tuberculosis [^75afd87c]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterised by widespread inflammation affecting multiple organ systems. Its varied clinical manifestations often complicate diagnosis, as it can closely mimic other conditions, particularly infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. This case report describes a woman in her early 20s initially suspected of having disseminated tuberculosis and treated accordingly due to overlapping symptoms, including fever, night sweats, lymphadenopathy and bilateral exudative pleural effusion. Subsequent evaluation, however, confirmed a diagnosis of SLE based on clinical criteria and positive autoantibody results. The patient also presented with anaemia of chronic disease and elevated inflammatory markers. This case highlights the diagnostic difficulty of differentiating SLE from tuberculosis, particularly in regions with high tuberculosis prevalence. Comprehensive physical examination, thorough evaluation and consideration of autoimmune disorders are essential in such cases to ensure accurate diagnosis, guide appropriate treatment and prevent severe complications.

### Lupus spectrum ambiguity has long-term negative implications for patients [^543e65cb]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Lupus diagnosis and SLE classification criteria: a conundrum that delays diagnosis?

Diagnostic criteria are used to make a diagnosis in variety of conditions. In a heterogeneous disease like SLE, that has not been possible to date because diagnostic criteria are quite difficult to develop given the complexity of SLE that often evades conventional formularies. Instead, diagnosis of SLE relies heavily on the adaptation of SLE classification criteria, clinical judgement and probabilistic diagnostic reasoning. However, there are differing views on the legitimacy of using SLE classification criteria in diagnostic scenarios. Large rheumatology organisations including the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) do NOT support application of diagnostic criteria, only classification criteria. However, other experts suggest that SLE classification criteria should not be used for making a diagnosis but can be used as a reference. We agree that development of diagnostic criteria for a disease with evasive heterogeneity is an arduous task and propose that a cadre of molecular and diagnostic tools are necessary to expand our understanding of lupus as a spectrum disease.

Recent studies suggest that Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinical (SLICC) 2012 and EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria have superior specificity in classifying SLE at 93.8% and 97.3%, respectively. Still, these criteria have lower sensitivity for classifying early lupus, probable lupus, incomplete lupus or other lupus endotypes. In general, application and subsequent underperformance of SLE classification criteria can have devastating long-term consequences for patients. Patients who do not meet the threshold for conventional SLE classification criteria often suffer longer and must manage their disease while simultaneously encountering physicians who may have clinical reasoning flaws or experiential biases that lead to a lack of agreement on the medical interpretation of their symptoms. Hypothetically, if a 'spectrum' definition of lupus were developed, disseminated and adopted, it could prompt providers to refer patients to rheumatological experts even if their symptoms were not as common or completely typical of lupus. This approach might, in turn, accelerate the diagnostic journey and decrease the time to diagnosis and at the very least give specialists the opportunity to provide treatment directed to a symptom or sign without absolute certainty of the diagnosis.

### Acute hepatitis in a young woman with systemic lupus erythematosus: a diagnostic challenge [^941c61a3]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 48-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosis was on naproxen, hidroxichloroquine and acetylsalicylic acid. She had self-suspended all medication and resumed 1 year later. Five days after the medication was resumed, she developed acute hepatitis, with biochemical hepatic cytolysis, hypergamaglobulinaemia and a serum antinuclear antibody titre of 1/2560. Idiopathic autoimmune hepatitis was considered, but drug-induced liver injury could not definitely be ruled out. Patient declined liver biopsy. Oral prednisolone was started. Within 3 months with prednisolone being tapered to 10 mg/day, a new flare occurred. Liver biopsy was performed and it favoured autoimmune hepatitis diagnosis. We discuss the diagnostic options and treatment approach in a patient with autoimmune disease and possible drug-induced liver injury who initially declined liver biopsy.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and care of living kidney donors [^3a7d528b]. Transplantation (2017). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) kidney involvement — Practice Point 10.1.1 outlines a diagnostic approach specifying when to test, the testing panel, abnormal thresholds, and actions. Testing is indicated with "Systemic lupus erythematosus presentation", "As regular surveillance", or "Suspicion of disease flare", and the panel includes "Serum creatinine and eGFR", "Urinalysis (dipstick and sediment)", "Spot protein–creatinine ratio (PCR)", and "Serology (anti-dsDNA and complement)" (eGFR is estimated glomerular filtration rate and anti-dsDNA is anti–double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid). Under "Is there evidence of abnormal proteinuria or urine sediment", abnormal proteinuria is defined by "dipstick protein 2+ (any level of specific gravity), dipstick protein 1+ (low specific gravity), or spot PCR > 500 mg/g (50 mg/mmol)", and urine sediment criteria include "acanthocytes (≥ 5%), red blood cell casts or white blood cell casts"; if "No", "No further urine testing at this time", and if "Yes", "Quantify proteinuria" and if "Is 24-hour proteinuria ≥ 500 mg/d?" "Yes", "Consider kidney biopsy", otherwise "Repeat testing and follow the progress" then "No further urine testing at this time". Under "Is there evidence of decreased or decreasing GFR", examples include "abnormal eGFR that is below the expected level based on age and clinical history, or decreasing eGFR, with no attributable cause other than systemic lupus erythematosus"; if "No", "No further kidney function testing at this time", and pathways lead to "Consider kidney biopsy".

### Treatment of immune-mediated cytopenias in patients with primary immunodeficiencies and immune regulatory disorders (PIRDs) [^d48ebb45]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Severe immune cytopenias (SICs) are rare acquired conditions characterized by immune-mediated blood cell destruction. They may necessitate emergency medical management and long-term immunosuppressive therapy, strongly compromising the quality of life. The initial diagnostic workup involves excluding malignancies, congenital cytopenias, bone marrow failure syndromes, infections, and rheumatologic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Causal factors for SIC such as primary immunodeficiencies or immune regulatory disorders, which are referred to as inborn errors of immunity (IEIs), should be diagnosed as early as possible to allow the initiation of a targeted therapy and avoid multiple lines of ineffective treatment. Ideally, this therapy is directed against an overexpressed or overactive gene product or substitutes a defective protein, restoring the impaired pathway; it can also act indirectly, enhancing a countermechanism against the disease-causing defect. Ultimately, the diagnosis of an underling IEI in patients with refractory SIC may lead to evaluation for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or gene therapy as a definitive treatment. Interdisciplinary care is highly recommended in this complex patient cohort. This case-based educational review supports decision making for patients with immune-mediated cytopenias and suspected inborn errors of immunity.

### Validation of the 2019 EULAR / ACR classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus in an academic tertiary care centre [^31686639]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The 2019 EULAR/ACR criteria for the classification of SLE are the most recent and up-to-date effort to provide a clear framework for the identification of patients with SLE that can be included in clinical trials. SLE is a heterogeneous disease, more a chameleon than a wolf, and this makes it particularly challenging to design and carry out trials of novel medications. Lupus trials are notoriously prone to fail to demonstrate benefit. Being able to clearly define the study cohort is one important prerequisite to pave the way to success.

For the purpose of generating homogeneity, the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification includes a history of ANA positivity as an entry criterion. This provided for maximum specificity, which was one goal of the EULAR/ACR working group, at the expense of decreased sensitivity. Importantly, the classification criteria were not designed to make the diagnosis of SLE, which remains a clinical decision. Nonetheless, all of the items in the classification are typical features of SLE, and as a matter of fact, SLE classification criteria have been useful as an adjunctive tool to make the clinical diagnosis ever since the first inception.

### Diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^de80254d]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is complex and variability in practices exists. Guidelines have been developed to help improve the management of SLE patients, but there has been no formal evaluation of these guidelines. This study aims to compare the scope, quality, and consistency of clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of patients with SLE.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched up to April 2014. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument and textual synthesis was used to appraise and compare recommendations.

Results

Nine clinical practice guidelines and 5 consensus statements were identified, which covered 7 topics: diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, neuropsychiatric SLE, lupus nephritis, antiphospholipid syndrome, and other manifestations of lupus. The methodological quality of the guidelines was variable, with the overall mean AGREE II scores ranging from 31% to 75%, out of a maximum 100%. Scores were consistently low for applicability, with only 1 guideline scoring above 50%. There was substantial variability in the treatments recommended for class II and V lupus nephritis, the recommended duration of maintenance therapy for class III/IV lupus nephritis (from 1 to 4 years), and timing of ophthalmologic examination for patients taking corticosteroids.

Conclusion

Published guidelines on SLE cover a complex area of clinical care, but the methodological quality, scope, and recommendations varied substantially. Collaborative and multidisciplinary efforts to develop comprehensive, high-quality evidence-based guidelines are needed to promote best treatment and health outcomes for patients with SLE.

### Sensitivity of classification criteria from time of diagnosis in an incident systemic lupus erythematosus cohort: a population-based study from Norway [^af1c7d5a]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex, heterogeneous autoimmune disease, with partly overlapping phenotypes that evolve from disease onset and undergo multiple changes across the course of the disease. Immune complexes containing autoantibodies is a hallmark of the disease and compiled data from the recent international SLE classification project (detailed below) showed that 98% of patients scored positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) by standardised indirect immunofluorescence testing. While the presence of additional, more specific autoantibodies binding double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), Smith ribonucleoprotein (anti-Sm) and membrane phospholipids (anti-PL) makes the diagnosis more likely, they are never more than diagnostic aids.

In SLE, the immune-mediated inflammation has destructive potential. Thus, if the disease is left untreated, targeted organs are at high risk of structural damage and loss of function. This implies that diagnostic delay, with the thwarted start-up of immune-suppressive therapies, is critical to avoid, as it may result in a situation where the patient already at time of diagnosis has severe, and sometimes irreversible, damage in one or more organ systems. Moreover, there is evidence that delayed diagnosis may increase the likeliness of persistent disease activity and flares, which has an impact on disease burden, damage accrual and mortality.

In the absence of diagnostic criteria, the current 'gold-standard' case definition for SLE and the basic eligibility criterion for all types of SLE research (including studies of early SLE), is 'diagnosis confirmed by expert clinical assessment'. However, this case definition is liable to bias, thus the case definition for research must be accompanied by classification criteria to secure homogeneity and comparability. Requiring high specificity, classification, in general, comes with the risk of low sensitivity. Accordingly, classification may exclude a significant proportion of patients, for example, from testing of new treatments in clinical trials.

Reflecting the need for better representation of SLE patients in clinical trials, it was an expressed ambition of the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology/American College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ACR) classification criteria to increase sensitivity, especially for patients with early disease, compared with the 1997 ACR criteria. This consequently accommodates inclusion earlier in the disease course to trials on newer treatments. Moreover, the new criteria were constructed as an additive scoring system, and as proposed when the criteria were launched, recent studies have linked higher scores to a more severe disease progression and higher risk of organ damage.

### Improving patient pathways for systemic lupus erythematosus: a multistakeholder pathway optimisation study [^a7b5804e]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We have developed a framework for optimising PPs in SLE which integrates the following elements: appropriate and timely referral strategy for SLE diagnosis; a dedicated lupus consultation, during which the diagnosis is formally announced, and following which psychological support is offered; individualised pathways with coordinated care based on organ involvement, disease severity and patient preference; improved patient education; prevention of complications such as infections, osteoporosis and cancer; as well as additional patient support, in particular from the social and employment perspectives. It is interesting to point out that five disruptive points and challenges which were reported by the stakeholders were not spontaneously reported by patients with SLE and that nine of these points were reported by patients but not stakeholders. Reconciling the different points of view of healthcare professionals and patients is obviously a major challenge when optimising PP.

Appropriate and timely diagnosis

A recent study has shown that the median diagnosis delay for SLE in Europe is ≈2 years and ≈1 year in France. This is largely due to the rarity of the disease, its highly polymorphic nature and the lack of a highly specific biomarker. Importantly, diagnosis delay may vary according to ethnic background and/or socioeconomic background. It is common feeling that the early diagnosis of SLE can be beneficial by allowing early intervention and potentially improving short-term and long-term outcomes. However, there is still limited evidence supporting this assumption, which mainly derives from administrative database analysis showing that patients with early diagnosis (< 6 months between probable SLE onset and diagnosis) had lower rates of flares and hospitalisations compared with patients with late diagnosis (≥ 6 months). During focus groups, the GPs (primary care physicians) have underlined the lack of general training in the field of autoimmune diseases as well as the complexity of ANA interpretation. Hence, the indications for ANA testing and the adequate referral procedure following ANA positivity should be optimised within the SLE-PP. In the USA, it has been shown that test ordering is significantly influenced by hidden cognitive processes related to the physician's calculation of patient resources and a health insurance system that requires certain types of evidence in order to permit further tests or particular interventions. In France, as well as in most European countries, the healthcare system is publicly funded and access to ANA testing is not a significant limitation. However, in most European countries, there are insufficient physicians in primary care for timely and adequate patient detection and monitoring, as well as significant imbalance between resource and demand for specialised care, which may result in additional delay in referral from primary to secondary or tertiary care.

### An evidence-based approach to diagnosing patients presenting with orbital inflammatory syndromes (an American ophthalmological society thesis) [^fe416bc1]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The initial management of patients presenting with orbital inflammatory syndromes varies-with some pursuing a diagnostic workup while others treat without any testing. The evidence behind this rationale is limited. A review of patients with orbital inflammation is performed with an analysis of diagnostic testing to develop a workflow for such patients.

Design

A retrospective review of patients presenting with acute orbital inflammation at a single institution from 2011 to 2020 was conducted.

Methods

Orbital imaging was required for inclusion. Patients with high suspicion of neoplasm, bacterial infection, vascular malformation, or thyroid eye disease were excluded. A review of presenting clinical findings, laboratory workup, orbital imaging, and biopsy were performed. Statistical analysis was performed identifying statistically significant diagnostic and treatment maneuvers.

Results

In total, 172 patients met inclusion criteria (66% female, mean age 46 years). The primary clinical presentation was myositis, dacryoadenitis, and infiltrative in 67, 73, and 32 patients (39.0%, 43.0%, 18.6%, respectively). Laboratory studies were conducted in 145 (84%) while biopsy was performed in 55 (32%). Specific orbital inflammation (SOI) was diagnosed in 29 (16.9%) with the most frequent diagnoses being sarcoidosis, IgG4-related disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. The majority (147, 85.5%) was initially treated with steroids, but steroid-sparing agent use was statistically higher in patients with SOI.

Conclusions

In patients presenting with orbital inflammatory syndromes, distinguishing myositis, dacryoadenitis, and infiltrative disease has workup and differential diagnosis impacts. Because SOI is relatively common, sequelae of SOI, and potential steroid-sparing therapy needs, diagnosis via an evidence-based systemic approach is critical.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: diagnosis and treatment [^01f68064]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematologic, integumentary, musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric, pulmonary, renal, and reproductive systems. It is a chronic disease and may cause recurrent flare-ups without adequate treatment. The newest clinical criteria proposed by the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology in 2019 include an obligatory entry criterion of a positive antinuclear antibody titer of 1: 80 or greater. Management of SLE is directed at complete remission or low disease activity, minimizing the use of glucocorticoids, preventing flare-ups, and improving quality of life. Hydroxychloroquine is recommended for all patients with SLE to prevent flare-ups, organ damage, and thrombosis and increase long-term survival. Pregnant patients with SLE have an increased risk of spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. Preconception counseling regarding risks, planning the timing of pregnancy, and a multidisciplinary approach play a major role in the management of SLE in patients contemplating pregnancy. All patients with SLE should receive ongoing education, counseling, and support. Those with mild SLE can be monitored by a primary care physician in conjunction with rheumatology. Patients with increased disease activity, complications, or adverse effects from treatment should be managed by a rheumatologist.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^d63365c9]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the paradigm of systemic autoimmune diseases characterised by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations with an unpredictable relapsing-remitting course. The aim of the present work was to identify current available clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for SLE, to provide their review and to identify physicians' and patients' unmet needs. Twenty-three original guidelines published between 2004 and 2017 were identified. Many aspects of disease management are covered, including global disease management, lupus nephritis and neuropsychiatric involvement, management of pregnancies, vaccinations and comorbidities monitoring. Unmet needs relate with disease management of some clinical manifestations and adherence to treatment. Many patient's unmet needs have been identified starting with faster diagnosis, need for more therapeutic options, guidelines on lifestyle issues, attention to quality of life and adequate education.

### Diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus with early manifestation of an eosinophilic pleural effusion [^e45414e0]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A woman in her 70s with a history of Crohn's disease presented to the emergency department with dyspnoea, cough and intermittent fevers. Evaluation revealed a pleural effusion with neutrophil predominance, and initial suspicion of infection prompted a short course of antibiotic therapy. However, the patient subsequently developed recurrent pleural effusion with eosinophilic predominance. Serological data confirmed a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the patient was started on appropriate treatment. This case presents an initial manifestation of eosinophilic-dominant pleural effusion in SLE. Current guidelines in treating pleural effusions do not explore rheumatological causes. However, we believe that our case demonstrates the value of a prompt investigation for rheumatological aetiologies in an otherwise unclassified eosinophilic-predominant pleural effusion. Such an investigation should include serological data as an important confirmatory marker for the diagnosis of SLE.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and care of living kidney donors [^ece4d025]. Transplantation (2017). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis and suspected thrombotic microangiopathy — patients with LN and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) should be managed according to the underlying etiology of TMA, as shown in Figure 13. Initial steps are to test for ADAMTS13 activity and antibodies to ADAMTS13 and to test for antiphospholipid antibodies, with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura risk stratification (PLASMIC score) using moderate/high risk (> 5 points) or low risk (0–4 points); in adults at moderate/high risk, start plasma exchange and glucocorticoid while awaiting test results. Low ADAMTS13 activity (< 10%) — systemic lupus erythematosus-associated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; plasma exchange + glucocorticoid + rituximab ± caplacizumab. Normal ADAMTS13 activity and negative antiphospholipid antibodies — evaluate for thrombotic microangiopathy etiologies; primary or secondary complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy — consider eculizumab. Normal ADAMTS13 activity and positive antiphospholipid antibodies — antiphospholipid syndrome nephropathy; anticoagulation ± plasma exchange.

### Lupus spectrum ambiguity has long-term negative implications for patients [^199aff03]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Educating providers on communications about diagnostic ambiguity

Although a spectrum definition may lead to more prompt diagnosis for some individuals, many are likely to still experience diagnostic uncertainty. In such situations, it is important for clinicians to help patients understand and navigate the ambiguity of their diagnosis. For example, clinicians should help patients understand why their phenotype may be indicative of lupus and what additional monitoring or treatment steps will need to occur before a diagnosis can be confirmed or an alternative diagnosis made. The use of a spectrum definition may ultimately be helpful in these conversations, as patients with possible lupus come to understand that they are near the end of the spectrum but may eventually have symptoms that are clearly indicative of lupus. It will be important for providers to be educated on how to have conversations with patients whose diagnosis may be unclear even if they fall within the lupus spectrum.

Recommendations for next steps

Determining whether it would be appropriate to move to a definition of lupus as a spectrum will require consultation with and consensus from stakeholders across the lupus global landscape, including professional medical societies, regulatory health agencies and sponsors in clinical research. These stakeholders will be crucial to driving the development and acceptance of a new definition and ensuring that all patients who experience symptoms of lupus are diagnosed accurately and in a timely manner. Before developing a spectrum definition, however, there are other foundational steps the global lupus community must take. ALPHA GAC recommendations for next steps include the following:

Conduct additional research into the natural history of disease and studies on environmental and modifiable lifestyle triggers that initiate and cause progression of lupus.
Continue to improve definitions of lupus endotypes with clinical and molecular signatures, including additional research on biomarkers.
Conduct prevention trials to advance understanding of whether predictive biomarkers can contribute to earlier diagnosis, possible prevention, likely treatment response and impact of lifestyle changes on disease course.
Leverage the professional networks of medical associations to: Implement provider training and tools to improve patient care, including in cases where there is diagnostic uncertainty. Send alerts and resources on the latest developments in the field. Develop a clear pathway for referral from primary care practitioner to specialist.
Leverage emerging research and work with the US Food and Drug Administration and other global regulatory health agencies to consider the expansion of the definition of lupus for drug development efforts.

### Characteristics and genetic analysis of patients suspected with early-onset systemic lupus erythematosus [^c2ad42cb]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

Seven cases including 4 female (57.1%) and 3 male (42.9%) were suspected with early-onset SLE (age of onset ≦ 5 years old). None of the patients were of consanguineous marriage and the age of disease onset ranged from 20 to 60 months. Compared to the cSLE patients onset at elder age, cases fulfilling the SLE classification criteria before the age of 5 are less female dominate (57.1% vs 90.4%), and more likely to suffer from proliferative glomerulonephritis (71.4% vs 56.5%), renal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) (28.6% vs 4.5%), neuropsychiatric disorder (57.1% vs 11.3%), and failure to thrive (FTT) (42.9% vs 4.0%). Clinical manifestations and initial laboratorial findings of those suspected with early-onset SLE were summarized in Table 1. Patients with probable genetic etiologies were further discussed.

### Malar rash in a patient with acute epiglottitis [^492e4a47]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

The malar rash, characterised by its classic butterfly-shaped distribution sparing the nasolabial folds, is a hallmark feature of SLE. Although it has a sensitivity of 57%, its specificity for SLE is approximately 96%, making it a valuable diagnostic clue in suspected cases. In this case, recognition of the rash ultimately prompted a rheumatological evaluation — but it should not have been the trigger. The patient has been experiencing joint pain and morning stiffness for a year, symptoms that strongly suggest an underlying inflammatory or autoimmune process, particularly in a young woman. These features alone warranted earlier investigation. Had a thorough workup been initiated at that time — potentially revealing abnormalities, such as anaemia or positive serologies — the diagnosis might have been reached much sooner, possibly preventing the progression to multiorgan involvement. Although the patient's lack of consistent access to care likely contributed to the delay, this case also highlights missed opportunities for clinical reasoning and pattern recognition when she did engage with the healthcare system. Her initial complaints were not unrelated to her ultimate diagnosis; rather, they were early manifestations of SLE that went unrecognised. This underscores a key learning point: a malar rash should be viewed as a clinical cue, not a prerequisite, for rheumatological evaluation.

The relationship between SLE and infection is intricate, with much still to be understood regarding the interplay between the two. Certain pathogens, such as the Epstein-Barr virus, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE, potentially through mechanisms like molecular mimicry. For patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SLE, infections can act as triggers for acute flares. Although rare, acute epiglottitis has been reported as an initial presentation of SLE. Immunological dysfunction in SLE, including complement system abnormalities and splenic dysfunction, is believed to increase vulnerability to infections caused by encapsulated organisms. Further research is needed to clarify the causal relationship between infections and the onset or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases like SLE. In this patient, the 12-month history of arthralgias and morning stiffness suggests that SLE was likely present before the onset of epiglottitis. The subsequent development of malar rash, acute pancreatitis and lupus nephritis may indicate that the acute epiglottitis triggered an SLE flare, unmasking the disease and facilitating its diagnosis.
