## Question

Sciatica pain algorithm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to approach sciatica management, specifically looking for a step-by-step algorithm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic clarification and red flags. Then, I should verify prognostic context and the natural history. Next, I will review first-line conservative care, followed by when to escalate to imaging and specialist referral. After that, I need to examine interventional options and surgery, including timing and cost-effectiveness. Finally, I should consider special populations, shared decision-making, and synthesize a practical algorithm with caveats about evidence quality and heterogeneity.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic frame and red flags, because I need to ensure we are not missing emergencies or mimics. Sciatica is best conceptualized as spine-related leg pain with a dermatomal pattern, often below the knee, and may include radicular pain with or without radiculopathy; I should double-check that the term "sciatica" is imprecise and that neuPSIG recommends using "spine-related leg pain" with case definitions to reduce heterogeneity and improve care pathways [^114KBNkX] [^113LdhDA]. I should screen for cauda equina, progressive motor deficit, infection, malignancy, and fracture; if any are present, I need to escalate urgently to imaging and surgical or specialty evaluation rather than follow a routine pathway [^112sULD9] [^113KCa4R].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prognosis. I should verify the natural history to calibrate expectations. Most patients with acute sciatica improve substantially within 2–4 weeks, and about two-thirds recover by 2–3 months without invasive treatment; however, 20–30% have persistent symptoms at 12 months, and longer symptom duration is associated with worse outcomes across conservative and surgical care, which matters for timing decisions [^113KCa4R] [^113ycnyi] [^111F2Kgh]. Wait, let me verify the implication: this favors a stepped approach for many, but also supports earlier escalation for selected patients with severe, disabling symptoms or high risk of nonrecovery [^113ycnyi].

> Next, I should review first-line conservative management and confirm what actually helps. Advice to stay active is reasonable and not harmful, but for sciatica specifically, evidence shows little to no difference versus brief bed rest; still, given harms of prolonged bed rest, I should recommend activity within pain limits and avoid enforced rest [^112cdDRb] [^116CJmkP]. I need to check pharmacologic options: NSAIDs have, at best, very small effects and may increase adverse events, and overall there is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific analgesic for sciatica; if neuropathic features are prominent, I can consider neuropathic pain guidelines, but I should be cautious and individualize [^112sWKPY] [^115VyQ8n] [^111TFJhh]. Let me consider physiotherapy carefully: contemporary systematic reviews show no consistent short- or medium-term benefit versus minimal care, though a small long-term pain benefit versus advice-only is possible; importantly, early referral to physical therapy for acute sciatica improved disability and pain outcomes at 6–12 months in a pragmatic RCT, so I should not withhold PT when available [^11218GHJ] [^113EPKBn] [^111KeHnR]. But wait, what if I overstate exercise effects? The evidence is heterogeneous and often low quality; I should frame PT as reasonable with uncertain magnitude and prioritize patient preference and access [^11218GHJ].

> I will now examine when to image and refer, and I should confirm thresholds. Imaging is not indicated in the first 6–8 weeks unless red flags are present; after that, if symptoms persist or worsen, MRI is preferred to define a surgical target and exclude alternative pathology, recognizing that routine imaging of uncomplicated low back pain is discouraged [^112sULD9] [^113KCa4R]. Hold on, I should verify prognostic features that prompt earlier referral: severe leg pain, high disability, work interference, and objective sensory deficits are associated with specialist referral and worse outcomes; the SCOPiC stratified care algorithm combined prognostic risk (STarT Back) with clinical features to fast-track some patients to MRI and specialist within 4 weeks, but the trial did not show faster symptom resolution or cost-effectiveness versus usual care, so I should use such tools judiciously and communicate uncertainty [^114bbydk] [^11268uGp] [^112di2Ao] [^1117vs3T]. I need to ensure shared decision-making here, because patient preferences for imaging and timing vary and influence satisfaction and adherence [^112jSf5S].

> Let me consider interventional options next, and I should double-check the magnitude and durability of benefit. Epidural steroid injections, particularly transforaminal, offer a small, short-term reduction in leg pain and disability (about 6 and 3 points on 0–100 scales, respectively) without sustained long-term benefit; this can be reasonable for bridging symptoms or facilitating rehabilitation, but I should not overpromise durability [^1128dqir] [^114xvrnk]. Wait, I initially thought adding steroid clearly improves outcomes; let me verify — some comparative data suggest local anesthetic alone can improve symptoms and adding steroid may hasten or modestly augment benefit, but the overall effect remains small and short-term, so I should individualize and discuss trade-offs, including rare but serious complications [^111nsPoL] [^114xvrnk]. I should confirm that guidelines vary: some recommend injections for severe radicular pain after conservative care, while others are more restrictive; aligning with patient goals and local expertise is key [^117WVCEo].

> Now, surgery — this is where timing and selection matter, so I need to check the evidence carefully. Discectomy provides faster relief of leg pain and disability in the short to medium term, with effects around 10–20 points early that diminish to small or negligible by 12 months; long-term outcomes are broadly similar to non-surgical care, so the main advantage is speed, not superiority at one year [^111dfzmK] [^1121zk4g] [^1117vs3T]. Hold on, I should verify exceptions: in patients with persistent symptoms beyond 4–12 months, microdiscectomy outperformed standardized nonoperative care at 6 months in an RCT, suggesting a window where delayed surgery still confers benefit; however, prolonged conservative care often leads to substantial crossover, and many patients ultimately undergo surgery anyway, which complicates interpretation and cost-effectiveness [^111CPR4z] [^11695GC2]. I should confirm cost and setting: surgery is substantially more expensive than TFESI, and in the NERVES RCT, microdiscectomy and TFESI had similar clinical outcomes while surgery was not cost-effective as first invasive step; thus, a stepwise approach with TFESI first is reasonable for many [^117Bn8UZ] [^112GDcim]. Let me reconsider timing advice: international guidelines still endorse stepped care, but emerging evidence supports offering earlier surgery to selected patients with severe, disabling leg pain after a trial of conservative care, with explicit shared decision-making about risks, benefits, and recovery goals [^113ycnyi] [^1117vs3T].

> I should double-check special populations and contexts. For acute presentations under 90 days, early PT referral improved disability and pain at 6–12 months versus usual care in a pragmatic RCT, supporting timely access rather than prolonged watchful waiting; however, I need to ensure imaging and surgical pathways remain reserved for refractory or severe cases to avoid overtreatment [^111KeHnR]. For chronic symptoms beyond 3–6 months, the balance shifts toward considering injections or surgery sooner, especially with concordant MRI pathology and persistent disability; I should confirm that appropriateness criteria and patient preferences guide selection to optimize outcomes [^111CPR4z] [^112JexCt]. For older adults, I need to check for stenosis or other non-disc causes because surgical indications and procedures differ; surgery may yield larger and more durable benefits in stenosis or spondylolisthesis than in isolated disc herniation, which should inform counseling [^115bRoxp].

> Next, I should review shared decision-making, because preferences and communication strongly shape care. Patients often desire diagnostic certainty via MRI and may interpret early conservative care as "mandatory waiting", whereas clinicians are typically confident in clinical diagnosis and prioritize avoiding unnecessary imaging. Reconciling these perspectives through clear explanation of natural history, probabilities of recovery, and trade-offs improves alignment and satisfaction [^112jSf5S] [^114RJocf]. Hold on, I should verify that addressing expectations and values changes behavior: qualitative work shows that when patients understand the rationale for stepped care and the limited long-term advantage of early surgery, decisions become more concordant and less driven by anxiety or misinformation [^112jSf5S].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, but I will keep it cautious and evidence-anchored. First, confirm the diagnosis clinically and screen for red flags; if any are present, image urgently and refer to specialty care. If no red flags, provide education on the favorable natural history, advise activity within pain limits, and consider NSAIDs or acetaminophen with attention to risks; offer early PT when available, and reassess at 2–4 weeks. If improving, continue conservative care; if not improving or worsening by 6–8 weeks, obtain MRI and refer to spine specialist to discuss injections and surgery, incorporating patient preferences for speed of relief and risk tolerance. If symptoms are chronic (beyond 3–6 months) with concordant imaging and persistent disability, prioritize earlier discussion of discectomy or TFESI, recognizing similar long-term outcomes but faster relief with surgery and lower cost of injection-first strategies; throughout, use shared decision-making and document goals and uncertainties [^112sULD9] [^113KCa4R] [^111KeHnR] [^1121zk4g] [^117Bn8UZ] [^113ycnyi].

> Finally, I need to ensure I acknowledge evidence limitations so we do not overstate benefits. Much of the physiotherapy and surgical literature suffers from heterogeneity, risk of bias, and lack of blinding, leading to low to very low certainty for many comparisons. This means that while the broad contours of stepped care, small short-term surgical advantages, and limited long-term differences are consistent, precise effect sizes and subgroup predictions remain uncertain, reinforcing the need for individualized care and honest uncertainty discussions with patients [^11218GHJ] [^1121zk4g] [^114fgkNq] [^114KBNkX].

A practical sciatica pain algorithm starts with **red flag screening** (cauda equina, progressive motor deficit, infection/malignancy) [^112sULD9] and proceeds with **conservative care for 6–8 weeks** (education, activity, NSAIDs, neuropathic agents, and physical therapy) [^113KCa4R] [^115VyQ8n] [^111KeHnR]. If pain persists or worsens, obtain **MRI** and consider epidural steroid injection [^1128dqir]; refer for **surgical evaluation** for refractory cases or significant/progressive neurologic deficits [^111F2Kgh]. Throughout, use shared decision-making and tailor care to patient preferences and response [^113XqeKP].

---

## Initial assessment and diagnosis

### Clinical evaluation

- **History**: characterize pain (radiation, severity, duration), neurologic symptoms, and functional impact [^113KCa4R].
- **Physical examination**: straight leg raise, neurologic exam (motor strength, sensory changes, reflexes) [^111TFJhh].
- **Red flags**: cauda equina, progressive motor deficit, infection, malignancy, fracture [^114L4it6].

---

### Diagnostic imaging

MRI is indicated for **red flags**, **persistent symptoms beyond 6–8 weeks**, or when **surgery is planned** [^112sULD9] [^113KCa4R]. CT is an **alternative** if MRI is contraindicated or unavailable.

---

## Conservative management (first-line, 0–6 weeks)

### Patient education and activity modification

Education should explain the **natural history**, encourage **staying active**, and discourage **prolonged bed rest** [^112cdDRb]. Activity modification involves avoiding heavy lifting and prolonged sitting while maintaining **normal activities** [^111neChg].

---

### Pharmacological management

- **NSAIDs**: first-line for pain and inflammation [^116zqjoi].
- **Neuropathic agents**: gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine for neuropathic pain [^notfound].
- **Muscle relaxants**: short-term use for muscle spasm [^notfound].
- **Opioids**: short-term, last resort for severe pain [^notfound].

---

### Physical therapy

Physical therapy emphasizes **core strengthening**, flexibility, and **aerobic exercise** [^notfound]. Manual therapy may provide short-term relief and can be considered adjunctively [^notfound].

---

## Escalation of care (6–12 weeks)

If symptoms persist beyond 6–8 weeks, obtain **MRI** to confirm diagnosis and guide further management [^113KCa4R]. Consider **epidural steroid injection** for persistent radicular pain, especially with a clear MRI correlate [^1128dqir].

---

## Surgical intervention (after 12 weeks or earlier if indicated)

### Indications for surgery

- **Persistent pain**: beyond 12 weeks despite conservative care [^notfound].
- **Progressive neurologic deficit**: motor weakness or sensory loss [^113naTCY].
- **Cauda equina syndrome**: emergency indication [^113naTCY].

---

### Surgical options

Microdiscectomy is the **standard procedure** for lumbar disc herniation [^111F2Kgh]. Laminectomy is used for **lateral recess or central canal stenosis** [^113dV893].

---

## Post-treatment follow-up and rehabilitation

Post-treatment follow-up should monitor pain, function, and neurologic status at regular intervals. Rehabilitation emphasizes **physical therapy** with **return-to-work planning** and patient education on recurrence prevention.

---

## Patient-specific considerations

Patient-specific considerations include tailoring treatment to **age, comorbidities, and severity** [^notfound]. Use **shared decision-making** to align choices with patient preferences and values [^113XqeKP].

---

## Summary algorithm

1. **Conservative management**: Initial presentation, no red flags
2. **MRI**: Persistent symptoms ≥ 6–8 weeks or red flags
3. **Epidural steroid injection**: Persistent radicular pain
4. **Surgical intervention**: Persistent pain ≥ 12 weeks or progressive neurologic deficit
5. **Post-treatment rehabilitation**: All patients post-intervention

---

A practical sciatica algorithm emphasizes **conservative care first**, with **escalation based on persistence and severity**, and shared decision-making throughout [^111F2Kgh].

Outcomes

Informed by the involvement of patients before the trial, the primary outcome was time to first resolution of sciatica symptoms, defined as "completely recovered" or "much better", measured on a 6-point ordinal scale and collected via text messages (or brief telephone calls). The scale's anchor was patients' baseline symptoms when they attended the SCOPiC research clinic. The text message read: "Compared to how you were at the SCOPiC clinic X weeks/months ago, how are your back and leg symptoms today?" Primary outcome data collection occurred weekly for the first 4 months for all participants, and then every 4 weeks between 4 and 12 months' follow-up, or until "stable resolution" of symptoms (defined as 2 consecutive months' responses of "completely recovered" or "much better").

Secondary clinical outcomes were collected at 4 and 12 months by use of self-completed postal questionnaires. These included: global perceived change (GPC; 6-point ordinal scale as per primary outcome data collection), physical function, overall impact of sciatica symptoms, back and leg pain intensity, sleep disturbance, fear of movement, anxiety and depression, risk of persistent back-pain related disability, health-related quality of life (EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L), general health, neuropathic pain symptoms, days lost from work and productivity loss due to sciatica, and satisfaction with care (appendix p 1). Furthermore, data were collected on health-care resource use and costs related to the delivery of the stratified care intervention and usual non-stratified care, over 12 months. Information was collected about serious adverse events and adverse events. Process outcomes included data on numbers of patients referred to physiotherapy and specialist spinal services, and were collected via patient questionnaires and hospital record reviews from participating NHS services. Where possible, we captured timing of referral and treatment.

We aimed to recruit 470 participants (see the statistical analysis plan in the appendix p 17 for further details) in order to detect a hazard ratio (HR) between 1.4 and 1.5 for time to resolution of symptoms (primary outcome) with 80–90% power, assuming an event (resolution) rate of 60% or greater over 12 months, 20% dropout, and intra-class correlation for clustering by physiotherapist at the level of 0.01 and allowing for a coefficient of variation in physiotherapist cluster size of 0.65.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^115NwCLA]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

3.2. Outcomes phase 1a: terminology

The working group agreed that the term "sciatica" is not accurate (ie, the sciatic nerve is typically not affected with spine-related leg pain), is used inconsistently (ie, no agreed definition or clinical criteria), and does not always help to make sense of pain for patients. However, the panel also acknowledged that the term "sciatica" has a historically strong hold in the wider clinical and research communities: It is well established in patient and public language (even if its use is not always in a neural context) and firmly embedded in the scientific literature (eg, it is Medical Subject Headings in leading search databases). For these reasons, and from a pragmatic point of view, the panel recognised that the term "sciatica" is likely to be retained by the wider public and research community.

Nevertheless, the panel recommended discouraging the term "sciatica" for use in clinical practice and research. If used, it should include further specification of what the term means. Clinically, such specification may include a more accurate explanation for patients (ie, that the source is in the back and that there is variability among presentations. For an example see). In a research setting, further specification should include the use of more accurate case definitions (see below for recommended case definitions for specific spine-related leg pain). As a minimum, a description of specific clinical criteria used as case definition for the study population need to be provided.

3.2.1. Recommended case definitions of specific spine-related leg pain

The panel recommended the use of case definitions for specific spine-related leg pain, including the following:
(1) Somatic-referred pain
(2) Radicular pain without or with radiculopathy

The case definitions of somatic-referred pain, radicular pain, and radiculopathy have already been defined and described by Bogdukand have been incorporated into the IASP terminology. The working group in principle agreed with these case definitions and their descriptions. We collated the descriptions of each case definition and added several clarifying adjustments (Table 1, and text in italics below). Of note, the panel emphasised that differentiation of these specific case definitions needs to take place in the context of the broader clinical presentation and, ideally, a detailed clinical examination.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Tq2jn]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

If data were available for the same outcome measure from at least two trials, meta-analysis was performed using Revman v5.4. We calculated standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Random effects models with inverse variance weighting were used to account for the variability of included studies. Heterogeneity was calculated with I² statistics and interpreted as follows: 'might not be important' (0–40%), 'moderate' (30–60%), 'substantial '(50–90%), and 'considerable' (75–100%). We performed separate overall meta-analyses comparing physiotherapy interventions with control interventions for our primary outcomes of pain and disability.

We planned to perform a subgroup analysis according to type of physiotherapy interventions. However, this was impossible as interventions were too heterogeneous to pool. We performed a post hoc subgroup analysis comparing the effect of physiotherapy interventions according to the type of control intervention (minimal vs. substantial). Minimal intervention included advice/education only, GP care, or sham treatment. Substantial intervention included surgery, disc and epidural injections. Due to high risk of bias, we performed a post hoc sensitivity analysis, removing those studies where at least two parameters of risk of bias were rated as high. Results that could not be included in the meta-analysis were narratively described.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^117T9V9D]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Interlaminar epidural injections — evidence from systematic reviews and guidelines indicates mixed or limited benefit for lumbar interlaminar epidural steroid injections. Multiple systematic reviews provided negative opinions, and prior reviews reported evidence ranging from indeterminate to moderate. In 1995 Koes et al reviewed 12 trials of lumbar and caudal epidural steroid injections and reported positive results from only 6 studies, and their updated review with 15 trials again found no evidence that epidural steroid injections are effective in patients with chronic back pain without sciatica. Watts and Silagy's meta-analysis utilized 11 studies involving a total of 907 patients and concluded that pooled randomized data supported epidural corticosteroids as effective for lumbosacral radicular pain. Armon et al concluded that epidural steroid injections for radicular lumbosacral pain do not impact average functional status or provide long-term pain relief beyond 3 months and issued a negative recommendation. Parr et al found the available interlaminar literature comprised only blind injections without fluoroscopy and determined the evidence as poor, and the APS and ACOEM guidelines reported negative results or evidence for interlaminar injections except for short-term benefit in radicular pain. Rho and Tang reported strong evidence for transforaminal injections but only short-term efficacy for interlaminar and caudal approaches, while concluding that lumbar epidural steroids can be an effective tool in the conservative management of low back pain with radicular symptoms.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections in the management of sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1128dqir]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Existing guidelines and systematic reviews provide inconsistent recommendations on epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica. Key limitations of existing reviews are the inclusion of trials with active controls of unknown efficacy and failure to provide an estimate of the size of the treatment effect.

Purpose

To determine the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica compared with placebo.

Data Sources

International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL.

Study Selection

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections in participants with sciatica.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Leg pain, back pain, and disability were converted to common scales from 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst possible pain or disability). Thresholds for clinically important change in the range of 10 to 30 have been proposed for these outcomes. Effects were calculated for short-term (> 2 weeks but ≤ 3 months) and long-term (≥ 12 months) follow-up.

Data Synthesis

Data were pooled with a random-effects model, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used in summary conclusions. Twenty-five published reports (23 trials) were included. The pooled results showed a significant, although small, effect of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo for leg pain in the short term (mean difference, -6.2 [95% CI, -9.4 to -3.0]) and also for disability in the short term (mean difference, -3.1 [CI, -5.0 to -1.2]). The long-term pooled effects were smaller and not statistically significant. The overall quality of evidence according to the GRADE classification was rated as high.

Limitation

The review included only English-language trials and could not incorporate dichotomous outcome measures into the analysis.

Conclusion

The available evidence suggests that epidural corticosteroid injections offer only short-term relief of leg pain and disability for patients with sciatica. The small size of the treatment effects, however, raises questions about the clinical utility of this procedure in the target population.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^115EuZHV]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Management of sciatica varies considerably. Patients are commonly treated in primary care but a small proportion is referred to secondary care and may eventually undergo surgery if complaints remain present for at least 6 weeks. Conservative treatment for sciatica is primarily aimed at pain reduction, either by analgesics or by reducing pressure on the nerve root. There seems to be consensus that surgery is indicated in carefully selected patients for sciatica in presence of a herniated lumbar disc, or severe sciatica with serious or progressive neurologic deficits and imaging demonstrating lumbar disc herniation at the nerve root level correlating with the patient's examination findings. The primary rationale of surgery for sciatica is that surgery will relieve nerve root irritation or compression due to herniated disc material. The most common type of surgery is open microdiscectomy, surgical removal of part of the disc, performed with or without the use of an operating microscope or other magnifying tools. Other minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as endoscopic surgery have recently been developed. In the absence of serious neurologic deficits or for persistent non-radicular low back pain, consensus whether surgery is useful or not has not yet been established. Furthermore, the timing of the intervention with respect to prolonged conservative care has not been evaluated properly.

At present, several randomised trials have been published that have compared surgery with conservative treatment. The objective of this systematic review is to compare and summarise the evidence regarding the effectiveness of surgery compared with conservative treatment for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^114VnjGL]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In general, there is evidence that early surgery in patients with sciatica provides for a better short-term relief of leg pain as compared to prolonged conservative care, but the evidence is low quality because of the fact that only one trial investigated this properly. No significant differences were found between surgery and usual conservative care in any of the clinical outcomes after 1 and 2 years, but the evidence is of very low quality. The scarcity of studies as well as the limited quality of the studies does not support the choice for any timing in our current guidelines.

Future studies should evaluate who benefits more from surgery and who from conservative care. Also economic evaluations should analyse the economical gain of the potential faster recovery against increased cost and complication rate of surgery.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112unCo8]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness and safety of surgery compared with non-surgical treatment for sciatica.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to June 2022.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Randomised controlled trials comparing any surgical treatment with non-surgical treatment, epidural steroid injections, or placebo or sham surgery, in people with sciatica of any duration due to lumbar disc herniation (diagnosed by radiological imaging).

Data extraction and synthesis

Two independent reviewers extracted data. Leg pain and disability were the primary outcomes. Adverse events, back pain, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment were the secondary outcomes. Pain and disability scores were converted to a scale of 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst pain or disability). Data were pooled using a random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and certainty of evidence with the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) framework. Follow-up times were into immediate term (≤ six weeks), short term (> six weeks and ≤ three months), medium term (> three and < 12 months), and long term (at 12 months).

Results

24 trials were included, half of these investigated the effectiveness of discectomy compared with non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections (1711 participants). Very low to low certainty evidence showed that discectomy, compared with non-surgical treatment, reduced leg pain: the effect size was moderate at immediate term (mean difference −12.1 (95% confidence interval −23.6 to −0.5)) and short term (−11.7 (−18.6 to −4.7)), and small at medium term (−6.5 (−11.0 to −2.1)). Negligible effects were noted at long term (−2.3 (−4.5 to −0.2)). For disability, small, negligible, or no effects were found. A similar effect on leg pain was found when comparing discectomy with epidural steroid injections. For disability, a moderate effect was found at short term, but no effect was observed at medium and long term. The risk of any adverse events was similar between discectomy and non-surgical treatment (risk ratio 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.98)).

Conclusion

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits declined over time. Discectomy might be an option for people with sciatica who feel that the rapid relief offered by discectomy outweighs the risks and costs associated with surgery.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^112di2Ao]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Potential explanations for the results of the SCOPiC trial include the performance of the stratification algorithm in predicting referral to specialists, the natural and clinical course of sciatica symptoms in primary care, and the effectiveness of the usual care intervention. The algorithm's predictive performance in relation to referral to spinal specialists is acknowledged to be modest (C-statistic 0.70), with a sensitivity of 51%, specificity of 73%, and positive predictive value of 22%, and a number of patients fast-tracked to MRI and specialist assessment might not have needed this care pathway. Additionally, our qualitative interview data, which will be published elsewhere, highlighted that for patients with a short duration of symptoms, clinicians were reluctant to consider invasive treatments such as injections and surgery before conservative treatment options were tried first, and before sufficient time for natural improvement had passed. As mentioned previously, no factors have been consistently shown to be associated with outcome in sciatica, and thus would be useful to guide clinical decision making about early referral to spinal specialists. The stratified care model tested in this trial was designed to help with identification of patients who were likely to be referred to specialists at some point and instigating this referral early in the patient's presentation, in addition to matching the remainder of patients to conservative packages of care early on. However, the good improvement achieved by most patients in both arms, including those in sciatica group 3 who had the highest baseline levels of pain and disability (with approximately a fifth in both arms reporting recovery within 4 weeks from randomisation), is indicative of an overall favourable natural and clinical course despite the initial high pain and incapacity levels, and points to the fact that the current prognostic factors associated with outcome or with early referral to specialists are not adequately capturing the population most likely to benefit from such a treatment pathway.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^113LdhDA]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, the working group has revised the terminology of spine-related leg pain and its specific case definitions. The panel recommends discouraging use of the term "sciatica" in clinical practice and research; instead, accurate case definitions should be used. The panel, with support from the NeuPSIG membership consultation, proposes the term of "spine-related leg pain" as an umbrella term to include the case definitions of somatic-referred pain and radicular pain with and without radiculopathy. This term may help differentiate pain originating from structures in the back from those originating from nonspinal structures (eg, somatic-referred pain from the hip).

The panel also proposed an adaptation of the neuropathic pain grading system in the context of spine-related leg pain, to facilitate the identification of neuropathic pain and initiation of specific management in this patient population.

Overall, the panel highlighted that the grading system is ideally applied within and augmented by the clinical work up, rather than considered in isolation. Furthermore, the proposed recommendations should be seen as a starting point that will likely need to be reviewed and revised as new knowledge arises and a more definitive understanding emerges. Table 2 summarises the recommendations and recommended actions in research.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^113uwKUW]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Early surgery versus prolonged conservative care

One large randomised trial (n = 283) with a low risk of bias compared early surgery to prolonged conservative treatment followed by surgery if needed in patients with severe sciatica for 6–12 weeks. Of the patients, 89% randomised to early surgery underwent microdiscectomy after a mean of 2 weeks, while 39% of patients randomised to conservative treatment underwent surgery after a mean of 19 weeks. Relief of leg pain was faster for patients assigned to early surgery. Intention-to-treat analysis showed statistically significant more leg pain relief in favour of early surgery as compared with prolonged conservative care at 3 months (MD −17.70, 95% CI −23.1 to −12.3). There was no significant overall difference between the two groups in disability scores during the first year. The median time to recovery was 4.0 weeks [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.7–4.4] for early surgery and 12.1 weeks (95% CI, 9.5–14.9) for prolonged conservative treatment. During the first year, early surgery achieved a faster rate of perceived recovery with a hazard ratio of 1.97 (95% CI 1.72–2.22, P < 0.001). At 1 year of follow-up, however, 95% of patients in both treatment groups had experienced satisfactory recovery, and no subsequent differences were found. This lack of a difference between groups was maintained for the following year. In conclusion, one low-risk-of-bias study yielded a low level of evidence (GRADE) to the effect that early surgery was beneficial for pain relief as compared to prolonged conservative care in the short term, but not in the longer term with a faster recovery rate for early surgery.

### Timing of surgery for sciatica: subgroup analysis alongside a randomized trial [^1172ZxJJ]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is characterized by radiating pain in an area of the leg typically served by one lumbar or sacral spinal nerve root and is sometimes associated with sensory and motor deficit. Apart from infrequent causes, sciatica is mostly due to a herniated lumbar disc. Because of the high prevalence in general practice and the major impact of low back disorders on society, surgery is frequently performed to speed up recovery of sciatica. Probably as a result of socio-cultural circumstances, different timing of surgical removal of the herniated portion of the disc appears to vary greatly in the western countries. Recently the option of surgery was offered to patients after only 6 weeks of unremitting sciatica. The major reason to offer early surgery was the unattractive alternative: the slow natural course of sciatica, occasionally extending over 4 years. Globally two options were available: (1) early surgery and (2) prolonged conservative care, possibly with surgery at a later date. Since surgery is economically affordable and relatively safe, most patients in western countries prefer early surgery rather than to wait for months or even years, risking long term work-disability and presence of chronic pain. Recently this study provided evidence that the prolonged conservative care strategy resulted in complete recovery at 1 year as similar as the surgical strategy, but it took twice as long compared to early surgery. The 1-year effects of the two assigned treatment strategies were similar as far as function and pain were concerned in the randomized cohorts. The contribution of this study is that patients, opting for early surgery, now are able to base their decision on realistic data about the alternative strategy, with similar outcomes at 1 and 2 years compared to early surgery. Individual decisions regarding early surgery or not are still difficult to make. Since treatment effects can differ between subgroups of patients, this might influence the indication for early disc surgery.

Therefore, it would be of great interest to patients and physicians to define determinants which occur early in the course of sciatica and predict the speed of recovery with either prolonged conservative care or early surgery. Insight in these determinants may help in the decision about when to perform surgery. We carried out a subgroup analysis of data from the aforementioned randomized trial to evaluate anamnestic, neurological and radiological variables which might in theory influence the difference in rate of recovery between the two treatment strategies.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^111fahzD]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Study Design

An in-depth interview study including patients, general practitioners, neurologists and neurosurgeons.

Objective

To gain insight in decision-making in sciatica care, by identifying patients' and physicians' preferences for treatment options, and the differences between and within both groups.

Summary Of Background Data

Sciatica is a self-limiting condition, which can be treated both conservatively and surgically. The value of both options has been disputed, and the care pathway is known for a substantial amount of practice variation. Most Dutch patients are taken care of by general practitioners before they are referred to hospital-based neurologists, who might refer to a neurosurgeon, who can perform a surgical intervention. Dutch sciatica care thus follows the principles of stepped care, and a cascade of decisions precedes surgery. Better understanding of the decision-making within this cascade might reveal opportunities to improve shared decision-making and to reduce unwarranted practice variation.

Methods

Interviews with 10 patients and 22 physicians were analysed thematically.

Results

While physicians were confident of their clinical diagnosis, patients preferred confirmation trough imaging to exclude other possible explanations. Furthermore, many patients showed reluctance towards the use of (strong) opioids, while all physicians favoured this and underlined the benefits of opioids in the management of sciatica complaints, to buy time and to allow patients to recover naturally. Finally, individual physicians differed strongly in their opinion on benefits and optimal timing of surgical treatment and epidural injections.

Conclusions

Dutch sciatica care is characterised by a cascade of decisions preceding surgery. Preferences differ within and between patients and physicians, which adds to the practice variation. To improve decision-making, physicians and patients should invest not necessarily more in the exchange of options or preferences, but in making sure the other understands the rationale behind them.

### Physical therapy plus general practitioners' care versus general practitioners' care alone for sciatica: a randomised clinical trial with a 12-month follow-up [^112imvE9]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The lumbosacral radicular syndrome (LRS), also called sciatica, is a disorder with radiating pain in the leg below the knee in one or more lumbar or sacral dermatomes, and can be accompanied by phenomena associated with nerve root tension or neurological deficits. A prolapsed disc is a frequent cause of LRS, but other causes include spinal or lateral recess stenosis, tumours and radiculitis. The incidence of LRS in the Netherlands is estimated at 5 per 1,000 persons a year.

There is consensus that treatment of LRS in the first 6–8 weeks should be conservative. The exact content of the conservative treatment is, however not yet clear. After the study of Vroomen et al. bed rest is no longer regarded as a treatment option for LRS. Assessed in a recent systematic review was the effectiveness of conservative treatments of LRS. Thirty trials were included that evaluated injections (n = 14), traction (n = 9), physical therapy (PT) (n = 4), bed rest (n = 2), manipulation (n = 2), medication (n = 2) and acupuncture (n = 1) as a treatment for LRS. Because several trials indicated no evidence of an effect it is not recommended to use corticosteroid injections and traction as treatment option. Whether clinicians should prescribe PT, bed rest, manipulation or medication could not be concluded from this review. Therefore, there is no evidence that one type of conservative treatment is clearly superior to others for patients with LRS.

In an previous observational study it was shown that GPs did not adhere to the guideline regarding the referral to PT; almost half of patients with LRS were referred for PT, although this was not recommended in the guideline. No specific characteristic could be identified to explain this referral to PT. Moreover, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the effectiveness of PT in LRS. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of PT management additional to GP management compared to GP management alone, in patients with acute LRS.

### Therapeutic efficacy and the impact of the "Dose" effect of acupuncture to treat sciatica: a randomized controlled pilot study [^116zqjoi]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is a common and bothersome medical problem. It typically presents as unilateral gluteal pain that may involve one leg in association with motor or sensory disturbances. Chronic sciatica may cause personal morbidity and negatively impact an individual's quality of life (QOL). The prevalence of sciatica varies among studies, with incidences of 24–40% for different etiologies. The most common cause of sciatica is a herniated or bulging lumbar intervertebral disc. Other nondiscogenic causes that may contribute to sciatica include bony or muscular compression, vascular anomalies, and epidural adhesion. Owing to the diverse origins of sciatica, the most effective treatment for sciatica remains unknown. A recently published guideline (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE]) for treating low back pain with or without sciatica suggests administering noninvasive treatments such as physical therapy, yoga, tai chi, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for first-line management of the condition. However, the NICE guidelines do not suggest patients with sciatica receive acupuncture treatment due to the relatively low-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials.

Acupuncture has been proposed as a treatment resulting in better outcomesfor many muscular and neurological diseases such as fibromyalgia, migraines, chronic pain syndrome, and acute stroke.–Acupuncture maneuvers may elicit a sensation of "de qi" (ie, dull pain, soreness or needling sensation) to achieve analgesia: neural signals are transferred through the peripheral nociceptive pathway, leading to a central neuromodulatory effect.

Nevertheless, there are several debates surrounding acupuncture treatment because there is inadequate evidence to promote its routine use. Some clinical trials and meta-analyses have recently contributed more evidence regarding acupuncture treatment for sciatica.–He et al, in their study of post-partum sciatica, revealed that up to 98% of patients in the treatment group recovered, compared with 24% in the non-acupuncture control group. Zhang et al showed electroacupuncture had greater short- and long-term benefits for chronic discogenic sciatica than medium-frequency electrotherapy. Qiu et al also demonstrated that acupuncture may stimulate the sciatic nerve trunk and effectively relieve pain in patients with discogenic sciatica. Moreover, acupuncture may reduce sciatica pain intensity, increase the pain threshold, enhance the effects of drug, and improve outcomes. The benefits of acupuncture in treating sciatica are well known; however, the possible dose-related response has not been sufficiently explored.

ASIPP epidural guidelines — sciatica management reviews state that epidural steroid was recommended as a good intervention due to superiority in reducing ODI, with intravenous and subcutaneous anti-TNF-α identified as the optimal treatment for both acute and chronic sciatica; a systematic review and network meta-analysis by Lewis et al supported the effectiveness of epidural injections in the same line as disc surgery and nonopioid medication, and Lee et al concluded that epidural injection was strongly recommended with high degree of evidence and that the transforaminal approach was more strongly recommended than caudal approach.

### Early surgery for sciatica [^11242oAe]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Studies that evaluated plasma disc decompression and chemonucleolysis were also included, but the small number did not permit firm recommendations. Commendably, the authors carefully rated the certainty of evidence, which was low or very low. The true effect could, therefore, be markedly different from the reported estimates, allowing only weak clinical recommendations. This certainty of evidence is disappointing considering that 11 of the 12 trials evaluating discectomy were reported after the CONSORT reporting guidelines were published. The authors concluded that "discectomy might be an option for people with sciatica who feel that the rapid relief offered by discectomy outweighs the risks and costs associated with surgery".

So, does that mean that people with sciatica should be offered surgery because they will experience more rapid improvements in pain and disability compared with non-surgical interventions? As always, context is key when interpreting study findings. In this systematic review, although not specifically mentioned by the research authors, most of the trials that examined the effect of discectomy recruited patients from secondary care. According to the stepped care approach recommended by international guidelines, secondary care referral should only be initiated for people who have not responded to conservative care or have severe radicular weakness. Furthermore, to be considered for surgery, patients require a surgical indication such as a structural target on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Accordingly, this systematic review included only trials of people with discogenic sciatica diagnosed by MRI. However, only 30% of patients in secondary care have an MRI finding that matches the spinal level predicted by clinical examination and thus represents a clear surgical indication. The results of this systematic review therefore relate to a much smaller and more defined group than the heterogeneous population with sciatica encountered in community healthcare settings.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^113dV893]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ACOEM Guidelines — scope and clinical questions for invasive treatments target management of low back disorders among working-age adults and span acute (up to 1 month duration), subacute (1 to 3 months' duration), and chronic (more than 3 months' duration) clinical timeframes; covered conditions include low back pain (LBP), sciatica/radiculopathy, spondylolisthesis, facet arthrosis, degeneration of the disc, failed back surgery syndrome, and spinal stenosis, while several broad categories including congenital disorders or malignancies and specific intraoperative procedures are not addressed. Guidance is organized by treatment phase (acute, subacute, chronic, postoperative) to answer multi-part questions including when, and for what conditions invasive procedures are recommended, when, and for what conditions surgery are recommended, which surgeries are recommended for which conditions, and what management options are recommended for delayed recovery.

### The cochrane review of advice to stay active as a single treatment for low back pain and sciatica [^111G3YM5]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A systematic review was conducted within the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group.

Objectives

To assess the effects of advice to stay active as a single treatment for patients with acute low back pain or sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Low back pain is a common reason for consulting a health care provider, and advice on daily activities constitutes an important part in the primary care management of low back pain.

Methods

All randomized studies available in systematic searches (electronic databases, contact with authors, reference lists) were included. Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the validity of the included trials, and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing information.

Results

Four trials, with a total of 491 patients, were included. In all the trials, advice to stay active was compared with advice for bed rest. Two trials were assessed as having a low risk of bias, and two as having a moderate to high risk of bias. The results were heterogeneous. The results from one high-quality trial of patients with acute, simple low back pain found small differences in functional status (weighted mean difference on a 0 to 100 scale, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.5–10.5) and length of sick leave (weighted mean difference, 3.4 days; 95% CI, 1.6–5.2) in favor of staying active, as compared with advice to stay in bed 2 days. The other high-quality trial compared advice to stay active with advice to rest in bed 14 days for patients with sciatic syndrome, and found no differences between the groups. One of the high-quality trials also compared advice to stay active with advice to engage in exercises for patients with acute, simple low back pain, and found improvement in functional status and reduced sick leave in favor of advice to stay active.

Conclusion

The best available evidence suggests that advice to stay active alone has little beneficial effect for patients with acute, simple low back pain, and little or no effect for patients with sciatica. There is no evidence that advice to stay active is harmful for either acute low back pain or sciatica. Because there is no considerable difference between advice to stay active and advice for bed rest, and there are potential harmful effects of prolonged bed rest, it is reasonable to advise people with acute low back pain and sciatica to stay active. These conclusions are based on single trials.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for sciatica [^112sWKPY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most frequently prescribed drugs for the treatment of sciatica. A previous Cochrane review on the efficacy of NSAIDs summarised findings for acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) and sciatica. This is an update of the original review (2008) focusing on people suffering from sciatica.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of NSAIDs in pain reduction, overall improvement, and reported side effects in people with sciatica.

Search Methods

We performed electronic searches up to 24 June 2015 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and two trials registers. We searched reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews on the topics for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (double-blind, single-blind, and open-label) that assessed the efficacy of NSAIDs in sciatica. We included all trials that compared NSAIDs to placebo, to other NSAIDs, or to other medication. Additional interventions were allowed if there was a clear contrast for the treatment with NSAIDs in the trial.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. Where feasible we calculated pooled results using Review Manager 5.3. We reported pain relief outcomes using mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We used risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI to report global improvement of treatment, adverse effects, and additional medication. We performed a meta-analysis if possible. We assessed level of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 10 trials reported in 9 publications (N = 1651). Only one trial out of 10 was assessed at low risk of bias. Five trials used the currently recommended daily dose for the drug, and two trials used lower daily doses available over the counter. Three trials investigated NSAIDs no longer approved for human use. The follow-up duration was short in all studies but one. Three trials (n = 918) compared the effects of NSAIDs to those of placebo on pain reduction. The pooled mean difference showed comparable pain reduction (visual analogue scale, 0 to 100) in the NSAIDs and placebo groups (MD -4.56, 95% CI -11.11 to 1.99). Heterogeneity was high (I² = 82%), and the quality of the evidence was very low. When we excluded one trial with a short follow-up of eight hours, the mean difference further decreased (MD -0.09, 95% CI -9.89 to 9.71). Three trials (n = 753) compared NSAIDs to placebo regarding global improvement. We found low-quality evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo with a risk ratio of 1.14 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.27). One trial (n = 214) studied the effect of NSAIDs on disability, finding very low-quality evidence that NSAIDs are no more effective than placebo on disability. Four trials (n = 967) comparing NSAIDs to placebo reported adverse effects, with low-quality evidence that the risk for adverse effects is higher in the NSAID group than in the placebo group (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.93). The adverse effects reported in this review are consistent with those previously reported in the literature.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated systematic review including 10 trials evaluating the efficacy of NSAIDs versus placebo or other drugs in people with sciatica reports low- to very low-level evidence using the GRADE criteria. The efficacy of NSAIDs for pain reduction was not significant. NSAIDs showed a better global improvement compared to placebo. These findings must be interpreted with caution, as the level of evidence according to the GRADE classification was very low for the outcome pain reduction and low for global improvement due to small study samples, inconsistent results, imprecision, and a high risk of bias in the included trials. While the trials included in the analysis were not powered to detect potential rare side effects, we found an increased risk for side effects in the short-term NSAIDs use. As NSAIDs are frequently prescribed, the risk-benefit ratio of prescribing the drug needs to be considered.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111TFJhh]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The clinical syndrome of sciatica has been recognised since ancient times. Currently believed to arise from a disorder of the nerve root, the syndrome is known by a range of synonyms such as lumbosacral radicular syndrome, nerve root compromise, nerve root pain, and nerve root entrapment or irritation. Sciatica is considered to be a prognostic indicator of poor outcome among patients with low back painwith a substantial proportion continuing to have persistent pain for two years or longer. The annual prevalence of sciatica is estimated to be between 14%and 2%. While there are a range of definitions of sciatica, the key clinical features that can help clinicians to distinguish it from non-specific low back pain include unilateral leg pain that is worse than the low back pain, pain radiating below the knee, presence of numbness or pins and needles in a dermatomal distribution, positive results on a straight leg raise test, and weakness or reflex changes, or both, in a myotomal distribution.

Analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs are often prescribed for patients with sciatica. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica are about five times more likely to take drugs than those with low back pain only. Drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), skeletal muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, systemic corticosteroids, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. While guidelines provide clear and generally consistent recommendations for the prescription of drugs for non-specific low back pain, this is not the case for sciatica.

At present the efficacy and tolerability of commonly prescribed analgesic and adjuvant drugs for the management of patients with sciatica has not been established. The problem is that there are no reviews that specifically focus on these drugs that are used in primary care to manage sciatica. Because most guidelines recommend a course of conservative care before surgery is considered, it is imperative to understand what best practice conservative care should entail. In this systematic review we determined the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care (orally, topically, or parentally) in the management of patients with sciatica when compared with other treatment options or no treatment.

### Advice to rest in bed versus advice to stay active for acute low-back pain and sciatica [^112cdDRb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute low-back pain (LBP) is a common reason to consult a general practitioner. Debate continues on the comparative effectiveness of advice on bed rest and staying active as part of the primary care management.

Objectives

To determine the effects of advice to rest in bed or stay active for patients with acute low-back pain or sciatica.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Back Review Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport, and SCISEARCH to May 2009, reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted authors of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of the effectiveness of advice to stay active or rest in bed for patients with acute LBP or sciatica. The main outcomes were pain, functional status, recovery and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. The trials were combined qualitatively or statistically, depending on data availability and presentation.

Main Results

We included ten RCTs with varying risk of bias. For patients with acute LBP, results from two trials (N = 401) suggest small improvements in pain relief (SMD 0.22 (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.41) and functional status (SMD 0.29 (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.49) in favour of advice to stay active. For patients with sciatica, there is moderate quality evidence of little or no difference in pain relief (SMD -0.03 (95% CI: -0.24 to 0.18)) or functional status (SMD 0.19 (95% CI: -0.02 to 0.41)), between advice to rest in bed or stay active. Low quality evidence (3 RCTs, N = 931) suggests little or no difference between exercises, advice to rest in bed or stay active for patients with acute LBP. Low quality evidence (1 RCT, N = 250) suggests little or no difference between physiotherapy, advice to rest in bed or stay active for patients with sciatica. No trials that compared different ways of delivering advice.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate quality evidence shows that patients with acute LBP may experience small benefits in pain relief and functional improvement from advice to stay active compared to advice to rest in bed; patients with sciatica experience little or no difference between the two approaches. Low quality evidence suggests little or no difference between those who received advice to stay active, exercises or physiotherapy. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on the estimate of effect and is likely to change our confidence in it.

### Advice to stay active as a single treatment for low back pain and sciatica [^111neChg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain is one of the most common conditions managed in primary care. Restricted activity, rest, and symptomatic analgesics are the most commonly prescribed treatment for low back pain and sciatica.

Objectives

To assess the effects of advice to stay active as single treatment for patients with low back pain.

Search Strategy

Computerised searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Musculoskeletal Group's Trials Register and Scisearch, and scanning of reference lists from relevant articles were undertaken. Relevant studies were also traced by contacting authors. Date of the most recent searches: December 1998.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised trials or quasi-randomised trials where the study population consisted of adult patients with low back pain or sciatica, in which one comparison group was advised to stay active. The main outcomes of interest were pain, functional status, recovery and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the validity of included trials and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to collect missing data or for clarification when needed.

Main Results

Four trials, with a total of 491 patients, were included. Advice to stay active was compared to advice to rest in bed in all trials. Two trials were assessed to have low risk of bias and two to have moderate to high risk of bias. The results were heterogeneous. Results from one high quality trial of patients with acute simple LBP found small differences in functional status [Weighted Mean Difference (on a 0–100 scale) 6.0 (95% CI: 1.5, 10.5)] and length of sick leave [WMD 3.4 days (95% CI: 1.6, 5.2)] in favour of staying active compared to advice to stay in bed for two days. The other high quality trial compared advice to stay active with advice to rest in bed for 14 days for patients with sciatic syndrome, and found no differences between the groups. One of the high quality trials also compared advice to stay active with exercises for patients with acute simple LBP, and found improvement in functional status and reduction in sick leave in favour of advice to stay active.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The best available evidence suggests that advice to stay active alone has small beneficial effects for patients with acute simple low back pain, and little or no effect for patients with sciatica. There is no evidence that advice to stay active is harmful for either acute low back pain or sciatica. If there is no major difference between advice to stay active and advice to rest in bed, and there is potential harmful effects of prolonged bed rest, then it is reasonable to advise people with acute low back pain and sciatica to stay active. These conclusions are based on single trials.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114BiiLV]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Registration

The protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018103900). We are reporting our findings according to the updated guidance for the PRISMA guidance.

Search strategy

We searched the following databases from inception to 29th January 2021: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, PEDro, PubMed and Scopus. We also searched grey literature including trial registries (OpenGrey and clinicaltrials.gov). The search strategy was developed in consultation with a medical librarian and included keywords relating to sciatica, physiotherapy and randomised controlled trials (Supplemental Table 1).

Study eligibility

Included studies were randomised controlled trials evaluating physiotherapy interventions compared to a control intervention in people with 'sciatica'. Trials were eligible if study participants were diagnosed with spinally referred leg pain of neural origin. This diagnosis required at least one of the following: positive sensory, myotomal or reflex tests on neurological examination; positive neurodynamic test (e.g. straight leg raise, slump); imaging confirming spinal nerve compromise correlating with symptoms; presence of neuropathic pain determined with neuropathic pain questionnaires; electrodiagnostic testing or quantitative sensory testing suggesting nerve root involvement. Studies which either did not specify how the sciatica diagnosis was made or were simply using pain referral into the leg without other clinical tests confirming a neural component were excluded. No restrictions were made on sciatica symptom duration or intensity. Eligible trials must evaluate physiotherapy interventions such as exercise, manual therapy, physiotherapy-led education, or a combination of these. The control intervention needed to be a non-physiotherapy intervention (e.g. surgery, GP care, other non-physiotherapy care). The control intervention could also be placebo, sham or no intervention. No restrictions were made on language.

Trials that included participants with serious pathology (e.g. cancer, fracture, cauda equina), pregnant women or participants aged below 18 were excluded. Studies evaluating post-surgical physiotherapy were excluded. As recent reviews address the effectiveness of acupuncture for people with sciatica, and acupuncture is not core physiotherapy practice in many countries, trials evaluating acupuncture were excluded.

Study selection

Two reviewers (LD, GJ) screened studies independently. In a first step, titles and abstracts were screened, followed by full texts. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and arbitration by a third reviewer (AS) if required.

### Acute lumbar disk pain: navigating evaluation and treatment choices [^114L4it6]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute lumbar disk herniations are the most common cause of sciatica. After excluding emergent causes, such as cauda equina syndrome, epidural abscess, fracture, or malignancy, a six-week trial of conservative management is indicated. Patients should be advised to stay active. If symptoms persist after six weeks, or if there is worsening neurologic function, imaging and invasive procedures may be considered. Most patients with lumbar disk herniations improve over six weeks. Because there is no difference in outcomes between surgical and conservative treatment after two years, patient preference and the severity of the disability from the pain should be considered when choosing treatment modalities. If a disk herniation is identified that correlates with physical findings, surgical diskectomy may improve symptoms more quickly than continued conservative management. Epidural steroid injections can also provide short-term relief.

### Early surgery for sciatica [^111dfzmK]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

International guidelines for sciatica recommend a stepped care approach starting with conservative management (ie, physiotherapy and medication), escalating to steroid injections, then surgery when non-surgical treatment has failed or when major radicular weakness is present. Unfortunately, evidence on the effectiveness of both non-surgicaland surgical options is uncertain.

In a linked paper, Liu and colleagues (doi:) report a methodologically sound and balanced systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 randomised clinical trials evaluating the evidence of surgical care for people with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation. Their meta-analysis suggests that discectomy is statistically significantly superior to non-surgical treatment in reducing leg pain and disability. However, effects were moderate at best (10–20 point reduction on a 100 point scale), but mostly small (5–10 point reduction). The benefits of discectomy were only evident in the short to medium term, with no clinically meaningful effects beyond 12 months.

### Acute lumbar disk pain: navigating evaluation and treatment… [^113naTCY]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Imaging modalities evaluated to detect lumbar disk herniation include myelography, computed tomography, CT myelography, and MRI. 3, 14 Standard myelography and CT myelography are invasive procedures that carry more risk and are less predictive for lumbar disk herniation than standard CT or MRI. CT and MRI provide similar sensitivity and specificity for lumbar disk herniation, although MRI provides a more detailed evaluation of the nerve roots and soft tissues of the spine.
3. Studies evaluating spinal manipulation for lumbar disk herniation have had conflicting results. Although one systematic review concludes that manipulation can be safely incorporated as a component of conservative management, 27 later meta-analyses have found no benefit of manipulation over other conservative therapies. 22, 28 A subsequent study comparing manipulation with sham manipulation found that manipulation significantly improved pain.

29 More high-quality studies are needed to determine the role of spinal manipulation in the management of lumbar disk herniation. Cognitive interventions involve educating the patient to stay active and avoid activities that could worsen the pain. One study compared disability outcomes in patients with a herniated lumbar disk using cognitive intervention with exercise or surgery. No difference in disability outcomes were shown after one year of treatment; however, less fear and fewer avoidance behaviors were noted in patients given cognitive intervention.
30. Surgical Treatments The indications for emergent surgical intervention for sciatica include cauda equina syndrome, epidural abscess, or severe and progressive neuromotor deficits. Patients with no improvement after six weeks of conservative management should undergo MRI or CT.

At this point, appropriate surgical candidates include patients with persistent neuromotor deficit, or severe sciatica with a positive straight-leg-raise test and imaging demonstrating lumbar disk herniation at the nerve root level correlating with the patient's examination findings. 8, 11, 33. 11 A systematic review and a recent large randomized controlled trial show that surgical diskectomy in carefully selected patients with sciatica from lumbar disk herniation provided faster relief of pain and disability than patients who were treated with conservative management. Surgery has been shown to have greater improvement in pain and disability than conservative treatment in the first two years after surgery, after which the outcomes are no different. 11, 12. Patient Counseling The natural history of lumbar disk herniation reveals that large herniations typically reabsorb with time.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^112jSf5S]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study give insight into the critical decision-making steps in the care pathway of sciatica. The two key elements are: (1) diagnosis of the problem and (2) deciding on the type of treatment. The position that patients and their physicians took differed, also within the groups of patients and physicians.

For patients, certainty about their diagnosis was most important. They preferred the evidence of MRI. This is congruent with earlier research, which showed that patients placed much emphasis on the need for a confirmed diagnosis, as a starting point for further treatment decisions. Patients' preference for imaging is well known, although not fully understood. A systematic review of qualitative studies about patients with low back pain and sciatica concluded that for patients, imaging gives more certainty and excludes other possible explanations. The patients we interviewed experienced the first weeks of GP-led conservative treatment as mandatory waiting time before they would receive a scan for confirmation.

Physicians seldom felt that they required imaging to confirm the diagnosis. This holds especially for neurologists and neurosurgeons. This is concurrent with research that showed that 89% of Dutch neurologists only order imaging under specific circumstances, such as after a long period of pain or with an abnormal neurological exam. For 27% of these neurologists, the patient requesting for an MRI is also sufficient reason to order imaging. For physicians, the presentation of sciatica is often so recognisable that confirmation by imaging is not required. Patients find this difficult to grasp.

Among physicians, the timing of intervention was the main subject of discussion. Physicians differed strongly in their opinions about the benefits of surgical or conservative treatment, especially with regard to the timing of surgery. In the Dutch context, the neurologist appears to be the most influential decision-maker here: he or she can accelerate or delay the decision to pursue surgical treatment, and decides about the timing of involvement of the neurosurgeon. Between approximately 6 weeks and 6 months after complaints have started, patients with persisting symptoms see a neurologist, who, with the patient, drives the decision about conservative treatment or surgical intervention. Without referral to a neurosurgeon, surgery is highly unlikely within the Dutch context. Of course, neurosurgeons can delay surgery further. Yet, they are unable to make it happen earlier.

### Sciatica: what the rheumatologist needs to know [^113KCa4R]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Sciatica is a set of symptoms rather than a specific diagnosis, and is caused by a herniated lumbar disc in the vast majority of cases. The most important symptom is lower limb pain radiating below the knee and into the foot and toes. The clinical course of acute sciatica is generally favorable, with most pain and related disability improving within 2–4 weeks with or without treatment. Diagnosis mainly involves history taking and physical examination. Imaging is warranted if there is evidence of an underlying pathology other than disc herniation, such as infection or malignancy, and in patients with severe symptoms that do not improve after 6–8 weeks of conservative treatment. MRI is the preferred imaging modality, as it can visualize soft tissues better than CT and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation. Conservative treatment is generally the first-line option in patients with sciatica; however, the currently available evidence does not show any intervention — including a broad range of conservative and surgical approaches — to have clearly superior outcomes. Thus, patient preference seems to be an important factor in the clinical management of sciatica.

### Low back and radicular pain: a pathway for care developed by the British pain society [^112dHsJD]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

These consensus guidelines aim to provide an overview of best practice for managing chronic spinal pain reflecting the heterogeneity of low back pain. Most guidelines have covered only one aspect of spinal care and thus have been divisive and potentially worsened the quality of care. Additionally, some of the evidence base is subjective and of poor quality. The British Pain Society low back pain pathway has reached across all disciplines and involved input from patients. It is recognized, however, that there is an urgent need for further good-quality clinical research in this area to underpin future guidelines. Considerable work is still needed to clarify the evidence; however, foundations have been laid with this pathway. Key features include: risk stratification; clarification of intensity of psychological interventions; a logical progression for the management of sciatica; and decision points for considering structural interventions such as spinal injections and surgery.

### Surgical techniques for sciatica due to herniated disc, a systematic review [^112bomnw]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Management of sciatica that is caused by a herniated disc varies considerably. Patients are commonly treated in primary care, but a small proportion is referred to secondary care and may eventually undergo surgery if complaints persist for at least 6 weeks. Conservative treatment for sciatica is primarily aimed at pain reduction, either by analgesics or by reducing pressure on the nerve root. However, consensus is lacking as to whether surgery is useful or not in the absence of serious neurologic deficits. There seems to be consensus that surgery is indicated in carefully selected patients with sciatica and presence of a herniated lumbar disc. In most Western countries, especially in the United States, rates of spine surgery are high. The primary rationale of any form of surgery for sciatica due to herniated disc is to relieve nerve root irritation or compression, but the results should be balanced against the likely natural history and the results of conservative care. A recent systematic review indicated that surgery resulted in faster recovery when compared with conservative care, but for the longer term (12 months) no differences were found. The usual indication for surgery is to provide more rapid relief of pain and disability in the minority of patients whose recovery is unacceptably slow.

The most common type of surgery is microscopic discectomy, which is defined as surgical removal of part of the disc, performed with the use of an operating microscope or other magnifying tools. Most studies refer to Caspar, Yasargil, and Williams when discectomy is performed with a microscope; and to Foley and Smith or Greiner-Perth et al. when discectomy is performed with tubular, muscle splitting, retractor systems, and endoscope. However, some have returned to using a microscope, while retaining the less invasive muscle splitting approach of Foley and Smith. There is also uncertainty regarding the relative benefits and harms of different surgical techniques, as was concluded in the 2007 Gibson and Waddell Cochrane review on lumbar disc herniation. This review needs to be updated as several new randomized trials have come to our attention comparing surgical techniques. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of the various surgical techniques for discectomy, such as open, microscopic or tubular discectomy.

### Outcome of invasive treatment modalities on back pain and sciatica: an evidence-based review [^114HNsk8]. European Spine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Within the framework of evidence-based medicine high-quality randomised trials and systematic reviews are considered a necessary prerequisite for progress in orthopaedics. This paper summarises the currently available evidence on surgical and other invasive procedures for low back pain. Results of systematic reviews conducted within the framework of the Cochrane Back Review Group were used. Data were gathered from the latest Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2005, Issue 2. The Cochrane reviews were updated using the evidence summary on surgery and other invasive procedures from the COST B13 European Guidelines for the Management of Acute and Chronic Non-Specific Low Back Pain. Facet joint, epidural, trigger point and sclerosant injections have not clearly been shown to be effective and can consequently not be recommended. There is no scientific evidence on the effectiveness of spinal stenosis surgery. Surgical discectomy may be considered for selected patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc prolapses that fail to resolve with the conservative management. Cognitive intervention Combined with exercises is recommended for chronic low back pain, and fusion surgery may be considered only in carefully selected patients after active rehabilitation programmes during 2 years time have failed. Demanding surgical fusion techniques are not better than the traditional posterolateral fusion without internal fixation.

### Are combined conservative interventions effective in reducing pain, disability and / or global rating of pain in people with sciatica with known neuropathic pain mechanisms? [^113bsyoP]. European Spine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

National Clinical Guidelines recommend an integrated combination of conservative management strategies for sciatica. However, the efficacy of such combinations have not been established. The purpose of this systemic review with meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of combined conservative (non-pharmacological) compared to single interventions for people with sciatica with a confirmed neuropathic mechanism.

Methods

The systematic review was registered on PROSPERO CRD42023464011. The databases included were the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, PubMed, Scopus, APA PsycINFO, and grey literature sources from inception until January 2024. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of combined non-pharmacological interventions in comparison to a control intervention among individuals with sciatica of a neuropathic origin identified using diagnostic or clinical tests. Primary outcomes were back pain, leg pain, and disability. The secondary outcome was global rating of change. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment (using Cochrane ROB2) were assessed by two reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed with a random effects model with inverse variance weighting used for the metanalysis using SPSS v 29.

Results

3,370 articles were identified, of which 6 were included. Risk of bias was high in one study and had some concerns in the remaining 5 studies for each outcome measure. There was evidence of efficacy for combined interventions for back pain in the short-and long-term (SMD -0.56 (95% CI -0.91, -0.22, p = 0.01, I² = 0.2; SMD -0.44 (95% CI -0.79, -0.1, p = 0.03, I² = 0.00), and for disability in the short term (SMD -0.48 (95% CI -0.92, -0.04, p = 0.04, I² = 0.72). There was no evidence of efficacy for leg pain at any time point ((short term SMD -0.45 (95% CI -0.91, 0.02, p = 0.06, I² = 0.65), medium term (SMD -0.29 (95% CI -1.12, 0.54, p = 0.35, I² = 0.82), long term (SMD -0.40 (95% CI -1.23, 0.44, p = 0.18, I² = 0.57). Certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate.

Conclusion

There are few studies that have combined conservative (non-pharmacological) interventions for the management of sciatica with a neuropathic component pain mechanism, as recommended by National Clinical Guidelines. This review indicates that combining conservative (no-pharmacological) management strategies appeared more effective than single interventions for the outcomes of low back pain in the short and long term, and for disability in the short term, but not for leg pain at any time point. The overall low certainty of evidence, suggests that future studies with more robust methodologies are needed.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^117Bn8UZ]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, NERVES is the first randomised trial to directly compare surgical microdiscectomy with TFESI as initial invasive treatments for management of radicular pain secondary to herniated lumbar disc in patients with non-emergency presentation of sciatica with symptom duration of up to 12 months. No significant differences were found for primary or secondary outcomes, with 47 (59%) of the 80 patients in the TFESI group not receiving surgery. This study was a pragmatic trial done within the NHS, recruiting patients whose symptoms had not improved within 6 weeks of conservative management and required additional treatment. Given the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) cost-effectiveness threshold of £20 000 per QALY, and that our results reported an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £38 737 per QALY gained, it is unlikely that surgery as a first invasive treatment would be considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources, compared with TFESI. Our findings were robust to several modelling scenarios and assumptions, and indicated that incremental QALY gains did not justify the increased costs of surgery.

### Physical therapy referral from primary care for acute back pain with sciatica: a randomized controlled trial [^111KeHnR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Few studies have examined primary care management for acute sciatica, including referral to physical therapy.

Objective

To evaluate whether early referral to physical therapy reduced disability more than usual care (UC) alone for patients with acute sciatica.

Design

Randomized controlled clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02391350).

Setting

2 health care systems in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Patients

220 adults aged 18 to 60 years with sciatica of less than 90 days' duration who were making an initial primary care consultation.

Intervention

All participants received imaging and medication at the discretion of the primary care provider before enrollment. A total of 110 participants randomly assigned to UC were provided 1 session of education, and 110 participants randomly assigned to early physical therapy (EPT) were provided 1 education session and then referred for 4 weeks of physical therapy, including exercise and manual therapy.

Measurements

The primary outcome was the Oswestry Disability Index (OSW) score after 6 months. Secondary outcomes were pain intensity, patient-reported treatment success, health care use, and missed workdays.

Results

Participants in the EPT group had greater improvement from baseline to 6 months for the primary outcome (relative difference, -5.4 points [95% CI, -9.4 to -1.3 points]; P = 0.009). The OSW and several secondary outcomes favored EPT after 4 weeks. After 1 year, between-group differences favored EPT for the OSW (relative difference, -4.8 points [CI, -8.9 to -0.7 points]) and back pain intensity (relative difference, -1.0 points [CI, -1.6 to -0.4 points]). The EPT group was more likely to self-report treatment success after 1 year (45.2%) than the UC group (27.6%) (relative risk, 1.6 [CI, 1.1 to 2.4]). There were no significant differences in health care use or missed workdays.

Limitation

The patients and providers were unblinded, and specific physical therapy interventions responsible for effects could not be determined.

Conclusion

Referral from primary care to physical therapy for recent-onset sciatica improved disability and other outcomes compared with UC.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^114xvrnk]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines — comparative effectiveness of epidural injections for sciatica and chronic pain: A network meta-analysis of management strategies for sciatica reviewing 122 relevant studies and 21 treatment strategies showed a statistically significant improvement with epidural injections, and a comparative network meta-analysis found that epidural steroid with local anesthetic was superior to epidural steroid without local anesthetic and to intramuscular steroid; subcutaneous antitumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) was superior to epidural local spinal anesthetic at reducing pain, but epidural steroids produced superior reductions in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores compared to subcutaneous anti-TNF-α. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reported after review of 73 trials that adding corticosteroids to local anesthetic had only small benefits with a potential for harm and no meaningful improvement in pain scores or duration of pain relief, and the authors recommended that clinical decisions should consider the potential for harm with steroids and the therapeutic benefit by the local anesthetic alone; additionally, a prior systematic review of 4 randomized trials was rated very low in methodologic quality, and despite numerous systematic reviews there have not been guidelines systematically developed to assess clinical and cost effectiveness of epidural injections, including percutaneous adhesiolysis, in managing spinal pain.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^115dZYyK]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The term sciatica describes symptoms of pain radiating from the low back to the legs, and it can be associated with sensory and motor deficits. Occasionally, patients only have leg pain with no associated back pain. A prolapsed disc causing compression of lumbar spinal nerve roots is the most common cause of sciatica. Sciatica has a substantial impact on patients and constitutes a considerable health-care, social, and economic burden.

As in many countries, most patients with sciatica in the UK are managed in primary care. For most patients, especially those with a short symptom duration, usual care comprises mostly a stepped-care approach, starting with conservative interventions such as advice, medications, and physiotherapy, with those patients who show no improvement eventually being offered imaging, specialist assessment, and consideration of suitability for invasive treatments (eg, injections or surgery). A longer symptom duration of sciatica is related to worse outcomes following both conservative and surgical treatment. In the absence of a systematic way to identify patients who might need more support in their care, including a referral to specialists for consideration of more invasive treatments, there is considerable variation in practice. The current, mainly stepped care, approach means that most patients have to show no improvement with previous interventions before being considered for further treatments, resulting in delays in referral to spinal specialists.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed up to Dec 31, 2013, with the search terms "stratified care", "sciatica", and "radiculopathy". The search was restricted to English language publications. We found no previous trials of stratified care for patients with sciatica before undertaking our study. Therefore, no systematic review was possible. The evidence considered came from previous research on prognostic stratified care for patients with non-specific lower back pain (STarT Back and IMPaCT Back studies) and a cohort of patients with sciatica (ATLAS study) in the primary care setting, from which we examined the factors predicting referral of patients to specialist spinal services. These previous studies shaped the development of the stratification algorithm (previously published) that was tested in this trial.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VyQ8n]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Although the knowledge of evidence about surgery has changed in the past decade, we still do not know much about a simpler conservative treatment such as pharmacological interventions for sciatica. A recent clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Societyrecommends that surgery should be considered as a treatment option for persistent and disabling radicular pain caused by a herniated lumbar disc. This recommendation relies on moderate short term benefits from large randomised clinical trials such as those by Peul et aland Weinstein et al, with 283 and 501 patients randomised, respectively. At present, there is a limited number of mainly small trials of pharmacological interventions with typically short term follow-up. For example, the evidence to support the use of anticonvulsants in chronic sciatica arises from a single trial with only 50 participants.

Our principal finding is that there is insufficient evidence to confidently guide the use of any analgesic or adjuvant pain medicine for the effective management of pain and disability in patients with sciatica. Until this changes, we would advise clinicians treating such patients who exhibit clinical features of neuropathic pain to consider evidence based guidelines for neuropathic painand for other patients with sciatica to consider therapeutic recommendations from current guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116avvRN]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, in patients with clinically diagnosed sciatica, physiotherapy interventions trialed to date provide inadequate evidence to make specific recommendations on their effectiveness in reducing pain or disability. The lack of convincing evidence may be due to several factors including incomplete trial reporting, clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity, and trials lacking high methodological quality. Rather than continuing to perform trials in the heterogeneous population of 'sciatica', future studies should focus on reducing clinical heterogeneity, using contemporary physiotherapy interventions and high methodological quality to hopefully end the roadblock of discovery on the most effective physiotherapy interventions for these patient populations.

Radicular pain algorithm — epidural injection evidence and next steps note that disc protrusion, herniation, and prolapse resulting in sciatica are seen in less than 5% of patients with low back pain; patients non-responsive to epidural injections will require either mechanical disc decompression, percutaneous adhesiolysis, or implantation of a spinal cord stimulator or intrathecal infusion systems depending on clinical factors, and there is good evidence for caudal, lumbar interlaminar, and lumbar transforaminal epidural injections in managing radicular pain or disc herniation, while the evidence is fair for these approaches in managing spinal stenosis.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^115dJ6rf]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Results

Four steps in the care process proved relevant for the clinical pathway of patients. These were uncertainty about the diagnosis, analgesia, epidural injections and surgery. Patients and physicians differed in opinion on the subjects of a certain diagnosis and analgesia. They had relatively similar opinions with respect to the different treatment options. Different options existed on the topic of surgical treatment, within both the group of patients as well as the group of physicians. A summary of the positions of patients and physicians on the four steps is presented in table 3.

Table 3
A summary of the perspectives of patients and physicians on the four main topics

Certainty and diagnosis

After the onset of sciatica, two prominent decisions or conflicts appear, concerning (1) diagnosing sciatica and the need for MRI-imaging to confirm the diagnosis and (2) the appropriate timing for referral to the hospital. Physicians felt confident about diagnosing sciatica, although the GPs mentioned that they sometimes doubted their diagnosis. They would discuss such doubts with their patients and generally would wait to see how symptoms developed. GPs acknowledged that their first objective in patients with subjected sciatica is to help the patient through the first period of pain and restricted mobility, rather than to determine the 'true' diagnosis rapidly. When patients did not improve, or pushed for referral, GPs would refer to a neurologist earlier than the 6–8 weeks suggested in the guideline. However, because of waiting lists, these patients often waited a few weeks before a specialist was available, and the total duration of complaints generally exceeded 6 weeks.

Patients understood the 6–8 weeks of conservative treatment by the GP as mandatory 'waiting time', after which their diagnosis would be confirmed by a specialist and with an MRI scan. When a neurologist deemed the scan to be unnecessary, patients were disappointed. Physicians were conscious of such patient expectations. Some kept refusing, others gave in:

Sometimes you notice within a minute that whatever you say, it won't matter.… And in such cases you can say 'according to the guideline you are not entitled to a scan'. But I am not treating the guideline, I am treating the patient. In my experience, if you do not refer such a patient for a scan, if you do not manage to get the patient to understand, and you kind of quarrel with the patient, next month you will receive information from another hospital and they'll have made the scan.

### Bed rest for acute low-back pain and sciatica [^116CJmkP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Low-back pain (LBP) is a common reason for consulting a general practitioner, and advice on daily activities is an important part of the primary care management of low-back pain.

Objectives

To assess the effects of advice to rest in bed for patients with acute LBP or sciatica.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Back Group Specialized Registry, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport, and SCISEARCH to March 2003, reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted authors of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or controlled clinical trials with quasi-randomisation (alternate allocation, case record numbers, dates of birth, etc.), in any language, where the effectiveness of advice to rest in bed was evaluated. The main outcomes of interest were pain, functional status, recovery and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the internal validity of included trials and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing information.

Main Results

Eleven trials (1963 patients) were included in this updated version. There is high quality evidence that people with acute LBP who are advised to rest in bed have a little more pain [Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) 0.22 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.02, 0.41)] and a little less functional recovery [SMD 0.29 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.45)] than those advised to stay active. For patients with sciatica, there is moderate quality evidence of little or no difference in pain [SMD -0.03 (95% CI: -0.24, 0.18)] or functional status [SMD 0.19 (95% CI: -0.02, 0.41)] between bed rest and staying active. For patients with acute LBP, there is moderate quality evidence of little or no difference in pain intensity or functional status between bed rest and exercises. For patients with sciatica, there is moderate quality evidence of little or no difference in pain intensity between bed rest and physiotherapy, but small improvements in functional status [Weighted Mean Difference 6.9 (on a 0–100 scale) (95% CI: 1.09, 12.74)] with physiotherapy. There is moderate quality evidence of little or no difference in pain intensity or functional status between two to three days and seven days of bed rest.

Reviewers' Conclusions

For people with acute LBP, advice to rest in bed is less effective than advice to stay active. For patients with sciatica, there is little or no difference between advice to rest in bed and advice to stay active. There is little or no difference in the effect of bed rest compared to exercises or physiotherapy, or seven days of bed rest compared with two to three.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^114RJocf]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Study design

An in-depth interview study including patients, general practitioners, neurologists and neurosurgeons.

Objective

To gain insight in decision-making in sciatica care, by identifying patients' and physicians' preferences for treatment options, and the differences between and within both groups.

Summary of background data

Sciatica is a self-limiting condition, which can be treated both conservatively and surgically. The value of both options has been disputed, and the care pathway is known for a substantial amount of practice variation. Most Dutch patients are taken care of by general practitioners before they are referred to hospital-based neurologists, who might refer to a neurosurgeon, who can perform a surgical intervention. Dutch sciatica care thus follows the principles of stepped care, and a cascade of decisions precedes surgery. Better understanding of the decision-making within this cascade might reveal opportunities to improve shared decision-making and to reduce unwarranted practice variation.

Methods

Interviews with 10 patients and 22 physicians were analysed thematically.

Results

While physicians were confident of their clinical diagnosis, patients preferred confirmation trough imaging to exclude other possible explanations. Furthermore, many patients showed reluctance towards the use of (strong) opioids, while all physicians favoured this and underlined the benefits of opioids in the management of sciatica complaints, to buy time and to allow patients to recover naturally. Finally, individual physicians differed strongly in their opinion on benefits and optimal timing of surgical treatment and epidural injections.

Conclusions

Dutch sciatica care is characterised by a cascade of decisions preceding surgery. Preferences differ within and between patients and physicians, which adds to the practice variation. To improve decision-making, physicians and patients should invest not necessarily more in the exchange of options or preferences, but in making sure the other understands the rationale behind them.

### Surgery or physical activity in the management of sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115bRoxp]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Previous reviews have compared surgical to non-surgical management of sciatica, but have overlooked the specific comparison between surgery and physical activity-based interventions.

Methods

Systematic review using MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase and PEDro databases was conducted. Randomised controlled trials comparing surgery to physical activity, where patients were experiencing the three most common causes of sciatica-disc herniation, spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis. Two independent reviewers extracted pain and disability data (converted to a common 0–100 scale) and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. The size of the effects was estimated for each outcome at three different time points, with a random effects model adopted and the GRADE approach used in summary conclusions.

Results

Twelve trials were included. In the short term, surgery provided better outcomes than physical activity for disc herniation: disability [WMD -9.00 (95% CI -13.73, -4.27)], leg pain [WMD -16.01 (95% CI -23.00, -9.02)] and back pain [WMD -12.44 (95% CI -17.76, -7.09)]; for spondylolisthesis: disability [WMD -14.60 (95% CI -17.12, -12.08)], leg pain [WMD -35.00 (95% CI -39.66, -30.34)] and back pain [WMD -20.00 (95% CI -24.66, -15.34)] and spinal stenosis: disability [WMD -11.39 (95% CI -17.31, -5.46)], leg pain [WMD, -27.17 (95% CI -35.87, -18.46)] and back pain [WMD -20.80 (95% CI -25.15, -16.44)]. Long-term and greater than 2-year post-randomisation results favoured surgery for spondylolisthesis and stenosis, although the size of the effects reduced with time. For disc herniation, no significant effect was shown for leg and back pain comparing surgery to physical activity.

Conclusion

There are indications that surgery is superior to physical activity-based interventions in reducing pain and disability for disc herniation at short-term follow-up only; but high-quality evidence in this field is lacking (GRADE). For spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis, surgery is superior to physical activity up to greater than 2 years follow-up. Results should guide clinicians and patients when facing the difficult decision of having surgery or engaging in active care interventions. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42013005746.

### Bertolotti syndrome in the pediatric population: a literature review and management algorithm [^115wmtdD]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcomes and Follow-Up

The outcomes for both conservative and surgical treatments of Bertolotti syndrome in pediatric patients were generally positive. Most patients who underwent surgical resection achieved complete symptom relief at the last recorded follow-up, usually a few months to up to two years. The two pediatric patients who underwent posterior fusion also had overall favorable outcomes, although one patient continued to experience symptoms like bilateral sciatica and moderate disability despite no LBP at 9-year follow-up. For those treated conservatively, many reported pain relief and resumed normal activities or sports. However, the follow-up periods were variable and the presence of residual symptoms in some cases highlight the need for long-term monitoring. Although specific rehabilitation protocols were not uniformly described, most patients were encouraged to progressively resume activity, with emphasis on core strengthening and postural training. Return to sports was reported as early as 6 weeks postoperatively. While prior research indicates positive surgical outcomes for Bertolotti syndrome, there is a lack of robust studies in both adult and pediatric populations to conclusively compare the efficacy of surgical versus conservative treatments.

Treating Bertolotti syndrome in children requires a personalized approach, balancing conservative treatments with timely surgery when needed. Understanding the unique presentation of the condition in children can lead to more effective management and better patient outcomes. More research is essential to refine treatment plans and diagnostic criteria, ensuring that children with this condition get the most appropriate and effective care.

### Cost-effectiveness of different strategies to manage patients with sciatica [^1153ozow]. Pain (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this paper is to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of treatment regimens for managing patients with sciatica. A deterministic model structure was constructed based on information from the findings from a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, published sources of unit costs, and expert opinion. The assumption was that patients presenting with sciatica would be managed through one of 3 pathways (primary care, stepped approach, immediate referral to surgery). Results were expressed as incremental cost per patient with symptoms successfully resolved. Analysis also included incremental cost per utility gained over a 12-month period. One-way sensitivity analyses were used to address uncertainty. The model demonstrated that none of the strategies resulted in 100% success. For initial treatments, the most successful regime in the first pathway was nonopioids, with a probability of success of 0.613. In the second pathway, the most successful strategy was nonopioids, followed by biological agents, followed by epidural/nerve block and disk surgery, with a probability of success of 0.996. Pathway 3 (immediate surgery) was not cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses identified that the use of the highest cost estimates results in a similar overall picture. While the estimates of cost per quality-adjusted life year are higher, the economic model demonstrated that stepped approaches based on initial treatment with nonopioids are likely to represent the most cost-effective regimens for the treatment of sciatica. However, development of alternative economic modelling approaches is required.

### Non-invasive and minimally invasive management of low back disorders [^116mGESa]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Low back algorithm — evaluation of subacute, chronic, or slow‑to‑recover low back pain begins with "Patients with activity limitations due to low back symptoms not improving or slow to resolve over 4 to 6 weeks". If there are no "Neurologic symptoms in lower limbs?" and symptoms are "Primarily low back symptoms", then "Evaluate for specific suspected conditions, especially AP/lateral x-rays. Consider also urinalysis, CBC, ESR, bone scan, hepatic enzymes, amylase". If "Test results positive?" and not "Age-related changes only?", then "Evaluate as indicated", with disposition "Exit Algorithm or Go to Algorithm 6 if chronic back-related disorder"; if either "Age-related changes only?" or tests are negative, "Go to Algorithm 5". If neurologic symptoms are present, assess whether "Significant (e.g., limiting work ability) sciatica present > 4 weeks?"; if not, "Go to Algorithm 2". If yes, determine "Obvious level of nerve root dysfunction on physical exam?"; if not, obtain "EMG. For new radicular pain, wait at least 3 weeks from onset". If there is "Evidence of nerve dysfunction on EMG?", then "Consult and/or choose CT or MRI to define nerve root compression". If there is "Physiologic and anatomic evidence of nerve root compression?", proceed to "Go to Algorithm 4"; if not, "Go to Algorithm 5". The figure caption clarifies scope as "evaluation of subacute, chronic, or slow-to-recover patients with low back pain unimproved or slow to improve (symptoms > 4 weeks)".

### Survey of acute low back pain management by specialty group and practice experience [^117S3ghY]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to explore concurrence with evidence-based management of acute back pain by primary care specialty and years in practice groups.

Methods

Participants randomly selected from five American Medical Association physician groups were surveyed asking their initial care recommendations for case scenarios with and without sciatica. Response differences were compared among groups and with the Agency for Health Research Quality's guideline.

Results

Response rate was 25%. Emergency physicians were least likely to order diagnostic studies for both cases but more often made recommendations likely to promote inactivity. Occupational physicians were less likely to order diagnostic studies and more likely choose treatments conducive to increasing activity. The longer physicians were in practice, the less likely they were to follow recommendations. All specialty groups selected more nonevidence-based interventions for the patient with sciatica. General practitioners were least likely to follow the guidelines in either case.

Conclusions

Despite widespread dissemination of acute low back pain guidelines, the study suggests a lack of adherence by certain primary care groups, physicians with more practice experience, and in specific areas of management.

### Do not routinely offer imaging for uncomplicated low back pain [^112sULD9]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

The clinical problem

The past two decades have seen a paradigm shift in the way we use imaging when managing low back pain (LBP). Imaging was once a routine part of the diagnostic workup for most cases of LBP. Evidence now indicates that imaging is useful only in the small subgroup of patients for whom there is suspicion of red flag conditions. These conditions include cancer, infection, inflammatory disease, fracture, and severe neurological deficits — which together account for only 5–10% of LBP presentations in primary care. For the remaining 90–95% of LBP cases (called non-specific or uncomplicated LBP), imaging will not guide management and can cause more harm than benefit. International guidelinesand "Choosing Wisely" campaigns now encourage a diagnostic triage approach to identify those patients who require imaging (box 1). Given these advances in knowledge, imaging rates for LBP should be decreasing, but recent systematic reviews show the opposite, reporting that imaging has increased over the past 20 yearsand that at least a third of all images are unnessary.

Box 1
"Choosing Wisely" statements from different countries related to avoiding the use of routine imaging for low back pain

"Don't routinely image patients with low back pain regardless of the duration of symptoms unless: (a) there are clinical reasons to suspect serious underlying pathology (i.e. red flags), or (b) imaging is necessary for the planning and/or execution of a particular evidenced-based therapeutic intervention on a specific spinal condition". — Canadian Spine Society, Choosing Wisely Canada
"Do not undertake imaging for low back pain in patients without indications of a serious underlying condition". — Australian Rheumatology Association, Choosing Wisely Australia
"Do not routinely offer imaging in a non-specialist setting for people with low back pain with or without sciatica. Consider imaging in specialist settings of care (for example, a musculoskeletal interface clinic or hospital) for people with low back pain with or without sciatica only if the result is likely to change management". — Royal College of Physicians, Choosing Wisely UK

### The efficacy of systematic active conservative treatment for patients with severe sciatica: a single-blind, randomized, clinical, controlled trial [^112Vkh5t]. Spine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective single-blind, randomized, clinical, controlled trial.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of active conservative treatment and to compare 2 active conservative treatment programs for patients with severe sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Reviews have demonstrated little or no efficacy for passive conservative treatment modalities in patients suffering from sciatica. The results for surgery are conflicting. Cohort studies have shown excellent results for active treatment modalities in patients with sciatica.

Methods

One hundred eighty-one consecutive patients with radicular pain below the knee were examined at the baseline, at 8 weeks, and at 1 year after the treatment. Participants were randomized into 2 groups: (1) symptom-guided exercises + information + advice to stay active and (2) sham exercises + information + advice to stay active. Symptom-guided exercises consisted of a variety of back-related exercises given in accordance with a written algorithm in which symptoms or response to exercises determined the exercises given (http://www.sygehuslillebaelt.dk/wm345075, click exercises). Sham exercises were optional, designed to increase general blood circulation, and had no targeted effect on the back. The information was comprehensive and included anatomy, pathogenesis, and how discs heal without surgery. The advice included encouragement to stay as active as possible but to reduce activity if leg pain increased. The use of medication was optional, but only paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were recommended.

Results

A mean of 4.8 treatment sessions were provided. All patients experienced statistically significant and clinically important improvements in global assessment, functional status, pain, vocational status, and clinical findings. The symptom-guided exercise group improved significantly more than the sham exercise group in most outcomes.

Conclusion

Active conservative treatment was effective for patients who had symptoms and clinical findings that would normally qualify them for surgery. Although participating patients had greater faith in the sham exercises before treatment, the symptom-guided exercises were superior for most outcomes.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113UAS6C]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits over non-surgical care reduced over time. Discectomy might be an option for people who require rapid leg pain relief and disability improvement, when the benefits outweigh the risks and costs related to surgery.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^112GDcim]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

There is considerable uncertainty about the clinical effectiveness of epidurals in sciatica compared with surgery for treatment of herniated lumbar disc. However, transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI), a newer and more precise treatment option, offered promise given that it can deliver the drug in a closer proximity to the site of pathology. We searched PubMed using the term "sciatica epidural steroid" immediately before the initial development of the NERVES protocol in 2013–14 and found that previous evidence supporting TFESI had come from cohort studies or single-centre studies, without clear specification of the non-surgical treatments provided. A meta-analysis from 2015 suggested that non-opioid analgesia, TFESI, and surgery were effective management options for sciatica secondary to uncomplicated herniated lumbar disc. However, the effectiveness of TFESI compared with surgery for herniated lumbar disc was uncertain, leading to wide variation in management guidelines for this common condition.

Added value of this study

NERVES is the first multicentre randomised trial directly comparing surgical microdiscectomy with TFESI on a 1:1 allocation basis as initial invasive treatment for sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc. There was no significant difference between TFESI and surgery pathways in clinical outcome, and surgery is unlikely to be a cost-effective alternative to TFESI. Complications of surgery were significant, offsetting any benefits of surgery as an early treatment, whereas only minor adverse events were seen with TFESI.

Implications of all the available evidence

NERVES provides high-quality evidence for a stepwise treatment framework of uncomplicated sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc with symptom duration of up to 12 months. TFESI would be less costly as an initial alternative to surgery for this condition, while achieving similar levels of improved outcomes.

### Advice to stay active or structured exercise in the management of sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116mLF2P]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Objective

To evaluate the evidence on comparative effectiveness of advice to stay active versus supervised structured exercise in the management of sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Conservative management of sciatica usually includes interventions to promote physical activity in the form of advice to stay active or exercise, but there has been no systematic review directly comparing the effectiveness of these 2 approaches.

Methods

Data Sources included MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PEDro databases. Studies were randomized controlled trials comparing advice with exercise. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Pain and disability data were extracted for all time points and converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. Data were pooled with a random effects model for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-ups. The GRADE approach was used to summarize the strength of evidence.

Results

Five trials were included in the meta-analysis, which showed a significant, although small effect favoring exercise over advice for reducing leg pain intensity in the short term (weighted mean difference: 11.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.71–22.16]) but no difference for disability (weighted mean difference: 1.45 [95% confidence interval, -2.86 to 5.76]). Furthermore, there was no difference at intermediate and long-term follow-ups between advice and exercise for patient-relevant outcomes.

Conclusion

There is low-quality evidence (GRADE) that exercise provides small, superior effects compared with advice to stay active on leg pain in the short term for patients experiencing sciatica. However, there is moderate-quality evidence showing no difference between advice to stay active and exercise on leg pain and disability status in people with sciatica in the long term.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114fgkNq]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Risk of bias and certainty of evidence

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias (selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting bias) of included trials using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We assessed funding and conflict of interest statements as part of assessing other bias (eg, industry funded trials without declaration of investigator autonomy was judged to be at high risk; supplemental file 11). We rated the certainty of evidence for each of the outcomes by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework. For each GRADE domain, the quality of evidence was downgraded by one level if a serious flaw was present, that is: risk of bias (> 25% of participants in this comparison were from studies at high risk of bias (supplemental file 3), inconsistency (substantial unexplained interstudy heterogeneity, I² > 50), imprecision (95% confidence interval were 20 points different to the point estimates), and, and small study effects (> 25% of participants were from small studies (< 100 participants per arm)). Certainty of evidence was rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. Any discrepancies between the evaluation of risk of bias and certainty of evidence were resolved through consensus, or, when required, by arbitration with a third reviewer.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115wPE3n]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Apart from the possibility that physiotherapy is indeed not effective for patients with sciatica, there are multiple possible reasons for the lack of evidence. The physiotherapy interventions used in the 11 trials comparing physiotherapy with substantial interventions are not all considered contemporary in line with current clinical guidelines. This is a reflection of a lack of recent physiotherapy trials, with only four of the 11 studies published in the last decade. Current clinical guidelines recommend group exercise and continuation of normal activities; however, bedrest was a component of the conservative treatment arm in two trials. The UK NICE Guidelines find no evidence supporting the use of corsets or belts, but these were a core component in another trial conducted before publication of these guidelines. The physiotherapy interventions are highly heterogeneous and remain unclear in several studies. The Bailey study leaves physiotherapy interventions at the discretion of the treating clinician, and the Peul study refers people to physiotherapy only if they are fearful of movement, leaving uncertainty about how many participants in those trials had active physiotherapy treatment. It could also be argued that patients deemed suitable for surgery are likely to represent a specific subgroup that may be less amenable to physiotherapeutic interventions (e.g. with intractable pain or neurological deficit). Indeed, two trials comparing physiotherapy interventions with surgery included patients who had already failed conservative treatment, raising serious concerns that physiotherapy interventions could possibly succeed in such a population.

A further challenge to progress in treatment is the diagnosis of sciatica itself. There is no agreed definition for sciatica, reflected in the wide range of definitions used in clinical trials, including our review. The broad term 'sciatica' comprises radiculopathy, radicular pain, or somatic referred pain. The differing patient populations bring clinical heterogeneity to most meta-analyses. Unfortunately, the high heterogeneity among studies reduces the confidence in our results. Together with previous systematic reviews with inconclusive findings, our results question the value of continuing to perform clinical trials in heterogeneous groups of patients. Although subgrouping according to risk stratification showed promise in the management of people with non-specific low back pain, this has failed in patients with sciatica. Subgrouping using a mechanism-based approach shows promising signals in patients with neuropathic pain of different aetiologies, but has yet to be examined in sciatica.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^114bbydk]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

A model of stratified care for patients consulting with non-specific low back pain, which uses a stratification tool to identify their risk of disability related to persistent back pain in order to match patients to appropriate treatments, has previously been shown to be both clinically and cost-effective in the UK National Health Service (NHS). There is insufficient evidence as to whether a similar approach specifically for patients presenting with sciatica in primary care could be beneficial.

A key challenge in the development of predictive and stratified care models for patients with sciatica is the scarce and inconsistent evidence for prognostic factors independently associated with outcome. To date, it has not been possible to predict which patients might benefit from surgery. An alternative stratification method is to test whether predicting and instigating early referral to spinal specialists improves outcomes compared to clinical care based on clinical judgement alone. We developed an adapted stratified care algorithm specifically for patients with sciatica presenting in primary care. Briefly, the algorithm combines information about the risk (low, medium, or high) of persistent disability (using the STarT Back tool; appendix p 9) with clinical criteria (current leg pain, pain below knee, interference with work or home activities, and objective sensory deficits) associated with referral to spinal specialist services, to allocate patients into one of three groups that are each matched to a care pathway. Patients at low risk of poor outcome, irrespective of clinical characteristics, are allocated to group 1 and are offered up to two sessions with a physiotherapist for brief support with self-management; patients at medium risk of poor outcome who have all four clinical characteristics, and patients at high risk of poor outcome with any three of the clinical characteristics, are allocated to group 3 with a matched care pathway of fast-track to MRI and referral to a spinal specialist; the remainder of patients are allocated to group 2 and offered up to six sessions of physiotherapy. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the algorithm for patient allocation to group 3 have been previously reported; sensitivity was 51%, specificity 73%, and the positive predictive value was 22% (C-statistic 0.70). Details of the matched care pathways for each sciatica group have been previously reported in our published protocol. The SCOPiC trial investigated whether this stratified care model led to faster resolution of sciatica symptoms compared with non-stratified usual care, and whether this approach was cost-effective. The linked qualitative interviews with patients and clinicians, exploring their views and experiences of the fast-track care pathway tested in the trial, will be reported separately.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^1113d9HE]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Potential participants were identified by electronic pop-up computer prompts in general practice computer systems triggered by appropriate diagnostic or symptom codes, or by weekly reviews of practice consultation records. Potentially eligible participants were sent information about the SCOPiC research clinic and the trial, and were invited to telephone an administrator to make an appointment at the SCOPiC research clinic to see a physiotherapist. Full eligibility screening and baseline assessments, including identification of each patient's sciatica group according to the stratification algorithm, were done at the research clinic by study physiotherapists.

Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica of any severity and duration following clinical assessment by a physiotherapist in the research clinics, had access to a mobile phone or landline, were not receiving treatment nor had received treatment in the last 3 months for the same problem, were not pregnant, and had no previous lumbar spine surgery. Patients with clinical suspicion (by their general practitioner [GP] or the assessing physiotherapist) of serious spinal pathology (eg, cauda equina syndrome, fracture, spondyloarthropathy, malignancy, infection, or foot drop) or serious physical or mental co-morbidities (as judged by their GP or the assessing physiotherapist) were excluded. The sciatica case definition for this trial was based on the assessing physiotherapist being at least 70% confident in their clinical diagnosis, with at least one of the following being present: leg pain approximating a dermatomal distribution; leg pain worse than or as bad as back pain; leg pain worse with coughing, sneezing, or straining; subjective sensory changes approximating a dermatomal distribution; objective neurological deficits indicative of nerve root compression; positive neural tension test;, and (specifically for spinal claudication or spinal stenosis) leg pain worse with weight-bearing activities and better with sitting. Assessing physiotherapists recorded a specific clinical diagnosis of sciatica due to disc prolapse or stenosis.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1117vs3T]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Implications for clinical practice and policy

International guidelines generally recommend surgical treatment for sciatica secondary to lumbar disc herniation if patients have not responded to comprehensive non-surgical treatment. These recommendations are because many people with acute sciatica will have improvements in their condition over time. Generally, our review supports these recommendations because non-surgical treatment was shown to be able to lead to similar outcomes at long term or even longer follow-ups. However, benefits could vary among different groups of people with sciatica. Attempts have been made to specify who might benefit more from early discectomy for people with sciatica. People with more severe pain in their leg and disability were shown to be more likely to have persistent and debilitating symptoms at 12 months. Thus, this subgroup might benefit from early discectomy because our review has shown that surgical treatment might lead to faster leg pain reduction. Added to that is the evidence that early discectomy is cost effective compared with prolonged non-surgical treatment in the context of the Dutch health system. These findings challenge the notion that non-surgical treatment should always be the first line treatment for sciatica. In people with sciatica who regard rapid pain relief as an important treatment goal, and who feel that the benefits of discectomy outweigh the risks and costs, discectomy could be an early management option.

As a result of the treatment's invasive nature and the substantial costs of surgery, we would encourage clinicians to discuss with their patients that discectomy can provide rapid relief of leg pain, but that non-surgical treatment can achieve similar results, although at a slower pace and with a potential chance of requiring delayed surgery if they do not respond to non-surgical treatment.

Future research

Although discectomy is widely used, the certainty of evidence supporting its use is only low to very low. All trials evaluating discectomy were not blinded and had high crossover rates. Evidence on plasma disc decompression and chemonucleolysis is limited by the low number of studies and small sample sizes. Large placebo controlled trials evaluating surgical treatment for sciatica have the potential to advance this field. However, the use of placebo controls in surgical trials has challenges. Furthermore, investigations into which group of people with sciatica are likely to benefit from early surgery is also key for clinicians to make individualised recommendations.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112HhBPd]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

We grouped the studies by surgical procedures. Then, within each surgical procedure, comparators were grouped as non-surgical (non-pharmacological or pharmacological) treatment, epidural steroid injections, and placebo or sham surgery (eg, intradiscal injection of saline solution). We presented discectomy as the primary surgical procedure because this procedure is most widely used for sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

Where appropriate, we converted continuous pain and disability outcomes to a common 0–100 scale (0 represents no pain or disability, 100 represents worst pain or disability) (supplemental files 3–5). We pooled data where possible, reported continuous outcomes as mean difference and 95% confidence intervals, and reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Statistical heterogeneity was determined with the I² test. A random effects model was used for all pooled comparisons.

Rather than selecting an arbitrary minimum clinically important threshold, we adopted a system of reporting consistent with the recommendations from the American College of Physicians' 2017 guidelines for low back pain. For pain and disability measured on a 0–100 point scale, an effect size of 5–10 points was considered small, 10–20 points moderate, and more than 20 points large. After reviewing the data, we considered effect size below 5 to be negligible.

Subgroup and exploratory meta-regression

We conducted preplanned subgroup analyses of our estimates of treatment effect (leg pain and disability) at each follow-up time to explore the influence of mean duration of symptom (< 3 months or > 3 months), approach of discectomy (micro or open). We also did post hoc subgroup analyses to explore the influence of analgesics in the comparator group (yes or no), small study effects (< 100 participants in each arm), and unsuccessful non-surgical treatment (yes or no).

We performed univariate meta-regression analyses of difference of means (leg pain and disability) on year of publication, duration of symptom, and sample size as continuous variables, in the comparison of discectomy versus non-surgical treatment across all time points.

Patient and public involvement

Due to the lack of funding, patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, or reporting of this study.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^113yXFzx]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Herniated lumbar disc resulting in back and leg pain travelling below the knee, sciatica, or radiculopathy is a worldwide burden to society. The condition affects an estimated 11% of patients presenting to their primary-care provider worldwide, with an annual prevalence estimated to be 2.2%. Generally, outcomes are favourable and 80% of patients improve with conservative care within 12–24 months. However, given that patients affected by this condition are typically aged 40–45 years, there is a risk of loss of livelihood if it is not managed promptly.

Treatment options have been considered by various expert-led guidelines, but no consensus exists for transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) due to a scarcity of class I evidence. Generally, once analgesia and lifestyle-modifying treatments have failed, steroid nerve root injections and surgical microdiscectomy are recommended for severe persistent cases. Stepwise care approaches based on treatment with non-opioids have been identified as likely to represent a more cost-effective approach than strategies involving direct referral for disc surgery; however, evidence for a stepwise treatment progression involving TFESI is scarce. Following various randomised trials comparing surgical treatments with non-surgical therapy, surgery is often deemed the most successful treatment option, leading to more than 10 000 discectomy procedures per year in the UK and 190 000 such procedures in the USA. The costs to the UK's National Health Service (NHS) for microdiscectomy (requiring patients to be hospitalised for 2 nights, on average) are approximately £4500 compared with £700 for TFESI.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111F2Kgh]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is a common condition with a lifetime prevalence of up to 43%. In approximately 85–90% of cases, a herniated disc causes lumbar nerve root compression or inflammation. Although the prognosis for patients with acute sciatica is generally favourable, 20–30% of patients still experience pain after a year.

Guidelines recommend a stepwise model of treatment for sciatica starting with non-surgical treatment such as exercise, then progressing to pharmacological and interventional treatment if the pain is refractory. When non-surgical treatments have not been effective, surgery can then be considered if radiological findings are consistent with symptoms. Discectomy is the most common surgical treatment for sciatica due to disc herniation. Around 180 000 discectomies are done in the USA per year, and an increasing trend in its use has been reported in many high-income countries over the past 20 years. However, evidence supporting surgical treatment for sciatica is uncertain.

Recent systematic reviews on this topic have several shortcomings. They have collated data from heterogeneous populations (eg, people with lumbar disc herniation, stenosis, and spondylolisthesis), which have distinct clinical courses and require different surgical procedures. Others have excluded studies published in languages other than English, newly published trials, and trials that compared surgery to other commonly used interventional treatments, such as epidural injections. Another network meta-analysis combined data from different time points. A nuanced interpretation of the outcomes for pain and disability was not given. Hence, current evidence supporting surgery for sciatica is undetermined and warrants a comprehensive update. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the effectiveness or efficacy and safety of surgical treatment, compared with non-surgical treatment, in people with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^111HRyc2]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The duration and intensity of the conservative treatment is poorly described in the included studies. There are many treatment regimens and modalities available for conservative treatment of sciatica varying from steroids to traction to physiotherapy interventions. Evidence from systematic reviews of conservative interventions for sciatica fail to identify the effect of one intervention over the other, however, large studies with a low risk of bias are scarce. In order to make an informed decision about the clinical homogeneity of the included comparisons, detailed information about the treatments is essential and the denomination "conservative treatment" is not sufficient.

Three narrative reviews which examined choice of surgery or conservative care concluded that surgery is indicated in presence of persistent neuromotor deficit. Both Awad and Moskovich and Legrand et al. suggested to let the patient make an informed choice. The review of Awad and Moskovich was published before publication of three of the studies included in this review. Although the publication of Legrand et al. was in 2007, this study did not include two studies published before that date. Gregory et al. promoted surgery with persistent neuromotor deficit or severe sciatica with a positive straight-leg-raise test and imaging demonstrating lumbar disc herniation at the nerve root level correlating with the patient's examination findings. Although published in October 2008, this study did not include three studies published before that date. Both reviews did not describe their search strategy, selection methods or quality assessments of the included studies and are therefore, potentially, prone to bias.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11218GHJ]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Physiotherapy interventions are prescribed as first-line treatment for people with sciatica; however, their effectiveness remains controversial. The purpose of this systematic review was to establish the short-, medium- and long-term effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions compared to control interventions for people with clinically diagnosed sciatica.

Methods

This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO CRD42018103900. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, PEDro, PubMed, Scopus and grey literature were searched from inception to January 2021 without language restrictions. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials evaluating physiotherapy interventions compared to a control intervention in people with clinical or imaging diagnosis of sciatica. Primary outcome measures were pain and disability. Study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers with consensus reached by discussion or third-party arbitration if required. Risk of bias was assessed independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool with third-party consensus if required. Meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed with random effects models using Revman v5.4. Subgroup analyses were undertaken to examine the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions compared to minimal (e.g. advice only) or substantial control interventions (e.g. surgery).

Results

Three thousand nine hundred and fifty eight records were identified, of which 18 trials were included, with a total number of 2699 participants. All trials had a high or unclear risk of bias. Meta-analysis of trials for the outcome of pain showed no difference in the short (SMD − 0.34 [95%CI − 1.05, 0.37] p = 0.34, I² = 98%), medium (SMD 0.15 [95%CI − 0.09, 0.38], p = 0.22, I² = 80%) or long term (SMD 0.09 [95%CI − 0.18, 0.36], p = 0.51, I² = 82%). For disability there was no difference in the short (SMD − 0.00 [95%CI − 0.36, 0.35], p = 0.98, I² = 92%, medium (SMD 0.25 [95%CI − 0.04, 0.55] p = 0.09, I² = 87%), or long term (SMD 0.26 [95%CI − 0.16, 0.68] p = 0.22, I² = 92%) between physiotherapy and control interventions. Subgroup analysis of studies comparing physiotherapy with minimal intervention favoured physiotherapy for pain at the long-term time points. Large confidence intervals and high heterogeneity indicate substantial uncertainly surrounding these estimates. Many trials evaluating physiotherapy intervention compared to substantial intervention did not use contemporary physiotherapy interventions.

Conclusion

Based on currently available, mostly high risk of bias and highly heterogeneous data, there is inadequate evidence to make clinical recommendations on the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions for people with clinically diagnosed sciatica. Future studies should aim to reduce clinical heterogeneity and to use contemporary physiotherapy interventions.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^11268uGp]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Sciatica has a substantial impact on individuals and society. Stratified care has been shown to lead to better outcomes among patients with non-specific low back pain, but it has not been tested for sciatica. We aimed to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of stratified care versus non-stratified usual care for patients presenting with sciatica in primary care.

Methods

We did a two-parallel arm, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial across three centres in the UK (North Staffordshire, North Shropshire/Wales, and Cheshire). Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had a clinical diagnosis of sciatica, access to a mobile phone or landline number, were not pregnant, were not currently receiving treatment for the same problem, and had no previous spinal surgery. Patients were recruited from general practices and randomly assigned (1:1) by a remote web-based service to stratified care or usual care, stratified by centre and stratification group allocation. In the stratified care arm, a combination of prognostic and clinical criteria associated with referral to spinal specialist services were used to allocate patients to one of three groups for matched care pathways. Group 1 was offered brief advice and support in up to two physiotherapy sessions; group 2 was offered up to six physiotherapy sessions; and group 3 was fast-tracked to MRI and spinal specialist assessment within 4 weeks of randomisation. The primary outcome was self-reported time to first resolution of sciatica symptoms, defined as "completely recovered" or "much better" on a 6-point ordinal scale, collected via text messages or telephone calls. Analyses were by intention to treat. Health-care costs and cost-effectiveness were also assessed. This trial is registered on the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN75449581.

Findings

Between May 28, 2015, and July 18, 2017, 476 patients from 42 general practices around three UK centres were randomly assigned to stratified care or usual care (238 in each arm). For the primary outcome, the overall response rate was 89% (9467 of 10601 text messages sent; 4688 [88%] of 5310 in the stratified care arm and 4779 [90%] of 5291 in the usual care arm). Median time to symptom resolution was 10 weeks (95% CI 6.4–13.6) in the stratified care arm and 12 weeks (9.4–14.6) in the usual care arm, with the survival analysis showing no significant difference between the arms (hazard ratio 1.14 [95% CI 0.89–1.46]). Stratified care was not cost-effective compared to usual care.

Interpretation

The stratified care model for patients with sciatica consulting in primary care was not better than usual care for either clinical or health economic outcomes. These results do not support a transition to this stratified care model for patients with sciatica.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113EPKBn]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review, including 18 studies and 2699 participants with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica suggests that physiotherapy interventions are only better than minimal interventions in reducing pain at long-term time points. Physiotherapy interventions are less effective than substantial interventions (e.g. surgery) in reducing pain at medium term and disability at short- and medium-term time points. However, heterogeneity was considerable in most meta-analyses, and confidence intervals were large, indicating substantial uncertainly surrounding the precision of these estimates. The favourable results for substantial intervention for pain in medium term and disability in short term did not persist following sensitivity analyses removing studies with high risk of bias. The currently available literature therefore provides insufficient evidence to support strong recommendations for physiotherapy interventions in the treatment of people with sciatica.

This systematic review reflects a wider collective inability to show significant benefit of non-surgical treatments for people with sciatica. Pharmacological options fail to demonstrate effects beyond placebo, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, anti-convulsants, anti-depressants or opioids. Epidural cortisone injections have small effect sizes and short-term benefits. These findings are disappointing given the clear need for effective conservative interventions voiced by patients.

### Novel approach to characterising individuals with low back-related leg pain: cluster identification with latent class analysis and 12-month follow-up [^116jWeNF]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical implications

This work gives detailed insight into the complexity of LBLP and shows that information on initial presentation can help classify patients into distinct clusters.

Even within a specific condition/presentation such as sciatica, variation is overlooked if only 'average' population measures are considered. Heterogeneous study populations in clinical research can potentially confound outcomes and recent clinical practice guidelines for LBP treatments conclude there is insufficient evidence to better match treatment for presentations of leg pain/sciatica. The clusters identified in this work may represent groups likely to need a different management approach.

Currently management of sciatica is a stepped care approach in those not deteriorating or with signs suggestive of sinister pathology, starting with non-invasive treatments and progressing to more invasive treatment options. Timing and when to move to the next step is not clear, particularly in those with higher pain levels and it still remains unknown which patient will benefit from what intervention at which point (e.g. conservative management/surgery /injection). Two of the clusters represent patients that could preferentially respond to this stepped approach (cluster 2 and 3). Cluster 4 patients may benefit from a more intensive initial approach earlier in their management e.g. specialist opinion regarding more invasive options (surgery/ injections). Patients in cluster 1 and cluster 5 may be more suitable for pain management options that include psychosocial interventions.

Levels of depression and anxiety were highest in the clusters with most severe symptoms, which is unsurprising and levels remained highest in cluster 5 at 12 months. Mechanisms driving the high pain and anxiety are potentially different between the two groups and management should reflect this. The atypical sciatica cluster resembles profiles of patients with persistent/ widespread pain, whereas cluster 4 have a clear diagnosis and in the clinical setting are more likely to be considered for treatment options such as injections and/or surgery.

These clusters could be more homogenous groups that represent uniquely different responders to specific interventions. The next step is to consider optimum management pathways for these clusters and formally test whether different management options improve outcomes.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^113XqeKP]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Resuming, Dutch sciatica care is characterised by involvement of multiple stakeholders, uncertainty in the aetiology of the disease and uncertainty about the value of diverse treatment options in each step of the care pathway. As a result, practice variation in sciatica care persists, despite efforts to harmonise care processes. Shared decision-making (SDM) is warranted in this situation, because given the uncertainties, patients preferences are extra important to take into account. However, research on the actual preferences that guide the different stakeholders in their decision-making process is not available. This qualitative study aims to: (1) identify key moments in this care pathway and (2) map the drivers and arguments in the decisions among the involved stakeholders.

### Early surgery for sciatica [^113ycnyi]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

In primary care, about two thirds of people with sciatica recover within two to three monthswithout the need or even an indication for invasive treatments. Therefore, extrapolation of Liu and colleagues' findings to a primary care population would be misleading. Their conclusions should be limited to people with a specific diagnosis of radicular pain with or without radiculopathy, who have likely not responded adequately to non-surgical approaches, or to people with severe pain and a large enough impact on quality of life to warrant secondary care referral. A more appropriate conclusion might be that discectomy could be an option for people with radicular pain (with or without radiculopathy) who present to secondary care settings with a clear indication for surgery.

Despite limitations related to the low certainty of evidence, Liu and colleagues' review raises an important point for clinicians, people with sciatica, and policy makers. Growing evidence for worse surgical outcomes associated with prolonged symptom duration, together with the better short and medium term benefits of discectomy reported in this systematic review, challenge the stepped care approach that offers the least invasive options first to everyone with sciatica. Expedited surgical triage would be preferable for people with discogenic sciatica and a clear indication for surgery when rapid pain relief is a priority. Although many international pathways have this intention, reality is often divergent. Access to specialist services is difficult and delayed in many health systems globally, requiring proactiveness and perseverance from the patient, which is often compromised by their symptoms. Easier and faster access to surgical triage is needed for patients who are most likely to benefit.

Although the new review cannot provide clear treatment recommendations, the findings highlight one of the main obstacles to improving outcomes in this clinical field: sciatica is a heterogeneous condition and no routine clinical measures can consistently predict outcome. This knowledge gap hinders early triage, including to more invasive treatments. Solving the heterogeneity puzzle is the key to helping people with sciatica and clinicians choose the right treatment for them earlier in the disease trajectory, while being fully informed of the benefits and risks of surgery.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^114ZLMiJ]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy — about 95% of herniated discs occur at the lower lumbar spine (L4/5 and L5/S1 level); disc herniation above this level is more common in people aged over 55 years. The estimated prevalence of lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica has been described as 9.8 per 1,000 cases, 5.1 in men and 3.7 in women. Lumbar radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation resolves spontaneously in 23% to 48% of patients, but up to 30% to 70% will still have significant symptoms after one year, with 5% to 15% of patients undergoing surgery. Based on controlled evaluations, lumbar intervertebral discography has been shown to diagnose internal disc disruption in 39% of a younger cohort of patients with low back pain, and in a study without assessing internal disc disruption the reported prevalence rate of discogenic pain was 26%.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^117YC1dX]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica can be managed both conservatively and surgically. In the Netherlands, sciatica care is organised following the stepped care principle, involving a general practitioner (GP) as gatekeeper for hospital care, and a hospital-based neurologist, before a neurosurgeon is consulted. Therefore, a chain of decisions and referrals precede surgery. Both the diagnostic process and timing of surgical treatment and the (societal) value of surgery over conservative treatment are topics of ongoing discussion, and practice variation has been widely reported. This practice variation may be driven by both differences between and within patient and provider preferences. This makes the management of sciatica of interest. Which preferences of patients and physician(s) shape these decisions?

In the Netherlands, the GP is the point of entry for non-acute health complaints. For sciatica, the GP guideline advises conservative treatment for 6–8 weeks, combining a strategy of watchful waiting, informing the patient and providing painkillers. If the patients' complaints last longer, the GP can refer to a neurologist. Neurologists can confirm the diagnosis and might order imaging. However, the neurologists' guideline advises against imaging, unless surgery is considered or there is doubt about underlying cause or pathology. Recent research showed that only 11% of Dutch neurologists routinely order imaging. Apart from conservative options, the neurologist can also prescribe more invasive pain treatments, usually performed by a pain team. In case of persisting complaints, the patient might be referred to a neurosurgeon or orthopaedic surgeon to consider surgery. The Dutch neurosurgery guideline advices not to perform surgery on patients with less than 8 weeks of complaints, and proposes surgery after more than 6 months of complaints without any proper improvement. In the intermediary period natural recovery could occur. Therefore, a shared decision on treatment should be pursued with the patient. A multidisciplinary guideline exists, of which the implementation faces difficulties.

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: current concept [^113mVv47]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this manuscript is to review the current knowledge in terms of retro-trochanteric pain syndrome, make recommendations for diagnosis and differential diagnosis and offer suggestions for treatment options. The terminology in the literature is confusing and these symptoms can be referred to as 'greater trochanteric pain syndrome', 'trochanteric bursitis' and 'trochanteritis', among other denominations. The authors focus on a special type of sciatica, i.e. retro-trochanteric pain radiating down to the lower extremity. The impact of different radiographic assessments is discussed. The authors recommend excluding pathology in the spine and pelvic area before following their suggested treatment algorithm for sciatica-like retro-trochanteric pain. Level of evidence II.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^11695GC2]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Surgery versus usual conservative care

One old study (n = 126) with a high risk of bias compared long-term outcomes of discectomy to conservative management. Both patient and observer ratings demonstrated that discectomy was significantly better than conservative treatment at 1 year. After 1 year, 24 of the 66 patients (36%) in the conservative care group versus 39 of the 60 patients (65%) in the surgery group reported a good outcome. No significant differences in outcomes were reported at 4 and 10 years follow-up.

One small trial (n = 56) with a high risk of bias compared microdiscectomy with conservative treatment in patients with sciatica for 6–12 weeks. Overall, no significant differences were found for leg pain or back pain, and subjective disability throughout the 2 years of follow-up. VAS leg pain scores, however, improved more rapidly in the discectomy group; 6 weeks scores in the surgery group was 12 (SD 20) versus 25 (SD 27) in the conservative group. The per-protocol analysis demonstrated no statistically significant differences.

A large trial (n = 501) with a low risk of bias in patients with sciatica for at least 6 weeks and confirmed disc herniation showed that both the surgery as well as the conservative treatment group improved substantially over 2 years for all primary and secondary outcome measures. The intention-to-treat analysis showed no statistically significant differences for any of the primary outcome measures. Of the patients randomised to surgery, 50% received surgery within 3 months of inclusion as compared with 30% who received surgery in the group randomised to conservative treatment. After 2 years of follow-up, 45% of patients in the conservative treatment group underwent surgery and 40% in the surgery group received conservative treatment.

In conclusion, there is conflicting evidence as to whether surgery is more beneficial than conservative care for short- and long-term follow-up.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^111vr5QA]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of surgery in patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniations is not without dispute. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of surgery versus conservative therapy (including epidural injections) for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation. A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and PEDro up to October 2009. Randomised controlled trials of adults with lumbar radicular pain, which evaluated at least one clinically relevant outcome measure (pain, functional status, perceived recovery, lost days of work) were included. Two authors assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane criteria and extracted the data. In total, five studies were identified, two of which with a low risk of bias. One study compared early surgery with prolonged conservative care followed by surgery if needed; three studies compared surgery with usual conservative care, and one study compared surgery with epidural injections. Data were not pooled because of clinical heterogeneity and poor reporting of data. One large low-risk-of-bias trial demonstrated that early surgery in patients with 6–12 weeks of radicular pain leads to faster pain relief when compared with prolonged conservative treatment, but there were no differences after 1 and 2 years. Another large low-risk-of-bias trial between surgery and usual conservative care found no statistically significant differences on any of the primary outcome measures after 1 and 2 years. Future studies should evaluate who benefits more from surgery and who from conservative care.

### The management of sciatica by acupuncture: an expert consensus using the improved Delphi survey [^114Ask8U]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is usually unilateral radiation pain along the direction of the sciatic nerve, accounting for 13% to 40% in different studies and reviews. Lumbosacral nerve root (L4-S1) inflammation or compression is the main cause. Neuroradiology studies have confirmed that 85% of sciatica is related to disc disease. Most patients report low back pain at the same time as pain. The severity of pain varies from patient to patient along with a sudden or chronic onset mostly. It can extend from below the knee to the toes of the feet. In severe cases, symptoms such as low back pain, decreased muscle strength, and abnormal reflexes may occur, which would cause severe discomfort with limited quality of life and function.

The current focus of treatment is to prevent the disease from becoming chronic through conventional drug treatment and early conservative treatment. However, conventional drugs have a variety of potential adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects. Recently updated clinical guidelines emphasize the role of conservative treatment of sciatica from Denmark, and the US. Surgery which can early relieve pain maybe is an option if the symptoms do not improve after 6–8 weeks of early intervention, but its effect is similar to that of conservative treatment within one year.

Acupuncture is a non-pharmacological therapy used in pain control. At present, acupuncture is widely used in the treatment of sciatica, but the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend that acupuncture should not be provided as a non-invasive treatment for patients with sciatica, which is based on the following: i) Relative values of different outcomes; ii) Trade-off between clinical benefits and harms; iii) Trade-off between net clinical effects and costs; iv) Quality of evidence; and v) Other considerations. In terms of the standardized use of acupuncture, there is no internationally recognized evidence and guidance recommendations except for the "Evidence-Based Acupuncture Clinical Practice Guide: Sciatica" from China. However, with the continuous emergence of new research evidence (ie, changes in available interventions, clinical efficacy, or cost), it is necessary to conduct expert consensus based on existing evidence and update appropriately to maintain the trustworthiness of clinical guidelines.

These uncertainties of acupuncture treatment recommendations for sciatica prompted this study to establish an expert consensus based on the clinical investigation and literature review by using the improved Delphi method, which is conducive to unifying the acupuncture principles and putting forward a standard therapeutic protocol for the treatment of sciatica which could be used in future trials and clinical practice.

### Surgery versus conservative care for persistent sciatica lasting 4 to 12 months [^111CPR4z]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

The treatment of chronic sciatica caused by herniation of a lumbar disk has not been well studied in comparison with acute disk herniation. Data are needed on whether diskectomy or a conservative approach is better for sciatica that has persisted for several months.

Methods

In a single-center trial, we randomly assigned patients with sciatica that had lasted for 4 to 12 months and lumbar disk herniation at the L4-L5 or L5-S1 level in a 1:1 ratio to undergo microdiskectomy or to receive 6 months of standardized nonoperative care followed by surgery if needed. Surgery was performed by spine surgeons who used conventional microdiskectomy techniques. The primary outcome was the intensity of leg pain on a visual analogue scale (ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe pain) at 6 months after enrollment. Secondary outcomes were the score on the Oswestry Disability Index, back and leg pain, and quality-of-life scores at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.

Results

From 2010 through 2016, a total of 790 patients were screened; of those patients, 128 were enrolled, with 64 in each group. Among the patients assigned to undergo surgery, the median time from randomization to surgery was 3.1 weeks; of the 64 patients in the nonsurgical group, 22 (34%) crossed over to undergo surgery at a median of 11 months after enrollment. At baseline, the mean score for leg-pain intensity was 7.7 in the surgical group and 8.0 in the nonsurgical group. The primary outcome of the leg-pain intensity score at 6 months was 2.8 in the surgical group and 5.2 in the nonsurgical group (adjusted mean difference, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.4; P < 0.001). Secondary outcomes including the score on the Owestry Disability Index and pain at 12 months were in the same direction as the primary outcome. Nine patients had adverse events associated with surgery, and one patient underwent repeat surgery for recurrent disk herniation.

Conclusions

In this single-center trial involving patients with sciatica lasting more than 4 months and caused by lumbar disk herniation, microdiskectomy was superior to nonsurgical care with respect to pain intensity at 6 months of follow-up.

### Physicians' initial management of acute low back pain versus evidence-based guidelines. influence of sciatica [^114JGavm]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Little information is available on physician characteristics and patient presentations that may influence compliance with evidence-based guidelines for acute low back pain.

Objective

To assess whether physicians' management decisions are consistent with the Agency for Health Research Quality's guideline and whether responses varied with the presentation of sciatica or by physician characteristics.

Design

Cross-sectional study using a mailed survey.

Participants

Participants were randomly selected from internal medicine, family practice, general practice, emergency medicine, and occupational medicine specialties.

Measurements

A questionnaire asked for recommendations for 2 case scenarios, representing patients without and with sciatica, respectively.

Results

Seven hundred and twenty surveys were completed (response rate = 25%). In cases 1 (without sciatica) and 2 (with sciatica), 26.9% and 4.3% of physicians fully complied with the guideline, respectively. For each year in practice, the odds of guideline noncompliance increased 1.03 times (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01 to 1.05) for case 1. With occupational medicine as the referent specialty, general practice had the greatest odds of noncompliance (3.60, 95% CI = 1.75 to 7.40) in case 1, followed by internal medicine and emergency medicine. Results for case 2 reflected the influence of sciatica with internal medicine having substantially higher odds (vs case 1) and the greatest odds of noncompliance of any specialty (6.93, 95% CI = 1.47 to 32.78), followed by family practice and emergency medicine.

Conclusions

A majority of primary care physicians continue to be noncompliant with evidence-based back pain guidelines. Sciatica dramatically influenced clinical decision-making, increasing the extent of noncompliance, particularly for internal medicine and family practice. Physicians' misunderstanding of sciatica's natural history and belief that more intensive initial management is indicated may be factors underlying the observed influence of sciatica.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^111ALGid]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this review we identified five studies comparing surgery with conservative care. Only one low-risk-of-bias study compared early surgery to prolonged conservative care and demonstrated more relief of leg pain up to 3 months for early surgery, but at 1 year the differences disappeared. The trials of surgery versus usual conservative treatment showed inconsistent findings. One low-risk-of-bias study compared surgery versus conservative treatment and found no differences between the two treatments. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis of these three studies because of the poor data presented in two of the studies. An observational cohort study conducted alongside one trial included 743 patients that received their preferred treatment. Both groups improved substantially over time, but surgery showed significantly better results for pain and function as compared with conservative treatment.

Three of the five studies found an effect in the early postoperative period, which diminished during further follow-up. This is relevant because a faster recovery rate could, besides the clinical benefit, have an economic advantage in a relatively young patient population. A cost-effectiveness study performed alongside the trial of Peul et al. showed that surgery is cost-effective with a willingness to pay 40,000 € as per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). In relation to this, timing of treatment is under debate, but for a reliable analysis of the effect of different timing, information about duration of symptoms is needed. The duration between onset of symptoms and actual treatment is described in four of the five trials. Equally important is the timing of the treatment after diagnosis by protocol or waiting list. This is only reported in two of the trials being 2 weeks. Heterogeneity in the duration of the symptoms or in the timing of treatments introduces a difference in timing of treatment since the onset of complaints and thus bias in the analysis of recovery rate.

### Lumbosacral radiculopathies: conservative approaches to management [^117BhHy9]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The prevalence of sciatica in Western society and its economic and functional impact make it an important problem to understand for treatment. Such understanding will impact greatly both medical management and decisions regarding activity, which could affect the perceived disability and financial dependence of a patient. This knowledge could be used to direct primary prevention, patient education, and future research efforts in back pain. The article also discusses that such strategies could improve health, decrease disability, and rein in costs.

### Improving prediction of "inevitable" surgery during non-surgical treatment of sciatica [^111WWDwN]. Pain (2008). Low credibility.

A randomized trial showed that surgery speeds up recovery of patients suffering sciatica for 6 weeks but prolonged conservative care yields similar results at one year. However 39% of this conservative care group ultimately underwent surgery after a mean period of 18.7 weeks. We evaluated variables to improve prediction of surgery in the conservatively treated cohort. Baseline data on 142 patients enroled in the conservative treatment arm of a randomized trial were analyzed to select those that could contribute to the prediction of surgery. The actual occurrence of surgery was used as dependent outcome of interest. Variables measured at baseline included neurological examination results, the visual analogue scale for pain (VAS) and the Roland disability questionnaire (RDQ). Higher pain intensity and functional limitations at baseline were associated with an increased likelihood of surgery during follow-up. Mutually adjusted Odds Ratios of 1.7 (95% CI; 1.1–2.7) per 20mm incremental intensification of pain on the VAS score and 1.8 (95% CI; 1.2–2.9) per 3 points of deterioration of the RDQ score quantify the increasing chance of undergoing delayed surgery. Despite maximal efforts to the contrary, surgery could not be prevented for a considerable proportion of patients in a conservatively treated cohort. Compared to those with lower scores initially, patients with more intense leg pain or higher disability scores were at higher risk to undergo delayed surgery. The individual surgical decision process is facilitated by the use of pain and disability scales complemented by patient preferences.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^115P7Z1M]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) etiologic descriptors distinguish nonspecific, specific, radiculopathy, sciatica, and visceral disease–related pain as follows: Nonspecific low back pain is pain in which no specific cause or structure can be identified to account for the patient's perceived symptoms; specific low back pain is pain that can be linked to a disorder, disease, infection, injury, trauma, or structural deformity and a potential causal relationship can be found between the diagnosis and the pain; radiculopathy is dysfunction of a nerve root associated with pain, sensory impairment, weakness, or diminished deep tendon reflexes in a nerve root distribution; sciatica is pain radiating down the leg below the knee in the distribution of the sciatic nerve, suggesting nerve root compromise due to mechanical pressure or inflammation and is the most common symptom of lumbar radiculopathy; and visceral diseases resulting in back pain are pain secondary to diseases of the viscera with examples including endometriosis, prostatitis, and aortic aneurysm.

2. Methods

This working group was commissioned by NeuPSIG. The facilitators (A.B.S. B.T. and H.S.) were tasked with convening an international expert group with diverse expertise in the area of "sciatica", neuropathic pain, and diagnostic grading.

We adopted a phased approach to address the objectives:
Phase 1a: discussion to reach consensus on proposed terminologies in the working group,
Phase 1b: consultation with the NeuPSIG membership to gauge members' preferences on the terminology proposition,
Phase 2: how to identify the presence of neuropathic pain in people presenting with spine-related leg pain (discussion to reach consensus in the working group).

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1121zk4g]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness and safety of surgery compared with non-surgical treatment for sciatica.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to June 2022.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials comparing any surgical treatment with non-surgical treatment, epidural steroid injections, or placebo or sham surgery, in people with sciatica of any duration due to lumbar disc herniation (diagnosed by radiological imaging).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two independent reviewers extracted data. Leg pain and disability were the primary outcomes. Adverse events, back pain, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment were the secondary outcomes. Pain and disability scores were converted to a scale of 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst pain or disability). Data were pooled using a random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and certainty of evidence with the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) framework. Follow-up times were into immediate term (≤ six weeks), short term (> six weeks and ≤ three months), medium term (> three and < 12 months), and long term (at 12 months).

Results

24 trials were included, half of these investigated the effectiveness of discectomy compared with non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections (1711 participants). Very low to low certainty evidence showed that discectomy, compared with non-surgical treatment, reduced leg pain: the effect size was moderate at immediate term (mean difference -12.1 (95% confidence interval -23.6 to -0.5)) and short term (-11.7 (-18.6 to -4.7)), and small at medium term (-6.5 (-11.0 to -2.1)). Negligible effects were noted at long term (-2.3 (-4.5 to -0.2)). For disability, small, negligible, or no effects were found. A similar effect on leg pain was found when comparing discectomy with epidural steroid injections. For disability, a moderate effect was found at short term, but no effect was observed at medium and long term. The risk of any adverse events was similar between discectomy and non-surgical treatment (risk ratio 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.98)).

Conclusion

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits declined over time. Discectomy might be an option for people with sciatica who feel that the rapid relief offered by discectomy outweighs the risks and costs associated with surgery.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^113LfU5c]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

There are some limitations in our present review. Firstly, the limited amount of studies, especially those with a low risk of bias, limits the strength of our recommendations. The GRADE approach needs consistent findings in separate studies to raise the level of evidence to 'moderate' or 'high'. The overall quality of the evidence should not be misinterpreted as the quality of an individual study.

A more general problem lies within the methodology of research for the assessment of timing of interventions. Current research models, with the randomised clinical trial as the gold standard, do not allow for a proper analysis of the difference between the time from inclusion (or onset of symptoms) to intervention and prolonged control intervention. The design and analysis of studies is complicated by the difference in cross-over possibilities between the two interventions. Crossing over from conservative treatment to surgery is to be expected for a certain amount of patients. The reverse is also possible as shown in the study of Weinstein et al. The mechanism is however different as crossing over is only counted as surgery did not take place at all.

The clinical data seem to favour surgery slightly; however, the costs of surgery are likely to be higher than conservative treatment for patients or the health care system. Also, potential complications are probably more prevalent and more severe with surgery. Only from a societal perspective it might be more cost-effective because of lower cost of production loss. Evaluating conservative treatment and surgical intervention requires a different set of outcome parameters, including complications, re-surgeries and economical information to allow for a balanced and informed cost-complication-effectiveness decision.

### WITHDRAWN: advice to stay active as a single treatment for low-back pain and sciatica [^117PH3nB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain is one of the most common conditions managed in primary care. Restricted activity, rest, and symptomatic analgesics are the most commonly prescribed treatment for low back pain and sciatica.

Objectives

To assess the effects of advice to stay active as single treatment for patients with low back pain.

Search Strategy

Computerised searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Musculoskeletal Group's Trials Register and Scisearch, and scanning of reference lists from relevant articles were undertaken. Relevant studies were also traced by contacting authors. Date of the most recent searches: December 1998.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised trials or quasi-randomised trials where the study population consisted of adult patients with low back pain or sciatica, in which one comparison group was advised to stay active. The main outcomes of interest were pain, functional status, recovery and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the validity of included trials and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to collect missing data or for clarification when needed.

Main Results

Four trials, with a total of 491 patients, were included. Advice to stay active was compared to advice to rest in bed in all trials. Two trials were assessed to have low risk of bias and two to have moderate to high risk of bias. The results were heterogeneous. Results from one high quality trial of patients with acute simple LBP found small differences in functional status [Weighted Mean Difference (on a 0–100 scale) 6.0 (95% CI: 1.5, 10.5)] and length of sick leave [WMD 3.4 days (95% CI: 1.6, 5.2)] in favour of staying active compared to advice to stay in bed for two days. The other high quality trial compared advice to stay active with advice to rest in bed for 14 days for patients with sciatic syndrome, and found no differences between the groups. One of the high quality trials also compared advice to stay active with exercises for patients with acute simple LBP, and found improvement in functional status and reduction in sick leave in favour of advice to stay active.

Authors' Conclusions

The best available evidence suggests that advice to stay active alone has small beneficial effects for patients with acute simple low back pain, and little or no effect for patients with sciatica. There is no evidence that advice to stay active is harmful for either acute low back pain or sciatica. If there is no major difference between advice to stay active and advice to rest in bed, and there is potential harmful effects of prolonged bed rest, then it is reasonable to advise people with acute low back pain and sciatica to stay active. These conclusions are based on single trials.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ijLmy]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The risk of bias analysis highlights areas of improvement for future trials. Performance bias is the area with the highest risk of bias. Although recent studies have shown that blinding of participants is possible, it is not easy to eradicate this bias where the intervention is a physical one such as surgery or physiotherapy. The main area that could easily be addressed is detection bias. Blinding outcome assessment would have reduced overall risk of bias in four studies.

Strengths and limitations

The main strength of this review was the strict inclusion criteria based on clinical diagnosis confirming spinally referred leg pain of neural origin. A consequence of the tight inclusion criteria is the exclusion of 45 studies due to inadequate information on diagnosis of sciatica. As a result, our data reflect outcomes in patients with true nerve involvement. Insufficient reporting and low number of studies prevented a subgroup analysis according to type of physiotherapy intervention. Future trials with physiotherapy intervention should adhere to the TIDieR framework to fully describe the complexity of the intervention.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111jg71Q]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

'Sciatica' is a broad term describing spinally referred pain of neural origin that radiates into the leg. The reported prevalence of sciatica varies widely (1.2–43%), probably due to different diagnostic criteria, reflecting a heterogeneous patient population. Sciatica is a significant burden to healthcare and the economy, as a neuropathic component in low back pain it is not only linked to poorer quality of life, but also increases the already high costs of back pain by a further 67%. Although prognosis is good for most patients, up to 45% continue to have symptoms for 12 months or longer.

Physiotherapy interventions such as exercise, manual therapy and psychological therapy are recommended in clinical guidelines for people with sciatica. However, the available systematic reviews examining the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions are at least ten years old. For example, study selection in the most recent systematic review comparing surgery versus conservative care ended in 2009. Their results could not be meta-analysed due to poor reporting and clinical heterogeneity. Similarly, a network-meta-analysis concluded its search in 2009, finding no support for the effectiveness of exercise or traction while manipulation may be beneficial. However, the latter was based on a single study only. Prior to this, reviews specifically focusing on conservative management of sciatica were published in 2010 and 2007 and were unable to make strong conclusions on the superiority of any treatment. More recent reviews published in 2015 and 2016 were limited to a subset of physiotherapy interventions (e.g. physical activity versus surgery and exercise versus advice to stay active). A recent review looked at a range of physiotherapy interventions, however the review did not include a meta-analysis.

Of note, sciatica is a heterogeneous condition with no agreed diagnostic criteria. Most reviews to date make no reference to the clinical diagnosis of included study participants rendering it unclear whether patients had confirmed nerve involvement. The objective of this systematic review was therefore to assess the up-to-date evidence on the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions compared with control interventions in people with clinically diagnosed sciatica.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^114KBNkX]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Pain radiating from the spine into the leg is commonly referred to as "sciatica". "Sciatica" may be associated with significant consequences for the person living with the condition, imposing a reduced quality of lifeand substantial direct and indirect costs (eg, £1.2–10.6 billion annually in the United Kingdom alone, extrapolated from primary care data).

Of note, there is no consensus on the definition and diagnostic criteria for "sciatica". The term "sciatica" has been used to encompass a range of nerve-related conditions originating from the spine such as radicular pain or painful radiculopathy. Despite the linguistic allusion to neural involvement, "sciatica" has in some instances even been used to encompass somatic referred pain.

Although these pain conditions may overlap, they are discrete entities with differing dominant pain characteristics (eg, nociceptive or neuropathic), which may require specific management approaches. Nevertheless, these terms are often used interchangeably, and these heterogeneous conditions are often amalgamated in clinical trials. Whether or not this amalgamation contributes to the modest treatment effects seen for "sciatica" is unclear.

Two of the main challenges associated with a diagnosis of "sciatica" relate to the inconsistent use of terminology for the diagnostic labels, "sciatica" or radicular pain or painful radiculopathy, and the identification of neuropathic pain. These challenges hinder collective clinical and scientific understanding and clarity regarding these conditions, impact effective clinical communication and care planning, prevent clear interpretation of the scientific literature related to the condition, and ultimately may contribute to the limited efficacy of care for people living with "sciatica". Indeed, most trials on conservative management for people with "sciatica" either show no, or at best, modest effects.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117YRTwY]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Quality assessment

Two reviewers (LD, LK) independently used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess study quality and risk of bias. The tool was piloted on three excluded studies to test agreement of decision-making. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by a third reviewer where required (GJ).

Data extraction

Two reviewers (LD, LK) independently extracted data using a standardised form; consensus was used to resolve any discrepancies. The following information was extracted: author, year, country, characteristics of participants (e.g. age, duration, severity of symptoms), diagnostic criteria, physiotherapy and control intervention (type, frequency and duration). Outcomes were extracted at baseline and follow-up time points. Primary outcomes of interest were pain (e.g. numerical pain rating scale) and disability (e.g. Oswestry disability index). Secondary outcomes were global perceived effect, quality of life, change in neurological function, psychological parameters, adverse events, and dropout rates. Means, standard deviations and sample sizes were extracted for each outcome. If alternative summary statistics were provided, we transformed the data using recommended calculations. If available, outcomes were extracted for different time points, and grouped according to time after randomisation as: short term (< 3 months); medium-term (> 3 months but < 12 months) or long-term (≥ 12 months). If multiple terms were reported within one period, the outcome closest to 7 weeks, 6 months and 12 months was used. When more than one body part was used to assess pain (e.g. leg and back pain), the highest score at baseline was used to reflect patients' dominant symptoms. When more than one outcome measure was used within a trial for a specific outcome of interest, the outcome measure described by the trial authors as their primary measure was used.

### A pilot study for effectiveness of non-pharmacological versus pharmacological treatment strategies for lumbar disc herniation: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^117WVCEo]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most common causes of low back pain (LBP) and radiating leg pain (sciatica). The prevalence of sciatica vary from 1.6% in the general population to 43% in specific working populations. Most cases of sciatica caused by acute LDH show favorable outcomes and resolve within 2 weeks to 3 months. However, in some cases, LDH becomes a chronic condition of lifelong experience with LBP.

Conservative treatment should be the first-line therapy for sciatica; nonetheless, the best method of conservative treatment remains unclear, with guidelines differing in their recommendations. The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends that non-pharmacological treatments, such as superficial heat treatment, massage, acupuncture, and spinal manipulation, should be selected for patients with LBP with or without sciatica. Among these various non-pharmacological treatments, there are many differences between guidelines for acupuncture and manual therapy. Korea guidelinesrecommend acupuncture and spinal manual therapy with high grade level of evidence. It suggested that acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and spinal manual therapy are helpful in improving pain and overall symptoms in patients with LDH. However, the United Kingdom (UK) guidelinesrecommend manual therapy only alongside an exercise program and against acupuncture. The Danish guidelinesalso state that acupuncture has low-quality evidence.

On the other hand, harms and serious adverse events for these non-pharmacological therapies have not been reported. In an RCT study on manual therapy for the neck, adverse events related to the musculoskeletal system and nervous system were observed in 5 patients (9.3%) in the intervention group, but all were mild or moderate side effects. In a systemic review of acupuncture treatment for a LDH patient, adverse events were reported in two trials, one reported no adverse events, and one reported local haematoma.

The recommendations for invasive treatment also vary widely depending on guidelines. Some recent guidelines, do not recommend epidural injections or facet joint injections, whereas the UK guidelinesrecommend epidural injections for patients with severe sciatica. The United States (US) guidelinesalso strongly recommend epidural injections for the management of sciatica or LDH. It suggested that transforaminal epidural steroid injections provide short-term (2–4 weeks) pain relief in LDH patients. Epidural injection is associated with serious adverse events such as plegia, spinal cord injury, dural hemorrhage, paralysis, stroke, and dural punctures, although the incidence rate is low.

### Appropriateness criteria for surgery improve clinical outcomes in patients with low back pain and / or sciatica [^112JexCt]. Spine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective, controlled, observational outcome study using clinical, radiographic, and patient/physician-based questionnaire data, with patient outcomes at 12 months follow-up.

Objective

To validate appropriateness criteria for low back surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

Most surgical treatment failures are attributed to poor patient selection, but no widely accepted consensus exists on detailed indications for appropriate surgery.

Methods

Appropriateness criteria for low back surgery have been developed by a multispecialty panel using the RAND appropriateness method. Based on panel criteria, a prospective study compared outcomes of patients appropriately and inappropriately treated at a single institution with 12 months follow-up assessment. Included were patients with low back pain and/or sciatica referred to the neurosurgical department. Information about symptoms, neurologic signs, the health-related quality of life (SF-36), disability status (Roland-Morris), and pain intensity (VAS) was assessed at baseline, at 6 months, and at 12 months follow-up. The appropriateness criteria were administered prospectively to each clinical situation and outside of the clinical setting, with the surgeon and patients blinded to the results of the panel decision. The patients were further stratified into 2 groups: appropriate treatment group (ATG) and inappropriate treatment group (ITG).

Results

Overall, 398 patients completed all forms at 12 months. Treatment was considered appropriate for 365 participants and inappropriate for 33 participants. The mean improvement in the SF-36 physical component score at 12 months was significantly higher in the ATG (mean: 12.3 points) than in the ITG (mean: 6.8 points) (P = 0.01), as well as the mean improvement in the SF-36 mental component score (ATG mean: 5.0 points; ITG mean: -0.5 points) (P = 0.02). Improvement was also significantly higher in the ATG for the mean VAS back pain (ATG mean: 2.3 points; ITG mean: 0.8 points; P = 0.02) and Roland-Morris disability score (ATG mean: 7.7 points; ITG mean: 4.2 points; P = 0.004). The ATG also had a higher improvement in mean VAS for sciatica (4.0 points) than the ITG (2.8 points), but the difference was not significant (P = 0.08). The SF-36 General Health score declined in both groups after 12 months, however, the decline was worse in the ITG (mean decline: 8.2 points) than in the ATG (mean decline: 1.2 points) (P = 0.04). Overall, in comparison to ITG patients, ATG patients had significantly higher improvement at 12 months, both statistically and clinically.

Conclusion

In comparison to previously reported literature, our study is the first to assess the utility of appropriateness criteria for low back surgery at 1-year follow-up with multiple outcome dimensions. Our results confirm the hypothesis that application of appropriateness criteria can significantly improve patient outcomes.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^114FdS7z]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pain radiating from the spine into the leg is commonly referred to as "sciatica", "Sciatica" may include various conditions such as radicular pain or painful radiculopathy. It may be associated with significant consequences for the person living with the condition, imposing a reduced quality of life and substantial direct and indirect costs. The main challenges associated with a diagnosis of "sciatica" include those related to the inconsistent use of terminology for the diagnostic labels and the identification of neuropathic pain. These challenges hinder collective clinical and scientific understanding regarding these conditions. In this position paper, we describe the outcome of a working group commissioned by the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG) of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) which was tasked with the following objectives: (1) to revise the use of terminology for classifying spine-related leg pain and (2) to propose a way forward on the identification of neuropathic pain in the context of spine-related leg pain. The panel recommended discouraging the term "sciatica" for use in clinical practice and research without further specification of what it entails. The term "spine-related leg pain" is proposed as an umbrella term to include the case definitions of somatic referred pain and radicular pain with and without radiculopathy. The panel proposed an adaptation of the neuropathic pain grading system in the context of spine-related leg pain to facilitate the identification of neuropathic pain and initiation of specific management in this patient population.
