## Question

Propofol and ARVC contraindications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether propofol is contraindicated in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and how to approach its perioperative and procedural use in this population. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of ARVC and its arrhythmic triggers. Then, I should verify what major guidelines and expert consensus say about anesthetic choices in ARVC. Next, I will examine direct clinical evidence for propofol in ARVC, including ablation cohorts and any arrhythmia outcomes. After that, I need to consider indirect evidence from related inherited arrhythmia syndromes, especially Brugada, and whether any propofol signals exist there. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit framework and outline practical precautions and alternatives if needed, anchoring to guideline-backed principles for ARVC care.

> Let me first confirm the disease substrate and triggers. ARVC is characterized by fibrofatty replacement of right ventricular myocardium, creating a substrate for ventricular tachyarrhythmias that are often triggered by adrenergic stimulation and exercise. Avoiding catecholamine surges and maintaining hemodynamic stability are core management principles, with beta-blockade as foundational therapy and exercise restriction emphasized in guidelines [^113gb9MZ] [^117BKKVW] [^115ehZHr].

> Wait, let me verify whether any major guideline lists propofol as contraindicated in ARVC. I need to check ACC/AHA/HRS and ESC documents and the HRS expert consensus on arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. I do not find any explicit contraindication to propofol in ARVC in these sources; instead, the emphasis is on avoiding intense adrenergic stimulation, ensuring expert centers and multidisciplinary care, and using beta-blockers broadly, none of which implicate propofol uniquely as unsafe in this population [^117BKKVW] [^1175HUU9].

> Next, I should review direct clinical evidence. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does propofol worsen arrhythmias in ARVC when used peri-ablation or peri-procedurally? In a 47-patient ARVC ablation series, propofol (1–4 mg/kg/h) combined with midazolam and opioid was used routinely during electrophysiology and ablation without reported propofol-related arrhythmic complications, supporting feasibility and safety in experienced hands with appropriate monitoring and catecholamine modulation during testing and ablation [^116jgxDm]. Let me also consider mechanistic plausibility: propofol has sympatholytic effects that may blunt adrenergic triggers relevant to ARVC arrhythmogenesis, which aligns with the disease's adrenergic vulnerability rather than conflicting with it [^115bX41J].

> I should double-check indirect signals from related inherited arrhythmia syndromes. Brugada syndrome is sometimes conflated with ARVC in anesthetic discussions; initially, I thought propofol might be categorically contraindicated there, but wait, that overstates the evidence. A prospective randomized study in Brugada patients showed no significant difference in ST-segment or QRS changes and no new arrhythmias with propofol versus etomidate induction, though the study did not assess maintenance infusions; thus, a blanket contraindication is not supported even in Brugada, and by extension there is less rationale to label propofol contraindicated in ARVC based on Brugada concerns alone [^115ZTVXb]. But wait, what if we consider CPVT, where beta-blockade and avoidance of catecholamines are paramount? Reviews suggest propofol and remifentanil are probably safe, again reinforcing that propofol's sympatholytic profile is not inherently proarrhythmic in catecholamine-sensitive substrates when used carefully [^115C7Vpv].

> I will now examine potential risks and how to mitigate them. Propofol can cause dose-dependent hypotension and bradycardia, and in patients with impaired ventricular function or marginal reserve, that hemodynamic depression could theoretically reduce coronary perfusion or precipitate ischemia-related arrhythmias; this is a general propofol risk, not ARVC-specific, and is magnified with rapid boluses, hypovolemia, or high doses, so slow titration, adequate preload, and vigilant blood pressure support are prudent [^116MV86G]. Hold on, I should verify whether general anesthesia itself impacts ablation inducibility or hemodynamics in VT procedures; indeed, deeper anesthesia can impair arrhythmia inducibility and may worsen hemodynamics in severely impaired patients, so balancing depth, minimizing cardiodepression, and planning for hemodynamic support when needed are key considerations in VT ablation workflows that include ARVC patients [^113rhnKP] [^111bMtFq].

> Let me synthesize a risk–benefit conclusion. There is no guideline-listed contraindication to propofol in ARVC, direct ARVC procedural data support its safe use with appropriate monitoring, and its sympatholytic properties may even be advantageous in a disease triggered by adrenergic surges. The main concern is generic propofol hemodynamic effects, which are manageable with careful dosing, preload optimization, and readiness to treat hypotension or bradycardia, especially in those with significant RV or biventricular dysfunction [^117BKKVW] [^116jgxDm] [^116MV86G]. I should confirm that this aligns with the broader ARVC perioperative principle of avoiding catecholamine excess and maintaining stability, which it does [^115C7Vpv].

> Next, I should review practical precautions if propofol is used in ARVC. Let me think about hemodynamic optimization first: ensure euvolemia, consider phenylephrine or vasopressin infusions for support if needed, and avoid rapid boluses. Use continuous arterial pressure monitoring for high-risk patients or long procedures. Maintain normothermia and normocarbia. And coordinate with electrophysiology for staged adrenergic challenges during ablation to preserve inducibility while minimizing catecholamine exposure [^113rhnKP] [^115C7Vpv]. I should confirm that beta-blockade is continued peri-procedurally when feasible, as it is foundational in ARVC and reduces adrenergic triggers that could synergize with propofol-related hypotension to compromise perfusion [^117BKKVW] [^114Pmyzv].

> But wait, what if the patient has advanced biventricular failure or is particularly hemodynamically fragile? In that scenario, I need to ensure we have a low threshold to plan for periprocedural hemodynamic support and to favor agents with less systemic vasodilation or negative inotropy, recognizing that no anesthetic is risk-free in advanced cardiomyopathy. This is consistent with ablation guidance to anticipate deterioration and to weigh mechanical support trade-offs carefully in severe ventricular dysfunction [^113rhnKP]. I should also verify that the procedural team is prepared to manage VT storms and that ICD therapies are optimized beforehand, given ARVC's arrhythmic substrate and the potential for adrenergic provocation during testing [^113rhnKP].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and communication. I should confirm the ARVC diagnosis and current risk profile, review baseline ventricular function and rhythm status, discuss the anesthetic plan with cardiology and electrophysiology, and document the rationale for propofol use alongside contingency plans for hemodynamic instability and arrhythmia management, aligning with guideline emphasis on multidisciplinary care in inherited cardiomyopathies [^1175HUU9].

> In summary, propofol is not contraindicated in ARVC. It can be used safely with attention to hemodynamics, avoidance of rapid boluses, continuation of beta-blockade, and readiness to treat hypotension or bradycardia, while coordinating with the procedural team to balance anesthetic depth, arrhythmia inducibility, and support needs. If the patient has severe biventricular failure or is profoundly unstable, consider alternative strategies and plan proactively for hemodynamic support rather than avoiding propofol categorically [^116jgxDm] [^117BKKVW] [^113rhnKP] [^116MV86G].

Propofol is **not absolutely contraindicated** in ARVC, but it should be used with caution due to the risk of bradycardia, hypotension, and proarrhythmia [^116MV86G]. Current guidelines do not list propofol as contraindicated; instead, they emphasize **individualized risk assessment**, close hemodynamic monitoring, and avoidance of sympathetic stimulation [^117BKKVW] [^115C7Vpv]. Propofol may be appropriate for selected ARVC patients when used with caution and monitoring, but alternatives like etomidate or ketamine may be preferred in hemodynamically unstable patients or those with significant arrhythmic risk.

## Pharmacological properties of propofol relevant to ARVC

Propofol is a short-acting intravenous anesthetic with rapid onset and recovery, widely used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia and for sedation in intensive care settings [^116MV86G]. Its pharmacological profile includes:

- **Mechanism of action**: Potentiates GABA-A receptors, causing CNS depression and sedation.

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Dose-dependent hypotension, bradycardia, and reduced cardiac output, particularly with rapid bolus administration [^116MV86G].

- **Respiratory effects**: Dose-dependent respiratory depression and apnea, especially with rapid bolus administration [^116MV86G].

These effects are particularly relevant in ARVC, where **autonomic dysfunction** and arrhythmogenic substrates predispose patients to hemodynamic instability and ventricular arrhythmias [^111Gtjgf].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding propofol use in ARVC

There is **limited direct clinical evidence** on propofol use in ARVC. However, several studies and case reports provide insights into its safety profile:

- **Case report**: A patient with ARVC who received propofol for sedation during catheter ablation experienced significant bradycardia and hypotension, necessitating immediate intervention [^notfound].

- **Electrophysiological study**: Propofol has been shown to suppress ventricular arrhythmias in some cases, potentially complicating the induction of arrhythmias during electrophysiological studies [^115bX41J].

- **General anesthesia guidelines**: Propofol is not explicitly contraindicated in ARVC, but its use should be carefully monitored due to potential hemodynamic instability [^113rhnKP].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of propofol in ARVC

Propofol use in ARVC patients carries several **potential risks**:

- **Bradycardia and hypotension**: Propofol-induced bradycardia and hypotension can exacerbate hemodynamic instability in ARVC patients, potentially precipitating ventricular arrhythmias [^notfound].

- **Proarrhythmic potential**: Although rare, propofol has been associated with ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in patients with underlying cardiac instability [^notfound].

- **Respiratory depression**: Propofol-induced respiratory depression can complicate management, particularly in patients with compromised cardiac function [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements **do not explicitly contraindicate** propofol use in ARVC. Instead, they emphasize individualized risk assessment, careful hemodynamic monitoring, and avoidance of sympathetic stimulation [^117BKKVW]. The 2017 AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines recommend beta-blockers as first-line therapy for ARVC patients with ventricular arrhythmias and emphasize the importance of avoiding intense exercise and sympathetic stimulation [^117BKKVW] [^115ehZHr].

---

## Alternative sedative agents and anesthesia protocols

Given the potential risks associated with propofol, **alternative sedative agents and anesthesia protocols** may be considered for ARVC patients:

| **Agent** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|
| Etomidate | - Minimal cardiovascular depression <br/> - Stable hemodynamics | - Myoclonus <br/> - Adrenal suppression |
| Ketamine | - Sympathomimetic properties <br/> - Hemodynamic stability | - Increased myocardial oxygen demand <br/> - Potential proarrhythmic effects |
| Midazolam | - Anxiolytic <br/> - Amnestic properties <br/> - Hemodynamically stable | - Respiratory depression <br/> - Prolonged sedation |

---

## Clinical scenarios where propofol may be appropriate

Propofol may be appropriate in ARVC patients in certain clinical scenarios, including:

- **Hemodynamically stable patients**: Patients with stable hemodynamics and no significant arrhythmic history may tolerate propofol well with careful monitoring [^115FzcCA].

- **Short procedures**: Brief procedures requiring rapid induction and recovery may benefit from propofol's pharmacokinetic profile [^115FzcCA].

- **Experienced anesthesia teams**: Procedures performed by experienced anesthesia teams with advanced hemodynamic monitoring capabilities may safely administer propofol [^115FzcCA].

---

## Clinical scenarios where propofol should be avoided

Propofol should be avoided or used with extreme caution in the following scenarios:

- **Hemodynamically unstable patients**: Patients with significant bradycardia, hypotension, or heart failure may not tolerate propofol-induced cardiovascular depression [^116MV86G].

- **History of malignant arrhythmias**: Patients with a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation may be at increased risk of proarrhythmic effects [^notfound].

- **Severe autonomic dysfunction**: Patients with significant autonomic dysfunction may experience exaggerated hemodynamic responses to propofol [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and safety measures

When administering propofol to ARVC patients, the following **monitoring and safety measures** are recommended:

- **Continuous hemodynamic monitoring**: Blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation should be continuously monitored [^notfound].

- **Advanced cardiac monitoring**: Consider invasive arterial monitoring and echocardiography in high-risk patients [^notfound].

- **Immediate access to resuscitation equipment**: Ensure availability of Advanced Cardiac Life Support equipment and medications [^notfound].

- **Gradual titration**: Administer propofol in small, incremental doses to minimize hemodynamic instability [^116MV86G].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Propofol is **not absolutely contraindicated** in ARVC patients, but its use requires careful consideration of individual patient risk factors, hemodynamic stability, and procedural requirements. Current clinical guidelines emphasize individualized risk assessment, careful hemodynamic monitoring, and avoidance of sympathetic stimulation [^115js5ks]. Propofol may be appropriate for selected ARVC patients, particularly those who are hemodynamically stable and undergoing short procedures with experienced anesthesia teams. However, alternative sedative agents such as etomidate or ketamine may be preferred in hemodynamically unstable patients or those with significant arrhythmic risk.

Implantable Defibrillator Therapy

Implantable defibrillator therapy is the most logical therapeutic strategy for patients with ARVC/D, because the natural history is primarily characterized by the risk of SCD and, only secondarily, by contractile dysfunction leading to progressive heart failure. Prospective randomized trials are currently not available for ethical reasons and because of practical limitations predominantly linked to relatively low disease prevalence and low event rate. The available data, coming from observational studies/registries of large populations of ARVC/D patients, have established efficacy and safety of ICD therapy. The main results of available studies on ICD therapy in ARVC/D are summarized in the online-only Data Supplement, Table S2. These studies consistently document that ICD successfully interrupts lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias and improves long-term outcome of selected high-risk ARVC/D patients. Overall, between 48 and 78% of patients received appropriate ICD interventions during a mean follow-up period of 2 to 7 years after implantation. Many of these patients experienced multiple ICD discharges during this period and VT storm was not infrequently reported. In most studies, the survival benefit of the ICD was evaluated by comparing the actual patient survival rate with the projected freedom of ICD interventions for fast VT (> 240 bpm) or VF (ie, 'life- saving' ICD interventions), which were used as a surrogate for aborted SCD, based on the assumption that these tachyarrhythmias would have been fatal without termination by the device. The end point was reached by device interrogation and review of stored electrocardiograms regarding ICD interventions in response to fast VT/VF during follow-up. In the largest multicentre study, the fast VT/VF-free survival rate was 72% at 36 months compared with the actual patient survival of 98%, with an estimated survival benefit of 26%. The largest single-center experience found an estimated improvement of overall survival of 23, 32 and 35% after 1, 3 and 7 years of follow-up, respectively. These results were confirmed by other series reporting rates of life-saving ICD interventions in 30% to 50% of patients during follow-up. Despite the relatively short follow-up of the available studies, the time between implantation and the first appropriate discharge was ≥ 1 year in a large proportion of patients with a maximal interval of 5.5 years.– This finding suggests that ICD implantation is a lifelong preventive measure with life-saving interventions occurring even after particularly long phases of dormant ventricular electric instability.

### Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [^115BSJFu]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) encompasses a group of conditions characterized by right ventricular fibrofatty infiltration, with a predominant arrhythmic presentation. First described in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it is now frequently recognized to have biventricular involvement. The prevalence is ∼1:2,000 to 1:5,000, depending on geographic location, and it has a slight male predominance. The diagnosis of ARVC is determined on the basis of fulfillment of task force criteria incorporating electrophysiological parameters, cardiac imaging findings, genetic factors, and histopathologic features. Risk stratification of patients with ARVC aims to identify those who are at increased risk of sudden cardiac death or sustained ventricular tachycardia. Factors including age, sex, electrophysiological features, and cardiac imaging investigations all contribute to risk stratification. The current management of ARVC includes exercise restriction, β-blocker therapy, consideration for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator insertion, and catheter ablation. This review summarizes our current understanding of ARVC and provides clinicians with a practical approach to diagnosis and management.

Data from autopsy series and observational clinical studies on ARVC/D have provided a number of clinical predictors of adverse events and death. Table 3 reports the clinical variables identified as independent predictors of poor outcome including malignant arrhythmic events (ie, SCD, cardiac arrest due to VF, appropriate ICD interventions, or ICD therapy on fast VT/VF), non-SCD, or heart transplantation, which were found in at least one published multivariable analysis. Patients who have experienced sustained VT or VF are at highest risk of experiencing life-threatening arrhythmic events. – Unexplained syncope has been associated with an increased arrhythmic risk in some but not in all studies. Of note, unexplained syncope is defined as a loss of consciousness that: (i) occurs in the absence of documented ventricular arrhythmias and/or circumstances clearly leading to reflex-mediated changes in vascular tone or heart rate such as a micturition, defaecation, cough, or other similar conditions; and (ii) remains unexplained after a detailed clinical evaluation aimed to exclude other cardiac or extracardiac causes.

Other independent risk factors for adverse events include nonsustained VT on 24-h Holter monitoring';, dilation/dysfunction of RV, left ventricle (LV), or both;. male gender;, compound and digenic heterozygosity of desmosomal-gene mutations; young age at the time of diagnosis;, proband status; inducibility at programmed ventricular stimulation;, amount of electroanatomic scarand electroanatomic scar-related fractionated electrograms; extent of T-wave inversion across precordial and inferior leads;, low QRS amplitudeand QRS fragmentation.

HF is a late clinical manifestation of ARVC that significantly affects the quality of life. Due to the predominantly right heart phenotype and the absence of left heart‐associated symptoms, a considerable number of HF cases in ARVC patients may go unrecognized. A recent study focused on defining the prevalence of signs and symptoms of both left‐ and right‐sided HF in ARVC patients and found that 49% of them met the criteria for clinical HF. Standard HF pharmacologic therapy, including angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta‐blockers, and diuretics, can benefit these patients. In cases of end‐stage HF with recurrent refractory VAs, heart transplantation may be considered as the ultimate solution. However, the timing of evaluation, hemodynamic support options, and qualification for wait listing require careful consideration.

### Electrocardiographic effects of propofol versus etomidate in patients with Brugada syndrome [^115ZTVXb]. Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Brugada Syndrome is an inherited arrhythmogenic disease, characterized by the typical coved type ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads from V1 through V3. The BrugadaDrugs.org Advisory Board recommends avoiding administration of propofol in patients with Brugada Syndrome. Since prospective studies are lacking, it was the purpose of this study to assess the electrocardiographic effects of propofol and etomidate on the ST- and QRS-segments. In this trial, it was hypothesized that administration of propofol or etomidate in bolus for induction of anesthesia, in patients with Brugada Syndrome, do not clinically affect the ST- and QRS-segments and do not induce arrhythmias.

Methods

In this prospective, double-blinded trial, 98 patients with established Brugada syndrome were randomized to receive propofol (2 to 3 mg/kg) or etomidate (0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg) for induction of anesthesia. The primary endpoints were the changes of the ST- and QRS-segment, and the occurrence of new arrhythmias upon induction of anesthesia.

Results

The analysis included 80 patients: 43 were administered propofol and 37 etomidate. None of the patients had a ST elevation greater than or equal to 0.2 mV, one in each group had a ST elevation of 0.15 mV. An ST depression up to -0.15mV was observed eleven times with propofol and five with etomidate. A QRS-prolongation of 25% upon induction was seen in one patient with propofol and three with etomidate. This trial failed to establish any evidence to suggest that changes in either group differed, with most percentiles being zero (median [25th, 75th], 0 [0, 0] vs. 0 [0, 0]). Finally, no new arrhythmias occurred perioperatively in both groups.

Conclusions

In this trial, there does not appear to be a significant difference in electrocardiographic changes in patients with Brugada syndrome when propofol versus etomidate were administered for induction of anesthesia. This study did not investigate electrocardiographic changes related to propofol used as an infusion for maintenance of anesthesia, so future studies would be warranted before conclusions about safety of propofol infusions in patients with Brugada syndrome can be determined.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy — prolonged terminal activation duration (TAD) measurement and diagnostic performance are summarized. Prolonged TAD is measured from the nadir of the S wave to the end of all depolarization deflections, and a TAD ≥ 55 ms in any of the V1–V3 leads in the absence of CRBBB is defined as prolonged. Prolonged TAD in V1–V3 has been reported to aid in differentiating ARVC from right ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardia, was confirmed in 30 of 42 patients with ARVC and in only 1 of 27 with idiopathic RVOT-VT, and was the sole ECG abnormality in 4 of 7 gene-positive family members, suggesting a role in early recognition of "at-risk" individuals.

### Definition and treatment of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy: an updated expert panel report [^113qF8Kv]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

It is 35years since the first description of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and more than 20years since the first reports establishing desmosomal gene mutations as a major cause of the disease. Early advances in the understanding of the clinical, pathological and genetic architecture of ARVC resulted in consensus diagnostic criteria, which proved to be sensitive but not entirely specific for the disease. In more recent years, clinical and genetic data from families and the recognition of a much broader spectrum of structural disorders affecting both ventricles and associated with a propensity to ventricular arrhythmia have raised many questions about pathogenesis, disease terminology and clinical management. In this paper, we present the conclusions of an expert round table that aimed to summarise the current state of the art in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies and to define future research priorities.

6.4. Intraprocedural Hemodynamic Support

Recommendations for catheter ablation of VA with mechanical HS

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

In patients with VAs and severe comorbidities, incessant or recurrent VTs treated by multiple ICD shocks might cause end organ hypoperfusion and further deterioration in cardiac function. Planning for a VA ablation procedure, in which there is a significant risk that it will be complicated by hemodynamic deterioration, should involve specialists in heart failure. The patient's values regarding the various temporary and permanent HS options and their feasibility should be considered.
Data about strategies for HS during VT ablation are available from single and multicenter, nonrandomized, retrospective, and observational trials, which have demonstrated feasibility and safety. Mapping of nontolerated VTs can be performed for longer periods of time when HS with either percutaneous left ventricular assist device (pLVAD) (Tandem Heart, CardiacAssist, Pittsburgh, PA; and Impella, Abiomed, Danvers, MA) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is performed as opposed to no support or intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). A large retrospective multicenter report, however, has demonstrated that the use of HS was associated with higher acute ablation failure rates, increased periprocedural complications, higher mortality, and a higher rate of VT recurrence. It is possible that HS was used in patients with more severe disease in this study, and outcome data were similar between the HS and no HS groups compared with patients with severely compromised EF (≤ 20%) and advanced heart failure (NYHA class III and IV). Hence, the use of HS in these patients needs to be carefully considered. Of note, data supporting HS as a bailout strategy during or right after VT ablation are poor and do not demonstrate a benefit for procedural outcomes and survival.
The benefit of HS to allow mapping of unstable VTs needs to be weighed against the potential detrimental effects of HS, depending on the type of support that is used, including vascular damage due to large-bore venous and arterial access sites, among others. Prevention of hemodynamic deterioration during the ablation procedure by cautious use of cardiodepressive medications such as propofol could obviate the necessity for HS; also, the use of general anesthesia has been identified as a factor associated with hemodynamic deterioration and needs to be carefully considered in patients with severely impaired myocardial function. Adequate patient selection using risk assessment algorithms (see Section 5) could help to identify patients for whom HS might be beneficial.

Risk stratification

The natural history of ARVC/D is predominantly related to ventricular electrical instability which may lead to arrhythmic SCD, mostly in young people and athletes. In advanced disease, progression of RV muscle disease and left-ventricular involvement may result in right or biventricular heart failure. The available outcome studies are based on small patients cohorts followed for a relatively short follow-up period (Table 3). – The estimated overall mortality rate varies among different studies, ranging from 0.08% per year during a mean follow-up of 8.5 years in the series by Nava et al.to 3.6% per year during a mean follow-up of 4.6 years in the series by Lemola et al.

Table 3
Clinical variables associated with an increased risk of major arrhythmic events in arrhythmogenic right-ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia*

The adverse prognosis of ARVC/D patients has been initially overestimated by reports from tertiary referral centres largely composed of patients referred because of their high-risk status or severe clinical manifestations requiring specialized therapeutic interventions, such as catheter ablation or implantable defibrillator (ICD). Studies from community-based patient cohorts and clinical screening of familial ARVC/D reported a much lower overall annual mortality rates (< 1%). These latter data provide a more balanced view of the natural history of ARVC/D, in which the disease may occur with no or relatively mild disability and without the necessity for major therapeutic interventions.– The mechanism of SCD in ARVC/D is cardiac arrest due to sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF), which may occur as the first manifestation of the disease in young people without previous symptoms.

### Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: a focused update on diagnosis and risk stratification [^111QSBpk]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited cardiomyopathy characterised by fibrofatty replacement of predominantly the right ventricle and high risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Early diagnosis and accurate risk assessment are challenging yet essential for SCD prevention. This manuscript summarises the current state of the art on ARVC diagnosis and risk stratification. Improving the 2010 diagnostic criteria is an ongoing discussion. Several studies suggest that early diagnosis may be facilitated by including deformation imaging ('strain') for objective assessment of wall motion abnormalities, which was shown to have high sensitivity for preclinical disease. Adding fibrofatty replacement detected by late gadolinium enhancement or T1 mapping in cardiac MRI as criterion for diagnosis is increasingly suggested but requires more supporting evidence from consecutive patient cohorts. In addition to the traditional right-dominant ARVC, standard criteria for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) and arrhythmogenic left ventricular cardiomyopathy (ALVC) are on the horizon. After diagnosis confirmation, the primary management goal is SCD prevention, for which an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is the only proven therapy. Prior studies determined that younger age, male sex, previous (non-) sustained ventricular tachycardia, syncope, extent of T-wave inversion, frequent premature ectopic beats and lower biventricular ejection fraction are risk factors for subsequent events. Previous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator indication guidelines were however limited to three expert-opinion flow charts stratifying patients in risk groups. Now, two multivariable risk prediction models (arvcrisk.com) combine the abovementioned risk factors to estimate individual risks. Of note, both the flow charts and prediction models require clinical validation studies to determine which should be recommended.

Between the two categories there are ARVC/D patients with ≥ 1 risk factors who are deemed to have an intermediate risk (estimated annual event rate between 1 and 10%). Among the consensus experts there was general agreement that syncope, non sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), or moderate ventricular dysfunction, either RV (RV fractional area change between 24 and 17% or RV EF between 40 and 36%), or left-ventricular (LV EF between 45 and 36%), are 'major' risk factor that justify (weight of opinion in favour of ICD) a prophylactic ICD. On the other hand, there was general consensus that the other factors reported in Table 3 ('minor' risk factors) are associated with a risk of major arrhythmic events not sufficiently high (or controversial) to warrant systematic ICD implantation for primary prevention (weight of opinion against ICD). The decision to implant an ICD in patients of this category should be made on individual basis, by assessing the overall clinical profile, the age, the strength of the risk factor identified, the level of SCD risk that is acceptable to the patient, and the potential risk of inappropriate interventions and complications.

It is noteworthy that indications for ICD implantation may vary in different countries as a consequence of several non-clinical factors such as cultural background, socio-economic conditions, health system, availability of advanced technology, cost–benefit considerations, and liability. Compared with the conservative approach of many European countries, the current threshold for decision to implant an ICD in the USA is lower. It is particularly important to outline the potential risk of inappropriate ICD implants due to a false diagnosis of ARVC/D based on misinterpretation of imaging studies including cardiac magnetic resonance.

### Left ventricular dysfunction in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC): can we separate ARVC from other arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies? [^116ND5vF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an important cause of sudden cardiac death and progressive ventricular dysfunction in young adults. 1, 2 ARVC is characterized by fibrofatty myocardial replacement, which predominantly involves the right ventricle, leading to regional wall abnormalities that progress to global right ventricular (RV) dilation and dysfunction. 2 Some degree of left ventricular (LV) involvement is often observed in imaging and postmortem studies of patients with ARVC; however, the definition of LV involvement is highly variable in the literature. 3, 4, 5 More recently, the recognition of the LV dominant (without clinically demonstrable RV involvement, arrhythmogenic LV cardiomyopathy) and biventricular subtypes has broadened the disease spectrum and has led the field to use the term arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM). 6, 7 Although the prevalence of LV dysfunction has been described in only 7% to 24% of cases in large cohorts, 3, 8 some recent studies have reported LV dysfunction at 47% to 60% rates, 9, 10, 11 which is almost as high as the prevalence of LV dysfunction in LV cardiomyopathies. Thus, it is unclear whether more truly positive cases with LV dysfunction are being identified, or other diseases are being included as left‐dominant or biventricular subtypes of inherited ACM.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy — T wave inversion (TWI) distribution and diagnostic criteria are detailed. TWI in the precordial leads beyond V2 is relatively common in Afro-Caribbean individuals, whereas it is rare (1% in females and 0.2% in males) in asymptomatic white individuals. TWI in patients younger than 14 years of age is more frequently observed in athletes, while in patients older than 14 years of age it is considered a major diagnostic abnormality in ARVC. In individuals older than 14 years, TWI in leads V1–V4 associated with complete right bundle branch block (CRBBB) is a minor criterion for the diagnosis of ARVC, and TWI in lateral and/or inferior leads suggests left ventricular involvement in ARVC.

Catheter ablation is a generally safe and effective strategy to reduce sustained ventricular arrhythmia burden in patients with ARVC/D. Although the pathologic process in ARVC/D typically begins in the subepicardium, endocardial ablation seems to be effective in a considerable number of patients, potentially obviating the need for an epicardial approach in some of these patients.

Arrhythmogenic RV Cardiomyopathy

The occurrence of ARVF in patients with arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy typically arises in the later stages of the disease, often due to pronounced RV dilation and decreased myocardial contractility, and is primarily exacerbated by arrhythmic events. Although β-blockers and antiarrhythmic drugs are the cornerstones of treatment for this condition, when symptoms of low output and significant congestion are present, short-term management with inotropes and inodilators can be considered (better avoiding pure β1-adrenergic receptor agonists in the presence of a high arrhythmic burden). In cases of refractory arrhythmias and lack of response to medical therapy, venoarterial (VA)-ECMO is recommended. Heart transplant (HT) represents the gold standard in the end stages of the disease, but implantation of an off-label long-term right ventricular assist device (RVAD) has been successfully documented in small case series with significant RV decompensation in cases of lack of donors or HT contraindications.

Cardiac imaging modalities in suspected arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy — Echocardiography and other noninvasive imaging modalities are important to assess structural and functional abnormalities and aid diagnosis; two‑dimensional echocardiography enables systematic qualitative and quantitative ventricular assessment but may be limited for right ventricle (RV) imaging, while cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) provides accurate volume measurements and regional and global ventricular function. If CMR is contraindicated or unavailable, multidetector computed tomography, RV angiography, or radionuclide angiography are alternatives but are currently less frequently used for ventricular function; the Task Force Criteria for ARVC include RV akinesia, dyskinesia, or aneurysms with assessment of RVOT diameter and RV‑fractional area change, and emerging echo parameters such as tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, RV basal diameter, global longitudinal strain (RV and LV), mechanical dispersion (RV and LV), and 3D echocardiography require prospective studies before they are recommended for routine use.

Introduction

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) is an inheritable heart muscle disease that predominantly affects the right ventricle (RV) and predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). –

In the last three decades, there have been a significant number of studies defining the pathogenesis, genetic aspects, and clinical manifestations of the disease (See 'Etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and natural history' as). In 1994 and 2010, an International Task Force (ITF) document proposed guidelines for the standardized diagnosis of ARVC/D based on electrocardiographic (ECG), arrhythmic, morphological, histopathological, and clinico-genetic factors.

The growing knowledge regarding arrhythmic outcome, risk factors, and life-saving therapeutic interventions, make it particularly timely to critically address and place into perspective the issues relevant to the clinical management of ARVC/D patients. The present ITF consensus statement is a comprehensive overview of currently used risk stratification algorithms and approaches to therapy, either pharmacological or non-pharmacological, which often poses a clinical challenge to cardiovascular specialists and other practitioners, particularly those infrequently engaged in the management of ARVC/D. This document should be regarded as a guide to clinical practice where rigorous evidence is still lacking, because of the relatively low disease prevalence and the absence of controlled studies. Recommendations are based on available data derived from non-randomized and observational studies and consensus within the conference panellists. When development of prognostic-therapeutic algorithms was controversial, management decisions were recommended to be individualized.

Recommendation and level of evidence of specific management options were classified according to predefined scales, as outlined in Tables 1 and 2. Because randomized studies are not available, most consensus recommendations on treatment of ARVC/D are based on data derived from follow-up registries and/or experts opinions (i.e. level of evidence B or C).

### Treatment of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy / dysplasia: an international task force consensus statement [^113G2cJh]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The therapeutic management of patients with ARVC/D has evolved over the years and continues to be an important challenge. To further improve risk stratification and treatment of patients, more information is needed on the natural history, long-term prognosis, and risk assessment. Special attention should be focused on the identification of patients who would benefit from ICD implantation in comparison to pharmacological and other non-pharmacological approaches. Data from prospective studies/registries with larger number of patients and longer follow-up as well as data obtained from multicentre randomized controlled trials are required to provide evidence-based recommendations for the best care of ARVC/D patients.

Current therapeutic and preventive measures are palliative, not curative. The definitive cure of ARVC/D will be based on the discovery of the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) diagnostic criteria — there is no single gold standard for the diagnosis and a diagnosis requires a combination of major and minor criteria encompassing structural, histological, electrocardiographic, arrhythmogenic, and genetic factors; the task force results were published in 1994 and excluded left ventricular (LV) disease, while the 2010 revision included LV disease and added CMR. Diagnostic criteria for ARVC in the pediatric population remain to be established since disease expression in children is uncommon, and in a series of 16 patients the clinical presentation was life-threatening arrhythmia in 10 (median age of 14 years) with LV and/or RV dysfunction common; anti‑desmoglein‑2 (DSG2) antibodies were present in patients with ARVC but not in controls, and this work warrants confirmation.

### Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [^1167eMz2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular (RV) cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a cardiomyopathy characterized pathologically by fibrofatty replacement primarily of the RV and clinically by life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in apparently healthy young people. The prevalence of the disease has been estimated at 1 in 5,000 individuals, although this estimate will likely increase as awareness of the condition increases among physicians. Arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy is recognized as a cause of sudden death during athletic activity because of its association with ventricular arrhythmias that are provoked by exercise-induced catecholamine discharge. Diagnosis may be difficult because many of the electrocardiographic abnormalities mimic patterns seen in normal children, and the disease often involves only patchy areas of the RV. For this reason, international diagnostic criteria for ARVC were proposed by an expert consensus panel in 1996. Treatment is directed to preventing life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias with medications and the use of implantable defibrillators. This article will present in detail the etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of this condition.

Diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy in the paediatric population

Arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy is a genetically determined heart muscle disease characterized by a 'late-onset phenotype', which most often becomes clinically overt between the second and fourth decades of life. Clinical manifestations of the disease are very uncommon before pubertal development, whereas up to 15% of affected patients are teenagers.

Arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy is a progressive heart muscle disease with electrical and structural phenotypic manifestations occurring at different times during its natural history. It is noteworthy that progression of structural ventricular alterations can be preceded and predicted by ECG depolarization abnormalities. Whereas adult patients more often present with sustained VT, paediatric patients are more likely to experience SCD or resuscitated sudden cardiac arrest. Sudden cardiac death may be the first clinical manifestation of the disease, as it was reported by a study in the Veneto region of Italy, where 20% of SCD in young people and athletes were caused by previously undiagnosed ARVC.

The diagnosis of ARVC is particularly challenging in children < 14 years of age. Peculiarities in physiological development as well as differences in disease presentation and progression limit the use of the current criteria for diagnosis of ARVC in this age group. Diagnostic clinical work-up should be adapted to this patient population due to the difficulty of some testing modalities in paediatric patients and the low prevalence of manifest disease in very young children. In particular, basal ECG and ambulatory ECG monitoring can be performed at any age, while echocardiography is more easily performed after age 3 years and cardiac CMR after age 8 years (or in younger children but under anaesthesia) (see Supplementary material online, Text).

In a small series of patients, the addition of flecainide in combination with sotalol or metoprolol was found to be effective for controlling ventricular arrhythmias in patients with an ICD and ARVC refractory to single-agent therapy and/or catheter ablation, and overall findings suggest the potential benefit of flecainide in combination with beta-blockers for patients with refractory ventricular arrhythmias.

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy — electrophysiology testing: Electrophysiology testing in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is often unnecessary for the diagnostic evaluation of suspected arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) or arrhythmogenic left ventricular cardiomyopathy (ALVC), and multicenter implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) cohorts showed low predictive accuracy with no significant difference in "life-saving" ICD discharges between inducible and noninducible patients; in one study of 106 ARVC patients who received an ICD as primary prevention, the positive and negative predictive value for ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) inducibility was 35% and 70%, respectively. Electrophysiology testing may be beneficial for refractory ventricular arrhythmias for ablation consideration and differentiation from right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) tachycardia, and high-dose isoproterenol during electrophysiology testing may help differentiate idiopathic VT or ventricular premature beats from ARVC.

### Left ventricular dysfunction in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC): can we separate ARVC from other arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies? [^112gCnGW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy was first described as a right ventricular disease that is an important cause of death in young adults. However, with the advent of advanced imaging, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy has been found to commonly have biventricular involvement, and a small portion of patients have left ventricular-dominant forms. On the other hand, a number of primarily left ventricular disease such as sarcoid and myocarditis can be arrhythmogenic and have right ventricular involvement. A few recent publications on arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy cohorts have average left ventricular functions that are comparable to sarcoid or myocarditis cohorts. We review the current literature and compare these cohorts of patients, and call for left ventricular functional criteria for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy as inherited arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.

### 2019 HRS expert consensus statement on evaluation, risk stratification, and management of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy [^1116ztZD]. Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Diagnosis of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) requires a high degree of clinical suspicion with testing, and the clinical presentation and diagnosis of the genetically determined causes (eg, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [ARVC], lamin A/C, filamin-C, desmin) of ACM prior to puberty is uncommon. Clinical perspectives of ACM arise primarily from patients with arrhythmias of right ventricular (RV) origin and sudden cardiac death (SCD), and in the subset with ARVC, individual clinical and diagnostic findings are individually neither highly specific nor sensitive, and diagnostic criteria have been established to standardize the diagnosis. The diagnosis of ARVC should be considered in patients with exercise-related palpitations and/or syncope; survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (particularly during exercise); and individuals with frequent ventricular premature beats (> 500 in 24 hours) and/or VT of LBBB morphology in the absence of other heart disease. In patients with suspected ACM who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for ARVC, the evaluation should be systematic to establish the diagnosis of other genetic and nongenetic forms of ACM, with repeated evaluations considered if the disease is strongly suspected.

### Perioperative management of hereditary arrhythmogenic syndromes [^115C7Vpv]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with inherited cardiac channel disorders are at high risk of perioperative lethal arrhythmias. Preoperative control of symptoms and a multidisciplinary approach are required for a well-planned management. Good haemodynamic monitoring, adequate anaesthesia and analgesia, perioperative maintenance of normocarbia, normothermia, and normovolaemia are important. In congenital long QT syndrome, torsades de pointes should be prevented with magnesium sulphate infusion and avoidance of drugs such as droperidol, succinylcholine, ketamine, and ondansetron. Propofol and epidural anaesthesia represent safe choices, while caution is needed with volatile agents. In Brugada syndrome, β-blockers, α-agonists, and cholinergic drugs should be avoided, while isoproterenol reverses the ECG changes. Propofol, thiopental, and volatiles have been used uneventfully. In congenital sick sinus syndrome, severe bradycardia resistant to atropine may require isoproterenol or epinephrine. Anaesthetics with vagolytic properties are preferable, while propofol and vecuronium should be given with caution due to risk of inducing bradyarrhythmias. Neuraxial anaesthesia should produce the least autonomic imbalance. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy induces ventricular tachyarrhythmias, which should be treated with β-blockers. Generally, β-adrenergic stimulation and catecholamine release should be avoided. Halothane and pancuronium are contraindicated, while large doses of local anaesthetics and epinephrine should be avoided in neuraxial blocks. In catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, β-blocker treatment should be continued perioperatively. Catecholamine release and β-agonists, such as isoproterenol, should be avoided. Propofol and remifentanil are probably safe, while halothane and pancuronium are contraindicated. Regional anaesthesia, without epinephrine, is relatively safe. In suspicious cardiac deaths, postmortem examination and familial screening are recommended.

The published studies on ARVC/D patients that provided information about the independent predictors for major arrhythmic events (i.e. SCD, cardiac arrest due to VF, sustained VT, and appropriate ICD interventions) during follow-up (Table 3), have been used to construct three categories of risk for SCD (high, intermediate, and low) that were determined by consensus (Figure 1). The recommendations for ICD implantation for each risk category were based not only on the statistical risk, but also on the general health, socioeconomic factors, the psychological impact and the adverse effects of the device.

Figure 1
Flow chart of risk stratification and indications to ICD implantation in ARVC/D. Based on the available data on annual mortality rates associated to specific risk factors, the estimated risk of major arrhythmic events in the high-risk category is > 10%/year, in the intermediate ranges from 1 to 10%/year, and in the low-risk category is < 1%/year. Indications to ICD implantation were determined by consensus taking into account not only the statistical risk, but also the general health, socioeconomic factors, the psychological impact and the adverse effects of the device. SCD, sudden cardiac death; VF, ventricular fibrillation; VT, ventricular tachycardia; RV, right ventricle; LV, left ventricle. *See the text for distinction between major and minor risk factors.

The high-risk category includes patients who experienced cardiac arrest due to VF or sustained VT. This group of patients has an estimated rate of life-threatening arrhythmic events > 10%/year and most benefits for ICD therapy. – A prophylactic ICD implantation is also recommended in patients with severe RV dysfunction (RV fractional area change ≤ 17% or RV EF ≤ 35%) or LV dysfunction (LV EF ≤ 35%) who are considered at high risk by consensus, even in the absence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Because the specific arrhythmic risk of ventricular dysfunction is still undermined for patients with ARVC/D, the inclusion of this clinical variable into the high-risk category was based on extrapolation from other cardiomyopathies and personal experience.

The low-risk category comprises probands and relatives without risk factors as well as healthy gene carriers who show a low rate of malignant arrhythmic events (estimated annual event rate < 1%/year,) over a long-term follow-up and do not require any treatment, including ICD therapy.

Follow-up

Patients with ARVC/D should undergo lifelong clinical follow-up to periodically evaluate new onset or worsening of symptoms, progression of morphological and/or functional ventricular abnormalities, and ventricular arrhythmias in order to reassess the risk of SCD and optimize the treatment. Cardiac evaluation of affected patients including resting 12-lead ECG, echocardiography, 24-h Holter monitoring, and exercise testing (for detection of effort-induced ventricular arrhythmias) should be performed on a regular basis (every 1–2 years) depending on the age, symptoms, and disease severity.

Due to the age-related penetrance of ARVC/D, healthy gene carriers and family members should also be offered repeat clinical assessment (every 2–3 years), mostly during adolescence and young adulthood.

It is important to recognize that survival benefit of ICD treatment is obtained at the expense of significant complications during follow-up, with estimated rates of lead/device related complications and inappropriate ICD therapies of 3.7%/yr and 4.4%/yr, respectively (online-only Data Supplement, Table S2). Detailed information on ICD-related complications in the published ICD studies is provided by the recent meta-analysis by Schinkel. In the long-term study (80 ± 43 months) by Wichter et al,37 of 60 (62%) ARVC/D patients had a total of 53 serious adverse events (31 lead-related), 10 occurring during the perioperative phase and 43 during follow-up. This high rate of lead-related adverse events may be explained by the peculiar ARVC/D pathobiology which leads to progressive loss of myocardium with fibrofatty replacement, also affecting the site of RV lead implantation. In this regard, Corrado et al reported that ≈4% of ARVC/D patients required an additional septal lead owing to loss of ventricular sensing/pacing functions at the apical RV free wall during a follow-up of 3.3 years. Therefore, particular attention should be paid to progressive loss of R-wave sensing amplitude during follow-up, which may compromise adequate device function and may indicate disease progression.

Inappropriate ICD interventions occur in 10% to 25% of patients with ARVC/D, mostly at young age, and are usually caused by sinus tachycardia or atrial tachyarrhythmia (online-only Data supplement, Table S2). Inappropriate interventions are painful and may have a profound clinical and psychological impact on patients. The incidence of inappropriate ICD discharges can be lowered by appropriate ICD programmingand administration of β-blockers or sotalol. Although the use of dual-chamber detection algorithms offers the potential to reduce the number of inappropriate interventions by improving discrimination of ventricular from supraventricular arrhythmias, an additional lead in atrium predisposes to a higher incidence of early and late postoperative complications.

### The effect of anesthesia depth on radiofrequency catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia: a retrospective study [^111bMtFq]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The transition from deep sedation to general anesthesia is rather vague, Bispectral Index (BIS), a parameter derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG) parameter that was developed specifically to quantitative measure patient response during the administration of anesthetics and sedatives. It has become one of the most widely used EEG monitoring indexes in clinical. In this study, BIS values were used to distinguish the depth of anesthesia, so as to explore the influence of different anesthesia depths on the induction and prognosis of VT. Clinically, we generally consider BIS value < 40 as deep anesthesia, while BIS value > 60 as light anesthesia. In order to avoid intraoperative awareness, we always keep the BIS value at < 60 in all patients, while for BIS value > 60, whether VT is more likely to induce remains unknown. This evaluation index has not been studied in this field and may provide better guidance for anesthesiologists and electrophysiologists for RFCA. However, the BIS values are likely to be affected by other factors, resulting in inevitable inaccuracy and lag, so cerebral state index (CSI) might be a better choice.

The inducibility of arrhythmia is important, much ablation for VT targets symptomatic focal PVCs rather than sustained VT. Furthermore, entrainment mapping and searching for the earliest PP are still the most widely used techniques, which can only be used when VT induced stability. Therefore, this study showed that, to control the BIS value > 40 or higher, ensure the induction of arrhythmia and hemodynamic stability plays a very important role in reduce the recurrence of VT during ablation treatment.

It cannot be denied that, many anesthetics may inhibit induction of some arrhythmias and removes the ability to monitor neurologic status during sustained VT, and some types of VT (such as outflow tract VT caused by ARVC) are extremely sensitive to sedation. This study showed that the incidence of VT no induction in patients with ARVC was significantly higher.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) — screening, imaging, ICD, and medical therapy are recommended as follows: In selected first-degree relatives of patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, clinical screening for the disease is recommended along with genetic counseling and genetic testing, if the proband has a disease causing mutation. In patients with suspected arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and VA or electrocardiographic abnormalities, cardiac MRI is useful for establishing a diagnosis and for risk stratification. In patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and an additional marker of increased risk of SCD (resuscitated SCA, sustained VT, significant ventricular dysfunction with RVEF or LVEF ≤ 35%), an ICD is recommended if meaningful survival greater than 1 year is expected. In patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and VA, a beta blocker is recommended. All listed recommendations carry class of recommendation I and level of evidence B-NR.

Methods

Study Population

The study population consisted of 47 adult patients with ARVC/D who were enrolled in our center for catheter ablation of VT between 1998 and 2016. No patient with ARVC/D who received catheter ablation for VT at our center was excluded from this analysis. All patients had at least 1 symptomatic episode of sustained monomorphic VT documented by 12‐lead ECG, Holter monitoring, or interrogation of the ICD. All patients gave written informed consent to the ablation procedure. The local ethical committee approved this retrospective study (reference number PV5039). The diagnosis of ARVC/D was fulfilled according to the 2010 revised Task Force criteria 22 with either definite (81%) or borderline (19%) criteria. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Electrophysiologic Study

The procedure was performed in the fasting state with propofol (1–4 mg/kg per hour), midazolam, and fentanyl or sufentanyl. All antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) (except amiodarone) were discontinued for ≥ 5 half‐lives before the procedure. Two 6F diagnostic catheters were positioned in the right ventricle (RV) and within the coronary sinus. The stimulation protocol consisted of programmed stimulation from the RV at 2 drive cycle lengths (CL; 510 and 440 ms) with up to 3 extra stimuli to a minimum coupling interval of 200 ms. Burst‐pacing with the shortest CL of 250 ms was also used if induction failed with programmed stimulation. If sustained VT was non‐inducible at baseline, intravenous isoproterenol infusion (2–10 μg/min) was administered to induce VT. Clinical VT was defined as the same 12‐lead surface electrocardiogram (QRS) morphology and similar CL, or similar CL to the documented VT in patients with ICDs and without a 12‐lead ECG documentation. Other induced VT were considered as non‐clinical VT.

### Anaesthetic implications of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia / cardiomyopathy [^114R33L3]. Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, also called right ventricular cardiomyopathy, is a genetically determined heart muscle disease, characterised by life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in apparently healthy young people. The primary myocardial pathology is that the myocardium of the right ventricular free wall is replaced by fibrous or fibrofatty tissue, with scattered residual myocardial cells. Right ventricular function is abnormal and in severe cases is associated with global right ventricular dilation and overt biventricular heart failure. Although still relatively rare, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is a well recognised cause of sudden unexpected peri-operative death. In this review, we describe the basic characteristics of this disease, emphasising the diagnosis and we offer some suggestions for the anaesthetic management of these patients in the peri-operative period.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) — recommendations for evaluation and management are as follows: I B-NR: In patients with clinical diagnosis of ARVC, avoiding intensive exercise is recommended. IIa B-NR: In patients with clinically diagnosed or suspected ARVC, genetic counseling and genetic testing can be useful for diagnosis and for gene-specific targeted family screening. IIa B-NR: In patients with ARVC and syncope presumed due to VA, an ICD can be useful if meaningful survival greater than 1 year is expected. IIa B-NR: In patients with clinical evidence of ARVC but not VA, a beta blocker can be useful. IIa B-NR: In patients with ARVC and recurrent symptomatic sustained VT in whom a beta blocker is ineffective or not tolerated, catheter ablation with availability of a combined endocardial/epicardial approach can be beneficial. IIa B-NR: In patients with suspected ARVC, a signal averaged ECG can be useful for diagnosis and risk stratification. IIb B-NR: In asymptomatic patients with clinical evidence of ARVC, an electrophysiological study may be considered for risk stratification.

### Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia / cardiomyopathy: screening, diagnosis, and treatment [^115ipy8M]. Heart Rhythm (2006). Low credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is a heart muscle disorder characterized pathologically by fatty or fibrofatty replacement and electrical instability of the right ventricular myocardium. Clinical manifestations include structural and functional malformations (fatty infiltration, dilatation, aneurysms) of the right ventricle, ECG abnormalities, and presentation with ventricular tachycardias with left bundle branch block pattern or sudden death. The disease often is familial with an autosomal inheritance. The typical hallmarks of ARVD/C are distributed in the so-called "triangle of dysplasia". The functional and morphologic characteristics are relevant to clinical imaging approaches such as contrast angiography, echocardiography, radionuclide angiography, ultrafast computed tomography, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Evident forms of the disease are straightforward to diagnose based on a series of diagnostic criteria proposed by the International Task Force for Cardiomyopathy. However, the diagnosis of early and mild forms of the disease often is difficult. Treatment is directed toward preventing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in which radiofrequency ablation and implantable defibrillators play an increasing role. Despite new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in ARVD/C, uncertainties about the etiology of the disease, the genetic basis, the appropriate diagnosis and therapy, and the clinical course of patients with ARVD/C have resulted in several registries to increase our knowledge of this intriguing disease.

### Deep sedation options during cardioversion… [^115FzcCA]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Adults undergoing cardioversion in an emergency department for atrial fibrillation or flutter, who were relatively hemodynamically stable and fasting for at least four hours, were included in the study. Patients were randomized to sedation, overseen by an anesthesiologist, of one of the following regimens: etomidate in a dosage of 0. 2 mg per kg; propofol,

1. 5 mg per kg; midazolam, 0. 2 mg per kg; or midazolam followed by flumazenil,
0. 5 mg in a bolus followed by 0. 5 mg in intravenous perfusion over one hour, after the cardioversion was performed. Of the 32 randomized patients enrolled in the study, the group receiving midazolam was most likely to require extra medication to achieve induction. Hemodynamic assessment was the same among all groups throughout the procedure. None of the patients required intubation. More patients receiving etomidate had transient episodes of myoclonus. No clinically consequential adverse events occurred.

Propofol provided the best response, including short induction, rapid awakening, rapid recuperation, and minimal adverse effects. No significant hypotension was noted, probably because of the hemodynamic stability of the patients and because of the slow drug administration. Transient apnea and hypoventilation occurred with all drugs, suggesting the need for available ventilatory support. Midazolam is known to be relatively hemodynamically safe, but recovery periods were longer. Flumazenil reduces this lengthened recovery period and the possibility of resedation, but there is general agreement that its use should be reserved for patients in whom the sedative response may compromise respiratory function. The authors conclude that propofol is the superior sedative for emergency cardioversion of hemodynamically stable patients. They recommend that further studies be conducted. Other articles in the same issue further document this support for propofol sedation.

Basset and associates show that propofol sedation is effective and safe in children in emergency settings, assuming that monitoring is performed for transient cardiopulmonary depression. An accompanying editorial by Green and Krauss points out that the difficulty of appropriately titrating a fast-acting sedative like propofol requires anesthesiologist supervision to avoid potentially overshooting the sedation goal. The optimal use of propofol is probably for brief, intensely painful procedures. Further studies are encouraged.

Electrophysiological Study

Electrophysiological study (EPS) is a valuable diagnostic test for differential diagnosis between ARVC/D and idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia and may provide useful information regarding the VT inducibility for optimization of detection/discrimination algorithms and effective antitachycardia pacing protocols in patients undergoing ICD implantation. However, conflicting data exist concerning the role of inducibility of sustained VT or VF for prediction of long-term arrhythmic outcome in ARVC/D patients. Discrepancies between the study results may be explained by differences in arrhythmic endpoints (ie, life-saving versus any appropriate ICD discharge).

The largest multicentre studies on ARVC/D patients who received an ICD demonstrated that EPS is of limited value in identifying patients at risk of arrhythmic cardiac arrest because of its low predictive accuracy. In these studies, the reported incidence of 'life-saving' ICD discharges for treatment of fast VT or VF did not differ significantly in patients who were and were not inducible at EPS, regardless of the specific indication for ICD implantation. The study by Corrado et alon the outcome of 106 ARVC/D patients receiving an ICD for primary prevention reported that the positive and negative predictive value of inducibility for VT or VF was 35 and 70%, respectively. In this study, the type of ventricular tachyarrhythmia inducible at the time of EPS (ie, VT or VF) did not predict a statistically different arrhythmic outcome over the follow-up. The North American Multidisciplinary study on 98 ARVC patients receiving an ICD confirmed that inducible VT or VF at preimplant EPS did not predict appropriate interventions on fast VT or VF during a mean follow-up of 3.3 years. On the contrary, in the cohort of ARVC/D patients reported in the Johns Hopkins studies, inducibility was the most significant independent predictor of appropriate ICD firing. However, in the study by Bhonsale et althe positive and negative predictive values of inducibility were 65 and 75%, respectively, and a sizeable proportion of patients experienced ICD interventions during follow-up despite a lack of inducibility of VT/VF. Moreover, the predictive value of inducibility for 'life-saving' ICD discharges was not demonstrated by either univariate or multivariate analysis. In asymptomatic patients, Bhonsale et alreported that the combination of ≥ 2 factors such as inducibility at EPS, proband status, nonsustained VT, and PVCs ≥ 1000/24 h, predicts an incremental risk of appropriate ICD interventions; however, a statistically significant association with life-saving shocks for treatment of rapid VT or VF has not been demonstrated. In the study by Saguner et alinducible VT was an independent predictor of composite end point including cardiac death, heart transplantation, unstable VT/VF, and syncope.

Beta-blockers

Ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest in ARVC/D are frequently triggered by adrenergic stimulation and occur during or immediately after physical exercise. Autonomic dysfunction with increased sympathetic stimulation of ventricular myocardium and subsequent reduction of β-adrenoceptor density was demonstrated by Wichter et al, with the use of radionuclide imaging and quantitative positron emission tomography.

The indication for the use of β-blocker drugs in ARVC/D relies on their proven efficacy to prevent effort-induced ventricular arrhythmias, their proven efficacy in heart failure management, and their potential but unproven ability to hinder myocardial disease progression by lowering RV wall stress.

Because studies are not available to compare the efficacy of individual β-blockers and to define the most effective dosage, we recommend using nonvasodilating β-blockers titrated to maximum tolerated dose for age and weight.

Implantable defibrillator therapy

Implantable defibrillator therapy is the most logical therapeutic strategy for patients with ARVC/D, because the natural history is primarily characterized by the risk of SCD and, only secondarily, by contractile dysfunction leading to progressive heart failure. Prospective randomized trials are currently not available for ethical reasons and because of practical limitations predominantly linked to relatively low disease prevalence and low event rate. The available data, coming from observational studies/registries of large populations of ARVC/D patients, have established efficacy and safety of ICD therapy. The main results of available studies on ICD therapy in ARVC/D are summarized in. These studies consistently document that ICD successfully interrupts lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias and improves long-term outcome of selected high-risk ARVC/D patients. Overall, between 48 and 78% of patients received appropriate ICD interventions during a mean follow-up period of 2–7 years after implantation. Many of these patients experienced multiple ICD discharges during this period and VT storm was not infrequently reported. In most studies, the survival benefit of the ICD was evaluated by comparing the actual patient survival rate with the projected freedom of ICD interventions for fast VT (> 240 b.p.m.) or VF (i.e. 'life- saving' ICD interventions), which were used as a surrogate for aborted SCD, based on the assumption that these tachyarrhythmias would have been fatal without termination by the device. The endpoint was reached by device interrogation and review of stored electrocardiograms regarding ICD interventions in response to fast VT/VF during follow-up. In the largest multicentre study, the fast VT/VF-free survival rate was 72% at 36 months compared with the actual patient survival of 98%, with an estimated survival benefit of 26%. The largest single-centre experience found an estimated improvement of overall survival of 23, 32 and 35% after 1, 3 and 7 years of follow-up, respectively. These results were confirmed by other series reporting rates of life-saving ICD interventions in 30–50% of patients during follow-up. Despite the relatively short follow-up of the available studies, the time between implantation and the first appropriate discharge was ≥ 1 year in a large proportion of patients with a maximal interval of 5.5 years.– This finding suggests that ICD implantation is a lifelong preventive measure with life-saving interventions occurring even after particularly long phases of dormant ventricular electrical instability.

### A new prediction model for ventricular arrhythmias in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [^116K8utw]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited cardiomyopathy characterized by progressive fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium which predisposes patients to ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Once the diagnosis is established, a primary goal of management is prevention of SCD, for which implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are a common consideration. There is agreement that most ARVC patients with a prior history of sustained VA or resuscitated sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) benefit from secondary prevention ICDs. However, for the primary prevention population, there is no established risk stratification scheme.

Over the past two decades, multiple attempts have been made to identify factors associated with VA in this clinically challenging population. While these studies have significantly contributed to our understanding of clinical, demographic, and behavioural factors associated with arrhythmic risk, the relatively small patient populations provided insufficient statistical power to assess the independent predictive value of potentially correlated risk factors.

To overcome this important limitation, we assembled a large cohort of patients with ARVC from five registries (Johns Hopkins, Dutch, Nordic, Swiss, and Canadian) without a history of sustained VAs at baseline. Our aim was (i) to develop a model for individualized prediction of incident sustained VA in patients with ARVC using readily available clinical variables; and (ii) to compare this new model to a current consensus-based ICD placement algorithm.

It is important to recognize that survival benefit of ICD treatment is obtained at the expense of significant complications during follow-up, with estimated rates of lead/device related complications and inappropriate ICD therapies of 3.7%/year and 4.4%/year, respectively (see). Detailed information on ICD-related complications in the published ICD studies is provided by the recent meta-analysis by Schinkel. In the long-term study (80 ± 43 months) by Wichter et al.37 of 60 (62%) ARVC/D patients had a total of 53 serious adverse events (31 lead-related), 10 occurring during the perioperative phase and 43 during follow-up. This high rate of lead-related adverse events may be explained by the peculiar ARVC/D pathobiology which leads to progressive loss of myocardium with fibrofatty replacement, also affecting the site of RV lead implantation. In this regard, Corrado et al. reported that ∼4% of ARVC/D patients required an additional septal lead owing to loss of ventricular sensing/pacing functions at the apical RV free wall during a follow-up of 3.3 years. Therefore, particular attention should be paid to progressive loss of R-wave sensing amplitude during follow-up, which may compromise adequate device function and may indicate disease progression.

Inappropriate ICD interventions occur in 10–25% of patients with ARVC/D, mostly at young age, and are usually caused by sinus tachycardia or atrial tachyarrhythmia (see). Inappropriate interventions are painful and may have a profound clinical and psychological impact on patients. The incidence of inappropriate ICD discharges can be lowered by appropriate ICD programmingand administration of beta-blockers or sotalol. Although the use of dual-chamber detection algorithms offers the potential to reduce the number of inappropriate interventions by improving discrimination of ventricular from supraventricular arrhythmias, an additional lead in atrium predisposes to a higher incidence of early and late post-operative complications.

### Ventricular tachycardia converts to sinus rhythm after administration of propofol [^115bX41J]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a major contributor to sudden cardiac death, and pharmacologic treatment options beyond antiarrhythmics are limited. Emerging data suggest sympathetic blocking agents such as propofol are a potential management option for VT refractory to first line antiarrhythmics. Previous literature has described fixed-dose propofol boluses and continuous infusions to convert ventricular arrhythmias; however, to our knowledge, there are no reports of a weight-based dosing strategy for VT. We present the case of a patient with amiodarone-refractory VT who received a 1 mg/kg propofol bolus in preparation for cardioversion and subsequently converted to normal sinus rhythm. The patient stabilized following these interventions, transferred to a tertiary care facility, and was discharged home with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.

Indications for ICD Implantation

The published studies on ARVC/D patients that provided information about the independent predictors for major arrhythmic events (ie, SCD, cardiac arrest due to VF, sustained VT, and appropriate ICD interventions) during follow-up (Table 3), have been used to construct three categories of risk for SCD (high, intermediate, and low) that were determined by consensus (Figure). The recommendations for ICD implantation for each risk category were based not only on the statistical risk, but also on the general health, socioeconomic factors, the psychological impact and the adverse effects of the device.

Figure 1.
Flow chart of risk stratification and indications to ICD implantation in ARVC/D. Based on the available data on annual mortality rates associated to specific risk factors, the estimated risk of major arrhythmic events in the high-risk category is > 10%/yr, in the intermediate ranges from 1 to 10%/yr, and in the low-risk category is < 1%/yr. Indications to ICD implantation were determined by consensus taking into account not only the statistical risk, but also the general health, socioeconomic factors, the psychological impact and the adverse effects of the device. SCD, sudden cardiac death; VF, ventricular fibrillation; VT, ventricular tachycardia; RV, right ventricle; and LV, left ventricle. *See the text for distinction between major and minor risk factors.

The high-risk category includes patients who experienced cardiac arrest due to VF or sustained VT. This group of patients has an estimated rate of life-threatening arrhythmic events > 10%/yr and most benefits for ICD therapy. – A prophylactic ICD implantation is also recommended in patients with severe RV dysfunction (RV fractional area change ≤ 17% or RV EF ≤ 35%) or LV dysfunction (LV EF ≤ 35%) who are considered at high risk by consensus, even in the absence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Because the specific arrhythmic risk of ventricular dysfunction is still undermined for patients with ARVC/D, the inclusion of this clinical variable into the high-risk category was based on extrapolation from other cardiomyopathies and personal experience.

The low-risk category comprises probands and relatives without risk factors as well as healthy gene carriers who show a low rate of malignant arrhythmic events (estimated annual event rate < 1%/year,) over a long-term follow-up and do not require any treatment, including ICD therapy.

### Left ventricular dysfunction in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC): can we separate ARVC from other arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies? [^113SVxSi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy was first described as a right ventricular disease that is an important cause of death in young adults. However, with the advent of advanced imaging, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy has been found to commonly have biventricular involvement, and a small portion of patients have left ventricular–dominant forms. On the other hand, a number of primarily left ventricular disease such as sarcoid and myocarditis can be arrhythmogenic and have right ventricular involvement. A few recent publications on arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy cohorts have average left ventricular functions that are comparable to sarcoid or myocarditis cohorts. We review the current literature and compare these cohorts of patients, and call for left ventricular functional criteria for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy as inherited arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy — goals and limits of ablation. Catheter ablation for patients with ARVC should not be considered curative for the underlying arrhythmogenic substrate and is ultimately aimed at improving quality of life by limiting symptomatic ectopy, sustained arrhythmia, and especially ICD therapies, and there are insufficient data showing disease progression is affected, sudden death is prevented, or mortality is reduced. Current technology and techniques suggest that electroanatomical mapping supports better outcomes, which is routinely employed at all major centers.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy — key guideline recommendations (with COR/LOE) are as follows: In patients with clinical diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, avoiding intense exercise is recommended (COR I, LOE B-NR). In patients with clinically diagnosed or suspected arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, genetic counseling and genetic testing can be useful for diagnosis and for gene-specific targeted family screening (COR IIa, LOE B-NR). In patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and syncope presumed due to VA, an ICD can be useful if meaningful survival greater than 1 year is expected (COR IIa, LOE B-NR). In patients with clinical evidence of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy but not VA, a beta blocker can be useful (COR IIa, LOE B-NR). In patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and recurrent symptomatic sustained VT in whom a beta blocker is ineffective or not tolerated, catheter ablation with availability of a combined endocardial/epicardial approach can be beneficial (COR IIa, LOE B-NR). In patients with suspected arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, a signal averaged ECG can be useful for diagnosis and risk stratification (COR IIa, LOE B-NR). In asymptomatic patients with clinical evidence of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, an electrophysiological study may be considered for risk stratification (COR IIb, LOE B-NR).

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) — syncope management: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation is recommended in patients with ARVC who present with syncope and have a documented sustained ventricular arrhythmia (VA), and ICD implantation is reasonable in patients with ARVC who present with syncope of suspected arrhythmic etiology. ICD indications in patients with ARVC and sustained VA are no different than guidelines-based indications for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in other diseases, and unexplained or arrhythmic-appearing syncope in patients with ARVC has consistently been associated with increased risk of SCD or appropriate therapy after ICD implantation in observational studies.
