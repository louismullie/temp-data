## Question

Why would a patients blood pressure drop and face turn white after laceration

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why blood pressure drops and facial pallor occurs after a laceration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about acute blood loss causing hypovolemia and reduced venous return. Then, I should verify how this translates to decreased cardiac output and arterial pressure via Frank-Starling physiology. Next, I will examine baroreflex-mediated sympathetic activation and the redistribution of blood flow. After that, I need to link cutaneous vasoconstriction to the visible sign of facial pallor. Then, I should integrate severity-dependent responses and the role of indices like the shock index. Finally, I will distinguish this hemorrhagic physiology from vasovagal syncope and synthesize the clinical picture with relevant caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the primary insult: a laceration with acute hemorrhage causes an immediate reduction in circulating intravascular volume, i.e., hypovolemia, which diminishes venous return to the heart and initiates a hemorrhagic shock physiology when sufficiently severe.

> I need to check the hemodynamic consequences next: decreased venous return lowers preload, which via the Frank-Starling relationship reduces stroke volume; since cardiac output equals stroke volume times heart rate, cardiac output falls, and because arterial pressure is a function of cardiac output times systemic vascular resistance, mean arterial pressure declines accordingly, with hypotension becoming more apparent as compensation fails; importantly, systolic blood pressure thresholds are insensitive in moderate hemorrhage and become evident mostly with severe blood loss, so normal-ish pressures early do not exclude shock.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about hypotension alone reflecting perfusion; baroreflex sensing of falling arterial pressure at the carotid sinus and aortic arch triggers sympathetic activation with catecholamine release to defend pressure and perfusion, and it is well recognized that patients can have preserved blood pressure yet markers of inadequate tissue perfusion such as elevated lactate, so I should confirm that hypotension signals decompensation rather than early shock per se [^114jCT4Q].

> Next, I should review the redistribution of blood flow caused by sympathetic outflow; let me think this through: alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction is pronounced in cutaneous, splanchnic, and renal beds to maintain perfusion to the brain and heart, trading peripheral perfusion for core organ flow as systemic vascular resistance rises, a hallmark of compensatory shock physiology [^111zdQkH].

> I will now examine the mechanism of facial pallor; wait, let me verify that the face is an easily visible window to changes in cutaneous perfusion: intense sympathetic-mediated vasoconstriction of superficial arterioles limits skin blood flow and oxyhemoglobin content, making the face appear pale, and pallor is indeed cataloged among classic signs of traumatic hemorrhage.

> Let me integrate this: the drop in blood pressure reflects declining cardiac output overwhelming compensatory vasoconstriction, while the facial pallor is the visible cost of that compensation as cutaneous flow is sacrificed to preserve vital organ perfusion; this creates creates the classic shock phenotype of hypotension, tachycardia, cool clammy skin, and altered mentation when decompensation ensues — wait, I repeated that; to be precise, this creates the classic shock phenotype with hypotension appearing late, and cool pale skin often manifesting earlier due to high sympathetic tone [^111zdQkH].

> I should double-check how severity modulates the presentation: with approximately 15–30% blood volume loss, compensatory mechanisms can maintain near-normal pressures while producing tachycardia and pallor; beyond roughly 30–40%, hypotension becomes more likely as compensation fails, which aligns with consensus statements noting that hypotension is a late and insensitive marker for moderate hemorrhage; although the shock index can be more sensitive than heart rate or systolic pressure alone in early hypovolemia, I need to ensure balance here, because newer data suggest compensatory reserve measurement can outperform shock index as an earlier signal of decompensation risk [^111zdQkH] [^1155LsgQ] [^1128Prr4].

> But wait, what if the presentation is vasovagal rather than hemorrhagic; let me reconsider the mechanism: traditional descriptions emphasize vasodilation with vagally mediated bradycardia causing hypotension and pallor, yet later invasive and beat-to-beat studies indicate that a fall in cardiac output often precedes major vasodilation during vasovagal syncope, so the net effect is different from hemorrhagic shock in which sympathetic vasoconstriction predominates; clinically, the laceration context, tachycardia, cool pale skin, and signs of hypovolemia point toward hemorrhagic physiology rather than the bradycardic, vasodepressor pattern typical of vasovagal episodes [^11475JTs].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical synthesis is sound: after a laceration, acute volume loss lowers preload and cardiac output, baroreflex-driven sympathetic responses initially defend arterial pressure by raising systemic vascular resistance and shunting blood centrally, and the visible sign is facial pallor from cutaneous vasoconstriction; overt hypotension signals that compensatory mechanisms are failing, so clinicians should not rely on blood pressure alone but also on global perfusion markers and trajectory, recognizing that prompt hemorrhage control and hemostatic resuscitation are essential as the physiology transitions from compensation to decompensation [^111zdQkH] [^114jCT4Q] [^1128vTi8].

A patient's blood pressure may drop and their face turn white following a laceration due to **hypovolemic shock from blood loss** [^111ZzRDs] and **vasovagal syncope from pain or fear** [^11475JTs]. Blood loss reduces circulating volume, lowering cardiac output and blood pressure [^114r2PNn], while **sympathetic vasoconstriction** [^117AiAzA] diverts blood from the skin, causing pallor [^111zdQkH]. Pain or emotional stress can trigger a vasovagal response [^11475JTs], causing bradycardia and vasodilation, further lowering blood pressure and reducing skin perfusion. Immediate management includes controlling bleeding [^1128vTi8], positioning the patient supine with legs elevated, and monitoring vital signs to prevent progression to shock.

### Physiological mechanisms involved

#### Hypovolemic shock

Significant blood loss from a laceration acutely reduces intravascular volume, causing hypovolemia [^111ZzRDs]. The resulting fall in venous return lowers stroke volume and cardiac output, leading to **hypotension** [^114r2PNn]. Compensatory peripheral vasoconstriction diverts blood to vital organs (brain, heart, kidneys), which manifests as cutaneous pallor [^111zdQkH].

---

#### Vasovagal syncope

Pain or emotional stress from a laceration may trigger a vasovagal reflex. Increased parasympathetic outflow causes **bradycardia** and peripheral vasodilation, abruptly lowering blood pressure [^11475JTs]. The resulting reduction in cerebral perfusion leads to dizziness, syncope, and pallor [^113M8Dww].

---

### Clinical signs and symptoms

Patients with **hypotension and pallor** following a laceration may exhibit the following signs and symptoms:

- **Dizziness or lightheadedness**: Due to reduced cerebral perfusion [^11475JTs].
- **Weak or rapid pulse**: Compensatory tachycardia or bradycardia from vasovagal response [^1155LsgQ].
- **Cold, clammy skin**: Resulting from peripheral vasoconstriction [^111ZzRDs].
- **Sweating**: Common in shock or vasovagal episodes [^114r2PNn].
- **Confusion or altered mental status**: Due to inadequate cerebral perfusion.

---

### Immediate medical interventions

Prompt medical intervention is crucial to prevent progression to **severe shock** or other complications:

- **Control bleeding**: Apply direct pressure, elevate the injured limb, and use tourniquets if necessary [^1128vTi8].
- **Positioning**: Place the patient supine with legs elevated (Trendelenburg position) to improve venous return and cardiac output [^111ZzRDs].
- **Fluid resuscitation**: Administer intravenous fluids (crystalloids) to restore blood volume and stabilize blood pressure [^111zdQkH].
- **Monitor vital signs**: Continuously monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation [^1128Prr4].
- **Oxygen therapy**: Provide supplemental oxygen to improve tissue oxygenation.
- **Address underlying causes**: Treat pain, anxiety, or other triggers of vasovagal syncope [^11475JTs].

---

### Potential complications if untreated

If hypotension and pallor following a laceration are not promptly addressed, **several complications may arise**:

- **Progression to severe shock**: Leading to multi-organ failure and death [^111ZzRDs].
- **Hypoperfusion-related organ damage**: Including renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, and neurological impairment.
- **Increased risk of infection**: Due to impaired immune response and tissue perfusion [^1128vTi8].
- **Delayed wound healing**: Resulting from inadequate blood supply to the injured area [^114r2PNn].

---

### Conclusion

A patient's blood pressure may drop and their face become pale following a laceration due to **hypovolemic shock** [^111ZzRDs] from blood loss and **vasovagal syncope** [^11475JTs] from pain or emotional stress. Immediate medical intervention is **essential** to prevent severe complications and ensure patient safety.

### Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring. Task force of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^111zdQkH]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Hypotension and shock

The diagnostic accuracy of a systolic blood pressure of < 95 mmHg associated with acute blood loss was assessed by Stern et al. in a systematic evaluation of physical findings in patients with hypovolemia. A random effects model produced a sensitivity of 13% for moderate blood loss and 33% for severe blood loss. The authors concluded that a systolic blood pressure of < 95 mmHg is not a sensitive measure for ruling out moderate or significant blood loss. A decrease in cardiac output is associated with significant vasoconstriction, leading to decreased peripheral perfusion to maintain arterial pressure. The presence of hypotension is generally included in the diagnosis of septic shock, but several studies have shown that preserved blood pressure can be associated with markers of inadequate tissue perfusion, such as decreased central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO₂) and significantly increased concentrations of blood lactate. Moreover, persistent hypotension in patients with septic shock without increased lactate levels may have a limited impact on mortality.

The definition of circulatory shock emerging from this consensus conference does not require the presence of hypotension. Instead, the definition of shock as a "life-threatening, generalized form of acute circulatory failure associated with inadequate oxygen utilization by the cells" usually includes, but is not limited to, the presence of hypotension. We recommend that the presence of arterial hypotension, defined as systolic blood pressure of < 90 mmHg, or mean arterial pressure.

### Cardiac output and vasodilation in the vasovagal response: An analysis of the classic papers [^11475JTs]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

The simple faint is secondary to hypotension and bradycardia, resulting in a transient loss of consciousness. According to Ohm's law applied to the circulation, BP = SVR × CO, hypotension can result from a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR), cardiac output (CO), or both. It is important to understand that when blood pressure (BP) is falling, SVR and CO do not change reciprocally as they do in the steady state.

In 1932, Lewis, assuming that decreased SVR alone accounted for hypotension, defined "the vasovagal response" along pathophysiologic lines to denote the association of vasodilation with vagal-induced bradycardia in simple faint.

- **Barcroft and Sharpey-Schafer studies**: Performed between 1940 and 1950 using volume-based plethysmography to demonstrate major forearm vasodilation during extreme hypotension. They concluded that the main mechanism for hypotension was vasodilation. Plethysmographic measurements were intermittent and not frequent enough to capture rapid changes in blood flow during progressive hypotension.

- **Later investigations by Weissler, Murray, and Stevens**: Conducted between 1950 and 1970 using invasive beat-to-beat BP measurements and more frequent measurements of CO using the Fick principle. They demonstrated that CO significantly fell before syncope, and little vasodilation occurred until very late in the vasovagal reaction.

Thus, since the 1970s, decreasing cardiac output rather than vasodilation has been regarded as the principal mechanism for the hypotension of vasovagal syncope.

Traumatic hemorrhage is a critical condition that can be associated with various symptoms and complications, including hypotension, excessive sweating, cyanosis, oliguria, pallor, and difficulty breathing. Additional signs can include increased capillary refill time, traumatic injury, chest pain, anxiety, confusion, dizziness, and coagulopathy. Patients may also experience hemorrhagic shock, sinus tachycardia, a weak pulse, altered mental status, and shock.

### Sodium nitroprusside [^1127Fjae]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Avoidance of excessive hypotension: While the average effective rate in adult and pediatric patients is about 3 mcg/kg/min, some patients will become dangerously hypotensive when they receive sodium nitroprusside injection at this rate. Infusion of sodium nitroprusside should therefore be started at a very low rate (0.3 mcg/kg/min), with upward titration every few minutes until the desired effect is achieved or the maximum recommended infusion rate (10 mcg/kg/min) has been reached.

Because sodium nitroprusside's hypotensive effect is very rapid in onset and in dissipation, small variations in infusion rate can lead to wide, undesirable variations in blood pressure. Since there is inherent variation in blood pressure measurement, confirm the drug effect at any infusion rate after an additional 5 minutes before titrating to a higher dose to achieve the desired blood pressure. Sodium nitroprusside should not be infused through ordinary I.V. apparatus, regulated only by gravity and mechanical clamps. Only an infusion pump, preferably a volumetric pump, should be used.

Because sodium nitroprusside can induce essentially unlimited blood-pressure reduction, the blood pressure of a patient receiving this drug must be continuously monitored using either a continually reinflated sphygmomanometer or (preferably) an intra-arterial pressure sensor. Special caution should be used in elderly patients since they may be more sensitive to the hypotensive effects of the drug.

### Comparison of non-invasive and invasive blood pressure in aeromedical care [^113eSjtj]. Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Blood pressure measurement is an essential physiological measurement for all critically ill patients. Previous work has shown that non-invasive blood pressure is not an accurate reflection of invasive blood pressure measurement. In a transport environment, the effects of motion and vibration may make non-invasive blood pressure less accurate. Consecutive critically ill patients transported by a dedicated aeromedical retrieval and critical care transfer service with simultaneous invasive and non-invasive blood pressure measurements were analysed. Two sets of measurements were recorded, first in a hospital environment before departure (pre-flight) and a second during aeromedical transport (in-flight). A total of 56 complete sets of data were analysed. Bland-Altman plots showed limits of agreement (precision) for pre-flight systolic blood pressure were -37.3mmHg to 30.0mmHg, and for pre-flight mean arterial pressure -20.5mmHg to 25.0mmHg. The limits of agreement for in-flight systolic blood pressure were -40.6mmHg to 33.1mmHg, while those for in-flight mean blood pressure were -23.6mmHg to 24.6mmHg. The bias for the four conditions ranged from 0.5 to -3.8 mmHg. There were no significant differences in values between pre-flight and in-flight blood pressure measurements for all categories of blood pressure measurement. Thus, our data show that non-invasive blood pressure is not a precise reflection of invasive intra-arterial blood pressure. Mean blood pressure measured non-invasively may be a better marker of invasive blood pressure than systolic blood pressure.

### Major haemorrhage: past, present and future [^1143KRY9]. Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

Definitions of major haemorrhage, particularly in trauma scenarios, have traditionally varied. Some definitions include the loss of more than one circulating blood volume within 24 hours, which equates to around 70 ml.kg⁻¹, or approximately 5 liters in a 70 kg adult. Another definition is the loss of 50% of the total blood volume in a shorter time period. Observable physiological changes, such as heart rate exceeding 110 beats per minute, can indicate major haemorrhage. However, in certain patient groups — such as older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients on beta-blockers — these physiological changes may be obscured.

Definitions also differ among various patient populations. In obstetrics, postpartum haemorrhage is defined as blood loss greater than 500 mL from the genital tract within 24 hours of delivery. This is further categorized into minor haemorrhage (500–1000 ml) and major haemorrhage (> 1000 ml). Major haemorrhage is further divided into moderate (1000–2000 ml) and severe (> 2000 ml) categories. In patients experiencing upper and/or lower gastrointestinal bleeding, various risk scores have been validated to stratify the severity of haemorrhage.

### Emerging treatment strategies for trauma-induced coagulopathy [^114RvD9k]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Trauma-induced coagulopathy has a multifactorial etiology. It is related to blood loss, including consumption of clotting factors and platelets, and hemodilution. Additionally, hyperfibrinolysis, hypothermia, acidosis, and metabolic changes affect the coagulation system.

- **Methods**: This is a review of pathophysiology and new treatment strategies for trauma-induced coagulopathy.

- **Results**: Paradigms are actively changing, and there is still a shortage of data. The aim of any hemostatic therapy is to control bleeding and minimize blood loss and transfusion requirements. Transfusion of allogeneic blood products, as well as trauma-induced coagulopathy, causes increased morbidity and mortality. Opinion is based on present studies and results from small case series, combined with findings from experimental studies in animals, in vitro studies, and expert opinions, as opposed to large, randomized, placebo-controlled studies. A summary of new and emerging strategies, including medical infusion and blood products, to beneficially manipulate the coagulation system in the critically injured patient is suggested.

- **Conclusion**: Future treatment of trauma-induced coagulopathy may be based on systemic antifibrinolytics, local hemostatics, and individualized point-of-care-guided rational use of coagulation factor concentrates such as fibrinogen, prothrombin complex concentrate, recombinant factor VIIa, and factor XIII. The authors speculate that timely and rational use of coagulation factor concentrates will be more efficacious and safer than ratio-driven use of transfusions.

### Blood pressure measurement in volunteers with and without padding between the cuff and the skin [^114gmqZ8]. Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Automated non-invasive arterial blood pressure measurements are frequently made during anaesthesia. Conscious patients often find the measurement uncomfortable. The tissues under the cuff can suffer trauma, such as skin creasing, blistering, petechial haemorrhages, and even nerve damage. We placed soft padding between the blood pressure measurement cuff and the skin of the upper arm of 140 healthy volunteers and compared cuff-related skin trauma and arterial blood pressure measurements with and without the padding. Padding was associated with a significant reduction in the frequency and intensity of skin trauma (p < 0.0001). There was no significant overall effect of the presence of padding on arterial blood pressure readings. We conclude that the benefit of padding outweighs any compromise to the reliability of arterial blood pressure measurement.

### The Bainbridge and the "reverse" Bainbridge reflexes: history, physiology, and clinical relevance [^113AGFma]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2012). Low credibility.

Francis A. Bainbridge demonstrated in 1915 that an infusion of saline or blood into the jugular vein of the anesthetized dog produced tachycardia. His findings after transection of the cardiac autonomic nerve supply and injection of the cholinergic blocking drug atropine demonstrated that the tachycardia was reflex in origin, with the vagus nerves constituting the afferent limb and a withdrawal of vagal tone the primary efferent limb. Subsequent investigators demonstrated that the increase in venous return was detected by stretch receptors in the right and left atria.

In the 1980s, it was shown convincingly that the Bainbridge reflex was present in primates, including humans, but that the reflex was much less prominent than in the dog. This difference may be due to a more dominant arterial baroreceptor reflex in humans. A "reverse" Bainbridge reflex has been proposed to explain the decreases in heart rate observed under conditions in which venous return is reduced, such as during spinal and epidural anesthesia, controlled hypotension, and severe hemorrhage.

The Bainbridge reflex is invoked throughout the anesthesia literature to describe the effect of changes in venous return on heart rate in patients in surgical and critical care settings, but a critical analysis of the experimental and clinical evidence is lacking. Our main objectives in this review are to summarize the history of the Bainbridge reflex, describe its anatomy and physiology, and discuss the evidence for and against it having an influence on heart rate changes observed clinically.

### Diagnosis and management of mild bleeding disorders [^111ZHhFD]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Mild bleeding disorders are a common reason for referral to a hematologist, and these conditions can be challenging to evaluate. Recent research has highlighted that some bleeding symptoms are quite common in the general population and that there is clinical variability in symptom expression among individuals with defined bleeding problems. Moreover, bleeding risks for many bleeding disorders are unknown.

This article reviews symptoms and problems that can be considered suspicious of a mild form of bleeding disorder and the diagnostic investigations useful to evaluate these problems. A stepwise approach is presented for the diagnostic evaluation, allowing detection of common and rare coagulation and fibrinolytic defects, as well as adequate assessments of potential von Willebrand factor and platelet problems.

Some common problems in the diagnosis and management of mild bleeding problems are reviewed, including the frequent failure to establish a diagnosis with testing. An approach is proposed for translating knowledge to patients who are challenged by mild bleeding problems.

### Blood conservation [^112nmdBE]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Patient blood management necessitates a multi-modality and multidisciplinary collaboration to identify patients who are at an increased risk of requiring blood transfusion and thereby decrease exposure to blood products. Transfusion is associated with poor postoperative outcomes, and guidelines exist to minimize transfusion requirements. This review highlights recent studies and efforts to apply patient blood management across disease processes and healthcare systems.

### Tests for diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage at vaginal birth [^114w3bCt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Accurate diagnosis of PPH can prevent adverse outcomes by enabling early treatment.

- **Objectives**: What is the accuracy of methods (index tests) for diagnosing primary PPH (blood loss ≥ 500 mL in the first 24 hours after birth) and severe primary PPH (blood loss ≥ 1000 mL in the first 24 hours after birth) (target conditions) in women giving birth vaginally (participants) compared to weighed blood loss measurement or other objective measurements of blood loss (reference standards)?

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to 24 May 2024.

- **Selection criteria**: We included women who gave birth vaginally in any setting. Study types included diagnostic cohort studies and cross-sectional studies that reported 2 x 2 data (number of true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative results) or where the 2 x 2 data could be derived from test accuracy estimates.

Eligible index tests included: visual estimation; calibrated blood collection devices; approach with calibrated drape and observations; blood loss estimation using the SAPHE (Signalling a Postpartum Hemorrhage Emergency) Mat; blood loss field image analysis and other technologies; uterine atony assessment; clinical variables (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, shock index); early warning charts; haemoglobin levels; and predelivery fibrinogen levels.

### Rapiblyk [^114JzbgB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hypotension**: Patients with hemodynamic compromise, hypovolemia, or on interacting medications are at increased risk of hypotension. Monitor blood pressure closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. Reduce or stop RAPIBLYK injection for hypotension, then expect the blood pressure effect to wane within 30 minutes.

- **Bradycardia**: Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders are at increased risk of bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving RAPIBLYK injection. Reduce or stop RAPIBLYK injection for bradyarrhythmia.

- **Cardiac failure**: Beta-blockers, like RAPIBLYK, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop RAPIBLYK injection and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage (10)].

- **Reactive airways disease**: Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta-blockers. Because of its relative beta-1 selectivity and titratability, RAPIBLYK injection may be titrated to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta-2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rates.

- **Use in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypoglycemia**: Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1156ADPY]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Syncope can have a variety of aetiologies and may result in falls and associated injuries. It is defined as a sudden yet transient complete loss of consciousness in which the individual is unable to maintain postural tone, followed by rapid and spontaneous recovery. Standing for 2 to 3 minutes is usually sufficient to observe the fall in blood pressure (BP) associated with syncope; however, in the case presented here, BP was measured after 5 minutes of standing. Determining the underlying cause of syncopal episodes is an important diagnostic step to appropriately guide management.

- **Potential causes of syncope**: A relatively common cause of syncope is orthostatic hypotension (OH), characterized by a drop in BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 10 mm Hg diastolic within a few minutes of standing.

Neurogenic OH (nOH; that is, OH resulting from autonomic dysfunction) can be differentiated from non-neurogenic causes of OH (e.g. hypovolaemia) clinically by autonomic function tests and by an insufficient compensatory heart rate (HR) increase on standing. Common clinical signs and symptoms of nOH include dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, and falls. Neurogenic OH is frequently comorbid with other disorders associated with autonomic dysfunction, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies, and type 2 diabetes. Neurogenic OH increases the risk of falls, which in turn interferes with activities of daily living and increases the burden of symptoms for patients and their caregivers.

### Practical management of major blood loss [^116D3FLX]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of bleeding, regardless of cause, is complex and poorly understood. For traumatic or sudden unexpected hemorrhage, using transfusion packs containing red cells, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and platelets in ratios between 1:1 and 1:3 seems reasonable. This method eliminates the need for 'wait and see' tests and should be part of an overall resuscitation and stabilization plan to improve outcomes following sudden hemorrhage. Replacing fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate with low-volume, targeted concentrates is appealing. There is increasing evidence for the efficacy and safety of fibrinogen concentrates as a single agent. The combination of fibrinogen and prothrombin complex concentrates could be powerful and improve the management of bleeding and patient outcomes; however, this approach remains unproven.

### Haemostatic support in postpartum haemorrhage: A review of the literature and expert opinion [^117HFUaJ]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2023). Low credibility.

The clinical definition of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) varies across countries and guidelines, making global consensus challenging. Definitions of PPH from different national and international guidelines are generally based on the volume of blood loss due to historical studies aiming to identify women at the highest risk. Several methods for measuring blood loss exist, such as visual estimation, gravimetric drape measurements, and haemoglobin measurements. However, there is no solid evidence supporting that using one method over another leads to improved clinical outcomes. Each method presents difficulties; visual methods often underestimate the total blood volume loss.

PPH risk is a relative concept influenced by factors such as bleeding rate, a patient's body size, and individual tolerance of blood loss. Defining PPH based solely on blood loss can be misleading and may delay treatment. Pregnant women can lose more than 1000 mL of blood without showing clinical signs of shock due to increased blood volume during pregnancy. Tachycardia is typically the only sign, even in cases of blood loss amounting to 25–35% of the total blood volume. This can obscure the extent of the bleeding and complicates the clinical evaluation of obstetric haemorrhage. Additionally, the lack of immediate availability of laboratory tests or blood gas analysis further hinders timely diagnosis and treatment.

### Blood pressure response to patterns of weather fluctuations and effect on mortality [^1161HD8N]. Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Very few studies have looked at longitudinal intraindividual blood pressure responses to weather conditions. There are no data to suggest that a specific response to changes in weather will impact survival. We analyzed over 169,000 clinic visits of 16,010 Glasgow Blood Pressure Clinic patients with hypertension. Each clinic visit was mapped to the mean West of Scotland monthly weather data, including temperature, sunshine, and rainfall. The percentage change in blood pressure was calculated between pairs of consecutive clinic visits, where the weather alternated between two extreme quartiles (Q(1)-Q(4) or Q(4)-Q(1)) or remained in the same quartile (Q(n)-Q(n)) for each weather parameter.

Subjects were categorized into two groups depending on whether their blood pressure response in Q(1)-Q(4) or Q(4)-Q(1) was concordant or discordant with Q(n)-Q(n). Generalized estimating equations and the Cox proportional hazards model were used to model the effect on longitudinal blood pressure and mortality, respectively. The Q(n)-Q(n) pattern showed a consistent mean 2% drop in blood pressure, whereas Q(4)-Q(1) showed a mean 2.1% and 1.6% rise in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. However, Q(1)-Q(4) did not result in significant changes in blood pressure. Temperature-sensitive subjects had significantly higher mortality (1.35 [95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.71]; P = 0.01) and higher follow-up systolic blood pressure (1.85 [95% confidence interval, 0.24–3.46]; P = 0.02) compared with temperature-nonsensitive subjects. Blood pressure response to temperature may be one of the underlying mechanisms affecting mortality rates.

### Syncope: What is the trigger [^112Svgi1]. Heart (2003). Low credibility.

Although a syncopal attack is frequently preceded by prodromal symptoms, sometimes the onset can be so abrupt that there is no warning at all. The switch in autonomic responses responsible for such an attack is quite rapid and dramatic, but the trigger for this remains one of the unresolved mysteries in cardiovascular physiology.

### Methods for blood loss estimation after vaginal birth [^112BeQts]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Almost 358,000 women die each year in childbirth, mainly in low-income countries. More than half of all maternal deaths occur within 24 hours of giving birth; severe bleeding in the postpartum period is the single most important cause. Depending on the rate of blood loss and other factors, such as pre-existing anaemia, untreated postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) can lead to hypovolaemic shock, multi-organ dysfunction, and maternal death within two to six hours.

This review investigated different methods for estimating blood loss. The most common method of measuring blood loss during the third stage of labour is visual estimation, during which the birth attendant makes a quantitative or semi-quantitative estimate of the amount of blood lost. In direct blood collection, all blood lost during the third stage of labour (except for the placenta and membranes) is contained in a disposable, funnelled plastic collector bag, which is attached to a plastic sheet and placed under the woman's buttocks. When the bleeding stops, there are two options: the bag can be weighed (also called the gravimetric technique), or the bag can be calibrated, allowing for a direct measurement.

A more precise measurement of blood loss is haemoglobin concentration (Hb) in venous blood sampling and spectrophotometry. With the dye dilution technique, a known quantity of dye is injected into the vein and its plasmatic concentration is monitored after the uterus stops bleeding. Using nuclear medicine, a radioactive tracer is injected, and its concentration is monitored after the uterus stops bleeding.

### Shock in trauma [^111ZzRDs]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Low credibility.

Shock is a life-threatening condition of circulatory failure leading to inadequate organ perfusion and tissue oxygenation. In a trauma patient, shock may be due to hypovolemia, cardiogenic, obstructive, or distributive causes, either individually or in combination. The physiological response to major hemorrhage depends on a variety of autonomic reflexes, the mechanism of injury, bleeding source, and the baseline physiology of the patient. This article discusses the common causes of shock and the accompanying physiology, how clinical assessment can support diagnosis and effective treatment of shock, and the common pitfalls in trauma patients.

### Trauma: The role of the innate immune system [^116vxDFj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Both IL-1β and TNF-α stimulate the production of IL-6 and IL-8. IL-8 is an important chemokine in the cascade leading to leukocyte recruitment and activation in tissues. The production of IL-8 induces an influx of neutrophils towards the site of production, such as in patients with ARDS, to the lung. The IL-8 concentration in the pulmonary fluid of patients with thoracic trauma is considered an indicator of ARDS occurrence, as increased levels correlate with its incidence.

IL-6 is an acute-phase protein, similar to C-reactive protein (CRP). Although the role of IL-6 in the pathophysiology of trauma-related organ failure remains unclear due to its non-specificity, epidemiological data provides evidence of a correlation between increased IL-6 levels after trauma and the Injury Severity Score (ISS), the incidence of complications, and mortality. A correlation also exists between IL-6 concentrations after intramedullary osteosynthesis and the development of ARDS. IL-6 can be viewed as a marker for the severity of trauma and, despite its indistinct role in pathophysiology, it can be a resource in triage, diagnosis, and prognosis.

### A rare complication of blood donation: Minoca [^116b2Etn]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Blood donation is a life-saving process that involves the temporary loss of a specific blood volume. Although generally safe, it may lead to adverse reactions, particularly in first-time donors. Among these, severe outcomes like myocardial infarction (MI) are extremely rare. Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is a distinct clinical entity with various potential etiologies, including coronary vasospasm and sudden hemodynamic changes. This report aims to present a rare case of MINOCA following blood donation to highlight the importance of comprehensive evaluation in blood donors presenting with acute symptoms.

A 39-year-old male presented to the emergency department with dizziness and blurred vision following blood donation. Initial assessment revealed normal vital signs, laboratory tests, and no prior medical history. Electrocardiography showed ST-segment elevation in leads D1 and AVL, and ST-segment depression in D3 and AVF. The patient was immediately treated with acetylsalicylic acid and underwent coronary angiography, which revealed normal coronary arteries. The pathological findings on the ECG resolved after the procedure. No changes in troponin levels were observed during intensive care follow-up, and the patient was discharged in good health after two days. MINOCA requires thorough investigation to determine underlying causes. Acute volume loss and sudden intravascular hemoglobin changes were likely contributing factors in this case.

Although rare, the association between blood donation and MINOCA highlights the need for vigilance in blood donors.

### Superiority of compensatory reserve measurement compared with the shock index for early and accurate detection of reduced central blood volume status [^1128Prr4]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Shock index (SI) equals the ratio of heart rate (HR) to systolic blood pressure (SBP), with clinical evidence showing it is more sensitive for trauma patient status assessment and prediction of outcomes compared with either HR or SBP alone. We used lower body negative pressure (LBNP) as a human model of central hypovolemia and compensatory reserve measurement (CRM) validated for accurately tracking reduced central blood volume to test the following hypotheses regarding SI:

- **Late signal of central blood volume status**: SI presents a late signal.
- **Sensitivity and specificity**: SI displays poor sensitivity and specificity for predicting the onset of hemodynamic decompensation.
- **Risk identification**: SI cannot identify individuals at greatest risk for the onset of circulatory shock.

- **Methods**: We measured HR, SBP, and CRM in 172 human subjects (19–55 years) during progressive LBNP designed to determine tolerance to central hypovolemia as a model of hemorrhage. Subjects were subsequently divided into those with high tolerance (HT) (n = 118) and low tolerance (LT) (n = 54) based on completion of 60 mm Hg LBNP. The time course relationship between SI and CRM was determined, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for the sensitivity and specificity of CRM and SI to predict hemodynamic decompensation using clinically defined thresholds of 40% for CRM and 0.9 for SI.

- **Results**: The time and level of LBNP required to reach an SI of 0.9 (~60 mm Hg LBNP) was significantly greater (p < 0.001) compared with CRM, which reached 40% at ~40 mm Hg LBNP. Shock index did not differ between HT and LT subjects at 45 mm Hg LBNP.

### Negative pressure wound therapy for open traumatic wounds [^111tDxnw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Traumatic wounds, resulting from injury, vary from abrasions and minor skin incisions or tears to wounds with extensive tissue damage or loss, including damage to bone and internal organs. Two key types of traumatic wounds considered in this review are those that damage only soft tissue and those involving a broken bone, specifically open fractures. In some instances, these wounds are left open, and negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is employed as a treatment. This medical device involves applying a wound dressing through which negative pressure is applied to draw tissue fluid away from the area. The treatment aims to support wound management, prepare wounds for further surgery, reduce the risk of infection, and potentially shorten the time to healing, with or without surgical intervention. Notably, there are no systematic reviews assessing the effectiveness of NPWT for traumatic wounds.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of NPWT for treating open traumatic wounds in people managed in any care setting.

- **Search methods**: In June 2018, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase, and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies, reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions regarding the language, date of publication, or study design.

### Understanding traumatic shock: Out-of-hospital hypotension with and without other physiologic compromise [^111m9hxf]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Among trauma patients with out-of-hospital hypotension, we evaluated the predictive value of systolic blood pressure (SBP) with and without other physiologic compromises for identifying trauma patients requiring early critical resources.

- **Methods**: This was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of injured patients 13 years or older with out-of-hospital hypotension (SBP ≤ 90 mm Hg) who were transported by 114 emergency medical service agencies to 56 Level I and II trauma centers in 11 regions of the United States and Canada from January 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011. The primary outcome was early critical resource use, defined as blood transfusion of 6 U or greater, major nonorthopedic surgery, interventional radiology, or death within 24 hours.

- **Results**: Of 3,337 injured patients with out-of-hospital hypotension, 1,094 (33%) required early critical resources and 1,334 (40%) had serious injury (Injury Severity Score [ISS] ≥ 16). Patients with isolated hypotension required fewer early critical resources (14% vs. 52%), had less serious injury (20% vs. 61%), and had lower mortality (24 hours, 1% vs. 26%; in-hospital, 3% vs. 34%). The standardized probability of requiring early critical resources was lowest among patients with blunt injury and isolated moderate hypotension (0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.15) and steadily increased with additional physiologic compromise, more severe hypotension, and penetrating injury (0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.90–0.98).

- **Conclusion**: A minority of trauma patients with isolated out-of-hospital hypotension require early critical resources.

### Figo recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022 [^112eE1Dy]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Low credibility.

- **Assessment and resuscitation**: Hemorrhagic shock is the most frequent type of shock in obstetric patients. Blood loss exceeding 40% of total blood volume leads to global hypoxia and metabolic acidosis. These metabolic complications, accompanied by organ hypoperfusion, trigger an irreversible state of coagulopathy, bolstering hemorrhage, and inducing multiple organ dysfunction and death.

- **Damage control resuscitation in PPH**: The concept of damage control resuscitation (DCR) was first reported by trauma surgeons, and its applicability has spread in traumatic and non-traumatic scenarios in general surgery, orthopedics, and obstetrics. DCR consists of a series of strategies to minimize hemorrhage, prevent the deadly triad (coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia), and maximize tissue oxygenation. This is achieved by a staged surgical approach that minimizes operative time, counteracting life‐threatening conditions and deferring the definitive surgical procedures until normal physiology is restored at the intensive care unit (ICU).

Efforts in DCR are focused on permissive resuscitation by blood product transfusion, use of massive blood transfusion protocols, limited use of crystalloids, bleeding control (including damage control surgery [DCS] and damage control interventional radiology [DCIR]), and physiological and biochemical stabilization in the ICU. DCR is usually reserved for severely injured patients who may not survive the surgical efforts to achieve primary repair in the operating room. It is evident that this approach can be considered only in higher‐level care facilities.

### Excessive bleeding is a normal cleansing process: A qualitative study of postpartum haemorrhage among rural Uganda women [^117BPhXL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

From the data, it emerged that the signs and symptoms of shock were another method used to recognize postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). Women referred to complaints of feeling dizzy, fainting, sweating, or collapsing as symptoms of excessive bleeding. They reported that when any of the above symptoms were experienced immediately after childbirth, the most likely cause was excessive bleeding.

A traditional birth attendant (TBA) and a woman described the symptoms and signs that alerted them as follows: "When a woman after delivery complains of dizziness, starts sweating, and loses consciousness, she is in danger. She fails to sit up on the bed or is feeling palpitations; that woman has excessive bleeding" (TBA 6).

Another woman recounted her experience: "After delivery, little blood was coming as usual, but within a short time, I realized that the cloth I had used as a pad was soaked with blood. Besides that, I was also feeling dizzy and was not understanding things around me until I was given cold water to drink" (Woman 5).

A mother of four gave birth to a baby alone in her house and managed to deliver the placenta. She described PPH as vaginal bleeding which is more than the amount lost during the menstrual period: "In the morning after giving birth, I compressed my tummy with warm banana leaves; then blood flow increased. I removed the cloth that I used as a pad and replaced it with another. Within a short time, that pad was also soaked. This flow was more than my menstrual period bleeding" (Woman 3).

### Clinical associations of injuries caused by vasovagal syncope: A cohort study from a tertiary syncope unit [^116UgC7F]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The outcome of interest was the incidence of injury during the index VVS episode. Injuries were clinically evaluated at the syncope clinic, and evidence of bruising, abrasion, laceration, head injury, musculoskeletal pain, or fractures that had occurred during VVS were considered as the outcome. Injury severity was considered as mild (bruising, abrasion), moderate (musculoskeletal pain, laceration, or mild injury to the head when neither had prompted an emergency visit), and severe (fractures, laceration, musculoskeletal pain, or head injury that needed an emergency department visit, or head injury associated with concussion or posttraumatic amnesia).

The primary per‐patient analysis included all index syncopal events that occurred just before presentation to the syncope clinic. In cases of previous attacks, history of syncope‐related injury was also obtained for a maximum of 2 prior syncopal episodes, in a retrospective approach based on clinical records and patient self‐report. Additionally, in a per‐syncope analysis, data for up to 3 VVS episodes (the index episode plus up to 2 prior events) were combined, and the frequency of injury and its associations with clinical characteristics were investigated. The variables used in the per‐syncope approach were specific to each episode.

### State-of-the-art management of the acutely unwell child [^117TENj1]. Anaesthesia (2022). High credibility.

Traumatic brain injury is a common global cause of death and disability in children. Children sustain different patterns of head injury compared to adults due to differing anatomy and physiology, and clinical management should reflect this. The common mechanisms for traumatic brain injury in children vary with age, presenting two peaks in childhood: in those aged under 2 years and in adolescents.

In all patients aged under 14 years, falls are the leading cause, with transport-related injuries (such as road traffic accidents and bicycles) increasing in the 4–8-year-old age group, and abusive head trauma more common below the age of 2 years. Presenting clinical features with high predictive value for abusive head trauma in patients aged under 3 years include apnea and retinal changes. Seizures, along with long bone and rib fractures, show association with abusive head trauma but fail to reach statistical significance.

With the development of major trauma centres, there has been a change in the location of care for patients with traumatic brain injury, necessitating the transfer of patients to such centres. Most of these transports in the UK are undertaken by anaesthetists with the support of paediatric colleagues and in close collaboration with the nearest paediatric critical care centre. Prevention of secondary brain injury is key to minimizing morbidity and mortality. The Brain Trauma Foundation published guidelines for the management of paediatric severe traumatic brain injury in 2019.

Interventions where the anaesthetist is central to preventing secondary brain injury are summarized in the text.

### Clinical associations of injuries caused by vasovagal syncope: A cohort study from a tertiary syncope unit [^113M8Dww]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) manifests as a transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) with loss of postural tone as a result of reduced cerebral blood flow. The lifetime prevalence of VVS is 40% among adults, and it is the cause of 1% to 1.5% of emergency department visits in the United States. VVS is characterized by a spontaneous and rapid recovery, is not associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes, and does not indicate an underlying cardiovascular disease in most circumstances; therefore, it is often considered a benign condition. However, it has been demonstrated that recurrent VVS can significantly reduce quality of life, and an episode of TLOC portends the risk of falling and traumatic injury.

Recent evidence indicates that patients who present to the hospital with syncope have an 80% higher risk of injury in the following year compared with controls. A 2021 meta-analysis of 23 studies involving 3,593 patients diagnosed with VVS found that 33.5% of individuals reported a history of traumatic syncopal episodes. These observations signify the importance of injury as a clinical outcome in VVS. Despite this importance, there is a paucity of data about predictors and risk factors of VVS-related injuries. Identification of clinical associations of injury is a crucial step in improving management of VVS and should prompt future research to not only focus on strategies to prevent recurrences but also to find approaches to reduce the risk of injury if VVS occurs.

Herein, we present data from an ongoing cohort of patients with VVS from a tertiary syncope unit.

### Spectral analysis of heart rate variability predicts mortality and instability from vascular injury [^1138YqSr]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Spectral analysis of continuous blood pressure and heart rate variability provides a quantitative assessment of autonomic response to hemorrhage. This may reveal markers of mortality as well as endpoints of resuscitation.

- **Methods**: Fourteen male Yorkshire pigs, ranging in weight from 33 to 36 kg, were included in the analysis. All pigs underwent laparotomy and then sustained a standardized retrohepatic inferior vena cava injury. Animals were then allowed to progress to class 3 hemorrhagic shock and were treated with abdominal sponge packing followed by 6 hours of crystalloid resuscitation. If the pigs survived the 6-hour resuscitation, they were in the survival (S) group; otherwise, they were placed in the nonsurvival (NS) group. Fast Fourier transformation calculations were used to convert the components of blood pressure and heart rate variability into corresponding frequency classifications. Autonomic tones are represented as follows: high frequency (HF) = parasympathetic tone, low frequency (LF) = sympathetic, and very low frequency (VLF) = renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The relative sympathetic to parasympathetic tone was expressed as the LF/HF ratio.

- **Results**: Baseline hemodynamic parameters were equal for the S (n = 11) and NS groups. The LF/HF ratio was lower at baseline for the NS group but was higher after hemorrhage and the resuscitation period, indicative of a predominately parasympathetic response during hemorrhagic shock before mortality. The HF signal was lower in the NS group during resuscitation, indicating a relatively lower sympathetic tone.

### Postpartum hemorrhage: Early identification challenges [^1131d2v4]. Seminars in Perinatology (2019). Low credibility.

Postpartum hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. A substantial number of maternal deaths associated with hemorrhage could be preventable. Accurate assessment of blood loss, identification of risk factors, and timely recognition of postpartum hemorrhage remain major challenges in obstetrics. It is essential to review available modalities for the estimation and quantification of peripartum blood loss, the value of risk assessment tools, and the challenges in early recognition of clinical signs and symptoms of postpartum hemorrhage.

### Shock index in diagnosing early acute hypovolemia [^1155LsgQ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the hemodynamic response and calculated shock index (SI = heart rate [HR]/systolic blood pressure [SBP]) in early acute blood loss.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective observational study that enrolled healthy blood donors. Patients were excluded if not eligible for blood donation. Baseline vital signs were obtained, 450 mL of blood was removed over 20 minutes, and vital signs were repeated immediately postdonation while lying and after 1 and 5 minutes of standing. Differences were tested using a paired t-test with P < .01 set for significance.

- **Results**: Forty-six patients were enrolled; means for each time interval are shown below with 95% confidence intervals.

- **Conclusions**: A significant elevation in mean SI was observed in healthy volunteers after standing for 1 and 5 minutes. Although significant changes in HR and SBP were observed, these indices were still within "normal" limits. The SI may be more useful in early hemorrhage than either the HR or SBP alone.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^1169JWhX]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Measurement of haemoglobin concentration is a routine procedure in postoperative care. The duration of testing for postoperative anaemia depends on the peri-operative bleeding risk associated with the surgical intervention and patient-dependent factors. In most cases of uncomplicated recovery from surgery, a nadir in haemoglobin concentration can be observed within the first 3–4 days after surgery. However, in patients with major complications following major surgery, prolonged hospitalisation and exposure to low haemoglobin levels increase the duration of monitoring required.

Usually, blood gas analysis, capillary sampling (e.g. HemoCue, HemoCue AB, Ängelholm, Sweden), or near-infrared spectroscopy (e.g. Radical-67, Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) are performed as point-of-care assessments, whereas the full blood count is tested in the central laboratory. The use of non-invasive continuous haemoglobin monitoring devices instead of phlebotomy may reduce blood loss, pain, and discomfort for the patient, but concerns about precision limit routine clinical use. Although the debate focuses on the accuracy of a single check, the reliability of non-invasive haemoglobin monitoring devices for detecting dynamic changes over time may permit detection of occult bleeding and response to therapy.

### Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring. Task force of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^114jCT4Q]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The prognostic value of lactate levels exceeds that of blood pressure. While hyperlactatemia is associated with worse outcomes in any type of shock, a correct interpretation also depends on the type of shock; for instance, septic shock versus hemorrhagic shock. From a metabolic perspective, elevations in blood lactate concentration may be due to increased production, decreased clearance, or a combination of the two. Since elevated plasma lactate is part of the definition of shock, measuring it as a diagnostic marker of shock can be considered circular reasoning. Many studies have confirmed the association between initial serum lactate levels and mortality independently of clinical signs of organ dysfunction. This holds true not only for patients with severe sepsis but also for those in cardiogenic shock.

An early decrease in blood lactate levels may indicate the resolution of global tissue hypoxia and has been associated with decreased mortality rates. Two studies have proposed 'lactate-based management' for ICU patients. Jones et al. studied 300 patients, of whom more than 80% had septic shock. They were treated to normalize central venous pressure (CVP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP); additional management to normalize lactate clearance compared with management to normalize ScvO₂ did not result in different rates of hospital mortality. Jansen et al. demonstrated that in patients with hyperlactatemia (> 3.0 mEq/L) on ICU admission, lactate-guided therapy, aiming to decrease lactate by ≥ 20% every 2 hours for the initial 8 hours, was compared with a control group where the treatment team had no knowledge of lactate levels other than the standard care practices.

### Physiologic mechanisms underlying the failure of the "shock index" as a tool for accurate assessment of patient status during progressive simulated hemorrhage [^111CpoUP]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Shock index (SI), the ratio of heart rate (HR) to systolic arterial pressure (SAP), is a metric often used to diagnose patients at risk of impending cardiovascular instability and hemorrhagic shock. We hypothesized that if SI reflected impending cardiovascular instability and shock in an individual, then: (1) elevations in SI and HR would be greater in individuals with low tolerance (LT) to progressive lower-body negative-pressure (LBNP) compared with individuals with high tolerance (HT), and (2) LT would be associated with greater vagal withdrawal of the baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) compared with HT.

- **Methods**: A total of 187 healthy subjects (HT, 125; LT, 62) underwent exposure to LBNP until a SAP of less than 80 mm Hg (instability) was achieved. HR and SAP were used to calculate SI, and BRS was determined from spontaneous fluctuations in R-R interval and diastolic arterial pressure. Maximal cardiac vagal withdrawal was calculated as the difference between BRS at baseline and BRS at 100% LBNP tolerance.

- **Results**: Contrary to our hypothesis, SI at 60%, 80%, and 100% LBNP tolerance in LT (0.59 ± 0.03, 0.73 ± 0.04, and 0.97 ± 0.06, respectively) was lower (p ≤ 0.002) than SI in HT subjects at the same levels (0.66 ± 0.03, 0.84 ± 0.04, and 1.24 ± 0.06, respectively). Maximal cardiac vagal withdrawal was less (p = 0.045) in LT subjects (11.3 ± 2.2 ms/mm Hg) compared with HT subjects (14.9 ± 2.5 ms/mm Hg). The sensitivity of SI in identifying impending instability (SI, 0.9) at 80% and 100% LBNP tolerance was 13% and 63% in LT subjects and 34% and 91% in HT subjects, respectively.

### Longitudinal blood pressure in late-stage chronic kidney disease and the risk of end-stage kidney disease or mortality (Best Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease Study) [^111sxTcK]. Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Whether different methods of quantitating blood pressure (BP) in late chronic kidney disease better mimic pathophysiological processes and clinical outcomes remains unclear. In a retrospective study, we determined the association of BP with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and all-cause mortality, with BP modeled at baseline versus longitudinally with time-varying Cox models as (1) current (most recent) clinic visit, (2) lag (visit immediately preceding the current), (3) cumulative (average of previous measurements), and (4) change from baseline to the most recent. Among 1203 study patients (6913 visits), the mean age and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate were 66 years and 18 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively, and 40% were female. Patients had a mean of 6.7 BP measurements, 540 (44.8%) reached ESKD, and 141 (11.7%) died.

For systolic BP > 160, current (hazard ratio [HR], 1.67), cumulative (HR, 1.58), and a rise to > 160 from baseline 120 to 160 (HR, 1.60) were associated with ESKD. Similarly, diastolic BP > 85 was associated with ESKD when modeled as current (HR, 1.47), lag (HR, 1.63), cumulative (HR, 2.15), or change from baseline (rise to > 85 from a baseline of 60–85; HR, 1.62). Both low systolic BP (< 140), when modeled as cumulative exposure, were associated with all-cause mortality. For diastolic BP, only cumulative > 85 was significantly associated with mortality (HR, 2.75). Thus, in late-stage chronic kidney disease, persistently high or rising systolic BP or diastolic BP is clinically significant.

### Autonomic compensation to simulated hemorrhage monitored with heart period variability [^117AiAzA]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that components of heart period variability track autonomic function during simulated hemorrhage in humans, a prospective experimental laboratory intervention was conducted in a human physiology laboratory.

The study involved 33 healthy, nonsmoking, volunteer subjects, including 23 men and ten women. Progressive lower body negative pressure was applied in 5-minute stages until the onset of impending cardiovascular collapse.

Continuous recordings were made of the electrocardiogram, beat-by-beat finger arterial pressure, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity from the peroneal nerve. Pulse pressure was calculated from the arterial pressure waveform and used as an estimate of relative changes in central blood volume. Heart period variability was assessed in both time and frequency domains. The application of lower body negative pressure resulted in progressive reductions in R-R interval and pulse pressure and increases in muscle sympathetic nerve activity. Arterial pressures changed minimally and at a later stage. R-R interval time domain variability measures and spectral power at the high frequency (0.15–0.4 Hz) decreased progressively with lower body negative pressure (p ≤ .001).

The study concludes that components of heart period variability track early compensatory autonomic and hemodynamic responses to progressive reductions in central blood volume during simulated hemorrhage.

### Identification and basic management of bleeding disorders in adults [^111XxjR1]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Adults with bleeding disorders may present to their family physician with minor bleeding symptoms or hematologic laboratory abnormalities discovered during evaluation for surgery or another purpose. Identifying the small proportion of adults who have an underlying bleeding disorder as the cause for such signs or symptoms may be challenging. In cases of asymptomatic hematologic laboratory abnormalities, the particular abnormality should narrow down the potentially affected hemostatic component(s), ideally streamlining subsequent investigation.

In patients presenting with bleeding symptoms, a thorough history and physical examination are critical for first identifying bleeding as pathologic, then performing the appropriate diagnostic evaluation after excluding identifiable causes. Knowledge of the pathophysiologic processes contributing to impaired hemostasis in any given bleeding disorder ensures proper treatment and avoids therapies that are unnecessary or even contraindicated.

Management is further determined by bleeding phenotype and, for invasive procedures, the anticipated risk for bleeding. Consultation with a hematologist may facilitate proper evaluation and treatment, particularly in adults with rare bleeding disorders or no identifiable cause for bleeding. This article reviews the diagnostic approach to hematologic laboratory abnormalities and abnormal bleeding in adults, as well as basic preventive care and hemostatic management of adults with bleeding disorders.

### Major haemorrhage: past, present and future [^1128vTi8]. Anaesthesia (2023). High credibility.

Major haemorrhage is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Successful treatment requires early recognition, planned responses, readily available resources (such as blood products), and rapid access to surgery or interventional radiology. Major haemorrhage is often accompanied by volume loss, haemodilution, acidaemia, hypothermia, and coagulopathy (factor consumption and fibrinolysis).

Management of major haemorrhage over the past decade has evolved to now deliver a 'package' of haemostatic resuscitation, including surgical or radiological control of bleeding, regular monitoring of haemostasis, advanced critical care support, and avoidance of the lethal triad of hypothermia, acidaemia, and coagulopathy. Recent trial data advocate for a more personalised approach depending on the clinical scenario. Fresh frozen plasma should be given as early as possible in major trauma in a 1:1 ratio with red blood cells until the results of coagulation tests are available.

Tranexamic acid is a cheap, life-saving drug and is advocated in major trauma, postpartum haemorrhage, and surgery, but not in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. Fibrinogen levels should be maintained above 2 g/L in postpartum haemorrhage and above 1.5 g/L in other haemorrhage. Improving outcomes after major traumatic haemorrhage is now driving research to include extending blood-product resuscitation into prehospital care.

### Is accurate and reliable blood loss estimation the 'crucial step' in early detection of postpartum haemorrhage: an integrative review of the literature [^112oKuJV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the single most common cause of maternal mortality globally, with 99% of all maternal deaths occurring in low-income countries. In many high-income countries, the incidence of severe PPH is increasing and is the leading cause of severe maternal morbidity. Primary PPH is defined as blood loss of 500 mL or more, and severe PPH as 1000 mL or more, within 24 hours of childbirth. PPH is most frequently attributed to uterine atony, which usually occurs within the first hour of birth and can escalate rapidly.

Following an earlier systematic review of causes of maternal death, Khan et al. (2006) concluded that most deaths from PPH could be avoided by prevention strategies, appropriate diagnosis, and management. However, while World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines include thirty-three recommendations for the prevention and management of PPH, there is only one recommendation for diagnosis. This is for regular assessment of uterine tone in the two hours immediately following birth to promote early detection of uterine atony.

Delays in the diagnosis and treatment of PPH are believed to have a direct effect on the severity of bleeding, the development of complications such as coagulopathy, and resulting rates of morbidity and mortality. Delays are reported to be caused by misinterpretation of the extent of blood loss and its physiological effects, failure to recognize hidden bleeding, and failure to escalate care to more senior colleagues. Experts have suggested that improving the accuracy and reliability of blood loss estimation is crucial to better outcomes.

### Jalyn [^115H9WYM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When starting treatment with Jalyn, avoid driving, operating machinery, or engaging in other dangerous activities until you understand how Jalyn affects you. The medication can cause a sudden drop in your blood pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, leading to fainting, dizziness, or feeling lightheaded. You should not donate blood while taking Jalyn or for six months after you have stopped using it. This precaution is necessary to prevent pregnant females from receiving Jalyn through blood transfusions.

Jalyn may cause serious side effects, including:

- **Decreased blood pressure**: Jalyn may cause a sudden drop in your blood pressure upon standing from a sitting or lying position, especially at the start of treatment. Symptoms of low blood pressure may include fainting, dizziness, and feeling lightheaded.

- **Rare and serious allergic reactions**: Seek medical help immediately if you experience swelling of your face, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, or serious skin reactions, such as peeling.

- **Higher chance of a more serious form of prostate cancer**.

### Postpartum hemorrhage: New insights for definition and diagnosis [^115Mti55]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

The definition of postpartum hemorrhage is inadequate for early recognition of this important cause of maternal death, which was responsible for over 80,000 deaths worldwide in 2015. A stronger definition should include both blood loss and clinical signs of cardiovascular changes after delivery, aiding providers in identifying postpartum hemorrhage more promptly and accurately. Along with the amount of blood loss, clinical signs, specifically the shock index (heart rate divided by systolic blood pressure), appear to aid in a more accurate diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage.

### A dramatic drop in blood pressure following prehospital GTN administration [^112BQmd5]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

A male in his sixties with no history of cardiac chest pain awoke with chest pain following an afternoon sleep. The patient did not self-medicate. His observations were within normal limits; he was administered oxygen via a face mask and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). Several minutes after the GTN, the patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate. This was rectified by atropine sulphate and a fluid challenge. There was no further deterioration in the patient's condition during transport to the hospital.

There are very few documented cases like this in the prehospital scientific literature. The cause appears to be the Bezold-Jarisch reflex, which involves stimulation of the ventricular walls and subsequently decreases sympathetic outflow from the vasomotor centre. Prehospital care providers managing any patient with a syncopal episode that fails to recover within a reasonable time frame should consider the Bezold-Jarisch reflex as the cause and manage the patient accordingly.

### Is accurate and reliable blood loss estimation the 'crucial step' in early detection of postpartum haemorrhage: an integrative review of the literature [^117Rw1ut]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality in low-income countries and severe maternal morbidity in many high-income countries. Poor outcomes following PPH are often attributed to delays in the recognition and treatment of PPH. Experts have suggested that improving the accuracy and reliability of blood loss estimation is the crucial step in preventing death and morbidity from PPH. However, there is little guidance on how this can be achieved. The aim of this integrative review was to evaluate the various methods of assessing maternal blood loss during childbirth.

- **Methods**: A systematic, integrative review of published research studies was conducted. All types of studies were included if they developed, tested, or aimed to improve methods and skills in quantifying blood loss during childbirth, or explored experiences of those involved in the process.

- **Results**: Thirty-six studies were included that evaluated the accuracy of visual estimation, tested methods to improve skills in measurement, examined their effect on PPH diagnosis and treatment, and/or explored additional factors associated with blood loss evaluation. The review found that health professionals were highly inaccurate at estimating blood loss as a volume. Training resulted in short-term improvements in skills, but these were not retained and did not improve clinical outcomes. Multi-faceted interventions changed some clinical practices but did not reduce the incidence of severe PPH or the timing of responses to excessive bleeding. Blood collection bags improved the accuracy of measurements.

### FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022 [^112b8DSd]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Low credibility.

The lack of consistency in the definition of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) has been a major limitation to the ability to compare prevalence in different studies. Classically, PPH was defined as quantified bleeding of more than 500 mL for vaginal deliveries and more than 1000 mL for cesarean deliveries, occurring within the first 24 hours of delivery. However, this definition did not focus on clinical signs and symptoms of hemorrhage, which prevented early detection in many cases. Therefore, in 2017, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) changed the definition to blood loss of more than or equal to 1000 ml, or blood loss that was accompanied by signs or symptoms of hypovolemia occurring within 24 hours after birth, regardless of the mode of delivery.

In contrast, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) defines PPH according to the volume of blood lost: minor (between 500 and 1000 ml) and major (> 1000 ml). However, the volume of estimated blood loss remains unreliable in many cases; therefore, much attention should be directed to the general clinical status of the patient instead.

Several tools for assessment of blood loss have been used, as accurate estimation will directly influence the diagnosis and management of PPH. Many groups cite visual estimation as part of blood loss assessment, but since it has a high potential to underestimate hemorrhage, the use of additional tools for more objective estimation is recommended. These tools include gravimetric measurement, direct blood collection techniques, and evaluation of clinical parameters.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^113jWegH]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

The concept of 'patient blood management' (PBM) is defined as "the timely application of evidence-based medical and surgical concepts designed to manage anaemia, optimise haemostasis, and minimise blood loss to improve patient outcomes after surgery". Patient blood management has been shown to reduce transfusion, healthcare costs, and morbidity and mortality. The treatment of pre-operative anaemia and isolated iron deficiency are crucial measures for PBM. However, detection and early treatment of pre-operative anaemia and iron deficiency remain significant logistical challenges. As a consequence, some patients may undergo surgery without having the chance to address their anaemia.

In addition, there has been increased emphasis on accelerated discharge after surgery and the use of restrictive transfusion thresholds to improve outcomes and reduce transfusion requirements. This may have led to overlooking potential opportunities to optimise anaemic patients and improve their functional recovery. Therefore, an additional focus on the early detection and treatment of postoperative iron deficiency and anaemia is a novel and complementary measure within the concept of PBM. This allows the attending physician to target patients who lost significant red cell mass during surgery and may require specific attention postoperatively or following discharge.

### Hypothermia in the trauma patient [^114K7u6S]. Injury (2004). Low credibility.

Hypothermia is a common finding in severely injured patients. Historically described as a consequence of wartime casualties where cold exposure was common, this topic has resurfaced in the trauma literature due to the increasing recognition of the morbidity and mortality associated with hypothermia. Hypothermia, along with acidosis and coagulopathy, has been identified as a component of the "lethal triad" in injured patients and has been shown to contribute to increased mortality in these patients. Decreases in core temperature during the course of initial evaluation and resuscitation are common and can contribute to poor outcomes in the injured patient. As induced hypothermia has been shown to be beneficial in some clinical situations, recent animal studies have attempted to investigate whether hypothermia in the trauma patient has any beneficial effects. This review examines the incidence and pathophysiology of hypothermia and discusses mechanisms of heat loss and rewarming techniques that can be utilized in the trauma patient.

### Calculated blood loss in severe obstetric hemorrhage and its relation to body mass index [^111Jxsj3]. American Journal of Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

To evaluate total calculated blood loss at the time of severe obstetric hemorrhage, this prospective observational study assessed women with obstetric hemorrhage. Women included received a blood transfusion for hypovolemia, and their body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Total blood volume lost was calculated, with blood loss analyzed concerning maternal size as indicated by BMI.

Fourteen hundred forty-three women meeting inclusion criteria delivered at our hospital between March 2002 and June 2006. The median calculated volume of blood lost was 3529 mL, and 93% of women sustained losses of ≥ 3000 mL. The blood loss sufficient to provoke signs and symptoms of hypovolemia was proportional to the woman's BMI.

Women who develop hypovolemia during childbirth have suffered very large losses of blood, and the infusion of blood products is required to restore circulation and prevent further morbidity.

### What's behind the mask? A look at blood flow changes with prolonged facial pressure and expression using laser Doppler imaging [^111wQxtg]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

Clinically, the initial blanching in burn scars observed during transparent plastic face mask application seems to diminish over time and with movement, requiring mask alteration. At the time of writing, studies quantifying perfusion with prolonged mask use do not exist. This study utilized laser Doppler imaging (LDI) to assess perfusion through the transparent face mask and movement in subjects with and without burns over time.

Five subjects fitted with transparent face masks were scanned using the LDI on four occasions. The four subjects without burns were scanned in the following manner: 1) no mask, 2) mask on while at rest, 3) mask on with alternating intervals of sustained facial expression and rest, and 4) after mask removal. Images were acquired every 3 minutes throughout the 85-minute study period. The subject with a burn underwent a shortened scanning protocol to increase comfort. Each face was divided into five regions of interest for analysis.

Compared with baseline, mask application significantly decreased perfusion in all subjects (P < .0001). During the rest period, perfusion did not change. There were no significant differences with changing facial expressions in any of the regions of interest. Upon mask removal, all regions of the face demonstrated a hyperemic effect, with the chin (P = 0.05) and each cheek (P < .0001) reaching statistical significance. Perfusion levels did not return to baseline in the chin and cheeks after 30 minutes of mask removal. Perfusions remain consistently low while wearing the face mask, despite changing facial expressions.

### Twin pregnancy and postpartum haemorrhage: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112zwfXe]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

In researching the challenges of addressing this topic, there exists no clear consensus on the definition of PPH. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) defines it as a blood loss of 500 mL or more, while the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) sets the threshold at 1000 mL or blood loss accompanied by signs of hypovolemia. Ongoing discourse exists on whether early signs of hypovolemia should be included in the definition, especially considering increased blood volume during pregnancy, which can mask shock symptoms. This is particularly relevant in low-income countries, where women are often severely anaemic before delivery. Unlike healthy women, severely anaemic women may not tolerate significant blood loss.

Additionally, neither the RCOG nor ACOG definitions account for differences in blood loss based on delivery method (vaginal versus CS). Within the meta-analysis, the potential variations in blood loss depending on the method of delivery were accounted for. This nuance becomes crucial as the mode of delivery can also impact the risk and extent of PPH. Considering these factors is crucial for achieving a universally accepted definition and ensuring consistency in data and precision in managing PPH in twin pregnancies.

Furthermore, most included papers within this meta-analysis utilized a qualitative, estimate-based method for measuring blood loss, leading to discrepancies and underestimation. Visual assessment, for instance, can underestimate blood loss by 33–50% compared to photo-spectrometry.

### Predicting out-of-office blood pressure level using repeated measurements in the clinic: An observational cohort study [^111aTBTb]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

We estimated the drop in SBP (sixth minus the first reading) in each individual patient at baseline and generated coefficients to represent the slope (linear) and quadratic (curve) components of this drop using polynomial regression modelling. These characteristics were chosen because they represent a simple and straightforward approach (BP drop) that would be easy to implement in clinical practice. They also offer a more complex model that more accurately represents the trends observed previously when blood pressure is measured repeatedly in a clinic setting. We plotted these clinic blood pressure characteristics against the corresponding home–clinic difference for each individual and investigated the relationship between the two using Pearson's correlation coefficient.

The relationship between clinic SBP and white-coat and masked effects was also examined. It was not possible to study white-coat and masked hypertension because this terminology conventionally refers to treatment-naive patients, and all patients enrolled in the TASMINH2 trial had uncontrolled treated hypertension. Therefore, their blood pressures did not straddle the diagnostic threshold. Because there are no standard definitions of the white-coat or masked effect, the sample population was divided into three groups based on the degree of difference between home and clinic blood pressure. An arbitrary range of group boundaries was examined, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to identify a boundary combination for the final analysis groups, which provided the largest between-group variance.

### The highs and lows of blood pressure: Toward meaningful clinical targets in patients with shock [^113DicpQ]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). High credibility.

The clinical Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) calculator is applicable in various conditions, including:

- **Infections and systemic conditions**: COVID-19 infection, sepsis and septic shock
- **Pregnancy-related conditions**: Preeclampsia
- **Perioperative and surgical care**: Perioperative bleeding, perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, thoracic aortic dissection
- **Neurological and traumatic conditions**: Brain death, cardiac arrest, cervical spine injury, traumatic brain injury, traumatic hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, acute ischemic stroke
- **Liver and renal conditions**: Hepatorenal syndrome, liver cirrhosis, acute liver failure, acute kidney injury
- **Cardiovascular conditions**: Cardiogenic shock

In the context of assessing circulatory health, the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) calculator processes two main inputs: systolic and diastolic blood pressures. These inputs are measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and adhere to acceptable ranges for accuracy and safety — systolic values between 60 and 300 mmHg, and diastolic values from 20 to 180 mmHg.

The calculation of MAP provides crucial insight into the perfusion pressure experienced by vital organs. It relies on a straightforward formula:

MAP = diastolic blood pressure + one-third of the pulse pressure (where pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures).

This equation highlights that diastolic pressure, representing the longer-lasting phase of the cardiac cycle, exerts more influence in the calculation than systolic pressure. The resultant MAP, expressed in mmHg and ranging logically from 0 to 200 mmHg, signifies the average driving force of blood through the vascular system.

### The role of blood pressure control in prevention of hematoma after blepharoplasty [^1175Adab]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Hematoma formation after blepharoplasty is serious and potentially vision-threatening, with hypertension being the primary risk factor. The aim of this paper is to assess perioperative blood pressure trends and rates of complications in patients undergoing a strict blood pressure protocol designed to keep perioperative systolic blood pressure below 120 mmHg.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed of 32 patients undergoing facelift with concomitant blepharoplasty from January 2015 to July 2018. For each patient, blood pressure readings obtained before, during, and after surgery were reviewed. Two-sample one-tail T-tests were performed, and p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

- **Results**: The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) for all patients was highest intraoperatively. Patients with known hypertension had higher mean SBPs than patients without hypertension across all phases of care, with a statistically significant difference in immediate preoperative SBP (p = 0.05). Males had a higher average blood pressure immediately postoperatively (p = 0.05). A previous diagnosis of hypertension in females was associated with a higher immediate preoperative SBP (p = 0.07) as well as age over 65 (p = 0.07). The overall rate of complications was 37.5%. No patients experienced hematoma.

- **Conclusion**: This study demonstrated that keeping blood pressure below 120 mmHg after surgery was an effective method of preventing hematoma after blepharoplasty, even in patients concurrently on anti-coagulative medications. Special attention to blood pressure management is advised for optimal outcomes.

### State of shock: Contemporary vasopressor and inotrope use in cardiogenic shock [^116rHKPv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

- **Stepwise approach to vasoactive therapy in cardiogenic shock**: Presented in Figure 4 is a proposed stepwise approach for the use of vasoactive agents in cardiogenic shock (CS). In the initial phase of therapy, patients should be stratified into two phenotypes: those with hypotension (systolic blood pressure 30‐mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure [MAP] from baseline with evidence of hypoperfusion) or low cardiac output (determined clinically, biochemically, or through an invasive hemodynamic assessment) and preserved blood pressure. The algorithm advocates for the initial correction of hypotension, followed by the treatment of the low cardiac output state with the use of inodilator therapy. The timing and role for the use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in this clinical situation remain less certain and are outside the scope of this review. However, persistent severe CS should prompt clinician consideration for MCS therapy at any stage of the proposed treatment pathway. This strategy leverages the emerging data supporting the use of norepinephrine as a first-line therapy, while emphasizing the need for ongoing and repeated assessment throughout the treatment journey to tailor therapy based on the prevailing hemodynamic status.

- **Assessing response to therapy and requirement for titration of hemodynamic supports**: A stepwise approach to the use of vasoactive medications for the management of cardiogenic shock is depicted in Figure 4.
