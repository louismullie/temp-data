## Question

Can u give prednisone for cough, pt tested positivr for covid but also has COPD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether prednisone should be given for cough in a patient with COVID-19 and COPD, and if so, under what circumstances and at what dose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is mild COVID-19 or a COPD exacerbation. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about systemic corticosteroids in COVID-19 by severity. Next, I will review the COPD-specific indications for systemic steroids and how COVID-19 changes or does not change that. After that, I need to check the evidence base for prednisone specifically versus dexamethasone and equivalent dosing. Finally, I will weigh risks and benefits and outline a practical, severity-based recommendation with monitoring and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Cough alone in COVID-19 is common and often self-limited; in COPD, cough can reflect baseline disease or an exacerbation, so I need to distinguish whether there are features of a COPD flare such as increased dyspnea, sputum volume or purulence, wheeze, or use of accessory muscles, and whether there is hypoxemia or a need for supplemental oxygen, because that distinction drives steroid decisions [^115gT5ZB].

> Next, I should review guideline direction on systemic corticosteroids in COVID-19 by severity. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — early in the pandemic many cautioned against steroids broadly, but the RECOVERY trial and subsequent living WHO and IDSA guidance established that systemic corticosteroids reduce mortality in severe and critical COVID-19, typically defined by hypoxemia requiring oxygen, while they are not recommended for non-severe disease due to potential harm and lack of benefit [^114cMAhX] [^114RDPk8] [^111PiJKB] [^1166KwLa].

> I will now examine the COPD side. Systemic corticosteroids are indicated for acute COPD exacerbations to reduce treatment failure and improve symptoms; importantly, GOLD and related guidance state that this indication stands regardless of concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection, and patients should continue their usual COPD medications during COVID-19 unless contraindicated for other reasons [^113sUdWW] [^115gT5ZB] [^115UED8i].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence for prednisone specifically. Most high-quality COVID-19 trials used dexamethasone, but IDSA provides equivalent dosing for alternatives: prednisone 40 mg daily is approximately equivalent to dexamethasone 6 mg daily, which is the standard regimen for severe COVID-19; thus, if prednisone is used, 40 mg daily for up to 10 days or until discharge is reasonable when clinically indicated, acknowledging the evidence base is strongest for dexamethasone [^111PiJKB] [^115PRqRi] [^11123BCv].

> Let me consider the risk–benefit balance in non-severe COVID-19. Systemic steroids can suppress antiviral immunity, delay viral clearance, and increase secondary infections; RECOVERY signaled potential harm in patients not requiring oxygen, and multiple guidelines advise against systemic steroids in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 without hypoxemia, so for isolated cough without features of COPD exacerbation or hypoxemia, prednisone should be avoided [^115pA1bG] [^114RDPk8] [^113sUdWW].

> But wait, what if the cough reflects a COPD exacerbation superimposed on COVID-19. In that case, I should treat the COPD exacerbation on its own merits: a short course of systemic corticosteroids is appropriate, with typical regimens such as prednisone 40 mg daily for 5 to 7 days, while also optimizing bronchodilators and considering antibiotics if bacterial infection is suspected; this COPD-directed steroid use is supported even in the setting of COVID-19, provided there is no contraindication [^113sUdWW].

> Hold on, I should verify the severe end of the spectrum. If the patient has COVID-19 with hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen or is critically ill, dexamethasone 6 mg daily for up to 10 days is first-line; if dexamethasone is unavailable, prednisone 40 mg daily is an acceptable alternative at an equipotent dose, ideally alongside guideline-directed supportive care and, when indicated, additional immunomodulators such as baricitinib or tocilizumab per severity and inflammatory markers [^111PiJKB] [^114PoSyP] [^116eijKF].

> I need to ensure I address inhaled corticosteroids separately. For ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, IDSA suggests against starting inhaled corticosteroids solely for COVID-19; however, patients already on inhaled corticosteroids for COPD should continue them to prevent destabilization of their chronic disease, which aligns with GOLD guidance [^112zRJGk] [^1134mQhk] [^113sUdWW].

> Let me reconsider the original question and synthesize. Prednisone is not indicated for cough alone in COVID-19 without hypoxemia or a COPD exacerbation; it is appropriate when there is a bona fide COPD exacerbation, in which case treat the exacerbation with a short prednisone course, and when COVID-19 is severe or critical, in which case dexamethasone is preferred and prednisone 40 mg daily is an acceptable alternative if dexamethasone is unavailable, with duration guided by clinical response and typically up to 10 days [^115UED8i] [^111PiJKB] [^114RDPk8].

> Finally, I should double-check practical steps. Assess for increased dyspnea, sputum change, wheeze, accessory muscle use, and oxygen saturation; obtain or review spirometry if available to support COPD exacerbation; if severe COVID-19 is suspected, check inflammatory markers and initiate guideline-concordant care; monitor for hyperglycemia, mood changes, sleep disturbance, and infection while on systemic steroids; and avoid unnecessary prolongation beyond 7–10 days unless there is a compelling indication [^115gT5ZB] [^111PiJKB].

---

Prednisone is **not routinely recommended** for cough in COVID-19 patients with COPD unless there is a clear COPD exacerbation [^113sUdWW] or severe COVID-19 requiring oxygen [^114cMAhX]. For mild COVID-19 without hypoxemia, **avoid systemic steroids** due to potential harm and lack of benefit [^114RDPk8] [^115pA1bG]. If a COPD exacerbation is present, use prednisone 40 mg orally daily for 5 days [^notfound]; if severe COVID-19 is present (SpO2 < 94% or needing oxygen), use dexamethasone 6 mg IV/PO daily for up to 10 days or until discharge [^111PiJKB] [^114PoSyP]. Monitor for hyperglycemia, infections, and psychiatric effects, and taper if therapy exceeds 2 weeks.

## Indications for corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients with COPD

Corticosteroids are indicated in COVID-19 patients with COPD **only in specific scenarios**:

- **COPD exacerbation**: Increased dyspnea, sputum volume/purulence, or wheeze [^113sUdWW] [^115UED8i].
- **Severe COVID-19**: SpO2 < 94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen [^114cMAhX] [^116eijKF].

Routine use for mild COVID-19 without hypoxemia or COPD exacerbation is **not recommended** [^114RDPk8] [^115pA1bG].

---

## Evidence supporting corticosteroid use in COVID-19 patients with COPD

Evidence supports corticosteroids in severe COVID-19 and in COPD exacerbations, but **not in mild COVID-19 without hypoxemia**:

- **RECOVERY trial**: Dexamethasone reduced mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen or mechanical ventilation [^116yq7bn] [^112Uvxyo].
- **IDSA guidelines**: Recommend dexamethasone for severe COVID-19 (SpO2 < 94% or needing oxygen) [^111PiJKB] [^116eijKF].
- **GOLD guidance**: Systemic steroids are indicated for COPD exacerbations, even with COVID-19, but not for mild COVID-19 without hypoxemia [^113sUdWW] [^111nthGv].

---

## Risks and benefits of prednisone in COVID-19 patients with COPD

### Benefits

Benefits include **reduced exacerbation severity** — systemic corticosteroids improve symptoms and lung function in COPD exacerbations [^notfound] — and, in severe COVID-19, **lower mortality and faster recovery** with dexamethasone [^112Uvxyo].

---

### Risks

- **Secondary infections**: Increased risk of bacterial and fungal infections, including pneumonia [^1154DRcr].
- **Hyperglycemia**: Worsening glycemic control, especially in diabetics [^1159fwg8].
- **Psychiatric effects**: Anxiety, insomnia, and mood changes [^notfound].
- **Delayed viral clearance**: Potential prolongation of viral shedding [^113J2eQs].

## Recommended dosage and duration of prednisone treatment

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended corticosteroid** | **Dosage** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| COPD exacerbation | Prednisone | 40 mg orally daily | 5 days [^notfound] |
| Severe COVID-19 (SpO2 < 94% or needing oxygen) | Dexamethasone | 6 mg IV/PO daily | 10 days or until discharge [^111PiJKB] [^114PoSyP] |
| Mild COVID-19 without hypoxemia or COPD exacerbation | None | Not recommended | Not recommended [^114RDPk8] [^115pA1bG] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **IDSA**: Dexamethasone for severe COVID-19; avoid systemic steroids in mild COVID-19 [^111PiJKB] [^115pA1bG].
- **GOLD**: Systemic steroids for COPD exacerbations, even with COVID-19; avoid in mild COVID-19 without hypoxemia [^113sUdWW].
- **WHO**: Systemic corticosteroids for severe/critical COVID-19; avoid in non-severe disease [^114cMAhX] [^114RDPk8].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Patients receiving prednisone require **close monitoring** for:

- **Hyperglycemia**: Check glucose regularly, especially in diabetics [^1159fwg8].
- **Infections**: Watch for new or worsening respiratory symptoms, fever, or signs of secondary infection [^116yq7bn].
- **Psychiatric effects**: Screen for mood changes, anxiety, or insomnia [^1119xWvB].
- **Blood pressure and electrolytes**: Monitor for hypertension and electrolyte disturbances [^notfound].

---

## Alternative treatments and adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive therapies should be optimized: continue **bronchodilators** (SABA/LABA) and inhaled corticosteroids as indicated [^115gT5ZB]. Use antibiotics only for bacterial infection, not routinely [^117PueHE]. Provide supportive care with oxygen, hydration, and symptom control [^115rYUW8].

---

Prednisone is **not routinely recommended** for cough in COVID-19 patients with COPD unless there is a COPD exacerbation or severe COVID-19. Use prednisone 40 mg daily for 5 days in COPD exacerbations, and dexamethasone 6 mg daily for severe COVID-19. Monitor for adverse effects and taper if therapy exceeds 2 weeks.

### Use of corticosteroids in asthma and COPD patients with or without COVID-19 [^114Bgqvz]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The potential detrimental effects of steroids on the immune system to fight viral infections had always been a concern for patients on long term steroids in chronic conditions. A recent warning from WHO on systemic corticosteroid use amid COVID-19 raised suspicion among public and healthcare professionals regarding the safety of steroid use during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The corticosteroids (inhaled and oral) are commonly prescribed in the management of asthma and COPD patients and any unsolicited changes in medications use may lead to potentially severe exacerbations and may risk patient lives. This article provides a critical review of clinical evidence and offers a detailed discussion on the safety and efficacy of corticosteroids in asthma and COPD patients, both with and without COVID-19.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids are well established for the long-term treatment of inflammatory respiratory diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They have been investigated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The anti-inflammatory action of inhaled corticosteroids might have the potential to reduce the risk of severe illness resulting from hyperinflammation in COVID-19.

Objectives

To assess whether inhaled corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of COVID-19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 7 October 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating inhaled corticosteroids for COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, sex, or ethnicity. We included the following interventions: any type or dose of inhaled corticosteroids. We included the following comparison: inhaled corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (with or without placebo). We excluded studies examining nasal or topical steroids.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. For risk of bias assessment, we used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the outcomes of mortality, admission to hospital or death, symptom resolution, time to symptom resolution, serious adverse events, adverse events, and infections.

Main Results

Inhaled corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (with/without placebo)
- People with a confirmed diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COVID-19
We found no studies that included people with a confirmed diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COVID-19.
- People with a confirmed diagnosis of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection or mild COVID-19
We included three RCTs allocating 3607 participants, of whom 2490 had confirmed mild COVID-19. We analysed a subset of the total number of participants recruited to the studies (2171, 52% female) as some trials had a platform design where not all participants were allocated to treatment groups simultaneously. The included studies were community-based, recruiting people who were able to use inhaler devices to deliver steroids and relied on remote assessment and self-reporting of outcomes. Most people were older than 50 years and had co-morbidities such as hypertension, lung disease, or diabetes. The studies were conducted in high-income countries prior to wide-scale vaccination programmes. A total of 1057 participants were analysed in the inhaled corticosteroid arm (budesonide: 860 participants; ciclesonide: 197 participants), and 1075 participants in the control arm. No studies included people with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. With respect to the following outcomes, inhaled corticosteroids compared to standard care: - may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (at up to day 30) (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.67; 2132 participants; low-certainty evidence). In absolute terms, this means that for every nine deaths per 1000 people not receiving inhaled corticosteroids, there were six deaths per 1000 people who did receive the intervention (95% CI 2 to 16 per 1000 people); - probably reduces admission to hospital or death (at up to 30 days) (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.99; 2025 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); - probably increases resolution of all initial symptoms at day 14 (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.30; 1986 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); - may reduce the duration to symptom resolution (at up to day 30) (by -4.00 days, 95% CI -6.22 to -1.78 less than control group rate of 12 days; 139 participants; low-certainty evidence); - the evidence is very uncertain about the effect on serious adverse events (during study period) (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.76; 1586 participants; very low-certainty evidence); - may result in little to no difference in adverse events (at up to day 30) (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.31; 400 participants; low-certainty evidence); - may result in little to no difference in infections (during study period) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.58; 400 participants; low-certainty evidence). As studies did not report outcomes for subgroups (e.g. age, ethnicity, sex), we did not perform subgroup analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

In people with confirmed COVID-19 and mild symptoms who are able to use inhaler devices, we found moderate-certainty evidence that inhaled corticosteroids probably reduce the combined endpoint of admission to hospital or death and increase the resolution of all initial symptoms at day 14. Low-certainty evidence suggests that corticosteroids make little to no difference in all-cause mortality up to day 30 and may decrease the duration to symptom resolution. We do not know whether inhaled corticosteroids increase or decrease serious adverse events due to heterogeneity in the way they were reported across the studies. There is low-certainty evidence that inhaled corticosteroids may decrease infections. The evidence we identified came from studies in high-income settings using budesonide and ciclesonide prior to vaccination roll-outs. We identified a lack of evidence concerning quality of life assessments, serious adverse events, and people with asymptomatic infection or with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. The 10 ongoing and four completed, unpublished RCTs that we identified in trial registries address similar settings and research questions as in the current body of evidence. We expect to incorporate the findings of these studies in future versions of this review. We monitor newly published results of RCTs on inhaled corticosteroids on a weekly basis and will update the review when the evidence or our certainty in the evidence changes.

Key Points

Question

How did the percentage of patients with severe COVID-19 who received treatment with corticosteroids vary over time (January 2020-September 2022) and across World Health Organization geographic regions?

Findings

In this cohort study of 434 851 patients with severe COVID-19, corticosteroid use increased over time but unequally across geographic regions. The statistical associations between increased corticosteroid use and publication of the Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy trial and World Health Organization guidelines were significant only in Europe, where most of the trial recruitment occurred.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that a lack of research representativeness may hinder guideline implementation.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and COVID-19: interrelationships [^113YjVkq]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COVID-19 have many potentially negative interrelationships, which may influence the course of infection and clinical outcomes. The aim of this review is to provide clinicians with an up-to-date perspective of the complex interactions between COPD and COVID-19.

Recent Findings

We consider mechanisms that could increase SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility in COPD, including increased ACE2 expression, reduced antiviral defence and dysfunctional immunity. We review evidence that COPD is associated with worse clinical outcomes from COVID-19 in analyses that have adjusted for confounding factors, and describe the mechanisms responsible. We discuss the use of inhaled corticosteroids in the context of susceptibility to COVID-19, and consider the impact of COVID-19 on the usual care of COPD patients.

Summary

The current review highlights the evidence that COPD patients have worse outcomes from COVID-19, and the multiple mechanisms responsible.

Inhaled corticosteroids for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 — evidence and outcomes: Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated budesonide, ciclesonide, or fluticasone versus placebo or no inhaled corticosteroids in ambulatory or hospitalized patients and reported mortality, COVID-19-related hospitalization, and serious adverse events. Among patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, inhaled corticosteroids failed to show or exclude a beneficial effect on mortality or hospitalization, with RR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.24, 1.44; absolute risk reduction: 3 fewer per 1,000 [from 5 fewer to 3 more], moderate certainty of evidence [CoE] and RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.52, 1.27, low CoE. Serious adverse events may be more frequent among those receiving inhaled corticosteroids rather than no inhaled corticosteroids; however, this may not be meaningfully different (RR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.32, 3.99; moderate CoE).

Background and Aims

Interest in corticosteroid therapy in COVID-19 has been rekindled after the results from Randomized Evaluation of COVid-19 thERapY (RECOVERY) Trial. However, the World health Organization has not recommended corticosteroid in the treatment of COVID-19. We sought to conduct a systematic review on the role of corticosteroid in the management of patients of COVID-19.

Methods

A systematic electronic search of PubMed, Cochrane and MedRxiv database using specific keywords was made up till June 17, 2020. Full text of all the original articles with supplementary appendix that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were retrieved and a detailed analysis of results were represented.

Results

Of the 5 studies (4 retrospective studies and 1 quasi-prospective study) conducted for evaluating the role of corticosteroids, 3 studies have shown benefit, while 2 studies shown no benefit and there was a suggestion of significant harm in critical cases in one sub-study. RECOVERY trial is the only randomized controlled trial that has shown a significant reduction of death by 35% in ventilated patients and by 20% amongst patients on supplemental oxygen therapy with the dexamethasone, although no benefit was observed in mild cases.

Conclusions

While the results from retrospective studies are heterogenous and difficult to infer of a definitive protective benefit with corticosteroids, RECOVERY trial found a significantly better outcome with dexamethasone, mostly in severe cases. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to replicate the outcome shown in RECOVERY trial for a substantial conclusion.

Systemic Corticosteroids

Caution has been raised about the widespread use of systemic corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19. Observational studies in patients with SARS and MERS reported no association between systemic corticosteroids (often at high dose) and improved survival, but they suggested that corticosteroids induced side effects, including osteonecrosis, and reduced viral clearance. The World Health Organization initially recommended against the routine use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 infection at the beginning of the pandemic, except in two clinical settings: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COPD exacerbations, in which specific indications for systemic corticosteroids were recognized.

A large, randomized trial in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 has shown that dexamethasone treatment at 6 mg/d for up to 10 days reduced mortality in patients receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or oxygen alone. A small observational study has also reported that methylprednisolone use was associated with improved survival in patients with COVID-19 and ARDS. Further studies have also reported the benefits of systemic glucocorticoids on reduction of mortality at 28 days in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially those that are not on IMV or on pressor support.

Systemic steroids should be used in COPD exacerbations according to the usual indications whether or not there is evidence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, as there is no evidence that this approach modifies the susceptibility to a SARS-CoV-2 infection or worsens outcomes (Figure 1).

### Systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 [^1153b4ZV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID-19 because they counter hyper-inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. So far, systemic corticosteroids are one of the few treatment options for COVID-19. Nonetheless, size of effect, certainty of the evidence, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors that remain to be evaluated.

Objectives

To assess whether systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19, and to keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 16 April 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, participant age, gender or ethnicity. We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids. We included the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (plus/minus placebo), dose comparisons, timing comparisons (early versus late), different types of corticosteroids and systemic corticosteroids versus other active substances. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome), corticosteroids in combination with other active substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and corticosteroids for long-COVID treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, ventilator-free days, new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, quality of life, serious adverse events, adverse events, and hospital-acquired infections.

Main Results

We included 11 RCTs in 8075 participants, of whom 7041 (87%) originated from high-income countries. A total of 3072 participants were randomised to corticosteroid arms and the majority received dexamethasone (n = 2322). We also identified 42 ongoing studies and 16 studies reported as being completed or terminated in a study registry, but without results yet. Hospitalised individuals with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care plus/minus placebo We included 10 RCTs (7989 participants), one of which did not report any of our pre-specified outcomes and thus our analysis included outcome data from nine studies. All-cause mortality (at longest follow-up available): systemic corticosteroids plus standard care probably reduce all-cause mortality slightly in people with COVID-19 compared to standard care alone (median 28 days: risk difference of 30 in 1000 participants fewer than the control group rate of 275 in 1000 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.00; 9 RCTs, 7930 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Ventilator-free days: corticosteroids may increase ventilator-free days (MD 2.6 days more than control group rate of 4 days, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.53; 1 RCT, 299 participants; low-certainty evidence). Ventilator-free days have inherent limitations as a composite endpoint and should be interpreted with caution. New need for invasive ventilation: the evidence is of very low certainty. Because of high risk of bias arising from deaths that occurred before ventilation we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics. Quality of life/neurological outcome: no data were available. Serious adverse events: we included data on two RCTs (678 participants) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids compared to standard care (plus/minus placebo); for adverse events and hospital-acquired infections, we included data on five RCTs (660 participants). Because of high risk of bias, heterogeneous definitions, and underreporting we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics (very low-certainty evidence). Different types, dosages or timing of systemic corticosteroids We identified one study that compared methylprednisolone with dexamethasone. The evidence for mortality and new need for invasive mechanical ventilation is very low certainty due to the small number of participants (n = 86). No data were available for the other outcomes. We did not identify comparisons of different dosages or timing. Outpatients with asymptomatic or mild disease Currently, there are no studies published in populations with asymptomatic infection or mild disease.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence shows that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly reduce all-cause mortality in people hospitalised because of symptomatic COVID-19. Low-certainty evidence suggests that there may also be a reduction in ventilator-free days. Since we are unable to adjust for the impact of early death on subsequent endpoints, the findings for ventilation outcomes and harms have limited applicability to inform treatment decisions. Currently, there is no evidence for asymptomatic or mild disease (non-hospitalised participants). There is an urgent need for good-quality evidence for specific subgroups of disease severity, for which we propose level of respiratory support at randomisation. This applies to the comparison or subgroups of different types and doses of corticosteroids, too. Outcomes apart from mortality should be measured and analysed appropriately taking into account confounding through death if applicable. We identified 42 ongoing and 16 completed but not published RCTs in trials registries suggesting possible changes of effect estimates and certainty of the evidence in the future. Most ongoing studies target people who need respiratory support at baseline. With the living approach of this review, we will continue to update our search and include eligible trials and published data.

Conclusions

There is little direct evidence about management of COVID-19 in people with COPD. Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion of COVID-19 in patients with COPD presenting with new or worsening respiratory symptoms, fever, and/or any other symptoms that could be COVID-19 related, even if these are mild, and should test for SARS-CoV-2. Patients should keep taking their oral and inhaled respiratory medications for COPD as directed, as there is no evidence that COPD medications should be changed during this COVID-19 pandemic.

INTRODUCTION

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This highly transmissible virus can cause mild viral illness, while more severe cases display systemic inflammation, pneumonia and acute severe respiratory failure. COVID-19 respiratory failure is often associated with good lung compliance, implicating vascular injury and vasoconstriction as central mechanisms of respiratory insufficiency. COVID-19 pneumonia appears to be caused by pulmonary exudate due to microvascular injury. Systemic manifestations are common in severe COVID-19, with endothelial injury causing cardiac, renal and neurological complications. These pulmonary and systemic disease components cause a high mortality in COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital, which is increased in older individuals and those with comorbidities including obesity and cardiovascular disease.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occurs in older individuals due to persistent inhalation of noxious particles, commonly from cigarette smoking. The pulmonary disease includes airway inflammation and remodelling, with variable alveolar destruction (emphysema). COPD patients suffer with dyspnoea, cough and sputum production, and may experience sudden worsenings (exacerbations) that are often caused by respiratory tract infections. In addition, COPD is associated with a high prevalence of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, which is not surprising in an older population with a significant smoking history. COPD and COVID-19 therefore have many potentially negative interrelationships, which may lead to worse outcomes from COVID-19, including impaired pulmonary function, older age and the presence of comorbidities in COPD patients. Furthermore, COPD patients may also be more susceptible to acquiring viral infections including SARS-CoV-2.

This review addresses interrelationships between COPD and COVID-19. The mechanisms that could cause increased SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility in COPD patients are considered. The evidence that COPD is associated with worse clinical outcomes from COVID-19 is reviewed, and whether the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) alters outcomes. We also consider the impact of COVID-19 on the usual clinical care of COPD patients.

### Global initiative for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive lung disease. the 2020 GOLD science committee report on COVID-19 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115rYUW8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has raised many questions about the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and whether modifications of their therapy are required. It has raised questions about recognizing and differentiating coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from COPD given the similarity of the symptoms. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Science Committee used established methods for literature review to present an overview of the management of patients with COPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear whether patients with COPD are at increased risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. During periods of high community prevalence of COVID-19, spirometry should only be used when it is essential for COPD diagnosis and/or to assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery. Patients with COPD should follow basic infection control measures, including social distancing, hand washing, and wearing a mask or face covering. Patients should remain up to date with appropriate vaccinations, particularly annual influenza vaccination. Although data are limited, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators, roflumilast, or chronic macrolides should continue to be used as indicated for stable COPD management. Systemic steroids and antibiotics should be used in COPD exacerbations according to the usual indications. Differentiating symptoms of COVID-19 infection from chronic underlying symptoms or those of an acute COPD exacerbation may be challenging. If there is suspicion for COVID-19, testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered. Patients who developed moderate-to-severe COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia, should be treated with evolving pharmacotherapeutic approaches as appropriate, including remdesivir, dexamethasone, and anticoagulation. Managing acute respiratory failure should include appropriate oxygen supplementation, prone positioning, noninvasive ventilation, and protective lung strategy in patients with COPD and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients who developed asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 should be followed with the usual COPD protocols. Patients who developed moderate or worse COVID-19 should be monitored more frequently and accurately than the usual patients with COPD, with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.

### COVID-19, asthma, and inhaled corticosteroids: another beneficial effect of inhaled corticosteroids? [^115kHeTo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a real pandemic. After a median incubation period of 5 days, the disease occurs in different stages, inducing upper and lower airway responses in mild disease (80–90% of patients) and progressing to bilateral pneumonia in severe disease (10–20%). A subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 develops acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring mechanical ventilation on intensive care. COVID-19 patients with preexisting comorbid conditions such as chronic respiratory diseases have worse disease outcomes, including a higher incidence of the need for hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality. However, it remains to be further investigated how preexisting chronic inflammatory airway diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and their treatment might modify the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of COVID-19. Approximately 300 million individuals worldwide have asthma. Considering that a significant proportion of individuals with asthma is confronted with COVID-19, it is crucial to understand which asthma patients are particularly at risk and how inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) — the cornerstone of asthma treatment — may influence morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. Long-term treatment with systemic corticosteroids (e.g. in transplant patients) is immunosuppressive, increasing the risk and severity of viral infections. Because of the potential risk for worse disease outcomes, the World Health Organization does not recommend systemic corticosteroid treatment in COVID-19, unless if indicated for other reasons such as acute asthma or COPD exacerbations requiring a short course of oral corticosteroids. These recommendations have caused doubt and uncertainty among patients with asthma and physicians on whether ICS therapy should be maintained during this pandemic. However, withdrawal of ICS treatment puts asthma patients at risk of severe exacerbations. A recent meta-analysis on COVID-19 outcomes in patients with chronic respiratory diseases using ICS concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to abandon the well-established ICS treatment in asthma. There is thus an urgent need to elucidate demographic and clinical characteristics that determine disease outcomes of COVID-19 in asthma, to investigate the impact of ICS and to unravel the underlying pathogenic mechanisms.

### Systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19: equity-related analyses and update on evidence [^111A5D9M]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID-19 because they counter hyper-inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. Nonetheless, size of effect, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors that remain to be evaluated.

Objectives

To assess whether and at which doses systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19, to explore equity-related aspects in subgroup analyses, and to keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 6 January 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID-19. We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids and the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care, different types, doses and timings (early versus late) of corticosteroids. We excluded corticosteroids in combination with other active substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and corticosteroids for long-COVID treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality up to 30 and 120 days, discharged alive (clinical improvement), new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death (clinical worsening), serious adverse events, adverse events, hospital-acquired infections, and invasive fungal infections.

Main Results

We included 16 RCTs in 9549 participants, of whom 8271 (87%) originated from high-income countries. A total of 4532 participants were randomised to corticosteroid arms and the majority received dexamethasone (n = 3766). These studies included participants mostly older than 50 years and male. We also identified 42 ongoing and 23 completed studies lacking published results or relevant information on the study design. Hospitalised individuals with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care plus/minus placebo We included 11 RCTs (8019 participants), one of which did not report any of our pre-specified outcomes and thus our analyses included outcome data from 10 studies. Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care compared to standard care probably reduce all-cause mortality (up to 30 days) slightly (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 0.97; 7898 participants; estimated absolute effect: 274 deaths per 1000 people not receiving systemic corticosteroids compared to 246 deaths per 1000 people receiving the intervention (95% CI 230 to 265 per 1000 people); moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect on all-cause mortality (up to 120 days) (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.34; 485 participants). The chance of clinical improvement (discharged alive at day 28) may slightly increase (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.11; 6786 participants; low-certainty evidence) while the risk of clinical worsening (new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death) may slightly decrease (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01; 5586 participants; low-certainty evidence). For serious adverse events (two RCTs, 678 participants), adverse events (three RCTs, 447 participants), hospital-acquired infections (four RCTs, 598 participants), and invasive fungal infections (one study, 64 participants), we did not perform any analyses beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics due to very low-certainty evidence (high risk of bias, heterogeneous definitions, and underreporting). Different types, dosages or timing of systemic corticosteroids We identified one RCT (86 participants) comparing methylprednisolone to dexamethasone, thus the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of methylprednisolone on all-cause mortality (up to 30 days) (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.07; 86 participants). None of the other outcomes of interest were reported in this study. We included four RCTs (1383 participants) comparing high-dose dexamethasone (12 mg or higher) to low-dose dexamethasone (6 mg to 8 mg). High-dose dexamethasone compared to low-dose dexamethasone may reduce all-cause mortality (up to 30 days) (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.04; 1269 participants; low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of high-dose dexamethasone on all-cause mortality (up to 120 days) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.08; 1383 participants) and it may have little or no impact on clinical improvement (discharged alive at 28 days) (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.09; 200 participants; low-certainty evidence). Studies did not report data on clinical worsening (new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death). For serious adverse events, adverse events, hospital-acquired infections, and invasive fungal infections, we did not perform analyses beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics due to very low-certainty evidence. We could not identify studies for comparisons of different timing and systemic corticosteroids versus other active substances. Equity-related subgroup analyses We conducted the following subgroup analyses to explore equity-related factors: sex, age (< 70 years; ≥ 70 years), ethnicity (Black, Asian or other versus White versus unknown) and place of residence (high-income versus low- and middle-income countries). Except for age and ethnicity, no evidence for differences could be identified. For all-cause mortality up to 30 days, participants younger than 70 years seemed to benefit from systemic corticosteroids in comparison to those aged 70 years and older. The few participants from a Black, Asian, or other minority ethnic group showed a larger estimated effect than the many White participants. Outpatients with asymptomatic or mild disease There are no studies published in populations with asymptomatic infection or mild disease.

Systemic corticosteroids probably slightly reduce all-cause mortality up to 30 days in people hospitalised because of symptomatic COVID-19, while the evidence is very uncertain about the effect on all-cause mortality up to 120 days. For younger people (under 70 years of age) there was a potential advantage, as well as for Black, Asian, or people of a minority ethnic group; further subgroup analyses showed no relevant effects. Evidence related to the most effective type, dose, or timing of systemic corticosteroids remains immature. Currently, there is no evidence on asymptomatic or mild disease (non-hospitalised participants). Due to the low to very low certainty of the current evidence, we cannot assess safety adequately to rule out harmful effects of the treatment, therefore there is an urgent need for good-quality safety data. Findings of equity-related subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution because of their explorative nature, low precision, and missing data. We identified 42 ongoing and 23 completed studies lacking published results or relevant information on the study design, suggesting there may be possible changes of the effect estimates and certainty of the evidence in the future.

CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE, COVID-19 AND INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS

Experimental studies using cultured cells have shown that corticosteroids can attenuate SARS-CoV-2 replication. The RECOVERY clinical trial (n = 6435) demonstrated that the corticosteroid dexamethasone (adminsitered orally or intravenously) decreased mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen or mechanical ventilation. In addition, a phase 2 clinical trial (n = 146) showed that inhaled budesonide administered in the community in the early stages of COVID-19 reduced the need for urgent medical care and improved the recovery time. Overall, these laboratory and clinical studies support a protective role for corticosteroids against COVID-19.

A retrospective analysis of electronic health records has been performed to investigate clinical outcomes in COPD patients in the UK treated with or without ICS. The OpenSAFELY UK primary care cohort analysed mortality outcomes in COPD patients (n = 148 557); COVID-19 associated mortality was increased in ICS users versus nonusers. Importantly, adjusting for confounding factors decreased the hazard ratio, and the fully adjusted model in patients of white ethnicity showed no detrimental effects of ICS use. Non-COVID-19 deaths were also higher in patients using ICS, highlighting the confounding effect of disease severity on mortality outcomes. Aveyard et al. studied outcomes in 193 520 COPD patients using primary care records; we discussed earlier that hospitalization and mortality rates were increased in COPD patients. The authors also reported increased hospitalization and mortality rates in ICS users versus nonusers in an unadjusted analysis, but that no detrimental effect of ICS use was observed after adjustment for demographic factors and medication use.

The overall weight of scientific information does not support any detrimental effect of ICS use with regard to COVID-19 outcomes in COPD patients. Indeed, the beneficial effects of systemic and ICS administered acutely to treat COVID-19 indicates a protective effect of this drug class in this scenario. The GOLD 2020 science committee report on COVID-19 accordingly recommends that for COPD patients the use of ICS as a maintenance treatment should not be changed during this pandemic.

Patient characteristics

Between February 7 and February 17, 2020, a total of 83 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 were screened for inclusion. Of these patients, 11 patients were excluded, including eight critical COVID-19 patients with less than two serial CT scans during hospital stay, two patients receiving systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy in the previous 6 weeks, and one patient with solid malignancy. Within the study period, 72 patients with severe COVID-19 were finally included in this study (Fig. 1).

Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of patients with severe COVID-19. The median age of the 72 patients was 63 years [IQR 49 to 69 years], and 51.4% of the patients were male. Fever was the most common symptom (90.3%), followed by fatigue (87.5%), cough (73.6%), and dyspnea (55.6%). Thirty-one patients (43.1%) received steroid therapy. Steroid therapy was started at a median of 14 days from onset of symptom. The median duration of steroid therapy was 13 days. The baseline characteristics between patients receiving steroid therapy and those not receiving steroid therapy were similar (Table 1). The vital signs and the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio on admission were also similar between the two groups.

During hospital stay, more patients in the steroid therapy group were treated with high-flow nasal oxygen than standard care group (35.5% vs. 7.3%, P < 0.01). However, the proportion of invasive or noninvasive ventilation between the two groups was comparable. All patients survived to discharge from hospital in this study. The length of hospital stay was longer in patients receiving steroid therapy than in those not receiving steroid therapy (36 vs. 29 days, P < 0.01).

Pharmacologic treatment of critically ill COVID-19 requiring non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula — We strongly recommend systemic corticosteroids in critically ill patients with COVID-19 with a mortality benefit (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.54; 0.82). In critically ill patients, dexamethasone 6mg/day is preferred, but doses up to 20 mg/day can be used if indicated; hydrocortisone 50 mg IV Q6 hours is an alternative, and methylprednisolone or prednisone are reasonable alternatives at equipotent doses. In addition to corticosteroids, we recommend using either IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab preferred over sarilumab) or JAK inhibitors (baricitinib preferred over tofacitinib) in patients with elevated inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP). Trials have not identified specific sub-populations of critically ill patients already receiving corticosteroids who would benefit with additional IL-6 or JAK inhibitors, and we do not recommend remdesivir since it has not shown a benefit in this sub-population.

Conclusions

This cohort study found that corticosteroid use for treatment of severe and critical COVID-19 increased over time in all WHO geographic regions. However, it remained low in Africa compared with Europe, where clinical trials assessing corticosteroids for treatment of COVID-19 enrolled the most participants. The findings of this study suggest that encouraging research diversity and representativeness may facilitate timely knowledge uptake and guideline implementation.

RESULTS

Two-hundred and fifty consecutive patients were evaluated for inclusion. Ten were hospitalized for ≤ 24 hours, 23 did not require oxygen by nasal cannula, HFNC, or mechanical ventilation, and 4 expired within 24 hours of admission (Figure 1). Two-hundred and thirteen patients were included, 81 (38%) in the SOC group and 132 (62%) in the early corticosteroid group. The median age of the SOC group and early corticosteroid group was 64 (IQR: 51.5, 73.5) and 61 (IQR: 51, 72) years, respectively. Black patients comprised 61.7% of the SOC group and 79.5% of the early corticosteroid group (P = 0.005). Of the comorbid conditions evaluated, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was more frequent in the SOC group compared to the early corticosteroid group (18.5% vs 9.1%; p = 0.045). The presenting COVID-19 symptoms, baseline severity of illness, and other demographics are presented in Table 1. One patient had a concomitant influenza infection in the early corticosteroid group.

Overall, corticosteroids use was 56.8% and 68.2% in the SOC group and early corticosteroid group, respectively (P = 0.094). The early corticosteroid group had a greater proportion of corticosteroids initiated within 48 hours of presentation (12.4% vs 41.7%, P < .001), with a median time to initiation of 2 days (IQR: 1–3, range 0–8) as compared to 5 days (IQR: 3–7, range 1–9) in the SOC. The median time to hydroxychloroquine initiation was greater in the SOC group compared to the early corticosteroid group (3 [IQR: 1, 4] vs 1 [IQR: 0, 2] days, P < .126).

### Association of inhaled and systemic corticosteroid use with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) test positivity in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases [^111XJh7Y]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The effects of chronic inhaled and systemic corticosteroids use on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity are unclear. Since many patients with chronic pulmonary diseases rely on corticosteroids to control disease, it is important to understand the risks of their use during the pandemic. We aim to study if the use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids affects the likelihood of developing COVID-19 infection.

Methods

We used the National Jewish Health electronic medical record research database to identify a cohort of all subjects who were tested for suspected COVID-19 between March 11 - June 23, 2020. Testing results, medication use, and comorbidities were obtained from the medical record. Following a comparison of different propensity score weighting methods, overlap propensity score weighting was used to analyze the association between medication use and COVID-19 diagnosis.

Results

The cohort consisted of 928 patients, of which 12% tested positive. The majority (66%) of patients had a history of chronic pulmonary diseases. There was no significant association between inhaled corticosteroid use and testing positive for COVID-19. Interestingly, systemic corticosteroid use was associated with a lower odds ratio (0.95, 95% CI: 0.91–0.99) of testing positive for COVID-19. Similar results were noted when the analysis was restricted to those with any chronic pulmonary diseases, with asthma or with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Conclusions

Our study supports the recommendation that patients with chronic pulmonary diseases, including asthma and COPD who require treatment with either inhaled or systemic corticosteroids, should continue their use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Pre-admission immunosuppressants were associated with higher rates of corticosteroid administration, potentially reflecting indications for pre-existing conditions or lower thresholds to start corticosteroids. Some pre-existing comorbidities for which corticosteroids are occasionally indicated, such as malignancy or rheumatological conditions, were associated with lower rates of corticosteroid administration, which could reflect proven or potential concern about associated immunosuppression. Immunosuppression might present a relative contraindication to corticosteroids; therefore, the risk of secondary infection with corticosteroids should be explored further to ensure safe and appropriate prescribing. Alternatively, clinicians might perceive there to be less benefit from corticosteroids because of a potential effect of existing immunosuppression.

Corticosteroids are also indicated in exacerbations of asthma and other chronic pulmonary diseases. However, patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 and non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease received fewer corticosteroids, which persisted after adjusting for age and comorbidities. This finding could reflect lower baseline SpO 2 and higher respiratory rates resulting in misclassification of some patients into artificially higher severity groups.

The rates of corticosteroid administration increased with markers of severity, such as high respiratory rate, low SpO 2, and high CRP, and increasing level of care, but corticosteroids were also administered to patients not recorded to have received supplementary oxygen or without markers of severe COVID-19. Despite the WHO severity criteria, the initial clinical guidelines and the principal message from the RECOVERY trial recommended corticosteroids to anyone needing supplementary oxygen, and this message might have persisted as a simple decision aid. Contrarily, both the RECOVERY and the Metcovid trials reported a potential signal to harm among patients not receiving oxygen, which might have persuaded clinicians to err to the side of caution among patients with less severe COVID-19. Despite this signal to harm among patients receiving no oxygen, the rate of corticosteroid administration in the non-oxygen cohort observed here did not change after RECOVERY trial publication. To account for the less clear indication for patients with milder disease, we focused on patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 when identifying the discussed factors independently associated with lower corticosteroid administration.

### Corticosteroid use in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis on clinical outcomes [^1154DRcr]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been worldwide debate on the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19. In the recent RECOVERY trial, evaluating the effect of dexamethasone, a reduced 28-day mortality in patients requiring oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation was shown. Their results have led to considering amendments in guidelines or actually already recommending corticosteroids in COVID-19. However, the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids still remain uncertain, and reliable data to further shed light on the benefit and harm are needed.

Objectives

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids in COVID-19.

Methods

A systematic literature search of RCTS and observational studies on adult patients was performed across Medline/PubMed, Embase and Web of Science from December 1, 2019, until October 1, 2020, according to the PRISMA guidelines. Primary outcomes were short-term mortality and viral clearance (based on RT-PCR in respiratory specimens). Secondary outcomes were: need for mechanical ventilation, need for other oxygen therapy, length of hospital stay and secondary infections.

Results

Forty-four studies were included, covering 20.197 patients. In twenty-two studies, the effect of corticosteroid use on mortality was quantified. The overall pooled estimate (observational studies and RCTs) showed a significant reduced mortality in the corticosteroid group (OR 0.72 (95%CI 0.57–0.87). Furthermore, viral clearance time ranged from 10 to 29 days in the corticosteroid group and from 8 to 24 days in the standard of care group. Fourteen studies reported a positive effect of corticosteroids on need for and duration of mechanical ventilation. A trend toward more infections and antibiotic use was present.

Conclusions

Our findings from both observational studies and RCTs confirm a beneficial effect of corticosteroids on short-term mortality and a reduction in need for mechanical ventilation. And although data in the studies were too sparse to draw any firm conclusions, there might be a signal of delayed viral clearance and an increase in secondary infections.

### Clinical characteristics and effects of inhaled corticosteroid in patients with post-COVID-19 chronic cough during the omicron variant outbreak [^115Krfi6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic cough is a common symptom in patients post the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and the clinical characteristics of patients with post-COVID-19 chronic cough during the Omicron era.

Methods

An ambispective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted that included patients with post-COVID-19 who attended the respiratory clinic at our hospital between January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023 with a complaint of persistent cough lasting more than 8 weeks. At 30 and 60 days after the first clinic visit for post-COVID-19 chronic cough, enrolled patients were prospectively followed up. We compared the changes in symptoms and pulmonary function between patients receiving ICS treatment (ICS group) and those not receiving ICS treatment (NICS group) at the two visits.

Results

A total of 104 patients with post-COVID-19 chronic cough were enrolled in this study (ICS group, n = 51; NICS group, n = 53). The most common symptoms accompanying post-COVID-19 chronic cough were sputum (58.7%, 61/104) and dyspnea (48.1%, 50/104). Seventy-one (82.6%, 71/86) patients had airway hyperresponsiveness, and 49 patients (47.1%, 49/104) were newly diagnosed with asthma. Most patients (95.2%, 99/104) exhibited improvement at 60 days after the first visit. The pulmonary function parameters of the patients in the ICS group were significantly improved compared to the baseline values (P < 0.05), and the improvement in the FEV 1 /FVC was significantly greater than that in the NICS group (P = 0.003) after 60 days.

Conclusions

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) may contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma, which could be the underlying cause of persistent cough post-COVID-19 infection. Post-COVID-19 chronic cough during the Omicron era was often accompanied by sputum, dyspnea, and airway hyperresponsiveness. ICS treatment did not have a significant impact on symptom management of post-COVID-19 chronic cough; however, it can improve impaired lung function in in these individuals.

### COVID-19 and corticosteroids: unfamiliar but potentially fatal infections that can arise following short-course steroid treatment [^116yq7bn]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, hydrocortisone, and dexamethasone, have powerful inhibitory effects on the immune system. Patients with COVID-19 may develop severe inflammatory-mediated disease with acute lung injury and multisystem organ dysfunction. Corticosteroids may improve outcomes in seriously ill COVID-19 patients by attenuating this inappropriate host immune response. –

Lower 28-day mortality was demonstrated in the large prospective, open-label controlled RECOVERY trial involving 6,425 participants admitted with COVID-19 in those randomized to 6 mg dexamethasone intravenously or orally once daily for up to 10 days than usual care. In those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, mortality among those treated with dexamethasone was one-third that in those receiving usual care and in those receiving oxygen without mechanical ventilation mortality was reduced by one-fifth. Benefit was also seen in those treated more than 7 days after symptom onset with inflammatory lung damage, but not for those without respiratory support requirement at randomization, suggesting the timing of this intervention within the course of illness may be important. On this basis, the use of corticosteroids, which are relatively inexpensive and readily available medications, has increased worldwide for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 disease, as recommended by several health authorities such as the WHO, the NIH, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Similarly, evolving observational data also suggest that corticosteroids may be helpful in the management of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome, an uncommon but very serious complication of COVID-19 in children.

Maintenance Pharmacological Treatment for COPD during the COVID-19 Pandemic

The use of inhaled and systemic corticosteroids has been controversial in the prevention and treatment of COPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. ICS have an overall protective effect against exacerbations in patients with COPD and a history of exacerbations. However, there is an increased risk of pneumonia associated with ICS use, raising concerns that immunosuppression with ICS could increase susceptibility to infections in some individuals.

Laboratory experiments show that corticosteroids reduce the production of antiviral IFNs (type I and III), increasing the replication of the rhinovirus and the influenza virus. In contrast, other laboratory data show that corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators can reduce the replication of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. These laboratory experiments suggesting a potential protective effect of ICS against COVID-19 have not been validated by clinical studies.

A systematic literature review identified no clinical studies in patients with COPD concerning the relationship between ICS use and clinical outcomes with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19, SARS, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). A more recent study has shown ICS use in COPD was not protective and raised the possibility that it increased the risk of developing COVID-19, but the results are likely to be confounded by the indication for ICS. There are no conclusive data to support the alteration of maintenance COPD pharmacological treatment either to reduce the risk of developing COVID-19 or, conversely, because of concerns that pharmacological treatment may increase the risk of developing COVID-19.

Similarly, there are no data on the use of long-acting bronchodilators, roflumilast, or macrolides in patients with COPD and clinical outcomes or risk of SARS-COV-2 infection; thus, unless evidence emerges, these patients should continue these medications required for COPD.

### Association between dexamethasone treatment after hospital discharge for patients with COVID-19 infection and rates of hospital readmission and mortality [^1159fwg8]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In a diverse cohort of patients with COVID-19 who received less than 10 days of treatment with dexamethasone, 6 mg/d, during COVID-19 hospitalization, we found that continuing dexamethasone therapy at discharge was not associated with a reduction in 14-day readmission or mortality postdischarge. These findings were largely consistent across varying durations of inpatient dexamethasone treatment, symptom durations at discharge, and oxygen requirements at discharge. Studies exploring the utility of continuing dexamethasone therapy at discharge have been sparse and our study adds novel insights and evidence regarding the appropriate treatment of COVID-19. The findings also raise questions regarding the prevailing practice of continuing corticosteroid therapy at discharge despite guideline recommendations.

Our findings have important implications for clinical practice. Our study, which spanned a period of the 2020 summer/fall surge in COVID-19 cases in Southern California, suggests that once a patient's condition is stable for discharge, continuing dexamethasone therapy does little to alter the natural course of the disease. Adverse effects of corticosteroids, including opportunistic infections and hyperglycemia, have been well described. In other diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, studies over time have reported that shorter courses of corticosteroids were noninferior to longer courses. Avoiding nonbeneficial use of corticosteroids and limiting to what is necessary would be consistent with the mantra of do no harm.

Although our study was done early in the pandemic, our findings remain of relevance in today's practice, especially because corticosteroids have become a cornerstone therapy for COVID-19. Studies have suggested a decrease in poor outcomes, such as mortality, in patients with COVID-19 as the pandemic progressed. We believe that a negative study finding early in the pandemic would apply even more so today because poor outcomes are less likely with better understanding of the disease, increased levels of vaccination, and variants that result in diseases with lower acuity.

There are at least 2 plausible explanations for our findings. The longer half-life of dexamethasone and self-tapering effect may have reduced any significant differences observed with extending the corticosteroid course. Whether the same findings would hold true for other corticosteroids with differing pharmacokinetics is unknown. Alternatively, it may be that any benefit derived from a reduction in COVID-19 disease severity is offset by potential complications of continuing the corticosteroid course; however, we did not explore specific reasons for readmissions in our study. Better understanding of potential complications in this population may be an area of future investigation.

Corticosteroid use is nevertheless common in hospitalized children with COVID-19, and there is reason to believe that the risk benefit ratio would be similar in children and adults.

Table 2 presents the proportion of patients with COVID-related pulmonary abnormalities observed on chest computed tomography (CT) at admission and the presence of specific clinical symptoms. Among the patients who underwent chest CT during hospitalization, the prevalence of pulmonary abnormalities consistent with COVID-related pneumonia among the patients in the asthma and non-asthma/COPD groups were comparable for both periods. However, patients with COPD demonstrated a higher prevalence of these abnormalities. Regarding clinical symptoms, there was a noticeable trend towards a higher proportion of patients with cough and wheezing among those with asthma.

Table 3 shows the treatment details during hospitalization. For both periods, there was a higher prevalence of patients receiving some form of treatment among those with COPD. Among patients with COPD, the use of remdesivir was observed in 30% during the first half of the study and 49% during the second half. Glucocorticoids were more frequently administered to patients with COPD, and higher dosages were also observed. Patients with asthma had a shorter course of COVID-19 (12–14 days) than did those without asthma and COPD. Conversely, patients with COPD tended to have longer courses (approximately 21 days).

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — baricitinib with remdesivir when corticosteroids are contraindicated: Among hospitalized patients with severe* COVID-19 who cannot receive a corticosteroid because of a contraindication, the IDSA guideline panel suggests use of baricitinib with remdesivir rather than remdesivir alone (Conditional recommendation†, Low certainty of evidence). Remark: Baricitinib 4 mg daily dose for 14 days or until hospital discharge, and the benefits of baricitinib plus remdesivir for persons on mechanical ventilation are uncertain.

Corticosteroid regimen (Table 1 and Additional file 6)

In the 44 studies, very diverse corticosteroid strategies were used. If reported (n = 35), methylprednisolone was the most frequently prescribed (n = 28). Prednisone (n = 5) and dexamethasone (n = 5) and hydrocortisone (n = 4) were also used, some in studies that allowed multiple corticosteroid regimens (n = 9).

The indication to start corticosteroids was described in 12 studies (Additional file 6): In three studies, corticosteroids were started at diagnosis/hospital admission. In five studies, ICU admission or respiratory deterioration were the indications to start, either randomized according to study protocol or not randomized.

In 29 studies, the dose of corticosteroids was reported: In 16 studies, an equivalent dose of > 1 mg/kg prednisolone was used and in 11 studies a lower equivalent dose than 1 mg/kg prednisolone. In two studies, a low- and high-dose group were present. The duration of therapy varied within a range of 5–10 days, in observational studies frequently dependent on clinical condition of patients.

Scope

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has become pandemic, reaching almost one million death worldwide. At present standard treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not well defined because the evidence, either from randomized or observational studies, with conflicting results, has led to rapid changes in treatment guidelines. Our aim was to narratively summarize the available literature on the management of COVID-19 in order to combine current evidence and interpretation of the data by experts who are treating patients in the frontline setting.

Methods

The panel conducted a detailed review of the literature and eventual press releases from randomized clinical trials for each possible available treatment. Inductive PubMed search waws performed for publications relevant to the topic, including all clinical trials conducted. The result was a flowchart with treatment indications for patients with COVID-19.

Implications

After 6 months of a pandemic situation and before a possible second coronavirus wave descends on Europe, it is important to evaluate which drugs proved to be effective while also considering that results from many randomized clinical trials are still awaited. Indeed, among treatments for COVID-19, only glucocorticoids have resulted in an association with a significant decrease in mortality in published randomized controlled trials. New therapeutic strategies are urgently needed.

### Repurposed pharmacological agents for the potential treatment of COVID-19: a literature review [^115w5cX6]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

From the February 2021 update of the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines, the Panel strongly recommends dexamethasone for hospitalised COVID-19 patients who require supplemental oxygen through high-flow devices or non-invasive ventilation. A combination with remdesivir is also mentioned as a treatment option for these patients. Dexamethasone is also strongly recommended for hospitalised patients on invasive ventilation or ECMO. For hospitalised patients who require increasing amounts of supplemental oxygen not through a high-flow device, non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or ECMO the use of dexamethasone can optionally be added to the treatment of remdesivir or can be administered as monotherapy if a combination with remdesivir is not feasible. Furthermore, the Panel strongly recommends against the use of dexamethasone for hospitalised COVID-19 patients who do not need supplemental oxygen and to non-hospitalised, mild to moderate COVID-19 patients. Recommended alternatives for dexamethasone, if not available, are prednisone, methylprednisolone, and hydrocortisone. The ERS supports this viewpoint by strongly suggesting systemic corticosteroids to patients who are hospitalised for COVID-19 that need oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation.

### Impact of corticosteroids in hospitalised COVID-19 patients [^113J2eQs]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

COVID-19 is associated with physiological and pathological evidence of ARDS. Until the recent RECOVERY trial, there was no evidence from randomised clinical trials identifying a specific therapy, including corticosteroids, that improved outcomes in patients with COVID-19 lung injury. During the early months of the pandemic, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of America)did not recommend the use of corticosteroids for COVID-19-related lung disease. Russell et al summarised the available clinical evidence for using corticosteroids in MERS-CoV, SARS-Co-V influenzaand, consistent with WHO recommendations, argued against the use of corticosteroids for COVID-19 lung injury. There has been concern that corticosteroids may increase viral replication, prolong viral shedding and increase the risk of secondary infections. Nevertheless, corticosteroids have been used to treat COVID-19 lung injury. The Chinese Thoracic Society developed a consensus statement on the use of corticosteroids for COVID-19 pneumonia and recommended that corticosteroids be used prudently in critically ill patients using low to moderate doses of methylprednisolone or equivalent for a duration of up to 7 days. The RECOVERY trial demonstrated that dexamethasone 6 mg once a day for 10 days reduced 28-day mortality in patients with COVID-19 who received respiratory support.

In this study, we report our early real-world clinical experience with corticosteroids in a cohort of patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in the New York City metropolitan area and provide evidence of mortality benefit and safety.

Variation in recommendations

The limited level of rigour in constructing the guidelines made accounting for the notable variation in the recommendations difficult. For instance, the Russian guidelines advocated the use of anti-inflammatory drugs whereas most others made no such recommendations. Most guidelines strongly discouraged the use of steroids for covid-19. However, the detail with which this recommendation was made varied widely. The use of steroids in acute respiratory infections such as covid-19 is contested, but the debate is complex and relies on the interpretation of observational studies and surrogate outcomes. Guidelines must be clear but must not obscure the complexity of this debate to guideline users.

The most marked difference in the content of the guidelines was in the support for antiviral agents, both in terms of whether to use antivirals at all and in the specific antiviral regimen endorsed. Clearly, complex factors are involved in choosing a treatment regimen in an emergency. However, because the guidelines were drafted without clear links between recommendation and underlying evidence, the logic of each regimen was hard to ascertain. Expecting strongly evidenced interventions for a recently emerged disease is unreasonable, and we appreciate that more thorough and a greater number of guidelines will be produced as the pandemic progresses. However, clinicians need guidelines that are evidence based and include a thorough evaluation of the level of evidence on which a recommendation is based, while also conveying which populations and indications the guidance applies to. When no evidence is available, this should also be made clear. Any recommendations made should be directly linked to an evaluation of the supporting evidence. GRADE is a systematic method for making clinical practice recommendations and helps to portray the certainty with which a recommendation is made and could be used. Arguably, the variation seen in the recommendations on the use of supportive care and the lack of recommendations for vulnerable, high risk populations underline the importance of a gold standard framework for guideline construction under conditions of uncertainty.

### Lower mortality risk associated with remdesivir + dexamethasone versus dexamethasone alone for the treatment of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 [^116vELsx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

(See the Editorial Commentary by Lee on pages 72–3.)

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic in March 2020. Over the 4 years since, guidelines have provided recommendations for use of antiviral and immunomodulatory (ie, corticosteroids) medications for COVID-19 management based on disease severity and evolving clinical evidence. In 2024, WHO acknowledged COVID-19's continuing threat to lives and health systems.

In the early stages of the pandemic, the effectiveness of dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory medication used to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome with mixed results, was compared to usual care in patients with COVID-19 randomized during 19 March 2020 to 8 June 2020 (RECOVERY study, NCT04381936). This study led to the WHO recommendation for corticosteroids in the management of COVID-19 on 22 June 2020. The 28-day mortality in the dexamethasone group was lower compared to the usual care group (22.9% vs 25.7%). However, there was also the potential for detrimental effects of dexamethasone versus usual care in this study; the death rate was higher in patients receiving no oxygen at randomization treated with dexamethasone (17.8%) versus patients receiving usual care (14.0%). More recent research conducted since the RECOVERY study has also shown the potential for a detrimental effect of corticosteroid treatment in patients with low-severity COVID-19.

### Acute bronchitis: rapid evidence review [^117PueHE]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis and accounts for more than 3 million outpatient office visits in the United States annually. The differential diagnosis includes exacerbations of preexisting conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure or other causes of acute cough, including pertussis, COVID-19, influenza, and community-acquired pneumonia. Acute cough may present with or without sputum production. Diagnostic testing is not indicated unless there is concern for other potential causes, such as community-acquired pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19. Acute bronchitis is a self-limiting disease. Evidence does not support the use of antitussives, honey, antihistamines, anticholinergics, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Antibiotics do not contribute to the overall improvement of acute bronchitis; although they may decrease the duration of cough by approximately 0.5 days, their use exposes patients to antibiotic-related adverse effects. Therefore, symptom relief and patient education regarding the expected duration of cough (2–3 weeks) are recommended for the management of acute bronchitis. Strategies shown to decrease antibiotic prescribing include delayed antibiotic prescriptions and describing acute bronchitis as a chest cold.

Summary

Background

Previous studies suggested that the prevalence of chronic respiratory disease in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 was lower than its prevalence in the general population. The aim of this study was to assess whether chronic lung disease or use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) affects the risk of contracting severe COVID-19.

Methods

In this population cohort study, records from 1205 general practices in England that contribute to the QResearch database were linked to Public Health England's database of SARS-CoV-2 testing and English hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths for COVID-19. All patients aged 20 years and older who were registered with one of the 1205 general practices on Jan 24, 2020, were included in this study. With Cox regression, we examined the risks of COVID-19-related hospitalisation, admission to ICU, and death in relation to respiratory disease and use of ICS, adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic status and comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19.

Findings

Between Jan 24 and April 30, 2020, 8 256 161 people were included in the cohort and observed, of whom 14 479 (0·2%) were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, 1542 (< 0·1%) were admitted to ICU, and 5956 (0·1%) died. People with some respiratory diseases were at an increased risk of hospitalisation (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] hazard ratio [HR] 1·54 [95% CI 1·45–1·63], asthma 1·18 [1·13–1·24], severe asthma 1·29 [1·22–1·37; people on three or more current asthma medications], bronchiectasis 1·34 [1·20–1·50], sarcoidosis 1·36 [1·10–1·68], extrinsic allergic alveolitis 1·35 [0·82–2·21], idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 1·59 [1·30–1·95], other interstitial lung disease 1·66 [1·30–2·12], and lung cancer 2·24 [1·89–2·65]) and death (COPD 1·54 [1·42–1·67], asthma 0·99 [0·91–1·07], severe asthma 1·08 [0·98–1·19], bronchiectasis 1·12 [0·94–1·33], sarcoidosis 1·41 [0·99–1·99), extrinsic allergic alveolitis 1·56 [0·78–3·13], idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 1·47 [1·12–1·92], other interstitial lung disease 2·05 [1·49–2·81], and lung cancer 1·77 [1·37–2·29]) due to COVID-19 compared with those without these diseases. Admission to ICU was rare, but the HR for people with asthma was 1·08 (0·93–1·25) and severe asthma was 1·30 (1·08–1·58). In a post-hoc analysis, relative risks of severe COVID-19 in people with respiratory disease were similar before and after shielding was introduced on March 23, 2020. In another post-hoc analysis, people with two or more prescriptions for ICS in the 150 days before study start were at a slightly higher risk of severe COVID-19 compared with all other individuals (ie, no or one ICS prescription): HR 1·13 (1·03–1·23) for hospitalisation, 1·63 (1·18–2·24) for ICU admission, and 1·15 (1·01–1·31) for death.

Interpretation

The risk of severe COVID-19 in people with asthma is relatively small. People with COPD and interstitial lung disease appear to have a modestly increased risk of severe disease, but their risk of death from COVID-19 at the height of the epidemic was mostly far lower than the ordinary risk of death from any cause. Use of inhaled steroids might be associated with a modestly increased risk of severe COVID-19.

### Clinical characteristics and effects of inhaled corticosteroid in patients with post-COVID-19 chronic cough during the omicron variant outbreak [^112Q6h1V]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We also found that post-COVID-19 chronic cough was accompanied by lung dysfunction, as some patients had obstructive or restrictive pulmonary ventilation dysfunction, and approximately half had abnormal minor airway function. Previous studies have reported respiratory symptoms and pulmonary dysfunction in patients with COVID-19, where similar abnormalities in pulmonary function test parameters were observed. This suggests the importance of pulmonary function tests for patients with persistent cough after COVID-19. Post-COVID-19 persistent cough is commonly accompanied by dyspnea, polypnea, weakness, muscular soreness, or other multisystem manifestations, which may indicate complex multifactor pathogenesis. Therefore, recording the accompanying symptoms and their degree can contribute to the identification and follow-up of patients with persistent cough.

Respiratory viruses can aggravate or induce asthma. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the attention of researchers to patients with asthma. Current research results show that existing asthma does not seem to increase a patient's susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or affect the severity of the disease. However, some research has supported the idea that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause an exacerbation of asthma or even contribute to the initial development of a clinical asthma attack. Our study provides evidence to support this perspective; more than 40% of patients with persistent symptoms of cough or breathlessness after COVID-19 infection were shown to have asthma. This proportion is higher than that reported in a previous study, where approximately one tenth of patients were diagnosed with newly emerging asthma. Our results may show a higher rate because positive bronchial provocation test results caused by transient airway hyperresponsiveness may increase the diagnosis of cough variant asthma.

### The role of antirheumatics in patients with COVID-19 [^117PUbz8]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 2 million deaths globally. Two interconnected stages of disease are generally recognised; an initial viral stage and a subsequent immune response phase with the clinical characteristics of hyperinflammation associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, many immune modulators and immunosuppressive drugs, which are widely used in rheumatological practice, have been proposed as treatments for patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. In this Review, we provide an overview of what is currently known about the efficacy and safety of antirheumatic therapies for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Dexamethasone has been shown to reduce COVID-19 related mortality, interleukin-6 inhibitors to reduce risk of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support, and baricitinib to reduce time to recovery in hospitalised patients requiring oxygen support. Further studies are needed to identify whether there is any role for glucocorticoids in patients with less severe COVID-19. Although evidence on the use of other antirheumatic drugs has suggested some benefits, results from adequately powered clinical trials are urgently needed. The heterogeneity in dosing and the absence of uniform inclusion criteria and defined stage of disease studied in many clinical trials have affected the conclusions and comparability of trial results. However, after the success of dexamethasone in proving the anti-inflammatory hypothesis, the next 12 months will undoubtedly bring further clarity about the clinical utility and optimal dose and timing of other anti-rheumatic drugs in the management of COVID-19.

Abatacept added to standard care in hospitalized adults with severe or critical COVID-19 receiving systemic glucocorticoids — evidence summary: One randomized controlled trial (N = 1049) enrolled adults 18 years or older with severe COVID-19 and randomized patients to abatacept 10 mg/kg (maximum dose 1000 mg) plus standard of care versus standard of care alone; standard of care included remdesivir (93–94%), corticosteroids (89–93%), tocilizumab (3%), and baricitinib (1–3%). Outcomes reported included mortality at 28 days, recovery at 28 days, and serious adverse events. In the GRADE Evidence Profile for this question, absolute effects per 1000 were reported as 41 fewer per 1000 (from 2 fewer to 82 fewer) for mortality at 28 days, 38 more per 1000 (from 7 fewer to 100 more) for recovery at 28 days, and 16 fewer per 1000 (from 41 fewer to 7 more) for serious adverse events.

Pharmacologic treatment of severe COVID-19 — criteria and therapies are specified: Patients with severe COVID-19 are those with pulmonary involvement and hypoxia or needing low flow oxygen, and most existing criteria for trials consider either a SpO2 level less than 94% or 90% or tachypnea (respiratory rate > 30 breaths per minute) as severe COVID-19. Corticosteroids, especially dexamethasone, are recommended as the cornerstone of therapy in severe COVID-19. Remdesivir may be considered as it has shown to decrease time to recovery or discharge, though it has not been shown to improve mortality. The IL-6 inhibitors tocilizumab and sarilumab and JAK inhibitors baricitinib and tofacitinib have shown a benefit in severe, but non-critical COVID-19 when used with corticosteroids, and we recommend using either IL-6 inhibitors or JAK inhibitors (baricitinib preferred over tofacitinib) in those with elevated inflammatory markers like CRP and progressive severe COVID-19; since there is greater supportive data for tocilizumab and baricitinib we recommend them preferentially over sarilumab and tofacitinib, though the latter agents are suitable alternatives if the former are not available. We do not recommend using hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, or convalescent plasma, and we also recommend against the use of ivermectin outside of the context of a clinical trial given the low certainty of evidence for its benefit.

### Dexamethasone in COVID-19 treatment: analyzing monotherapy and combination therapy approaches [^1119xWvB]. Cytokine (2024). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the exploration of effective treatment options, with dexamethasone emerging as a key corticosteroid for severe cases. This review evaluates the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone, highlighting its ability to reduce mortality rates, alleviate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and mitigate hyperinflammation. While dexamethasone shows therapeutic promise, potential adverse effects-including cardiovascular issues, neuropsychiatric complications, lung infections, and liver damage-necessitate careful monitoring and individualized treatment strategies. The review also addresses the debate over using dexamethasone alone versus in combination with other therapies targeting SARS-CoV-2, examining potential synergistic effects and drug resistance. In summary, dexamethasone is a valuable treatment option for COVID-19 but its risks highlight the need for tailored surveillance approaches. Further research is essential to establish clear guidelines for optimizing treatment and improving patient outcomes.

### Steroid harms if given early in COVID-19 viraemia [^116J69ZL]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

COVID-19 is a biphasic illness with an initial viraemia phase and later effective adaptive immune phase, except in a minority of people who develop severe disease. Immune regulation is the key target to treat COVID illness. In anticipation, an elderly man self-medicated himself with dexamethasone on the day of symptom onset of a flu-like illness, took other symptomatic measures and was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. His condition deteriorated with each passing day resulting in hospitalisation. He demanded oxygen and declared as severe COVID. With supportive treatment, he recovered after the 20th day of illness. Immunosuppression and anti-inflammation are likely to benefit when the immune response is dysregulated and turning into a cytokine storm. A medication that has saved many could be the one predisposing to severity if taken as a preventive measure, too early in the disease course, especially the viraemia phase.

COVID-19 and COPD — People with COPD presenting with new or worsening respiratory symptoms, fever, and/or any other symptoms that could be COVID-19 related, even if these are mild, should be tested for possible infection with SARS-CoV-2. Patients should keep taking their oral and inhaled respiratory medications for COPD as directed, and physical distancing and shielding, or sheltering-in-place, should not lead to social isolation and inactivity; patients should stay in contact with their friends and families by telecommunication and continue to keep active, and they should also ensure they have enough medication. Patients should be encouraged to use reputable resources for medical information regarding COVID-19 and its management, and guidance for remote (phone/virtual/online) COPD patient follow-up and a printable checklist are provided. Differentiating the symptoms of COVID-19 infection from the usual symptoms of COPD can be challenging; cough and breathlessness are found in over 60% of patients with COVID-19 and are usually also accompanied by fever (> 60% of patients). In COVID-19 symptoms may be mild at first, but rapid deterioration in lung function may occur, and a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 needs to be maintained in people with COPD who present with symptoms of an exacerbation, especially if accompanied by fever, impaired taste or smell or GI complaints. Persistent symptoms in people with COPD may cause diagnostic difficulty: approximately 10–20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may develop persistent symptoms with 25–45% experiencing dyspnea at 6–9 months after the acute infection and approximately 20% at 9–12 months.

In another post-hoc analysis, people with two or more prescriptions for ICS in the 150 days before study start were at a slightly higher risk of severe COVID-19 compared with all other individuals (ie, no or one ICS prescription): HR 1·13 (1·03–1·23) for hospitalisation, 1·63 (1·18–2·24) for ICU admission, and 1·15 (1·01–1·31) for death.

Interpretation

The risk of severe COVID-19 in people with asthma is relatively small. People with COPD and interstitial lung disease appear to have a modestly increased risk of severe disease, but their risk of death from COVID-19 at the height of the epidemic was mostly far lower than the ordinary risk of death from any cause. Use of inhaled steroids might be associated with a modestly increased risk of severe COVID-19.

### Pharmacologic management of COPD exacerbations… [^115UED8i]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

25 At the end of 10 days, patients receiving doxycycline showed higher rates of clinical cure compared with those receiving placebo. A second study randomized 100 patients to receive 500 mg of a quinolone or 500 mg of amoxicillin compared with placebo for 10 days. 27 No significant differences were observed between the treatment and placebo groups. The third trial was conducted in Spain and randomized 310 patients to receive amoxicillin or placebo. 26 Patients treated with amoxicillin had a significantly longer time to subsequent exacerbations than those receiving placebo, which was considered a measure of clinical cure. RECOMMENDATION 2 The AAFP recommends that clinicians prescribe corticosteroids for adults with acute exacerbations of COPD to reduce clinical failure. There is insufficient evidence to guide the dose, route of administration, or duration of treatment.

Low quality of evidence demonstrated that systemic corticosteroids decreased the clinical failure rate in adults with acute exacerbations of COPD. One RCT conducted in the Veterans Affairs health system randomized 190 patients to receive a course of intravenous methylprednisolone and oral prednisone or to receive placebo for eight weeks. 30 A third group, which was not included in the analysis, received corticosteroids for two weeks. Patients receiving placebo had significantly higher rates of clinical failure than those receiving corticosteroids. The second study looked at 26 patients who received oral prednisone or placebo. 31 No treatment failures were observed in the treatment group compared with 61% of those in the placebo group. 14 This is consistent with a large observational study that was published after the search dates for the evidence review. 32 This study used administrative data and included 10, 152 patient records.

These data showed small increases in rates of pneumonia-associated hospitalization and mortality associated with longer courses of corticosteroids. 32 There was insufficient evidence to guide decisions about routes of administration of corticosteroids in this population. 60 Similarly, providing immunizations against pneumococcal infections and influenza was shown to reduce the number of exacerbations in patients with COPD. 61, 62 Additionally, potential comorbidities can be effectively addressed in the primary care setting. If a patient has not had a spirometry test previously, this can be administered by the primary care physician to confirm that other conditions, such as asthma or restrictive lung disease, are not contributing to the exacerbation episodes.

### Corticosteroid therapy for patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease… [^116UDqDc]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Historically, treatment approaches to COPD have mirrored the treatment of asthma. Patients with stable COPD have minimal corticosteroid responsiveness compared with patients with asthma, and physiological evidence for systemic steroid administration for COPD is weaker. Despite this, up to 80% of patients with COPD who require treatment for acute respiratory failure receive parenteral corticosteroids, 11 and their administration has been endorsed in major guideline statements.

1. The optimal dose of steroid and duration of treatment for COPD exacerbations remains unknown. The wide range of studied doses and regimens has included 100 mg of hydrocortisone as well as 125 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone. One regimen of 30 mg of prednisolone daily showed similar benefit to a more aggressive, higher-dosage steroid regimen.

40, 41 Niewoehner et al40 found no advantage to 8 weeks of oral prednisone therapy compared with 2 weeks, and the rates of serious infection may have been higher in those patients receiving 8 weeks of steroid treatment. There is evidence to suggest that patients who receive systemic steroids are at increased risk of infection. One meta-analysis found that patients receiving corticosteroid treatment were at increased risk of lethal and nonlethal infections. 59 This association was dose dependent, although there was no increase in risk observed with either cumulative doses of prednisone less than 700 mg or daily doses of prednisone less than 10 mg. Presumptive diagnosis of COPD by physicians may underestimate the prevalence of asthma in the study population. Benefit from steroid administration in asthma is well documented, and the inclusion of patients with asthma in COPD studies will overestimate steroid benefit.

Most studies excluded patients with a history of asthma, one excluded patients with significant reversibility of airflow obstruction on spirometry, 43 and one excluded patients with positive skin prick tests. 42 Despite this, it is possible that some of the patients studied had either asthma or a combination of asthma and COPD. Despite concerns with respect to diagnostic accuracy, the overall implication of the reported trials remains valid: patients who present to their physicians with symptoms of a COPD exacerbation are likely to benefit immediately from systemic corticosteroid therapy regardless of whether their true diagnosis is COPD or asthma. However, the management algorithms for these 2 disorders differ substantially, particularly with respect to long-term inhaled corticosteroid use, thus the correct diagnosis should be pursued when the patient becomes stable.

### Steroid resistance during COPD exacerbations with respiratory… [^11744BW2]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Like many diseases of chronic inflammation, the course of COPD is marred by intermittent disease flares that need more intensive treatment. In COPD, disease flares are called acute exacerbations of COPD. AECOPDs are characterized by increased shortness of breath, wheezing or cough that leads to urgent, and sometimes emergent, treatment with inhaled bronchodilators, antibiotics and steroids. For example, patients hospitalized with an AECOPD are effectively treated with steroids dosed as low as 40mg/day. In contrast, two recent clinical studies showed that ~80mg/day of prednisone was ineffective for AECOPD patients hospitalized with respiratory failure, while in a second study ~160mg/day of methylprednisolone improved outcomes.

The investigators recent epidemiologic study showed that 66% of patients admitted with an AECOPD and respiratory failure between 2003–2008 were treated with > 240mg/day of methylprednisolone, a dose that increases steroid-related side effects. The investigators hypothesize that there is a stepwise increase in steroid resistance with COPD < AECOPD < AECOPD with respiratory failure. A newly launched team of investigators is focused on establishing the presence of steroid resistance, defining the cause, devising new treatments to combat this problem and optimizing therapy for these vulnerable patients. Preliminary data show that DUSP1 is decreased in alveolar macrophages from COPD patients, suggesting the central hypothesis that steroid resistance is increased in AECOPDs with respiratory failure due to impaired glucocorticoid-mediated induction of DUSP1.

To address this hypothesis, the investigators will inject 23 AECOPD patients with respiratory failure and 23 matched stable COPD subjects with 60mg of methylprednisolone to: 1) determine the presence of corticosteroid resistance in AECOPDs, 2) determine the role of DUSP1, and 3) examine alternative mechanisms driving steroid resistance. Exclusion Criteria for AECOPD with Ventilatory Failure Cohort:

- Systemic steroid use ≤ 30 days prior to return visit
- Infection requiring antibiotics ≤ 1 month prior to return visit
- Hemoglobin < 8. 0 g/dl
- Acute pulmonary embolism
- Diabetes
- History of immunodeficiency, interstitial lung disease, neuromuscular disorder or heart failure with respiratory exacerbation.

### Effect of oral prednisolone on symptom duration and severity in… [^117VixGe]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

This was regarded as the more important of the 2 primary outcomes because cough was the main presenting symptom of the illness, and it included measures of both duration and severity. The second primary outcome was the mean severity score of the 6 main symptoms on days 2 to 4; the mean score was calculated across the symptoms for each day and then an overall mean was calculated, with a maximum value of 6. Because there were no previous studies of oral steroids to inform the minimum clinically important difference in both outcomes, the investigative team considered the balance of potential benefits and adverse effects and reached a minimum clinically important difference consensus of 20%, corresponding to a geometric mean in the active treatment group of
3. 79 days for duration of cough and 1. 66 points for severity of symptoms. Symptom diaries were returned by 374 participants. For duration of moderately bad or worse cough, data were available for 334 participants, with 40 reporting an initial cough severity of less than 3 points and 24 lost to follow-up. Quiz Ref IDIn this randomized trial of 401 adults, 5 days of moderate-dose oral prednisolone did not reduce the duration of moderately bad or worse cough, or the severity of symptoms between days 2 and 4 adults without asthma who presented to primary care with acute lower respiratory tract infection. No effects were observed for duration and severity of any acute lower respiratory tract infection symptom, duration of abnormal peak flow, antibiotic use, or adverse events, including worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes.

Second, there was a higher than expected number of participants with zero duration of moderately bad or worse cough, although a sensitivity analysis including these participants did not influence the results. Third, other baseline biomarkers were not measured, and it is possible that patients with more severe, inflammatory, eosinophilic, 32, 33 or microbiological 34 etiology entered the trial or could have differentially benefited.
