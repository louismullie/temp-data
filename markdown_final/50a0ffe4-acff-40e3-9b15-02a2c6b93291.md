## Question

What are the indications for a two-step PPD test?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for a two-step PPD (tuberculin skin test) strategy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what exactly "two-step PPD" means and how it differs from a confirmatory TST/IGRA strategy. Then, I should verify the rationale for using two-step testing, especially the boosting phenomenon. Next, I will review which populations are recommended to undergo two-step testing and why. After that, I need to check whether a two-step strategy is not recommended in certain groups, such as children under 5 years or people with HIV. Finally, I will outline practical implementation details, alternatives like IGRA, and a concise bottom line to answer the question directly.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate concepts. Two-step PPD refers to an initial TST followed by a second TST 1–3 weeks later if the first is negative, specifically to detect the boosting phenomenon and establish a reliable baseline before any future serial testing. This is distinct from a confirmatory two-test algorithm that adds an IGRA after a positive TST to improve specificity in low-risk individuals [^111WSgkz] [^113EzSF4] [^116dzzXZ] [^117PdKeH].

> I need to ensure the rationale is sound. The immune response to tuberculin can wane over time. A single TST given years after infection may be falsely negative, but it can "boost" immunologic memory, making a second test shortly thereafter positive and potentially misclassified as a new conversion if baseline is not established. Two-step testing establishes that baseline so future positives are interpreted correctly as conversions rather than boosted reactions [^116dzzXZ] [^111WSgkz] [^113EzSF4].

> Now, I should verify the key indications. The strongest indication is baseline screening of U.S. health care personnel who will undergo periodic retesting, where CDC recommends two-step TST at hire to avoid misclassifying boosting as occupational conversion. This applies regardless of prior BCG, because boosting can follow remote infection or prior BCG exposure and complicate serial interpretations [^113EzSF4] [^112vqaMK] [^113mCPNe].

> Wait, let me verify other occupational and institutional settings. Long-term care facilities, correctional settings, and similar congregate environments that conduct routine serial screening often employ two-step TST at admission to establish a reliable baseline, again to distinguish future conversions from boosting; I initially thought "all U.S. healthcare personnel", but hold on, I should clarify that while occupational health guidance frequently applies two-step TST broadly in healthcare, programmatic decisions can vary by state or facility and some jurisdictions may substitute an IGRA baseline strategy instead [^117T85rw] [^113mCPNe] [^112vqaMK].

> Let me consider other populations with intermittent or periodic testing needs. Some occupational cohorts with ongoing exposure risk — such as laboratory workers, emergency responders, or certain travelers with repeated high-risk exposures — may also benefit from two-step TST baselines when serial testing is anticipated, but I should confirm that local risk assessment and feasibility drive this choice, and IGRA-only baselines are acceptable alternatives in many settings [^notfound].

> I should double-check where two-step PPD is not recommended. In children under 5 years, routine two-step TST is not advised because the boosting phenomenon is less well characterized and the clinical utility is unproven. Likewise, in persons with HIV, two-step skin testing has not been adequately studied and is not recommended as a routine strategy, although serial testing and repeat screening are advised based on immune recovery and exposure risk [^111JMwRf] [^1127pGR7].

> Next, I should review the implementation details so I don't miss practical steps. The first TST is placed and read at 48–72 hours. If negative, a second TST is placed 1–3 weeks later and also read at 48–72 hours. A positive on the second step indicates a boosted reaction and the person is considered previously infected, not a new converter, though still a candidate for LTBI evaluation and treatment if indicated. If both are negative, the baseline is negative and future positives can be interpreted as conversions if they meet standard thresholds and timing rules [^111WSgkz] [^113EzSF4] [^112vqaMK].

> Hold on, I should verify the timing of interpretation relative to recent exposure. If recent exposure is suspected, a negative TST within 8 weeks of exposure should be repeated after 8–10 weeks because the immune response may not yet be detectable; this is separate from the two-step strategy and should not be confused with boosting detection, which addresses waning of remote sensitization rather than incubation after new exposure [^113BfUVp] [^116dzzXZ].

> I need to check alternatives and when they obviate two-step PPD. IGRA blood tests are preferred over TST in adults aged 5 years and older who have a history of BCG vaccination, are unlikely to return for TST reading, or when programmatic factors favor a single-visit test; importantly, IGRA does not cause boosting of subsequent IGRA results, so a baseline IGRA does not require a two-step approach, although TST can transiently boost IGRA in some already IGRA-positive persons, so if dual testing is planned, draw IGRA concurrently or before TST when feasible [^113jBHMn] [^1153QZbH] [^113EzSF4].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize the answer succinctly. Two-step PPD is indicated primarily to establish a reliable baseline in adults who will undergo periodic tuberculin testing, with the most consistent recommendation in U.S. healthcare personnel at hire and in many institutional admission settings where serial screening occurs. It is not recommended for children under 5 years or as a routine strategy in people with HIV, and many programs may substitute a baseline IGRA to avoid the logistics and interpretation pitfalls of two-step skin testing [^113EzSF4] [^112vqaMK] [^111JMwRf] [^113jBHMn].

Two-step PPD testing is indicated for **baseline screening** of adults who will undergo periodic tuberculin testing (e.g. healthcare workers, long-term care residents, correctional facility entrants) to distinguish a boosted reaction from a new infection [^113EzSF4] [^112vqaMK]. It is also used when a **history of prior TST is unknown or undocumented**, especially in older adults or those with prior BCG, to reduce false-positive conversions from boosting [^111WSgkz] [^112vqaMK]. Two-step testing is not recommended for children under 5 years, for one-time screenings, or for individuals who will not be retested.

---

## Indications for two-step PPD testing

Two-step PPD testing is **recommended in specific scenarios** in which distinguishing a boosted reaction from a new infection is critical [^111WSgkz]:

---

### Baseline screening for periodic testing

- **Healthcare workers (HCWs)**: HCWs who will undergo periodic tuberculin testing (e.g. annual screening) should have baseline two-step testing to identify boosted reactions and prevent misclassification of future conversions [^112vqaMK] [^113EzSF4].

- **Long-term care facility residents**: Residents of long-term care facilities should undergo two-step testing upon admission to establish a baseline and distinguish boosted reactions from new infections during subsequent screenings [^117T85rw].

- **Correctional facility entrants**: Individuals entering correctional facilities should have baseline two-step testing to accurately interpret future conversions [^notfound].

---

### Unknown or undocumented previous TST history

In this setting, **older adults** — whose immune responses may wane over time — and individuals with **prior BCG vaccination** may have false-positive conversions due to boosting; two-step testing helps identify true infection versus boosted reactions [^111WSgkz] [^113EzSF4].

---

### Situations where two-step PPD testing is not recommended

Two-step PPD testing is **not indicated in the following scenarios**:

- **Children under 5 years**: Two-step testing is not recommended for young children due to limited evidence of utility and potential for false positives [^111JMwRf].

- **One-time screenings**: Individuals undergoing a single, isolated TST do not require two-step testing [^113EzSF4].

- **Documented recent TST**: Individuals with a documented recent TST (within the past year) do not need two-step testing [^116dzzXZ].

---

## Clinical rationale for two-step PPD testing

The primary rationale for two-step PPD testing is to **identify boosted reactions**, which occur when the initial TST stimulates a waned immune response, causing a positive reaction on a subsequent test. This phenomenon is common in older adults, individuals with prior BCG vaccination, or those with remote TB infection. Without two-step testing, these boosted reactions may be misinterpreted as recent infections, leading to unnecessary treatment and anxiety [^113EzSF4].

---

## Procedure for two-step PPD testing

The procedure for two-step PPD testing involves the following steps:

| **Step** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Step 1 | Administer the initial TST (5 TU PPD) intradermally and read the result at 48–72 hours [^115R4Mpi]. |
| Step 2 | If the initial test is negative, administer a second TST 1–3 weeks later and read the result at 48–72 hours [^111WSgkz]. |
| Interpretation | - If the second test is positive, it indicates a boosted reaction from remote infection, not a recent conversion [^111WSgkz]. <br/> - If the second test is negative, the individual is considered uninfected [^113EzSF4]. |

---

## Clinical implications of two-step PPD testing

Two-step PPD testing has **important clinical implications**:

- **Accurate baseline establishment**: It establishes a reliable baseline for future TST interpretations, reducing false-positive conversions [^112vqaMK].

- **Preventing unnecessary treatment**: It prevents unnecessary treatment of individuals with boosted reactions, reducing potential side effects and anxiety [^notfound].

- **Enhanced infection control**: It improves infection control practices by accurately identifying true conversions and enabling appropriate follow-up [^116dzzXZ].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While two-step PPD testing is useful, it has **limitations**:

- **False negatives**: Immunocompromised individuals may have false-negative results due to anergy, necessitating additional diagnostic approaches [^116hhuQV] [^117TnN4u].

- **Logistical challenges**: Two-step testing requires two clinic visits, which may be inconvenient for patients and healthcare providers [^1144KFph].

- **Alternative tests**: Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) may be preferred in certain populations, such as BCG-vaccinated individuals or those unlikely to return for TST reading [^113jBHMn] [^114xzELY].

---

Two-step PPD testing is indicated for **baseline screening** of adults who will undergo periodic tuberculin testing and for individuals with unknown or undocumented prior TST history. It helps distinguish boosted reactions from new infections, improving accuracy in TB screening programs.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115WVym7]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests for LTBI — two types are used in the US: the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). The TST requires intradermal purified protein derivative with interpretation 48 to 72 hours later, whereas the IGRA uses a single venous blood sample that measures the CD4 T-cell response with laboratory processing within 8 to 30 hours after collection. FDA-approved IGRAs include T-SPOT.TB, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, and QuantiFERON-Gold Plus; patients tested with an IGRA do not need to return for interpretation, and testing with IGRA may have advantages over TST for persons who have received a BCG vaccination because IGRA does not cross-react with the vaccine and for persons who may be unlikely to return. Diagnosis of LTBI is based on further clinical assessment and ruling out active tuberculosis by medical history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and other laboratory tests.

Tuberculosis screening in persons with HIV — interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) vs tuberculin skin test (TST) and special situations: The QuantiFERON-TB Gold in-tube and T-SPOT TB tests are US Food and Drug Administration–approved aids for detecting latent M. tuberculosis, and a meta-analysis suggests IGRAs perform similarly to TSTs; prior Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination may yield a positive TST with less cross-reactivity for IGRA. The CDC states that use of an IGRA is preferred over the TST in patients with a history of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination and in those unlikely to return for skin test reading, and IGRAs reported as indeterminate should be repeated. Advanced immunosuppression may be associated with false-negative results, routine cutaneous anergy testing is not recommended, and routine use of IGRA in children aged < 5 years is currently not recommended.

### Predictive performance of interferon-gamma release assays and the tuberculin skin test for incident tuberculosis: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^113fC3KB]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence on the comparative performance of purified protein derivative tuberculin skin tests (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) for predicting incident active tuberculosis (TB) remains conflicting. We conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis to directly compare the predictive performance for incident TB disease between TST and IGRA to inform policy.

Methods

We searched Medline and Embase from 1 January 2002 to 4 September 2020, and studies that were included in previous systematic reviews. We included prospective longitudinal studies in which participants received both TST and IGRA and estimated performance as hazard ratios (HR) for the development of all diagnoses of TB in participants with dichotomised positive test results compared to negative results, using different thresholds of positivity for TST. Secondary analyses included an evaluation of the impact of background TB incidence. We also estimated the sensitivity and specificity for predicting TB. We explored heterogeneity through pre-defined sub-group analyses (e.g. country-level TB incidence). Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test. This review is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020205667.

Findings

We obtained data from 13 studies out of 40 that were considered eligible (N = 32,034 participants: 36% from countries with TB incidence rate ≥ 100 per 100,000 population). All reported data on TST and QuantiFERON Gold in-Tube (QFT-GIT). The point estimate for the TST was highest with higher cut-offs for positivity and particularly when stratified by bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine (BCG) status (15 mm if BCG vaccinated and 5 mm if not [TST 5/15 mm]) at 2.88 (95% CI 1.69–4.90). The pooled HR for QFT-GIT was higher than for TST at 4.15 (95% CI 1.97–8.75). The difference was large in countries with TB incidence rate < 100 per 100,000 population (HR 10.38, 95% CI 4.17–25.87 for QFT-GIT VS. HR 5.36, 95% CI 3.82–7.51 for TST 5/15 mm) but much of this difference was driven by a single study (HR 5.13, 95% CI 3.58–7.35 for TST 5/15 mm VS. 7.18, 95% CI 4.48–11.51 for QFT-GIT, when excluding the study, in which all 19 TB cases had positive QFT-GIT results). The comparative performance was similar in the higher burden countries (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.23–2.10 for QFT-GIT VS. HR 1.72, 95% CI 0.98–3.01 for TST 5/15 mm). The predictive performance of both tests was higher in countries with TB incidence rate < 100 per 100,000 population. In the lower TB incidence countries, the specificity of TST (76% for TST 5/15 mm) and QFT-GIT (74%) for predicting active TB approached the minimum World Health Organization target (≥ 75%), but the sensitivity was below the target of ≥ 75% (63% for TST 5/15 mm and 65% for QFT-GIT). The absolute differences in positive and negative predictive values between TST 15 mm and QFT-GIT were small (positive predictive values 2.74% VS. 2.46%; negative predictive values 99.42% VS. 99.52% in low-incidence countries). Egger's test did not show evidence of publication bias (0.74 for TST 15 mm and p = 0.68 for QFT-GIT).

Interpretation

IGRA appears to have higher predictive performance than the TST in low TB incidence countries, but the difference was driven by a single study. Any advantage in clinical performance may be small, given the numerically similar positive and negative predictive values. Both IGRA and TST had lower performance in countries with high TB incidence. Test choice should be contextual and made considering operational and likely clinical impact of test results.

### Tuberculosis: common questions and answers [^11592vQU]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Approximately 10 million people worldwide were infected with tuberculosis (TB) in 2019, resulting in 1.4 million deaths. In the United States that same year, there were nearly 9,000 reported cases of TB disease and up to 13 million people were living with latent TB infection (LTBI), which is an asymptomatic, noncommunicable infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Without treatment, LTBI will progress to active TB disease in approximately 5% to 10% of affected people. Individuals with symptoms of TB disease warrant testing. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends testing individuals at increased risk of LTBI with an interferon-gamma release assay or tuberculin skin testing. Because the incidence of LTBI in health care professionals is similar to that of the general population, periodic retesting is not recommended. After a positive test result, chest radiography should be performed and, in patients with suspected pulmonary TB disease, sputum collected for diagnosis. Both suspected and confirmed cases of LTBI and TB disease must be reported to local or state health departments. Preferred treatment regimens for LTBI include isoniazid in combination with rifapentine or rifampin, or rifampin alone for a duration of three and four months, respectively. Treatment of drug-susceptible TB disease includes an eight-week intensive phase with four drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol), followed by a continuation phase lasting 18 weeks or more, with two drugs based on susceptibility testing results. Consultation with a TB expert is necessary if there is suspicion or confirmation of drug-resistant TB.

### Interferon-γ release assays or tuberculin skin test for detection and management of latent tuberculosis infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117X3Z6V]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Background

Use of an interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release assay or tuberculin skin test for detection and management of latent tuberculosis infection is controversial. For both types of test, we assessed their predictive value for the progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease, the targeting value of preventive treatment, and the necessity of dual testing.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, with no start date or language restrictions, on Oct 18, 2019, using the keywords ("latent tuberculosis" OR "latent tuberculosis infection" OR "LTBI") AND ("interferon gamma release assays" OR "Interferon-gamma Release Test" OR "IGRA" OR "QuantiFERON®-TB in tube" OR "QFT" OR "T-SPOT.TB") AND ("tuberculin skin test" OR "tuberculin test" OR "Mantoux test" OR "TST"). We included articles that used a cohort study design; included information that individuals with latent tuberculosis infection detected by IFN-γ release assay, tuberculin skin test, or both, progressed to active tuberculosis; reported information about treatment; and were limited to high-risk populations. We excluded studies that included patients with active or suspected tuberculosis at baseline, evaluated a non-commercial IFN-γ release assay, and had follow-up of less than 1 year. We extracted study details (study design, population investigated, tests used, follow-up period) and the number of individuals observed at baseline, who progressed to active tuberculosis, and who were treated. We then calculated the pooled risk ratio (RR) for disease progression, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of IFN-γ release assay versus tuberculin skin test.

Findings

We identified 1823 potentially eligible studies after exclusion of duplicates, of which 256 were eligible for full-text screening. From this screening, 40 studies (50592 individuals in 41 cohorts) were identified as eligible and included in our meta-analysis. Pooled RR for the rate of disease progression in untreated individuals who were positive by IFN-γ release assay versus those were negative was 9.35 (95% CI 6.48–13.49) compared with 4.24 (3.30–5.46) for tuberculin skin test. Pooled PPV for IFN-γ release assay was 4.5% (95% CI 3.3–5.8) compared with 2.3% (1.5–3.1) for tuberculin skin test. Pooled NPV for IFN-γ release assay was 99.7% (99.5–99.8) compared with 99.3% (99.0–99.5) for tuberculin skin test. Pooled RR for rates of disease progression in individuals positive by IFN-γ release assay who were untreated versus those who were treated was 3.09 (95% CI 2.08–4.60) compared with 1.11 (0.69–1.79) for the same populations who were positive by tuberculin skin test. Pooled proportion of disease progression for individuals who were positive by IFN-γ release assay and tuberculin skin test was 6.1 (95% CI 2.3–11.5). Pooled RR for rates of disease progression in individuals who were positive by IFN-γ release assay and tuberculin skin test who were untreated versus those who were treated was 7.84 (95% CI 4.44–13.83).

Interpretation

IFN-γ release assays have a better predictive ability than tuberculin skin tests. Individuals who are positive by IFN-γ release assay might benefit from preventive treatment, but those who are positive by tuberculin skin test probably will not. Dual testing might improve detection, but further confirmation is needed.

### Within-subject variability and boosting of T-cell interferon-gamma responses after tuberculin skin testing [^1157Hh9b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Rationale

The optimal strategy for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection is controversial. Adoption of a two-step strategy (tuberculin skin test [TST] followed by an IFN-gamma release assay [IGRA], compared with an IGRA alone), may be limited by TST-mediated boosting of subsequent IGRA responses. Assessment of within-subject IGRA variability will aid in establishing thresholds for conversions and reversions, and interpretation of serial testing results.

Objectives

To determine short-term IGRA variability and the impact of TST on subsequent IGRA results.

Methods

Within-subject variability and TST-mediated boosting of IGRA responses were evaluated in 26 South African participants with varying exposure risk. IGRAs (T-SPOT.TB, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube [QuantiFERON-TB-GIT], PPD, and heparin-binding hemagglutinin) were repeated four times over 21 days pre-TST, and on Days 3, 7, 28, and 84 post-TST administration.

Measurements and Main Results

All participants showed within-subject IGRA variability. Changes of ± 3 spots (T-SPOT.TB) or ± 80% from the mean IFN-gamma response (QuantiFERON-TB-GIT) over 3 weeks explained 95% of the variability. Spontaneous conversions/reversions occurred in 7 of 26 subjects (27%) (6 for T-SPOT.TB and 1 for QuantiFERON-TB-GIT [P = 0.049]) during the within-patient variability studies (pre-TST). After the TST eight subjects (33%) boosted above the defined baseline variability. By Day 7 post-TST, but not Day 3, 2 (12.5%) initially IGRA-negative test subjects converted. By contrast, boosting of PPD and heparin-binding hemagglutinin occurred by Day 3 post-TST.

Conclusions

When using a two-step screening strategy it appears safe to perform a QuantiFERON-TB-GIT or T-SPOT.TB IGRA within 3 days of performing the TST. A 3-spot or 80% IFN-gamma response variation, on either side of baseline values, explains 95% of the short-term variability and may be useful for interpreting conversions and reversions, and values close to the cut-point.

### New approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^116hhuQV]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of latent M. tuberculosis infection

Despite the fact that control and management of TB in many low TB incidence countries is centered around the identification and subsequent treatment of individuals latently infected with M. tuberculosis (LTBI), actual identification of LTBI in human subjects is presently not feasible. The current diagnostic tests (such as the tuberculin skin test or more recently developed T cell-based assays) are only designed to measure the adaptive immune response of the host exposed to M. tuberculosis, typically six to eight weeks after exposure to the bacilli.

The tuberculin skin test (TST) measures cell-mediated immunity in the form of a DTH response to a complex cocktail of > 200 M. tuberculosis antigens, known as purified protein derivative (PPD) and the test result is usually read as induration (in mm) recorded 48 to 72 hours after intradermal injection of PPD. The criteria for a positive TST vary considerably and depend on the inoculum and type of PPD preparation used in the test. In the United States, 5 tuberculin units (TUs) are generally used and the induration of ≥ 5 mm in HIV-seropositive or organ transplant recipient or in a person in contact with a known case of active TB is considered as positive. However, in foreign-born persons originating from high TB incidence countries or persons at higher risk of exposure to M. tuberculosis (such as health care professionals), induration of ≥ 10 mm is regarded as positive TST. In most European countries, 2 TUs are used and the induration of ≥ 10 mm in immunocompetent adults is considered as positive. In the United Kingdom, 10 TUs are used and the induration of 5–15 mm in BCG unvaccinated and ≥ 15 mm in BCG vaccinated immunocompetent adults is considered as positive. Skin test reaction over 20 mm is usually due to active disease; however, a negative skin test in an active TB patient may also result from anergy or incorrect administration of the test or improper storage of the test reagents, thus compromising the sensitivity of the test. Skin testing is most suitable for detecting M. tuberculosis infection in developing countries where > 80% of the global TB cases occur, as it does not require extensive laboratory facilities and health care workers are already familiar with administering and reading skin tests. However, TST has several inherent problems as the antigens present in PPD are also present in the vaccine strain M. bovis BCG and several environmental mycobacteria. Hence, TST has lower specificity as the test can not differentiate between infection with M. tuberculosis, prior vaccination with M. bovis BCG or sensitization with environmental mycobacteria. Furthermore, sensitivity of TST is limited in immunocompromised individuals due to anergy. These factors have compromised the sensitivity and specificity of tuberculin skin test for the diagnosis of LTBI.

ATS/IDSA/CDC tuberculosis diagnosis — rationale and strength language: Accuracy studies indicate that IGRAs are more specific and equally or more sensitive than TST in individuals who have received the BCG vaccination; therefore, false-positive results are less likely with IGRAs than with TST, and false-positive results may lead to unnecessary treatment and its accompanying risks (i.e., hepatotoxicity). To minimize these risks, the guideline development panel chose to recommend IGRA testing for individuals who received the BCG vaccination, and the recommendation to perform IGRA testing rather than TST testing is strong for those who have received the BCG vaccination or who are not likely to return for TST read; in contrast, the suggestion to perform IGRA testing rather than TST testing on all other patients who are likely to be infected with Mtb and have a low or moderate risk of progressing to TB disease is conditional, and while the committee concluded that IGRA testing is preferable in most patients, it recognized that TST testing may be more appropriate in a sizeable minority due to availability, feasibility, cost, or burden.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) diagnostic testing — IGRA vs TST and age thresholds: Guidelines recommend that persons at low risk for Mtb infection and disease progression NOT be tested for Mtb infection. We concur with this recommendation. If diagnostic testing is nevertheless performed in such individuals, We suggest performing an IGRA instead of a TST in individuals 5 years or older (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest a second diagnostic test if the initial test is positive in individuals 5 years or older (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). When such testing is performed, the person is considered infected only if both tests are positive. We suggest performing a TST rather than an IGRA in healthy children < 5 years of age for whom it has been decided that diagnostic testing for LTBI is warranted (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). In situations in which an IGRA is deemed the preferred diagnostic test, some experts are willing to use IGRAs in children over 3 years of age. While both IGRA and TST testing provide evidence for infection with Mtb, they cannot distinguish active from latent TB. Therefore, the diagnosis of active TB must be excluded prior to starting on treatment for LTBI. This is typically done by determining whether or not symptoms suggestive of TB disease are present, performing a chest radiograph and, if radiographic signs of active TB are seen, then sampling is performed and the patient managed accordingly.

### Comparison of tuberculin skin testing and interferon-γ release assays in predicting tuberculosis disease [^113Qpbt3]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this diagnostic study assessing the predictive value of 3 tests, IGRAs demonstrated superior performance to TSTs for predicting incident TB. The uncertain ability of FDA-approved tests to predict development of TB disease is one factor that has held back adoption of recommended routine testing of individuals at risk of TB. Specifically, it has been unclear whether IGRAs outperform the TST and whether it is time to retire the TST, which is more than 100 years old. The findings of this large prospective study support the use of IGRAs over the TST for TB disease prediction, even when TST results exist, and support the benefits of a single testing strategy using an IGRA test. While this study provided evidence to guide testing strategies given currently available tests, it also underscored the need for new predictive tests to be developed for clinical use. Advancing TB elimination requires tests that can more accurately tell us who will develop TB disease and who will not.

### Screening for tuberculosis infection prior to initiation of anti-TNF therapy [^112AckiA]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

2 Current clinical practice

In the absence of a gold standard test for diagnosis of LTBI, current clinical management of patients with IMID requiring anti-TNF therapy involves checking for a history of untreated or partially treated TB, risk-stratification for exposure to cases of active TB, evidence of residual changes indicative of prior TB infection on a chest radiograph and a tuberculin skin test (TST).

The TST is a measure of the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to intradermal inoculation of purified protein derivative (PPD), a crude mixture of more than 200 M. tuberculosis proteins. Because antigens within PPD are also found in other mycobacteria, the TST suffers from poor specificity in bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG)-vaccinated persons. Moreover, the sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test used to diagnose LTBI is compromised in patients on immunosuppressive therapy with a high rate of false-negative TST test results. For example, in a Peruvian study, the size of the TST response was significantly lower and the proportion negative (i.e. < 5 mm) to TST was significantly higher in patients with RA compared to healthy immunocompetent controls (median size PPD induration 4.5 vs 11.5 mm P < 0.01; 79/112 (70.6%) vs 25/96 (26%) P < 0.01, respectively). Logistical hurdles, including the need for a return visit to read the result of this in vivo test and operator variability in inoculation and reading of the result, also limit the effective use of TST.

Thus because almost all patients awaiting initiation of anti-TNF therapy are on immunosuppressive therapy, the TST is not an appropriate test to screen for LTBI in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. This concern around the interpretation of the TST in patients on disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is reflected in British Thoracic Society guidelines from 2005 that recommended replacing TST with an individual risk–benefit calculation in patients with a normal chest radiograph balancing the population risk of LTBI in different groups based on age and ethnicity with the risk of serious hepatotoxicity secondary to isoniazid therapy.

Two-step skin testing has not been assessed in children or in the presence of HIV and its routine use is not recommended (expert opinion). Patients with positive TST or IGRA results should undergo chest radiography and clinical evaluation to exclude TB disease.

### Extent and effects of recurrent shortages of purified-protein derivative tuberculin skin test antigen solutions-United States, 2013 [^111CkVmQ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Two kinds of immunologic tests are used for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection: TSTs * and interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) blood tests. The indications for using these tests are the same, although one or the other test is preferred for certain populations (e.g. TST is preferred for children aged < 5 years). These preferences could play a role in setting priorities when one of the methods is unavailable. Together, these tests are the only means for detecting latent M. tuberculosis infection, and they contribute to diagnosing active TB disease. When findings such as chest radiography and mycobacterial cultures are sufficient for confirming or excluding the diagnosis of TB disease, the results from TST or IGRA might be unnecessary. However, most TB cases in the United States are diagnosed with an array of diagnostic findings, including results from TST or IGRA. When TB disease is strongly suspected, specific treatment should be started, regardless of results from these tests.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing — two-step strategy considerations are described: Performing a second diagnostic test when the initial test is negative is a strategy to increase sensitivity. This may reduce specificity, but the panel decided that this is an acceptable trade-off in situations in which the consequences of missing LTBI (ie, not treating individuals who may benefit from therapy) exceed the consequences of inappropriate therapy (ie, hepatotoxicity). Performing a confirmatory test following an initial positive result is based upon both the evidence that false-positive results are common among individuals who are unlikely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the committee's presumption that performing a second test on those patients whose initial test was positive will help identify initial false-positive results.

### Safety and efficacy of the C-Tb skin test to diagnose Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, compared with an interferon γ release assay and the tuberculin skin test: a phase 3, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^113D6vzm]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Targeted screening and treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection substantially reduces the risk of developing active tuberculosis. C-Tb (Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark) is a novel specific skin test based on ESAT-6 and CFP10 antigens. We investigated the safety and diagnostic potential of C-Tb compared with established tests in the contact-tracing setting.

Methods

Negative controls, close contacts, occasional contacts, and patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis were enrolled at 13 centres in Spain. We compared C-Tb with the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube ([QFT] Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) interferon γ release assay (IGRA) and the purified protein derivative (PPD) RT 23 tuberculin skin test ([TST] Statens Serum Institute). All participants older than 5 years were tested with QFT. Some participants in the negative control group received C-Tb without the TST to test for potential interactions between C-Tb and PPD RT 23. The rest were randomly assigned in blocks of ten and tested with both C-Tb and TST, with five in each block receiving injection of C-Tb in the right arm and the TST in the left arm and five vice versa. The primary and safety analyses were done in all participants randomly assigned to a group who received any test. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01631266, and with EudraCT, number 2011–005617–36.

Findings

From July 24, 2012, to Oct 2, 2014, 979 participants were enrolled, of whom 263 were negative controls, 299 were occasional contacts, 316 were close contacts, and 101 were patients with tuberculosis. 970 (99%) participants completed the trial. Induration sizes were similar for C-Tb and TST, but TST positivity was affected by BCG vaccination status. We found a strong positive trend towards C-Tb test positivity with increasing risk of infection, from 3% in negative controls to 16% in occasional contacts, to 43% in close contacts. C-Tb and QFT results were concordant in 785 (94%) of 834 participants aged 5 years and older, and results did not differ significantly between exposure groups. The safety profile of C-Tb was similar to that for the TST.

Interpretation

C-Tb delivered IGRA-like results in a field-friendly format. Being unaffected by BCG vaccination status, the C-Tb skin test might provide more accurate treatment guidance in settings where the TST is commonly used.

### Interferon-γ release assays versus tuberculin skin test for targeting people for tuberculosis preventive treatment: an evidence-based review [^114hyVaF]. The Journal of Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess whether Interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) reduce the number of people considered for tuberculosis (TB) preventive treatment without increasing subsequent active disease.

Methods

Longitudinal studies with both tuberculin skin test (TST) and IGRAs were identified through a PubMed search. Reductions in diagnosis of TB infection and increases in incident TB in people considered not infected, using IGRAs either instead of TST or as a confirmatory test (two-step approach), were assessed.

Results

In comparison with TST alone, the pooled reductions in diagnosis of TB infection obtained with IGRAs were 16.7% and 5.8% at 5 and 10 mm cut-offs respectively, and 24.5% and 12.4% at 5 and 10 mm respectively with the two-step approach. Compared with TST alone, incident TB among people considered not infected increased with the two-step approach (0.94% with T-SPOT(®).TB and 1.1% with QuantiFERON(®)-TB Gold In-Tube) in one of seven studies in high-income countries. In middle- and low-income countries, two of four studies presented increases (0.08 and 0.03 per 100 patient-years respectively) with the two-step approach.

Conclusions

In high-income countries, the use of IGRAs, either instead of TST or as confirmatory test reduces the number of people considered for preventive treatment, without a significant risk of subsequent active disease.

### Which new diagnostics for tuberculosis, and when? [^116D4qaZ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Recently, new diagnostic tools for tuberculosis detection and resistance testing have become available. The World Health Organization endorses new tuberculosis diagnostics by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process. This endorsement process takes place when limited evidence beyond test accuracy is available. There is a need to provide guidance to tuberculosis programs about which new diagnostics to scale up and how best to position them in diagnostic algorithms. To speed adoption of new diagnostics for tuberculosis, the policy recommendation process should be revised to consist of 2 steps: technical recommendation and programmatic recommendation. Technical recommendation would follow the GRADE process and be based on accuracy with limited cost and feasibility data, while programmatic recommendation would include patient-important outcomes, cost-effectiveness when implemented under routine conditions, and factors critical to successful scale-up. The evidence for both steps should be systematically collected, but each requires different study designs.

### Clinical testing guidance for tuberculosis: tuberculin skin… [^113EzSF4]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Background About the TB skin test The TB skin test is a test used to determine if a person is infected with TB bacteria. In this test, a standardized solution made with purified protein derivative, which is derived from tuberculin, is injected under the skin. Typically, PPD produces a T-cell mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction if the person has been infected with TB bacteria. In most people who have TB infection, the immune system will recognize the PPD because it is derived from proteins that are excreted by. M. tuberculosis growing in specialized media under standardized conditions. PPD is diluted to standard concentration and potency in FDA-approved testing solutions. It takes 2 to 8 weeks after initial infection with TB bacteria for the immune system to be able to react to PPD and for the infection to be detected by the TB skin test. For Everyone: Testing for Tuberculosis: Skin Test.

Advantages and disadvantages of the TB skin test Advantages
- Simple to perform
- Low cost
- No need for phlebotomy
- Well-established definitions of TB skin test conversions
- Legacy of decades of clinical and epidemiological research. Determining an approach CDC has resources to help health care providers talk to patients about TB testing and treatment. CDC guidelines recommend using TB blood tests to test for TB infection in most cases. However, TB skin tests are an acceptable alternative in situations where a TB blood test is not available, is too costly, or is too burdensome. Most people can receive a TB skin test. TB skin tests are contraindicated only for people who have had a severe reaction. TB skin tests are not contraindicated for any other persons, including infants, children, pregnant women, or people with HIV.

Boosted reactions and two-step testing A boosted reaction can occur in previously infected, older adults whose sensitivity to tuberculin has decreased over time. It also can occur in persons of any age who have been vaccinated with BCG or infected with mycobacteria besides M. tuberculosis complex. When given a TB skin test years after infection, these persons may have little or no reaction, giving a negative skin test result. However, the TB skin test may stimulate the immune system, causing a boosted reaction with a positive result after subsequent tests. The TB blood test does not boost subsequent test results. Two-step testing is a strategy used to reduce the likelihood that a boosted reaction will be misinterpreted as a recent infection if the person has to be tested again. Two-step testing should be used for the initial skin testing of persons who will be retested periodically. If the TB skin test is used for baseline testing of U. S.

health care personnel, use two-step testing. Two-step testing
- If the first TB skin test result is negative, a second TB skin test should be done 1 to 3 weeks later.
- If the second TB skin test result is positive, it is probably a boosted reaction.
- Based on this second test result, the person should be classified as previously infected. This would not be considered a skin test conversion or a new TB infection.
- However, the patient is a candidate for treatment for latent TB infection.
- Based on this second test result, the person should be classified as previously infected. This would not be considered a skin test conversion or a new TB infection.
- If the second skin test result is negative, the baseline result is negative, and the person would be classified as uninfected. Administering the TB skin test The TB skin test is performed by injecting 0. 1 mL of tuberculin purified protein derivative into the inner surface of the forearm.

Key messages

What is already known on this subject?
Antitumour necrosis factors (anti-TNFs) are associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections, including active tuberculosis (TB).
What might this study add?
Using a strict purified protein derivative (PPD) cut-off of ≥ 5 mm induration, as well as a TB questionnaire, may reduce the incidence of TB in patients receiving anti-TNF therapy.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
Antibiotic treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI) at screening, or in patients already on anti-TNF therapy if a history of PPD ≥ 5 mm is documented, decreases the incidence of TB in patients receiving anti-TNF therapy.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

TUBERSOL Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative (Mantoux), is indicated to aid diagnosis of tuberculosis infection (TB) in persons at increased risk of developing active disease.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have published guidelines regarding populations that would benefit from tuberculin skin testing (TST). Current recommendations can be accessed at: http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/testing.htm.

Previous BCG vaccination is not a contraindication to tuberculin testing. The skin-test results of BCG vaccinated persons can be used to support or exclude the diagnosis of TB infection. However, an FDA-approved interferon gamma release assay is preferred over tuberculin skin test for persons 5 years of age and older who were previously vaccinated with BCG. (8)

In vivo diagnostic tests of cell-mediated immunity — tuberculin skin testing with purified protein derivative (PPD) — is identified as the prototype antigen recall test that provides direct evidence of hypersensitivity to antigens in Mycobacterium hominis or related mycobacterial species (B). The test is performed by intracutaneous injection of 0.1 mL of standardized PPD, starting with the intermediate strength of 5 tuberculin units (C), and the reaction reaches maximum size in 48 h. Historically, a tuberculin skin test of more than 10 mm in diameter identifies 90% of healthy sensitized persons, but in a study of 2,848 healthy non–BCG-vaccinated persons this cutoff was valid only when infection prevalence was at least 10%; in lower-prevalence populations a cutoff value of more than 15-mm diameter is proposed. The test is also used to evaluate successful skin conversion after BCG vaccination.

Booster Effect and Two-Step Testing

Infection of an individual with tubercle bacilli or other mycobacteria or BCG vaccination results in a delayed hypersensitivity response to tuberculin which is demonstrated by the skin test. The delayed hypersensitivity response may gradually wane over a period of years. If a person receives a tuberculin test at this time, a significant reaction may not be detected. However, the stimulus of the test may boost or increase the size of the reaction to a second test, sometimes causing an apparent conversion or development of sensitivity. This booster effect can be seen on a second test done one week after the initial stimulating test and can persist for a year, and perhaps longer. When routine periodic tuberculin testing of adults is done, initially two-stage testing should be considered to minimize the likelihood of interpreting a boosted reaction as a conversion.7,15,16

In this testing method, persons who have a negative initial skin test undergo a second tuberculin skin test 1–3 weeks after the first. Both tests should be read and recorded at 48 to 72 hours. Those individuals with a positive reaction on the second test should be considered to be previously infected, and those with a negative reaction on the second test should be considered uninfected. In these uninfected persons, a positive result on any future skin test should be interpreted as a skin test conversion.7

### Prognostic value of interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin test in predicting the development of active tuberculosis (UK PREDICT TB): a prospective cohort study [^111i8PWi]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

When the intention is to identify the largest proportion of individuals with a positive test result who might progress to active tuberculosis, such as among household contacts of patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis, TST-5 — as currently recommended in US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines — might be the best approach. By contrast, screening programmes (eg, of migrants) should consider progression rates, the trade-off between the three criteria of selecting the most appropriate testing method outlined earlier, and the cost-effectiveness of the selected testing strategy.

We compared our results with the review that informed the WHO guidelines on managing latent tuberculosis, and summarised all existing pairwise comparisons of an IGRA versus TST. We identified several studies in our literature search and from the WHO review that evaluated TST versus a single IGRA in high incidence countries, and four did head-to-head comparisons in low incidence countries. However, only one of these studies compared TST with each of the commercially available IGRAs, and the other three studies only compared TST with QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube. Although sample sizes ranged from 339 to 1335 participants, all four studies had 15 or fewer individuals who progressed to active tuberculosis. To our knowledge, our study is the largest head-to-head comparison of the three available diagnostic tests for latent tuberculosis infection, both in terms of the number of participants and progressions to active tuberculosis. Our estimates of positive predictive value are towards the low end of those previously reported, and are less than were found in two other small cohort studies. Positive predictive values for the development of active tuberculosis depend in part on the incidence of tuberculosis in the study population — ie, the positive predictive value is higher when the incidence is greater. Our analysis of TST stratified by BCG-vaccination status showed similar IRRs to those for both IGRAs, which is in contrast with the WHO guidelines reviewthat concluded TSTs had a lower IRR than IGRAs for progression to active tuberculosis in low incidence countries. In our study, progression of disease was increased among the recently exposed participants compared with migrants whose infection had probably been acquired in another country.

Alternative test(s)

Two types of immunological tests excluded from this review are the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). Both methods are dependent on the cellular immune response to M tuberculosis antigens in individuals previously exposed to the organism, and neither can distinguish between latent tuberculosis infection and active tuberculosis disease (Pai 2014). Further, neither method is sensitive enough to serve as a rule out test for tuberculosis disease in children, but is mainly used to confirm tuberculosis infection and to support clinical decision making; with full consideration of all the stated caveats. The TST has been in clinical use for over a century and involves intradermal injection of M tuberculosis purified protein derivative. Drawbacks to the TST include the need for a second clinical encounter 48 to 72 hours after placement for result interpretation, inter‐reader variability, a tendency for previous bacillus Calmette‐Guerin vaccination to result in false‐positive results, and a tendency for false‐negative results in immunosuppressed individuals or due to anergy in individuals with active disease (Pai 2014).

Tuberculin skin test (TST) — performance characteristics and two‑step testing report that sensitivity measured in clinically well persons with previously treated tuberculosis is high (95%–98%). False‑negative reactions occur more frequently in infants and young children, early (< 8 weeks) after infection, in persons with clinical conditions associated with immunosuppression or overwhelming illness, after recent viral and bacterial infections, and with treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (eg, high‑dose corticosteroids, TNF inhibitors). Test specificity is decreased among persons with prior BCG vaccination — especially those vaccinated postinfancy or with repeat vaccination — and in areas where nontuberculous mycobacteria are common, increasing false‑positive TST reactions. Because of the boosting phenomenon, initial repeat testing is recommended for persons with a negative TST who will undergo periodic screening and have not been tested recently (eg, 1 year), and this 2‑step testing uses a repeat TST within 1–3 weeks after an initial negative TST to avoid misclassification of boosting as conversion.

Contact investigations and outbreak response in TB control — contact investigations are a critical component of TB control, following only TB case detection and treatment in priority (AIII). State and local health departments should establish a comprehensive contact investigation program (AIII) and TB-control programs should develop a protocol identifying persons responsible for each step and outlining processes to maximize efficiency within available resources (AIII). Programs should have procedures for voluntary HIV counseling and testing of contacts with priorities based on locally derived risk data or on the local epidemiology of TB and HIV infection (BIII). Tuberculin skin testing should prioritize contacts at highest risk for progression based on risk factors such as age < 5 years, HIV infection, and other immunocompromising conditions (AII). DOT for LTBI should be considered for all contacts, with high-risk contacts receiving highest priority for directly observed treatment (AII). Programs should apply existing communicable disease laws to contacts who fail to comply with examination requirements (BII), develop HIPAA-compliant guidelines for release of confidential information (BIII), evaluate the effectiveness and impact of contact investigations and develop interventions to improve performance when indicated (BIII), and develop outbreak response plans including indicators for initiating the plan, notification procedures, response team composition and staffing, follow-up and treatment of contacts, indications for requesting assistance from CDC, and evaluation of the response (BIII).

### Official American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America / centers for disease control and prevention clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children [^115KazTd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection — risk stratification and prognostic test performance are described as follows: Individuals with immunological evidence of exposure to Mtb antigens but without clinical disease are termed latently infected, and those with recent infection (< 2 years) are at increased risk for progression to clinical disease. Those with negative TSTs or IGRAs are unlikely to progress to TB, yet the PPV of either test is relatively modest, with household-contact estimates that 20–200 people require treatment to prevent one case. Evidence for IGRAs in children < 5 years old is still limited, and studies to inform appropriate use for accurately diagnosing LTBI in this age group are needed.

Private medical practitioners — roles and responsibilities in tuberculosis (TB) control — should understand prevalent conditions with public health implications in their patient populations; know applicable state reporting laws; address suspected TB by promptly establishing diagnosis, using consultations and hospitalization if indicated, reporting suspected cases to the jurisdictional public health agency, and partnering with that agency to develop a treatment plan that optimizes completion; incorporate current recommendations for diagnosis, standard treatment of TB, and targeted testing and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI); and be able to place and read tuberculin skin tests, rule out suspected TB disease by clinical examination, history, and chest radiograph, and treat and monitor treatment for LTBI.

### Nationwide shortage of tuberculin skin test antigens: CDC recommendations for patient care and public health practice [^111kyJMz]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

CDC recommends the following three general approaches to mitigate a reduction in TB testing capability resulting from the expected shortage of Aplisol:

- Substitute IGRA blood tests for TSTs. Clinicians who use the IGRA blood tests should be aware that the criteria for test interpretation are different from the criteria for interpreting TSTs.

- Substitute Tubersol for Aplisol for skin testing. In studies, the two skin test products give similar results for most patients.

- Prioritize allocation of TSTs, in consultation with state and local public health authorities. Prioritization might require the deferment of testing some persons. CDC recommends testing only for persons who are at risk for TB. Groups at high risk for TB infection include 1) persons who are recent contacts exposed to persons with TB disease; 2) those born in or who frequently travel to countries where TB disease is common; 3) those who currently or previously lived in large group settings (such as homeless shelters or correctional facilities); 4) persons with compromised immune systems, including those with health conditions or taking medications that might alter immunity; and 5) children, especially those aged < 5 years, if they are in one of the risk groups noted above.

Although overall test concordance is high, switching between PPD skin test products or TSTs and blood tests in serial testing might result in apparent conversions from negative to positive or reversions from positive to negative that might be attributable to inherent interproduct or intermethod discordance rather than change in M. tuberculosis infection status. Clinicians should assess test results based on the person's likelihood of infection and risk for progression to TB disease, if infected.

In settings with a low likelihood of TB exposure, the deferment of routine serial testing should be considered in consultation with public health and occupational health authorities. Annual TB testing of health care personnel is not recommended unless there is a known exposure or ongoing transmission.

Tuberculosis control — institutional settings and program actions: Persons with an indication for treatment of LTBI should be encouraged to initiate and complete treatment (AII). Residents admitted to long-term care facilities should be tested for M. tuberculosis infection on admission (with a two-step test if tuberculin skin testing) and should receive a history and physical examination to detect symptoms and signs of TB; residents with M. tuberculosis infection should be offered treatment if indicated, with careful monitoring for drug toxicity (BII). Jails and prisons should develop and implement effective infection-control programs, including risk assessment, staff training, screening for TB among incoming detainees and prisoners, isolation of inmates with infectious forms of TB, treatment and discharge planning, and prompt and thorough contact investigations (AII), and in jails and prisons, HIV-infected inmates should not be housed together in a separate housing unit unless institutional control programs following current guidelines have been established and proved to be effective in preventing the transmission of M. tuberculosis (AII). Organizations that provide shelter and other types of emergency housing for homeless persons should develop institutional TB-control plans, and guidelines to facilitate this process are available from the Francis J. Curry National TB Center (AII). TB-control programs should remain aware of the possibility of TB disease as a cause of current transmission during epidemiologic surveillance and contact investigation, and ongoing education and training should be maintained and available to any program that is investigating possible transmission of M. tuberculosis (AII).

### Screening of immigrants in the UK for imported latent tuberculosis: a multicentre cohort study and cost-effectiveness analysis [^114FQ5wp]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

The rationale supporting this screening approach remains unclear, especially because data are scarce for the prevalence of latent infection in new immigrants as measured by interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs). Furthermore, although NICE's recommendation for the two-step method of screening (ie, tuberculin skin-test plus confirmatory IGRA) has been adopted in most European countries, the USA, and many centres in the UK increasingly use one-step IGRA testing to screen for latent infection, probably because of this test's high specificity. Additional reasons for the use of the one-step test include evidence that IGRAs might be able to predict the development of active tuberculosis from latent infection, and uncertainty about the optimum cutoff for a positive skin test in the context of previous BCG vaccination. We did this multicentre cohort study to compute yields from, and cost-effectiveness of, screening for latent infection at different thresholds in relation to incidence of tuberculosis in immigrants' countries of origin.

### Tuberculin purified protein derivative (Aplisol) [^115R4Mpi]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Tuberculin PPD is indicated as an aid in the detection of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The standard tuberculin test employs the intradermal (Mantoux) test using a 5 TU dose of tuberculin PPD.7The 0.1 mL test dose of Aplisol (tuberculin PPD, diluted) is equivalent to the 5 TU dose which has been clinically utilized and standardized with PPD-S. Tuberculin skin testing is not contraindicated for persons who have been vaccinated with BCG and the skin-test results of such persons are used to support or exclude the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infections.4HIV infection is a strong risk factor for the development of TB disease in persons having TB infection. All HIV-infected persons should receive a PPD-tuberculin skin test.3

Tuberculin skin test (purified protein derivative [PPD]) interpretation — population-prevalence–dependent cutoffs and reading window: Widespread use of the intermediate strength of PPD (5) tuberculin units has demonstrated that reactors can be separated from nonreactors by diameters of 10 mm or greater of induration if the prevalence of active infection in the tested population at large is 10% or more, whereas the cutoff value is 15 mm or more when there is a lower prevalence of latent tuberculosis in the general population; tuberculin skin test readings up to 168 hours after application may still be reliable.

### National shortage of purified-protein derivative tuberculin products [^1144EUSe]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

In controlled studies, the agreement between TST results from Tubersol and Aplisol is high. The agreement between results from a TST and an IGRA blood test or between results from the two commercial IGRA blood tests is lower.

CDC recommends any of the following three general approaches for addressing the shortages of TST antigens:

Substitute IGRA blood tests for TSTs. Although the costs associated with the blood tests themselves can be greater than the cost of TSTs, the use of the blood tests might be more cost-effective in certain settings because their improved specificity in persons who have had previous Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunization or exposure to nontuberculous mycobacteria might allow for better targeting of preventive therapy. The blood tests require phlebotomy, preparation of blood specimens, and specific laboratory services for analysis; these tests are not available in all practice settings. Clinicians who use the IGRA blood tests should be aware that the criteria for test interpretation are different from criteria for interpreting TSTs.
Allocate TSTs to priority indications, such as TB contact investigations, as determined by public health authorities. This might require deferment of testing some persons. CDC does not recommend testing persons who are not at risk for TB.
Substitute Aplisol for Tubersol for skin testing. In cross-sectional studies, the two products give similar results for most patients. Shortages of Aplisol are expected to become more widespread, limiting the feasibility of this approach.

Some surveillance programs for TB infection control rely on routine serial TSTs. Switching products or methods might make changes in serial results difficult to interpret: the apparent conversions of results from negative to positive or reversions from positive to negative could be caused by inherent interproduct or intermethod discordance. In settings with a low likelihood of TB exposure, the deferment of routine serial testing should be considered in consultation with public health and occupational health authorities.

### Evaluation of results from occupational tuberculin skin tests – Mississippi, 2006 [^115AVm8g]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2007). Low credibility.

In October 2006, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) received a request for a health hazard evaluation from a fire department in Mississippi. In June 2006, the fire department had administered two-step tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) and determined that nine firefighters tested positive for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Local investigation had identified no source of TB infection. The NIOSH evaluation was conducted to 1) determine whether TB transmission was occurring among department firefighters, 2) assess the accuracy of positive TST results, and 3) make recommendations regarding administration of future fire department TB-testing programs. This report describes the results of that evaluation, which indicated that all nine firefighters had false-positive TST findings, likely caused by errors in interpretation of the test results. These results highlight the importance of conducting TB testing only when indicated by TB risk assessment and following CDC guidelines to avoid errors in TST administration and interpretation that might result in unnecessary medical evaluation and follow-up.

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113FJ4gW]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To determine the annual rate of tuberculosis development after a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay result (IGRA), or both, among untreated populations with characteristics believed to increase the risk of tuberculosis (at risk populations).

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials from 1 January 1990 to 17 May 2019, for studies in humans published in English or French. Reference lists were reviewed.

Eligibility criteria and data analysis

Retrospective or prospective cohorts and randomised trials that included at least 10 untreated participants who tested positive to tuberculosis antigens (contained in TST or IGRA, or both) followed for at least 12 months. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) and meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines, two reviewers independently extracted study data and assessed quality using a modified quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Data were pooled using random effects generalised linear mixed models.

Main outcome measures

The primary outcome was tuberculosis incidence per 1000 person years among untreated participants who tested positive (TST or IGRA, or both) in different at risk subgroups. Secondary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of tuberculosis and incidence rate ratios among participants with a positive test result for latent tuberculosis infection compared with those with a negative test result in at risk subgroups.

Results

122 of 5166 identified studies were included. In three general population studies, the incidence of tuberculosis among 33 811 participants with a TST induration of ≥ 10 mm was 0.3 (95% confidence interval 0.1 to 1.1) per 1000 person years. Among 116 197 positive test results for latent tuberculosis infection in 19 different at risk populations, incidence rates were consistently higher than those in the general population. Among all types of tuberculosis contacts, the incidence of tuberculosis was 17.0 (95% confidence interval 12.9 to 22.4) per 1000 person years for participants with a positive IGRA result and 8.4 (5.6 to 12.6) per 1000 person years for participants with a positive TST result of ≥ 5 mm. Among people living with HIV, the incidence of tuberculosis was 16.9 (10.5 to 27.3) for participants with a positive IGRA result and 27.1 (15.0 to 49.0) for participants with a positive TST result of ≥ 5 mm. Rates were also high for immigrants, people with silicosis or requiring dialysis, transplant recipients, and prisoners. Incidence rate ratios among test positive versus test negative participants were significantly greater than 1.0 in almost all risk groups, for all tests.

Conclusions

The incidence of tuberculosis is substantial in numerous at risk populations after a positive TST or IGRA result. The information from this review should help inform clinical decisions to test and treat for latent tuberculosis infection.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing — cautions and limitations: While both IGRA and TST provide evidence for infection with Mtb, they cannot distinguish active from latent tuberculosis and the diagnosis of active TB must be excluded prior to treatment for LTBI; a large (> 15 mm) TST reaction is more likely to reflect infection, measurement variability exists for IFN-γ tests (the FDA accepts a variance of 11%), there are insufficient data for quantitative interpretation of IGRAs beyond FDA cut-points, results near the cut-point are less reliable, and the results of IFN-γ testing should be reported quantitatively; discordance between TST and IGRA is common and in low-risk populations discordant tests are likely to be false positives.

Screening for coinfections — tuberculosis recommendations — Upon initiation of care, persons with HIV without a history of tuberculosis or a prior positive tuberculosis screening test should be screened for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection using either a tuberculin skin test (TST) or an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). Those with positive test results should be treated for latent M. tuberculosis infection after active tuberculosis has been excluded. Persons with HIV who have close contact with persons with infectious tuberculosis should be treated for latent M. tuberculosis infection regardless of their TST or IGRA results, age, or prior courses of tuberculosis treatment; active tuberculosis should be excluded first.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in persons with HIV — testing, retesting thresholds, and test characteristics: All persons with HIV should be tested for LTBI at the time of HIV diagnosis, regardless of their epidemiological risk of TB exposure (AII). The two current methods available for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in the United States, interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) and tuberculin skin test (TST), help differentiate infected from uninfected people; however, diagnostic accuracy of TST and IGRA are limited, a negative test does not exclude the diagnosis of LTBI or TB disease, a positive test does not in itself mean LTBI therapy is warranted, and decisions should not be based on IGRA or TST results alone. Persons with negative diagnostic tests for LTBI, advanced HIV infection (CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3) and without clinical indications for empiric LTBI treatment should be re-tested for LTBI once they start ART and attain a CD4 count ≥ 200 cells/mm3 to ensure the initial test was a true negative; annual testing for LTBI using TST is recommended for persons with HIV at high risk for repeated or ongoing exposure (AIII). Traditionally, LTBI has been defined by a positive TST (≥ 5 mm of induration at 48 to 72 hours in persons with HIV) in persons with no clinical or radiographic evidence of TB disease. Current evidence suggests that IGRAs have higher specificity than the TST (92% to 97% vs. 56% to 95%, respectively), two IGRAs are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and available in the United States, and progressive immunodeficiency is associated with decreased sensitivity of IGRAs; reproducibility of positive IGRA results has been limited among health care workers and might also affect those with HIV. Evidence from South and West Africa reports IPT benefit regardless of test status, with IPT decreasing risk among all persons with HIV regardless of TST or IGRA status and improved survival with IPT regardless of TST or IGRA status.

Patients who test positive should undergo chest radiography and clinical evaluation to exclude TB disease.

### Isoniazid [^1118FPLx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Isoniazid tablets, USP are recommended for all forms of tuberculosis in which organisms are susceptible. However, active tuberculosis must be treated with multiple concomitant anti-tuberculosis medications to prevent the emergence of drug resistance. Single-drug treatment of active tuberculosis with isoniazid or any other medication, is inadequate therapy.

Isoniazid tablets, USP are recommended as preventive therapy for the following groups, regardless of age. (Note: the criterion for a positive reaction to a skin test (in millimeters of induration) for each group is given in parenthesis):

Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (greater than or equal to 5 mm) and persons with risk factors for HIV infection whose HIV infection status is unknown but who are suspected of having HIV infection. Preventive therapy may be considered for HIV infected persons who are tuberculin-negative but belong to groups in which the prevalence of tuberculosis infection is high. Candidates for preventive therapy who have HIV infection should have a minimum of 12 months of therapy.
Close contacts of persons with newly diagnosed infectious tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 5 mm). In addition, tuberculin-negative (less than 5 mm) children and adolescents who have been close contacts of infectious persons within the past 3 months are candidates for preventive therapy until a repeat tuberculin skin test is done 12 weeks after contact with the infectious source. If the repeat skin test is positive (greater than 5mm), therapy should be continued.
Recent converters, as indicated by a tuberculin skin test (greater than or equal to 10 mm increase within a 2-year period for those less than 35 years old; greater than or equal to 15 mm increase for those greater than or equal to 35 years of age). All infants and children younger than 4 years of age with a greater than 10 mm skin test are included in this category.
Persons with abnormal chest radiographs that show fibrotic lesions likely to represent old healed tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 5 mm). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly.
Intravenous drug users known to be HIV-seronegative (greater than 10 mm).
Persons with the following medical conditions that have been reported to increase the risk of tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 10 mm): silicosis; diabetes mellitus; prolonged therapy with adrenocorticosteroids; immunosuppressive therapy; some hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases, such as leukemia or Hodgkin's disease; end-stage renal disease; clinical situations associated with substantial rapid weight loss or chronic undernutrition (including: intestinal bypass surgery for obesity, the postgastrectomy state [with or without weight loss], chronic peptic ulcer disease, chronic malabsorption syndromes and carcinomas of the oropharynx and upper gastrointestinal tract that prevent adequate nutritional intake). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly.

### Prognostic value of interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin test in predicting the development of active tuberculosis (UK PREDICT TB): a prospective cohort study [^113BnaGM]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Our results have implications for guidelines and future cost-effectiveness analyses, particularly in the screening of tuberculosis contacts for latent tuberculosis infection and also recent migrants (ie, in the past 5 years) from high-burden countries. Although negative predictive values were similar for all tests, we have found statistically significant differences for the positive prediction of progression to active tuberculosis between tests, with a positive TST-5 result being a significantly worse predictor than all other tests, and a positive T-SPOT. TB result being a significantly better predictor than all other tests, except for TST-15, and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube was significantly better than TST-10. Although the review of the WHO guidelines, did not examine TST stratified by BCG-vaccination status compared with IGRAs, we show for the first time, to our knowledge, that by use of this stratification method, TST is equivalent to IGRAs. The most recent WHO guidelinesrecommend either a TST or IGRA as equivalent alternatives without taking into account previous BCG vaccination. Our results contradict this recommendation. The screening strategy by which participants are identified for treatment influences the cost-effectiveness of any test-and-treat programme; the more people who are identified as positive and eligible for treatment, the greater the cost. The trade-offs of testing with TST-5 (which identified the most progressors but with potentially the highest number needed to treat) versus IGRAs and TST-15 (which are likely to have the lowest numbers needed to treat) has implications for WHO guidelines depending on the uptake of testing and adherence to management in different settings. In the absence of a highly specific diagnostic test for latent tuberculosis infection at risk of progression, a cheap and non-toxic treatment is needed that can be given to a larger proportion of screened people than is the case with current treatment options.

### Tuberculin purified protein derivative (Tubersol) [^113BfUVp]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

False Negative Reactions

Not all infected persons will have a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to a tuberculin test.

In those who are elderly or those who are being tested for the first time, reactions may develop slowly and may not peak until after 72 hours.

Since tuberculin sensitivity may take up to 8 weeks to develop following exposure to M. tuberculosis (see Mechanism of Action), persons who have a negative tuberculin test < 8 weeks following possible TB exposure should be retested ≥ 8–10 weeks following the last known or suspected exposure. (15)

Altered Immune Status

Impaired or attenuated cell mediated immunity (CMI) can potentially cause a false negative tuberculin reaction. Many factors have been reported to cause a decreased ability to respond to the tuberculin test in the presence of tuberculous infection including viral infections (e.g., measles, mumps, chickenpox and HIV), live virus vaccinations (e.g., measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio and yellow fever), overwhelming tuberculosis, other bacterial infections, leukemia, sarcoidosis, fungal infections, metabolic derangements, low protein states, diseases affecting lymphoid organs, drugs (corticosteroids and many other immunosuppressive agents), and malignancy or stress. (7)(16)(17) A TST should be deferred for patients with major viral infections or live-virus vaccination in the past month. Persons with the common cold may be tuberculin tested.

Because TST results in HIV-infected individuals are less reliable as CD4 counts decline, screening should be completed as early as possible after HIV-infection occurs. (17)

Booster Effect and Two-Step Testing

If tuberculin testing will be conducted at regular intervals, for instance among healthcare workers or prison workers, two-step testing should be performed as a baseline to avoid interpreting a booster effect as a tuberculin conversion. If the first test showed either no reaction or a small reaction, the second test should be performed one to four weeks later. Both tests should be read and recorded at 48 to 72 hours. Patients with a second tuberculin test (booster) response of ≥ 10 mm should be considered to have experienced past TB infection. (13)(18)

Persons who do not boost when given repeat tests at one week, but whose tuberculin reactions change to positive after one year, should be considered to have newly acquired tuberculosis infection and managed accordingly. (6)

### BTS clinical statement for the diagnosis and management of ocular tuberculosis [^1131o99F]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

IGRA/TST: immunological tests for TB infection

Given the paucibacillary nature of most cases of OTB disease, evidence of infection is often based on measurement of immune responses to Mtb rather than direct detection of the bacteria or nucleic acids.

The aim of these tests is to conventionally identify individuals who have had a TB infection. As Mtb infection is a prerequisite for TB disease, a negative TST or IGRA result could potentially rule-out a diagnosis of TB disease (ie, exclude TB from the differential diagnosis). In patients where there is a positive test, the question arises as to whether the eye disease is related to TB (and potentially either direct ocular disease, or a secondary hypersensitivity to TB disease elsewhere) or whether this is merely coincidental LTBI.

The tuberculin skin test

When tuberculin is injected intradermally, it generates a delayed hypersensitivity reaction within the skin of individuals who have previously been exposed to TB. Current clinical practice is to use purified protein derivative extract (PPD — a standardised mixture of over 200 mycobacterial proteins) for the test; this is known as the Mantoux test, where the borders of the reaction to intradermal PPD at 48–72 hours are defined by visual inspection and palpation and then measured.

Definitions of a positive reaction are determined by the dose and type of PPD used. In the UK, a dose is of 2 international units (IU) of RT 23 is used and a positive reaction ('cut-off') is seen when the skin induration is greater than or equal to 5 mm irrespective of BCG status. A recent multicentre prospective UK-based study (PREDICT)has demonstrated that all cutoffs for the TST evaluated still had a poor prognostic performance for progression to active disease from LTBI although a BCG stratified 5 or 15 mm cut-off was superior to the 5 mm cut-off.

Other issues with skin testing include the need for two clinic visits to complete the test, severe localised skin reactions including blistering and oedema can also occur and cause significant discomfort for the individual. Lastly, the test is operator dependent in terms of instillation and reading, and therefore, subject to a degree of potential error.

### QuantiFERON-TB gold in-tube as a confirmatory test for tuberculin skin test in tuberculosis contact tracing: a noninferiority clinical trial [^113yHZ7J]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Screening strategies based on interferon-γ release assays in tuberculosis contact tracing may reduce the need for preventive therapy without increasing subsequent active disease.

Methods

We conducted an open-label, randomized trial to test the noninferiority of a 2-step strategy with the tuberculin skin test (TST) followed by QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) as a confirmatory test (the TST/QFT arm) to the standard TST-alone strategy (TST arm) for targeting preventive therapy in household contacts of patients with tuberculosis. Participants were followed for 24 months after randomization. The primary endpoint was the development of tuberculosis, with a noninferiority margin of 1.5 percentage points.

Results

A total of 871 contacts were randomized. Four contacts in the TST arm and 2 in the TST/QFT arm developed tuberculosis. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, this accounted for 0.99% in the TST arm and 0.51% in the TST/QFT arm (-0.48% difference; 97.5% confidence interval [CI] -1.86% to 0.90%); in the per-protocol analysis, the corresponding rates were 1.67% and 0.82% in the TST and TST/QFT arms, respectively (-0.85% difference; 97.5% CI, -3.14% to 1.43%). Of the 792 contacts analyzed, 65.3% in the TST arm and 42.2% in the TST/QFT arm were diagnosed with tuberculosis infection (23.1% difference; 95% CI, 16.4% to 30.0%).

Conclusions

In low-incidence settings, screening household contacts with the TST and using QFT-GIT as a confirmatory test is not inferior to TST-alone for preventing active tuberculosis, allowing a safe reduction of preventive treatments.

### National shortage of purified-protein derivative tuberculin products [^113ojjSV]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Tubersol, a product of Sanofi Pasteur Limited, is in short supply nationwide until at least the end of May 2013. Tubersol is one of two purified-protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin products licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The manufacturer has notified CDC that 50-dose vials of Tubersol will remain unavailable until the end of May 2013 and that supplies of 10-dose vials are still being reestablished: the product is available only by contacting Sanofi directly (ator telephone, 800–822–2463). JHP Pharmaceuticals, LLC, the manufacturer of Aplisol, the other PPD tuberculin product licensed by FDA, has notified FDA that the product is available in restricted quantity. Acute local shortages of Aplisol also have been reported to CDC by TB control officials, as health-care providers switch from Tubersol to Aplisol. The shortages of Aplisol probably will diminish as Tubersol supplies are restored to their preshortage availability in the normal distribution networks. This report advises public health officials, clinicians, and workers in occupational health and infection control about how to adapt to the shortage.

Two kinds of immunologic methods are used for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection: tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) and interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) blood tests. The indications for use of these tests are the same, although one or the other method is preferred for certain populations, and this could play a role in setting priorities when one of the methods is unavailable. Together, these tests are the only means for detecting latent M. tuberculosis infection, and they contribute to diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) disease. When findings such as chest radiography, nucleic acid amplification test of sputum, and/or mycobacterial cultures are sufficient for confirming or excluding TB, the results from a TST or an IGRA blood test might not be needed. A negative TST or IGRA result does not exclude the possibility of TB infection because some persons can have a compromised ability to react to tests for TB infection. However, most persons diagnosed with TB in the United States have had a positive TST or IGRA blood test that has contributed to that diagnosis. When TB disease is strongly suspected, specific treatment should be started regardless of results of a TST or an IGRA blood test.

### Prevention of tuberculosis in patients treated with biological therapies: twenty years' experience in a specialised tuberculosis clinic in a low-prevalence country [^114Pu4tF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

This study builds on previous evidence to assess the risk of tuberculosis (TB) in patients treated with biologic therapies (BioT), the role of the interferon-γ-release assay (IGRA) QuantiFERON-TB (QFT) Gold as a stand-alone screening test, and whether periodic re-testing is warranted for patients with a negative pre-BioT screening.

Methods

A total of 1,368 patients starting BioT were screened for TB infection using four screening strategies over four consecutive periods: (1) two-step tuberculin skin test (TST); (2) two-step TST plus QFT Gold In-Tube; (3) single-step TST plus QFT Gold In-Tube; and (4) QFT Gold In-Tube (or QFT Gold Plus) alone. All patients with TB infection were offered preventive therapy.

Results

TB infection was diagnosed in 327 (23.9%) patients (40.8%, 39.5%, 25.3%, and 14.8% in the first, second, third and fourth periods, respectively; p = 0.000). The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with respect to the first period were 0.89 (95%CI, 0.55–1.44), 0.49 (95%CI, 0.33–0.73), and 0.23 (95%CI, 0.15–0.36) for the second, third and fourth periods, respectively. During follow-up, 11 patients (0.8%) developed TB. The probability of remaining TB-free after 11 years of BioT exposure was 99.1%, with no significant differences between screening periods (P = 0.372). All TB cases in patients with negative baseline screening occurred within the first year of BioT exposure, which would make systematic re-screening pointless.

Conclusions

Although BioT-associated TB can be significantly reduced, it is not completely preventable. Neither dual testing nor periodic systematic re-screening for TB infection is warranted after a negative pre-BioT test.

### Utilization of the quantiFERON-TB gold test in a two-step process with the tuberculin skin test to evaluate health care workers for latent tuberculosis [^116XZNtV]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

A cost analysis of combining a tuberculin skin test (TST) and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (QFT-GT) to detect latent tuberculosis in newly hired health care workers was performed. An approximately 50% reduction in the cost of additional care was realized when workers with positive TST results were subsequently screened using the QFT-GT.

### Extent and effects of recurrent shortages of purified-protein derivative tuberculin skin test antigen solutions-United States, 2013 [^115KpfqM]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

To address shortages of PPD TST antigen solutions, CDC has recommended any of three general approaches: 1) substitute IGRA blood tests for TSTs; 2) allocate TST supplies to priority indications, as determined by public health authorities; and 3) substitute Aplisol for Tubersol for skin testing, which depends on Aplisol availability.

Some surveillance programs for institutional or occupational TB infection control rely on routine serial TST or IGRA. For these indications, switching products or methods should be undertaken cautiously. Serial changes in test results become difficult to interpret, because the apparent conversions of results from negative to positive or reversions from positive to negative could be caused by inherent interproduct or intermethod variability. In settings with a low likelihood of M. tuberculosis exposure, the deferment of routine serial testing should be considered in consultation with public health and occupational health authorities.

Up-to-date information about shortages of biologic products, including PPD TST antigen solutions, is available from FDA online at.

### Tuberculin purified protein derivative (Tubersol) [^1173i3Zn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Interpretation of the Test

The skin test should be read by a trained health professional 48 to 72 hours after administration of TUBERSOL. Skin test sensitivity is indicated by induration only; redness should not be measured.

Measure the diameter of induration transversely to the long axis of the forearm and record the measurement in millimeters (including 0 mm). (7) The tip of a ballpoint pen, gently pushed at a 45° angle toward the site of injection, will stop at the edge of induration.

Also record presence and size (if present) of necrosis and edema, although these are not used in the interpretation of the test.

Positive Reactions

Tuberculin reactivity may indicate latent infection, prior infection and/or disease with M. tuberculosis and does not necessarily indicate the presence of active tuberculous disease. Persons showing positive tuberculin reactions should be considered positive by current public health guidelines and referred for further medical evaluation. (7)(9) The repeated testing of uninfected persons does not sensitize them to TUBERSOL. (6)(7)(9)

The significance of induration measurements in diagnosing latent TB infection must be considered in terms of the patient's history and the risk of developing active TB disease as indicated in Table 1. (9)

A TST conversion is defined as an increase of ≥ 10 mm of induration within a 2-year period, regardless of age. (9)

The possibility should be considered that the skin test sensitivity may also be due to a previous contact with atypical mycobacteria or previous BCG vaccination. (7)(9)

Negative Reactions

An individual who does not show a positive reaction to 5 TU on the first test, but is suspected of being TB positive, may be retested with 5 TU. (See Booster Effect and Two-Step Testing .) Any individual who does not show a positive reaction to an initial injection of 5 TU, or a second test with 5 TU may be considered as tuberculin negative.

False Positive Reactions

False positive tuberculin reactions can occur in individuals who have been infected with other mycobacteria, including vaccination with BCG. (7) However, a diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection and the use of preventive therapy should be considered for any BCG-vaccinated person who has a positive TST reaction, especially if the person has been, or is, at increased risk of acquiring TB infection. (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE .) (13)(14)

### Guidelines on interferon-γ release assays for tuberculosis infection: concordance, discordance or confusion? [^112hKrFk]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Identification of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection and preventive therapy is important for TB control, especially in high-risk populations. Since the advent of interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs), many studies have evaluated their role in the diagnosis of active and latent TB. With the growing evidence base, many guidelines now include IGRAs. We surveyed the literature and contacted experts to identify 33 guidelines and position papers from 25 countries and two supranational organizations. The results show considerable diversity in the recommendations on IGRAs, with four approaches commonly proposed: (i) two-step approach of tuberculin skin test (TST) first, followed by IGRA either when the TST is negative (to increase sensitivity, mainly in immunocompromised individuals), or when the TST is positive (to increase specificity, mainly in bacillus Calmette-Guérin-vaccinated individuals); (ii) Either TST or IGRA, but not both; (iii) IGRA and TST together (to increase sensitivity); and (iv) IGRA only, replacing the TST. Overall, the use of IGRAs is increasingly recommended, but most of the current guidelines do not use objective, transparent methods to grade evidence and recommendations, and do not disclose conflicts of interests. Future IGRA guidelines must aim to be transparent, evidence-based, periodically updated, and free of financial conflicts and industry involvement.

### Revisiting annual screening for latent tuberculosis infection in healthcare workers: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^115crHDP]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) infection has long been considered a hazard for healthcare workers (HCWs), where occupational factors such as caring for patients with respiratory TB increase risk. Routine screening and treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) has traditionally been an important element of TB prevention measures in Canadian and US healthcare institutions.

The preferred method of serial screening for LTBI in Canadian HCWs is the tuberculin skin test (TST), with the recommended frequency of testing reflecting the volume of TB patients cared for at the healthcare facility and the risk inherent to specific work activities. Baseline two-step tuberculin testing is recommended for all HCWs upon hiring in Canada. Subsequent annual testing is recommended for those with intermediate-risk duties (e.g. direct patient care) in settings where TB patients are more likely to be encountered. Annual testing is also recommended for all HCWs who perform high-risk duties (e.g. cough-inducing procedures or laboratory procedures with potential M. tuberculosis exposure), regardless of work setting. Other HCWs, who are at lower risk based on setting and/or duties, are retested only after identified exposure where there is concern about possible transmission. US guidelines are similar, although they suggest that an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) may replace the TST.

Recent data call into question the use of routine serial testing for the 'typical' North American HCW involved in most patient care activities which may entail exposure to M. tuberculosis. This is because false-positive test conversions become more frequent than true-positives as the risk of true infection falls, regardless of the specific test used. The true risk now faced by most North American HCWs is small, as TB incidence in the US is now at an all-time low. This is concordant with reported estimated conversion rates of 0.8–0.9% over 6–18 months of follow-up. Several reports have also suggested more frequent false-positive 'conversions' with the IGRAs, although one study reported lower apparent conversion rates with the T-SPOT.TB test, particularly when borderline results were excluded.

### The risk of falsely declaring noninferiority of novel latent tuberculosis treatment in large trials [^115JSm7S]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The authors examined the impact of LTBI prevalence, the sensitivity and specificity of currently available proxy tests for LTBI, and the choice of noninferiority margins and other parameters on the design and interpretation of noninferiority trials. There is much debate about what constitutes "true" latent infection. A particular concern in noninferiority trials relates to the specificity of a test for LTBI and the prevalence of true LTBI in the study population.

A low prevalence of LTBI would mean that many individuals in the trial are not infected, which increases the risk of falsely declaring noninferiority. This modeling analysis suggests that without testing for LTBI, that risk is substantial when the LTBI prevalence is below 45%. When LTBI prevalence is less than 45%, it is still better to "enrich" the trial population for LTBI by enrollment based on LTBI tests. However, as the low specificity of the LTBI test would again result in low prevalence, more specific tests, such as IFN-γ release assays (IGRAs), should be used. Indeed, more broadly, the authors conclude that noninferiority trials evaluating regimens for treating LTBI should enroll participants based on IGRAs rather than on the PPD tuberculin skin test (TST), to decrease the risk of misclassifying ineffective regimens as noninferior. The conclusion that IGRAs are better than TSTs was predetermined by the assumption that the TST has a considerably lower specificity (59–70% for TSTs vs. 93–99% for IGRAs) in "standard practice" than IGRAs. These specificity estimates are derived from studies that used a TST cutoff of 5 mm for children and HIV-infected individuals in accordance with CDC recommendations — a sensible public health decision to ensure that few cases of LTBI are missed by maximizing sensitivity at the expense of specificity. However, trials do not have to use standard TST cutoffs. Previous studies suggested that it is possible to achieve very high specificity levels with the TST using higher thresholds. Indeed, at cutoffs of ≥ 15 mm, the TST's ability to predict subsequent TB is similar to that of IGRAs.

### Prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection among healthy young children and adolescents and a two-step approach for the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection in chengdu, China [^116rgCY6]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a state of persistent immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) antigens without any clinical symptoms of active tuberculosis (TB). About a quarter of the global population has TB infection, and a considerable proportion is in the LTBI state without symptoms and infectivity. However, the LTBI population is a large reservoir of MTB, and can progress to active and highly contagious TB. The risk of LTBI progression is higher in children and adolescents, who are also more likely to develop severe diseases such as miliary tuberculosis and tuberculosis meningitis, and also, have a shorter latency period. However, there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of LTBI currently. Tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) are both recommended to diagnose LTBI, which based on cellular immune responses to MTB antigens. TST has also been used as an epidemiologic tool to evaluate the prevalence of LTBI based on different cutoff values. Nevertheless, the optimal test of screening LTBI in young children is controversial and epidemiologic evidence is limited.

When considering the cost-effectiveness analyses and diagnosis accuracy of screening tests, a 2-step approach is adopted by many countries, including Britain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, Italy and Spain, – that is, using TST in the first-line and, if positive, using IGRA in the second step (TST-IGRA). A 2-step approach could reduce the cost of prophylactic treatment for more people detected by TST. In addition, the confirmation of positive IGRA results might be conducive to encourage acceptance and adherence to treatment and management of latent tuberculosis infection in high tuberculosis burden countries.

World Health Organization reported that an estimated 10.0 million individually were diagnosed with TB in 2018 and childhood TB accounted for 11% of the total, China ranked among the top 30 countries with the highest TB burden with a TB incidence of 866,000 cases, including 99,000 cases of childhood TB. Therefore, the timely detection and treatment of LTBI in children are essential and urgent to eliminate TB in China as well as other high-burden countries. However, little is known regarding the prevalence of LTBI among children and the most suitable test to be used to screen for LTBI in young children and the longitudinal follow-up about the populations.

### Baseline tuberculosis screening and testing for health care… [^112vqaMK]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know All U. S. health care personnel should be screened for tuberculosis upon hire. This process includes a risk assessment, symptom evaluation, and TB blood test or TB skin test. TB Screening and Testing for Health Care Personnel The TB screening process for health care personnel includes:

- A baseline individual TB risk assessment,
- TB symptom evaluation
- A TB test, and
- Additional evaluation for TB disease as needed. Follow your state's TB regulations. CDC recommendations do not override or replace state regulations. State and local regulations may differ to meet local needs. Contact your state or local TB control program for the testing regulations in your state. Use an individual TB risk assessment to help interpret test results and determine whether health care personnel are at increased risk.

Health care personnel at lower risk for TB who have a positive test result for TB infection should have a second TB test.
- For example, health care personnel who do not have any TB symptoms, are unlikely to be infected and are at low risk for progression to TB disease should receive a second TB test if their first test result is positive.
- Health care personnel are considered to have TB infection only if both the first and second test results are positive and should then be evaluated with a chest x-ray and TB symptom screening. Baseline TB Blood Test for Health Care Personnel If baseline testing is performed using a TB blood test:

- Administer TB blood test following proper protocol.
- Review result, using the individual TB risk assessment to help interpret test results.
- If the result is negative, consider not infected.
- If the result is positive.

andthe health care personnel is at low risk, administer a second test.
- If the result of the second test is also positive orthe health care personnel is at risk, consider the health care personnel to be infected with TB and evaluate for TB disease.
- If the result is negative, consider not infected.
- Document result. Using a TB blood test for baseline testing of health care personnel does not require two-step testing. TB blood tests are the preferred TB test for people who have received the Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Baseline Two-Step TB Skin Test for Health Care Personnel If the Mantoux tuberculin skin test is used for baseline testing of health care personnel, use two-step testing. Purpose Two-step testing is recommended for the initial TB skin test for adults who may be tested periodically, such as health care personnel.

This procedure is especially important for settings that are classified as low risk where testing is indicated only upon exposure. Some people with latent TB infection have a negative reaction to the TB skin test when tested years after being infected. However, if they are tested again within a year of the first test, they may have a positive reaction. The first TB skin test can "trigger the memory" of the immune system, boosting its ability to react to the second TB skin test. It may appear that these people were infected between the first and second tests. However, the second positive test reaction is actually a boosted reaction due to TB infection that occurred a long time ago. Two-step TB skin test process The TB skin test should be placed and read by a designated, trained health care provider. Consult with your state and local public health authorities to determine who is authorized to place and read TB skin tests in your state.

### Official American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America / centers for disease control and prevention clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children [^116imagU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

High-risk Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection — committee practice when initial testing is negative is described as follows: many committee members acknowledged that they perform a second test in clinical practice if patients at high risk for progression test negative, specifically performing a tuberculin skin test (TST) if an initial interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) is negative or an IGRA if an initial TST is negative, and if the second test is positive, they consider this evidence for infection with Mtb; this approach aims to increase sensitivity, is not based upon empirical evidence, and may be an acceptable trade off when the consequences of missing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) are judged higher than those of a false-positive result.

### Nationwide shortage of tuberculin skin test antigens: CDC recommendations for patient care and public health practice [^116GFsqY]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

CDC is expecting a 3–10 month nationwide shortage of Aplisol, a product of Par Pharmaceuticals, and one of two purified-protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin antigens licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in performing tuberculin skin tests. This time frame is the manufacturer's current estimate and is subject to change. The manufacturer notified CDC that they anticipate an interruption of supply of Aplisol 5 mL (50 multidose vials) beginning in June 2019, followed by an interruption of the supply of Aplisol 1 mL (10 multidose vials) in November 2019. The expected shortage of Aplisol 1 mL could occur before November 2019 if demand increases before then. Information on the status of this supply interruption will be updated at FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research–Regulated Products: Current Shortages website. This report includes CDC recommendations for mitigating a reduction in tuberculosis (TB) testing capability resulting from the anticipated Aplisol shortage.

Two types of immunological methods (tuberculin skin tests [TSTs] and interferon-gamma release assay [IGRA] blood tests) are used for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. TSTs and IGRAs are used for the diagnosis of latent TB infection and can aid in the diagnosis of TB disease, but additional evaluation and testing is necessary to distinguish between latent TB infection and TB disease to determine the appropriate treatment. When findings such as chest radiography and mycobacterial cultures are sufficient for confirming or excluding a TB diagnosis, the results from a TST or an IGRA blood test might not be needed. However, most TB cases in the United States are diagnosed through a combination of findings, including results from one of these tests. When TB disease is strongly suspected, specific treatment should be initiated, regardless of results from TST or an IGRA blood test.

Two FDA-approved PPD tuberculin antigen products are available in the United States for use in performing TSTs: Tubersol (Sanofi-Pasteur) and Aplisol. In controlled studies, the concordance between the two products is high.

### Diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: the potential role of new technologies [^117NLC2x]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. TB control programmes need improvement in the diagnosis of latent TB infection. The tuberculin skin test (TST) is far from a 'gold' standard as it often gives false results. Interferon-gamma assays are newly available tests to detect latent TB infection, but they are currently not routinely used. They are based on immune responses to purified protein derivative (PPD) or to region of difference 1 (RD1) specific antigens. Assays based on RD-1 specific antigens perform better than both PPD based assays and TST. They correlate with TB exposure and are less likely to give false results in non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease, Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination and immunosuppression. More accurate diagnosis of latent TB infection with RD-1 specific antigen based interferon-gamma assays may allow targeting of chemoprophylaxis to reduce the burden of active TB while decreasing wastage of health care resources due to false results associated with TST. However, further research and development is required to verify that new tests can predict the risk of later development of active TB and to make it feasible to perform these tests in a reproducible fashion at low cost, particularly in developing countries.

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114w5QGB]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the annual rate of tuberculosis development after a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay result (IGRA), or both, among untreated populations with characteristics believed to increase the risk of tuberculosis (at risk populations).

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials from 1 January 1990 to 17 May 2019, for studies in humans published in English or French. Reference lists were reviewed.

Eligibility Criteria and Data Analysis

Retrospective or prospective cohorts and randomised trials that included at least 10 untreated participants who tested positive to tuberculosis antigens (contained in TST or IGRA, or both) followed for at least 12 months. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) and meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines, two reviewers independently extracted study data and assessed quality using a modified quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Data were pooled using random effects generalised linear mixed models.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was tuberculosis incidence per 1000 person years among untreated participants who tested positive (TST or IGRA, or both) in different at risk subgroups. Secondary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of tuberculosis and incidence rate ratios among participants with a positive test result for latent tuberculosis infection compared with those with a negative test result in at risk subgroups.

Results

122 of 5166 identified studies were included. In three general population studies, the incidence of tuberculosis among 33811 participants with a TST induration of ≥ 10 mm was 0.3 (95% confidence interval 0.1 to 1.1) per 1000 person years. Among 116197 positive test results for latent tuberculosis infection in 19 different at risk populations, incidence rates were consistently higher than those in the general population. Among all types of tuberculosis contacts, the incidence of tuberculosis was 17.0 (95% confidence interval 12.9 to 22.4) per 1000 person years for participants with a positive IGRA result and 8.4 (5.6 to 12.6) per 1000 person years for participants with a positive TST result of ≥ 5 mm. Among people living with HIV, the incidence of tuberculosis was 16.9 (10.5 to 27.3) for participants with a positive IGRA result and 27.1 (15.0 to 49.0) for participants with a positive TST result of ≥ 5 mm. Rates were also high for immigrants, people with silicosis or requiring dialysis, transplant recipients, and prisoners. Incidence rate ratios among test positive versus test negative participants were significantly greater than 1.0 in almost all risk groups, for all tests.

Conclusions

The incidence of tuberculosis is substantial in numerous at risk populations after a positive TST or IGRA result. The information from this review should help inform clinical decisions to test and treat for latent tuberculosis infection.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1155sRUQ]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests and test characteristics: Two types of screening tests for LTBI are currently available in the US: the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). The TST requires trained personnel to administer intradermal purified protein derivative and interpret the response 48 to 72 hours later. The IGRA requires a single venous blood sample that measures the CD4 T-cell response to specific Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens and laboratory processing within 8 to 30 hours after collection. Testing with IGRA may have advantages over TST for persons who have received a BCG vaccination, as IGRA does not cross-react with the vaccine, and for persons who may be unlikely to return for TST interpretation.

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ZMutR]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Data analysis

In the planned primary analysis, for each identified group and tuberculosis test we estimated the pooled primary and secondary outcomes using random effects meta-analysis. We pooled the results for QFT-Gold and QFT-Gold-In-Tube (referred to as QFT). We analysed outcomes separately for TST indurations at 5 mm, 10 mm, and 15 mm cut points, T-SPOT. TB, QFT, and both IGRAs pooled together.

In planned secondary analysis, for studies reporting results of TST and IGRA, we calculated the incidence rate ratio among people with concordant (same test results) and discordant (test results differ) results. In further planned secondary analyses, we included all studies, regardless of the number of participants tested, and conducted a priori defined stratified analysis based on method of follow-up (passive v active), median year of study start (≤ 2005 v ≥ 2006), study design (randomised controlled trial v retrospective cohort v prospective cohort), mean or median duration of follow-up (≤ 24 months v > 24 months), annual tuberculosis incidence in country of study (< 30 per 100 000 v ≥ 30 per 100 000), country level income (high v upper middle, lower middle, and low), method of tuberculosis diagnosis (microbiological v microbiological and clinical v not specified), and study quality (high v moderate v low). In post hoc analysis, we conducted stratified analysis based on proportion of patients excluded because of treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (< 20% v ≥ 20%) and stratified analysis based on country level policy of BCG vaccination (multiple or post-infancy v vaccination only at birth or none) according to the BCG World Atlas.

All analyses were performed with package meta (version 4.9–5) in R. Individual study outcome estimates were log or logit transformed and random effects meta-analysed using generalised linear mixed models with a Poisson distribution; pooled estimates were back transformed. This method has the advantage of avoiding zero cell corrections that could bias estimates when events are rare. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic. Publication bias was not assessed statistically, as factors other than results, such as investigator motivation and funding, might influence why a study is published, commonly used tests do not always agree, few population groups analysed met the minimum criteria for statistical assessment of publication bias, and lack of statistical significance or funnel plot asymmetry does not indicate lack of publication bias.

### Time for a change? Updated guidelines using interferon gamma release assays for detection of latent tuberculosis infection in the office setting [^112SqSxk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alfa inhibitors and other systemic medications increases the risk of reactivating a latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. Therefore, screening for latent TB infection is important in dermatology patients eligible for treatment with these medications. Although the tuberculin skin test (TST) has its limitations, it has been the standard choice for diagnosis of latent TB infection. Since the development of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs), the role of the TST has been re-evaluated and IGRAs have increasingly been incorporated into national guidelines. Although there are situations when either test may be performed, in individuals who have received a BCG vaccination and in those who are unlikely to return for a TST reading, IGRAs may be particularly helpful in distinguishing patients at risk for TB. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of both the TST and the IGRA and presents a summary of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010 guidelines for using IGRAs.

Boosting of IGRAs by tuberculin skin testing (TST) — observations and timing: Initial studies found that repeat TST testing did not alter the IGRA response, but more recent evidence suggests that prior TST placement can boost an IGRA, particularly in those already IGRA positive; this can be observed in as little as 3 days post-TST and may wane after several months; based on these data, they suggest when dual testing is to be considered that the IGRA be collected either concurrently or prior to TST placement.

### The utility and interpretation of tuberculin skin tests in the middle east [^1156o7Ym]. American Journal of Infection Control (2005). Low credibility.

Tuberculin skin test (TST) interpretation can be confounded by Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination and infection with nontuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM). However, a wealth of epidemiologic information has allowed the formulation of recommendations for reasonably informed interpretation of the TST in most clinical situations. In the Middle East, the TST remains a useful test. BCG vaccination is given at birth, which should have minimal effect on TST reactions in adolescents or adults. In countries of the Middle East with moderate to high incidence of active smear-positive pulmonary TB (> 20 per 100,000 per year), a positive TST will almost always indicate true TB infection. However, in Middle East countries with very low incidence of active TB (< 10 per 100,000 per year), a positive TST will more likely be false positive because BCG vaccination is still routinely given; until BCG vaccination is abandoned, the TST will be less useful in these countries. These findings are applicable to countries in other regions of the world, and the utility TST will also be increased where the likelihood of TB infection is higher and lowered where TB infection is unlikely, yet BCG vaccination is still given.

### Late boosting phenomenon in TST conversion among health care workers [^113Yio8N]. Occupational Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Available information is insufficient to guide determination of whether tuberculin skin test (TST) conversions of health care workers (HCWs) within 2 years of two-step testing are related to occupational exposures or to other causes, including late boosting.

Aims

To describe the epidemiologic factors of TST conversion in HCWs, comparing early TST conversion (≤ 2 years after two-step testing) with late conversion to possibly distinguish late boosting phenomenon from occupational TST conversion.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of a database of TSTs of HCWs from 1 January 1998, through 31 May 2014, in the United States Midwest.

Results

In total, 40142 HCWs had 197932 tests over the 16 years, with 123 conversions (conversion rate: 0.3%; 95% CI 0.3–0.4%). Among 61 HCWs with a negative two-step TST, 30 (49%) were found to have early TST conversion within 2 years; 31 (51%) had late conversion, with likely occupational exposure but no identifiable community risks. Persons with early conversion were more likely to be born outside the USA (89% versus 57%; P < 0.05), had a higher rate of prior bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination (89% versus 52%; P < 0.05) and had no identifiable risk factors for conversion (63% versus 58%; P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Early conversions among HCWs after negative two-step TST are associated with various nonoccupational factors, including international birth and BCG vaccination history. Therefore, conversion is not a reliable indicator of recent tuberculosis contact in this population, and two-step TST is insufficient to discount a delayed boosting response for HCWs.

### Predictors of positive tuberculin skin test (TST) results after 2-step TST among health care workers in Manitoba, Canada [^112RC1ZT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Baseline 2-step tuberculin skin testing (TST) is recommended for health care workers (HCWs) to identify cases of the "boosting phenomenon" (i.e., a negative initial TST result followed by a positive result) and to track the risk of acquiring occupational tuberculosis. However, the 2-step TST has been shown to be insufficient to identify all cases of the booster phenomenon in older adults and refugees. The objective of this study was to identify whether a history of bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination and foreign birth — variables that are known to be associated with the booster phenomenon — remain predictors of a positive TST result in a group of HCWs documented to have negative 2-step TST results (i.e., 2 TSTs done 7–28 days apart with indurations < 10 mm in diameter).

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of an employee database in a tertiary care hospital in Winnipeg, Canada. The study population was comprised of 698 HCWs with negative 2-step TST results who underwent a TST 0–2 years after completion of the 2-step procedure.

Results

Forty-six HCWs (6.6%) had a positive TST result 0–2 years after the 2-step test. In a multiple logistic regression analysis controlling for age, BCG vaccination, foreign birth, sex, and work setting, only history of BCG vaccination (odds ratio [OR], 8.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.04–17.4), foreign birth (OR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.53–6.62), and high-risk work setting (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.44–5.95) were associated with a positive TST result.

Conclusions

Even for HCWs with negative results of 2-step TST, foreign birth and history of BCG vaccination are associated with a positive result of a future TST. Some positive TST results in such HCWs are related to nonoccupational factors, including delayed boosting, rather than to conversion due to recent tuberculosis contact.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^114rR9E5]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Tuberculin skin test (PPD) administration and reading — The tuberculin skin test is elicited by the intradermatous injection of 0.1 mL of standardized PPD starting with the intermediate strength of 5 tuberculin units, and the size of the delayed skin test reaction is measured 48 hours after antigen challenge with the largest diameter of the palpable firm area that outlines the induration response measured to the nearest millimeter; when a single intradermal injection (other than PPD) is used to evaluate prior sensitization to a potential pathogen, a reaction of 5 mm or greater may suffice as the cutoff point for positive tests, but smaller reactions (2 to 4 mm) may be clinically important.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^114Y61qw]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive indices for tuberculin skin testing — Although the standardized PPD antigen has been used for many years as a predictor of active or latent tuberculous infection, confounders, such as susceptible populations, BCG vaccination, and cross-sensitization with other atypical mycobacterial species, have all affected the diagnostic accuracy of the tuberculin skin test and, by extrapolation, other delayed-type hypersensitivity tests. Establishing the cutoff value for mean wheal diameter of tuberculin reactions has not been universally accepted because of several confounding factors, including cross-sensitization with atypical mycobacterial species, prior BCG vaccination and a delayed boosting effect in health care workers; by contrast, tuberculin skin test reactions may be either reduced or abolished if concurrent anergy exists. Thus, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive indices would not be applicable to large population groups unless these confounders could be eliminated, and standardization of other recall antigens present in anergy panels is incomplete with the possible exception of C. albicans.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113HteXV]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosing latent TB infection — All people with HIV should be evaluated for LTBI at the time of HIV diagnosis, regardless of their epidemiological risk of TB exposure; in programmatic settings in the United States, TB screening has been suboptimal, with only 47% to 69% of people with HIV presenting to care completing initial screening, and 42% of those with LTBI initiating therapy, and the two current diagnostics available in the United States, IGRA and TST, help differentiate those with and without TB infection, but the diagnostic accuracy of TST and IGRA is limited such that a negative test does not exclude the diagnosis of LTBI or TB disease and a positive test does not, by itself, mean LTBI therapy is warranted, so decisions about medical and public health management should include epidemiological risk factors, medical history, and other clinical information when interpreting IGRA or TST results.

High-risk individuals ≥ 5 years — test performance and recommendation: Individuals at high risk of progression include those with HIV infection, an abnormal chest radiograph consistent with prior TB, silicosis, or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy; in HIV infection, IGRA sensitivity has been estimated to be from 65% to 100% while TST sensitivity is only 43% using TB diagnosis as reference, and limited data suggest IGRAs are at least as sensitive as TST; Recommendation 2 states there are insufficient data to recommend a preference for either a TST or an IGRA as the first-line diagnostic test in individuals 5 years or older who are likely to be infected with Mtb and at high risk of progression when testing for LTBI is warranted.

Key points
- The TB skin test is one method of determining whether a person is infected with TB bacteria.
- Reliable administration and reading of the TB skin test requires standardization of procedures, training, supervision, and practice. Background About the TB skin test The TB skin test is a test used to determine if a person is infected with TB bacteria. In this test, a standardized solution made with purified protein derivative, which is derived from tuberculin, is injected under the skin. Typically, PPD produces a T-cell mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction if the person has been infected with TB bacteria. In most people who have TB infection, the immune system will recognize the PPD because it is derived from proteins that are excreted by. M. tuberculosis growing in specialized media under standardized conditions.

PPD is diluted to standard concentration and potency in FDA-approved testing solutions. It takes 2 to 8 weeks after initial infection with TB bacteria for the immune system to be able to react to PPD and for the infection to be detected by the TB skin test. For Everyone: Testing for Tuberculosis: Skin Test. Advantages and disadvantages of the TB skin test Advantages
- Simple to perform
- Low cost
- No need for phlebotomy
- Well-established definitions of TB skin test conversions
- Legacy of decades of clinical and epidemiological research.

Disadvantages
- Requires trained personnel to administer and interpret
- Requires correct refrigeration and an inventory plan for the skin test solution
- Requires two or more patient visits
- Previous BCG vaccination or infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria can cause false-positive results
- Concurrent infections can cause false-negative results
- Rare adverse effects
- Can cause booster phenomenon
- Subject to biases and errors with TB skin test placement and reading. Most people can receive a TB skin test. TB skin tests are contraindicated only for people who have had a severe reaction. TB skin tests are not contraindicated for any other persons, including infants, children, pregnant women, or people with HIV. Boosted reactions and two-step testing A boosted reaction can occur in previously infected, older adults whose sensitivity to tuberculin has decreased over time.

It also can occur in persons of any age who have been vaccinated with BCG or infected with mycobacteria besides M. tuberculosis complex. When given a TB skin test years after infection, these persons may have little or no reaction, giving a negative skin test result. However, the TB skin test may stimulate the immune system, causing a boosted reaction with a positive result after subsequent tests. The TB blood test does not boost subsequent test results. Two-step testing is a strategy used to reduce the likelihood that a boosted reaction will be misinterpreted as a recent infection if the person has to be tested again. Two-step testing should be used for the initial skin testing of persons who will be retested periodically. If the TB skin test is used for baseline testing of U. S. health care personnel, use two-step testing. Two-step testing
- If the first TB skin test result is negative, a second TB skin test should be done 1 to 3 weeks later.
