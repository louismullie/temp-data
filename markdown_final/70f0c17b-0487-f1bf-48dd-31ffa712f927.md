## Question

54 yo F with history of chronic migraines, hypertension (on verapamil), and polycystic kidney disease presents for severe migraine unrelieved by home meds. In ED, neurologist recommends IV dihydroergotamine (DHE) for abortive therapy. BP 128/76, HR 62, creatinine 0.8 — proceed with standard DHE therapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether IV dihydroergotamine (DHE) is safe and appropriate for a 54-year-old woman with chronic migraine, hypertension on verapamil, and polycystic kidney disease, given her current blood pressure and creatinine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about absolute and relative contraindications to DHE. Then, I should verify drug–drug interactions, especially with verapamil and CYP3A4. Next, I will assess renal considerations in polycystic kidney disease. After that, I need to check cardiovascular risk and whether baseline ECG or enzymes are warranted. Finally, I will weigh benefits versus risks and outline a practical, safer plan if DHE is deferred, including alternatives and monitoring.

> Let me first confirm the core contraindications and precautions for DHE. DHE is contraindicated with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, in ischemic heart disease or coronary vasospasm, uncontrolled hypertension, hemiplegic or basilar migraine, peripheral vascular disease, sepsis, recent vascular surgery, and severe hepatic or renal impairment; it should not be coadministered within 24 hours of triptans or other ergots, and caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular risk factors or on vasoconstrictors [^115yhik9] [^111itpDf] [^116kDpD2].

> Wait, let me verify the drug–drug interaction concern with verapamil. Verapamil is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, and coadministration with DHE can increase DHE exposure and precipitate vasospasm, including cerebral or peripheral ischemia; the FDA labeling explicitly contraindicates DHE with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and advises caution with vasoconstrictors, which makes verapamil coadministration risky even if not absolutely listed as a contraindication with moderate inhibitors [^115yhik9] [^111itpDf] [^116kDpD2]. Hold on, I should double-check whether any exception applies; I do not see a labeled exception for moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, and case literature documents vasospastic angina with DHE even without underlying coronary disease, reinforcing the mechanistic concern here [^notfound].

> I need to check renal considerations next. Polycystic kidney disease can impair renal function, but her creatinine is 0.8 mg/dL, suggesting preserved eGFR; DHE is primarily hepatically metabolized with only about 6–7% urinary excretion, so severe renal impairment is a contraindication, but normal or mildly reduced renal function is not a standalone contraindication, though caution remains prudent in CKD [^1148Ebni] [^115yhik9]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even with normal creatinine, PK shifts in CKD could theoretically alter clearance, so I should still weigh risk–benefit carefully rather than assume equivalence.

> Next, I should review cardiovascular risk. Her blood pressure is 128/76 mmHg, which is controlled, but she is 54 years old with hypertension and on verapamil, placing her in a higher vascular risk category; DHE can cause vasoconstriction and chest pain, and inpatient series show a notable incidence of chest pain with IV DHE even without enzyme elevations, prompting many centers to obtain baseline ECG and consider troponins if symptoms occur [^115QpHyD]. I should confirm that guidelines advise caution in patients with vascular risk; yes, multiple sources emphasize careful assessment and monitoring in such patients, and the FDA warns about serious cardiac and cerebrovascular events with ergots [^115QpHyD] [^115Jh4tJ].

> Let me consider the clinical context and alternatives. The ED setting often uses DHE as part of a "migraine cocktail", but evidence quality in the ED is limited and heterogeneous; moreover, given the verapamil interaction and her vascular risk profile, the balance tilts toward avoiding DHE today and choosing safer, evidence-supported ED options such as a dopamine antagonist antiemetic with an NSAID, or magnesium, while ensuring no recent triptan use that would conflict with DHE if it were ever considered later [^1143jZn6] [^113SY8cw] [^115yhik9]. But wait, what if the neurologist's preference is strong? Even then, the pharmacologic interaction and vasospasm risk are not trivial, and I should communicate these risks explicitly before proceeding [^115yhik9].

> I should double-check dosing and safety monitoring if, despite these concerns, DHE were still used. Typical IV DHE dosing is 0.5–1 mg with antiemetic coverage, repeated up to a cumulative 3 mg in 24 hours; many inpatient protocols use 0.5–1 mg every 8 hours for 2–3 days, with close monitoring for nausea, chest pain, and blood pressure changes, and a low threshold for ECG if chest symptoms occur [^113rABGW] [^114tbh6j]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with practice; yes, centers routinely pair DHE with metoclopramide or similar antiemetics and monitor vitals and symptoms during infusion, which underscores the need for vigilant observation if used at all [^114tbh6j].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. Given the moderate CYP3A4 inhibition by verapamil, the patient's age and hypertension, and the potential for serious vasospastic events, IV DHE is not the safest choice today; the risk–benefit ratio favors deferring DHE and selecting an alternative abortive regimen in the ED, reserving DHE for scenarios where the interaction and vascular risk have been addressed and monitored closely if ever deemed necessary [^115yhik9] [^1131FGD1] [^1143jZn6]. I need to ensure documentation of the interaction risk, counsel the patient, and coordinate with neurology for follow-up acute and preventive strategies that avoid hazardous combinations [^115yhik9].

---

Do not use IV DHE in this patient because of the **verapamil interaction** [^115yhik9] and the risk of **vasospasm and ischemia** [^115Jh4tJ]. Verapamil is a CYP3A4 inhibitor that increases DHE levels and the risk of serious adverse effects, including peripheral and coronary vasospasm [^1131FGD1]. Even with normal renal function, the interaction risk is high; choose an alternative abortive such as metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, or a triptan (if no cardiovascular disease) [^113SY8cw] [^112U5FXC].

---

## Pharmacological considerations and contraindications

- **CYP3A4 interaction**: Verapamil is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor [^notfound]; DHE is metabolized by CYP3A4, so coadministration increases DHE exposure and the risk of vasospasm and ischemia [^115yhik9].

- **Vasoconstriction risk**: DHE causes vasoconstriction [^114GoGpm]; with CYP3A4 inhibition, this risk rises, potentially causing peripheral ischemia, coronary vasospasm, or cerebrovascular events [^115Jh4tJ].

- **FDA warnings**: The label contraindicates DHE with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and advises caution with moderate inhibitors like verapamil [^115yhik9] [^111itpDf].

---

## Clinical evidence and case reports

Case reports describe **vasospastic angina and myocardial ischemia** with DHE, even without coronary disease, and verapamil did not prevent vasospasm in these cases [^1131FGD1]. Although the patient's BP is controlled, the interaction risk remains significant [^115yhik9].

---

## Alternative abortive therapies

Given the interaction risk, **consider alternatives**:

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Metoclopramide | Dopamine antagonist | Effective for nausea and vomiting; monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms [^112kKD7w] |
| Prochlorperazine | Dopamine antagonist | Effective for nausea and vomiting; monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms [^notfound] |
| Triptans (e.g. sumatriptan) | 5-HT1B/1D agonists | Avoid if cardiovascular disease; do not coadminister within 24 hours of DHE [^115yhik9] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines advise **avoiding DHE with CYP3A4 inhibitors** and recommend alternative abortives in such cases [^115yhik9]. Given the verapamil interaction, DHE should be avoided here.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Do not use IV DHE in this patient because of the **verapamil interaction** and the risk of **vasospasm and ischemia**. Use metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, or a triptan (if no cardiovascular disease) instead [^113SY8cw] [^112U5FXC].

Summary

DHE is an older drug with an interesting history, yet it is still clinically useful today for patients with migraine attacks not responsive to triptans, who have a greater burden from migraine, and in refractory migraine. Currently, it is administered as a liquid nasal spray or by injection, though oral formulations have been used historically, and an intranasal powder is in development. DHE can be used at home, in the clinic, and in the hospital with good results in select patients. All providers who care for patients with migraine should be familiar with its properties and precautions.

Emergency Departments and Urgent Care Centers

Patients who do not have adequate at-home treatment options lack access to outpatient infusion centers, or who have intractable nausea and vomiting may present to an emergency department (ED) or urgent care center (UCC) for treatment. There have been few strong studies of DHE use in the EDand none in the UCC setting. In one class 3 study in the ED, patients were randomized to DHE 1 mg SC or sumatriptan 5 mg SC. The outcome favored sumatriptan at 1 and 2 hours though not at 3 hours, suggesting a more durable effect of DHE at aborting a migraine attack. Due to the lack of rigorous studies, however, the use of IV DHE in the ED setting does not garner a strong recommendation. Despite this, it is used commonly in many EDs and UCCs, often as part of a "migraine cocktail" incorporating antiemetic and anti-inflammatory drugs. Further study is warranted to establish best practices with DHE under these circumstances.

Inpatient

Certain populations of patients benefit from inpatient admission for the management of migraine. Among them include patients with status migrainosus, dehydration or intractable nausea/vomiting, dependence on opioids or barbiturates requiring detoxification, medical disease requiring careful observation, outpatient treatment failure, frequent ED visits, and those requiring comprehensive medical or psychiatric co-management.

For patients with a longstanding history of refractory migraine, inpatient treatment improves pain and disability and reduces analgesic overuse. Multiple drugs can be used in the inpatient setting along with DHE to enhance its effects, manage other symptoms of migraine, and mitigate adverse events. Inpatient use was first described by Raskin, in which 55 patients with continuous headache, most of whom were overusing acute medications, received IV DHE at a dose between 0.3 mg and 1 mg every 8 hours for 2 days. At the end of treatment, 89% of patients were headache-free with most reporting lasting benefit.

It was not until 1943 that DHE was first developed as a derivative of ergotamine. DHE, when compared to ergotamine, demonstrates greater alpha-adrenergic antagonist activity, lower arterial vasoconstriction, less dopaminergic agonism, and lower emetic potential.

DHE was largely used and studied as an acute treatment for migraine at first. It was later found that DHE, while effective in acute treatment, required higher doses for the same effects when compared to ergotamine. Because of its weaker vasoconstrictive properties, later studies supported the notion that DHE might be used as a prophylactic treatment. Currently, it is used in some countries under this indication, but not in the USA.

For years, ergotamine and DHE were the only migraine-specific treatment options until the era of the triptans. Now many guidelines list triptans and DHE as first-line therapies for moderate to severe migraine attacks. DHE has been found to be helpful with menstrual migraine, status migrainosus, rebound headache, and chronic daily headache.DHE has also been found to be effective in triptan non-responders.

Introduction

Migraine is an under-recognized and undertreated neurologic condition that can be significantly costly and disabling. Migraine has been found to be the second leading cause of disability in the United States when it comes to "impaired quality of life, substantial lost productivity, and high economic costs". Several theories behind the etiology of migraine have been put forth over centuries, including both vascular and neuronal, until ultimately in 2002, Goadsby, Lipton, and Ferrari described migraine as a neurovascular condition. Treatments for migraine include preventive and acute, and in one way or another, they address certain aspects of migraine pathophysiology. With respect to acute therapy, there has been an evolution from treatments that are non-specific (ie, they target aspects not unique to migraine) to the more specific (ie, they target the unique aspects) driven by the need for more effective and better tolerated approaches. One of the first synthesized migraine-specific treatments is dihydroergotamine (DHE). Here we discuss the coming of age of DHE through its prototype, its pharmacology, and its pharmacokinetics, and more importantly, the special considerations – who should use it, under what circumstances, and when to use with caution.

Patient Selection and Clinical Use

Guidelines in the United States and France recommend migraine-specific therapies like triptans and DHE as first-line treatment for moderate to severe attacks.DHE is considered generally beneficial in difficult to treat cases, for example, those with menstrual migraine, rebound headache, migraine recurrence, status migrainosus, or chronic daily headache. A typical intranasal dose consists of one spray (0.5 mg) into each nostril then repeated after 15 minutes. A typical injectable dose is 0.5 to 1 mg. It is generally recommended to limit dosing to 3 mg per 24 hours and to 6 mg per week, though it has been established safe and effective to give up to 3 mg per day for up to 7 days in a controlled setting.

Both triptans and DHE act on 5HT-1B and −1D receptors but have different pharmacodynamics. Both can be useful in the treatment of moderate to severe migraine attacks, with sumatriptan providing more rapid relief and DHE being more effective in reducing recurrence. Often DHE is reserved as an option for patients whom triptans have failed but has value also in difficult to treat headaches and those complicated with medication overuse.

Abstract

Dihydroergotamine (DHE) is an ergot alkaloid derivative of substances produced by rye fungus. Ergotamine was first used in the field of gynecology and obstetrics, then used for migraine treatment a few years later. DHE was developed as a derivative of ergotamine. DHE, when compared to ergotamine, demonstrates greater alpha-adrenergic antagonist activity, lower arterial vasoconstriction, less dopaminergic agonism, and lower emetic potential. DHE can be delivered via several routes including intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SC), intranasal (IN), oral, and orally inhaled (although the latter two are not available in the USA and the last remains experimental only). DHE can be used in an outpatient basis in infusion centers, emergency departments, and urgent care centers, as well as inpatient treatment for admitted patients. There are protocols for adults as well as pediatric migraine treatment. DHE and other ergot alkaloids are considered contraindicated in pregnant women as ﻿they decrease uterine blood flow and increase uterine muscle contractility predisposing to spontaneous abortion. DHE during lactation is also not recommended as it can lead to gastrointestinal distress and weakness in infants; it can also suppress milk production. Caution should be taken before administering DHE in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. DHE is an older drug with an interesting history, yet it is still clinically useful today for patients with migraine attacks not responsive to triptans, who have a greater burden from migraine, and in refractory migraine.

DHE has low oral bioavailability and is subject to substantial (greater than 90%) first-pass metabolism. However, the metabolites of DHE have actions similar to those of the parent drug, which leads to potentiation of effect. In addition, oral DHE has incomplete and inconsistent drug passage across the gastrointestinal mucosa, making it suboptimal for clinical use. The absolute bioavailability of SC/IM/IV DHE is 100%, and for intranasal administration, it is approximately 40%. Peak plasma levels occur approximately 1 to 2 minutes after IV administration, 24 minutes after IM administration, and 30 to 60 minutes after intranasal administration. Parenteral administration of DHE avoids first-pass hepatic metabolism and delivers adequate plasma concentrations of the drug.DHE is rapidly and extensively metabolized in the liver with only about 6–7% excreted in the urine. The major route of elimination is the feces following biliary excretion of unchanged drug and metabolites.DHE has many metabolites, but only the ones that contain the ergoline ring structure of ergot alkaloids are active in migraine. The major metabolite is 8-OH DHE, which attains a concentration 5–7 times greater than that of DHE itself, with pharmacological effects qualitatively similar to those of the parent compound. The elimination half-life of DHE is biphasic, with peaks at approximately 0.7 to 1 hour and then 10 to 13 hours.

Patients with Cardiovascular Risk Factors

Given the potential for vasoconstriction, caution should be exercised in all patients. DHE, in contrast to ergotamine and triptans, has a less vasoconstrictive effect on peripheral arteries and a more pronounced effect on the veins. Hence, IV DHE was used at one time with heparin, even in elderly patients, for the prophylactic treatment of postoperative thrombophlebitisand in orthostatic hypotension. Still, use in patients who already have a predisposition for vasoconstriction, active or unstable vascular disease, or high vascular risk burden is contraindicated. It is also worth noting that the vasoconstrictive effects of DHE are more prominent in the meningeal arteries than coronary arteries. Baseline EKG is often recommended prior to inpatient IV DHE administration, and a more complete vascular risk assessment is often undertaken in the predisposed based on comorbidities or age.

A common side effect of IV DHE is chest pain. In a retrospective review in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 24% of patients admitted for IV DHE developed chest pain. Among them, 20% had EKG abnormalities, but none were deemed clinically significant, and no elevations in cardiac enzymes were seen. Most of the time therapy could be restarted safely and effectively, however precautions are still warranted when patients complain of chest pain, regardless of their risk profile, and evaluation with EKG and cardiac enzymes should be undertaken when chest pain occurs.

Considerations in Special Populations

Pregnant or Lactating Women

As a group, ergots are associated with increased sympathetic activity and vasoconstriction. Use in pregnancy has been associated with decreased uterine blood flow and increased uterine muscle contractility, predisposing to spontaneous abortion. Therefore, its use in pregnancy is not recommended,–and DHE and other ergot alkaloids are considered contraindicated in the USA.

There are no studies prospectively evaluating adverse events and outcomes of DHE use in pregnant women. The available data come mainly from registries and animal studies. In a pregnancy registry done in Quebec, evaluating 53 pregnant women exposed to DHE, the use of DHE in pregnancy was associated with a fourfold increase risk of prematurity. In one animal study, DHE did not demonstrate teratogenic effects, but in another, a dose of 617 mg/kg produced 50% embryonic mortality in rats, and with lower doses, congenital malformations were observed including cleft palate, bilateral limb defects, and lens opacity.

The use of DHE during lactation also is not recommended. Under Hale's lactation risk, it is classified as L4 (potentially hazardous) due to reported cases of gastrointestinal distress and weakness in infants. In addition, it can suppress milk production.

Pediatric Use

Despite its utility, relatively little has been written about DHE in this population, and therefore, its use has been limited mostly to specialists in pediatric migraine who are familiar with its effects. Intranasal DHE has been used successfully in children and adolescents who do not respond to intranasal triptans. IV DHE has been shown to be effective in status migrainosus in children and adolescents.–There are two inpatient dosing schedules for pediatric patients described in the literature, based on weight, age, and tolerability. A lower dose protocol calls for 0.1–0.2 mg/dose (based on age) along with a neuroleptic (eg, metoclopramide) administered every 6 hours for a maximum of 16 doses or until headache freedom is achieved. A higher dose protocol (for patients with inadequate response to lower doses, or who are deemed unlikely to respond to a lower dose but likely to tolerate a higher dose) utilizes 0.5–1 mg/dose (based on age and weight) administered with a neuroleptic (eg, prochlorperazine) every 8 hours for a maximum of 20 doses. Two retrospective studies of these dosing regimens revealed that 74–80% of patients have an excellent response.

Pharmacology

DHE is one of the derivatives of ergot alkaloids, which come from the fungus Claviceps purpurea that grows in the ears of rye. The chemical structure of all ergot alkaloids includes the ergoline ring.DHE is a semisynthetic, hydrogenated ergot alkaloid synthesized by reducing an unsaturated bond in ergotamine. This chemical modification results in an ergot derivative with greater alpha-adrenergic antagonist activity and reduced vasoconstrictor and emetic potential.DHE is structurally similar to lysergic acid diethylamide (aka LSD); however, it does not carry hallucinogenic properties.DHE also has structural similarities to serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, therefore its purported mechanism of action is by acting on various catecholamine receptors.

The exact mechanism of action is not known; however, it is proposed to include inhibition of neurogenic inflammation, blockade of transmission in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, and possibly, vasoactive effects (eg, constriction of large capacitance arteries, closure of arteriovenous anastomoses). It is believed that these effects are due to its potent agonist activity at 5HT-1B, −1D, and −1F receptors. The most common adverse effects seen with DHE include nausea, vasoconstriction, and dizziness, suggesting that DHE indeed acts also on dopaminergic, muscarinic, and adrenergic receptors.

### Updated evaluation of IV dihydroergotamine (DHE) for refractory migraine: patient selection and special considerations [^114tbh6j]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

In a publication by Silberstein and colleagues, long-term prognosis was evaluated in 50 patients admitted for inpatient management of chronic daily headache and medication overuse. They found that 87% of patients who were detoxified from acute drug overuse and treated with repetitive IV DHE continued to have an improvement for up to 2 years. In their experience, IV DHE is effective in rapidly controlling intractable headache, with most patients achieving improvement in 2 to 3 days. Other studies also support the effectiveness of IV DHE in reducing headache frequency and severity. This includes a study by Nagy et al who evaluated 114 patients with chronic migraine treated with IV DHE; 67% of patients reported headache freedom at discharge, and 75% reported headache freedom 1 month after treatment.

Protocols of administrating DHE vary from center to center. The University of California San Francisco Headache Center administers DHE every 8 hours with an initial dose of 0.5 mg escalated to 1 mg as tolerated. In pediatric patients, the dose is adjusted for weight in patients under 50 kg.

Special considerations to take with IV DHE revolve around its potential adverse events and contraindications. The most common side effect is nausea. Many patients require a concomitant antiemetic. A more recent adverse event has become apparent with the increasing use of DHE in the inpatient setting in patients with difficult IV access. In a retrospective review of patients admitted to the inpatient headache unit at University of California San Francisco Headache Center, patients undergoing DHE infusion who had a mid-line or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line) had a higher risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) than patients undergoing treatment without DHE or with only peripheral access. Of 263 admissions for IV DHE treatment given trough PICC or midline, 19 had PE, DVT, or superficial vein thrombosis. Of the 10 adults with DVT or PE, all required anticoagulation; 1 pediatric patient needed anticoagulation. This suggests that the venoconstrictive effect of DHE around a longer foreign surface (PICC line or mid-line) increases the risk of thrombus formation. Given that no thrombotic effect was associated with peripheral IV access, the authors recommend the use of peripheral IV lines for administrating IV DHE whenever possible.

Long-term success depends not only on providing aggressive IV treatment for migraine but also on optimizing preventive medication, addressing psychological comorbidities and providing adequate follow-up post hospital.

### Treatment of acute migraine headache [^113SY8cw]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Migraine headache is a common and potentially debilitating disorder often treated by family physicians. Before diagnosing migraine, serious intracranial pathology must be ruled out. Treating acute migraine is challenging because of substantial rates of nonresponse to medications and difficulty in predicting individual response to a specific agent or dose. Data comparing different drug classes are relatively scarce. Abortive therapy should be used as early as possible after the onset of symptoms. Effective first-line therapies for mild to moderate migraine are nonprescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and combination analgesics containing acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine. Triptans are first-line therapies for moderate to severe migraine, or mild to moderate migraine that has not responded to adequate doses of simple analgesics. Triptans should be avoided in patients with vascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or hemiplegic migraine. Intravenous antiemetics, with or without intravenous dihydroergotamine, are effective therapies in an emergency department setting. Dexamethasone may be a useful adjunct to standard therapy in preventing short-term headache recurrence. Intranasal lidocaine may also have a role in relief of acute migraine. Isometheptene-containing compounds and intranasal dihydroergotamine are also reasonable therapeutic options. Medications containing opiates or barbiturates should be avoided for acute migraine. During pregnancy, migraine may be treated with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (prior to third trimester), or opiates in refractory cases. Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, intranasal sumatriptan, and intranasal zolmitriptan seem to be effective in children and adolescents, although data in these age groups are limited.

Outpatient Infusion Centers

Raskin developed the original repetitive dose IV DHE protocol to treat refractory migraine in 1986. This became the foundation for inpatient and in-clinic treatments administered over a number of days. The original protocol called for IV DHE 0.3–1 mg every 8 hours with IV metoclopramide 10 mg for 2–3 days. Raskin's original protocol has been studied against various other treatments over the years, including IV meperidine and IV promethazine, in which it resulted in similar efficacy yet significantly fewer adverse effects, and IV ketorolac, in which it demonstrated a greater degree of improvement. In the outpatient infusion setting, a modification of this protocol is typically undertaken to allow for up to 2 mg of DHE in divided doses (and other medications as necessary) to be delivered over several hours and repeated on consecutive days. Continuous intravenous DHE administration in an outpatient home-based setting is also another option for patients. Charles et al conducted a prospective study to treat patients with a daily intractable headache by administering intravenous DHE infusion at their home. They were administered a total of 7.5 mg IV DHE over ﻿three consecutive days under the care of a registered nurse. Thirty-five patients were treated, 33% became headache-free and 64% had a reduction in their headache at the end of 3 days. It is a cost-effective treatment option for patients and avoids hospitalization for migraine treatment.

A favorable adverse event profile, high degree of efficacy, and lack of need for close laboratory or telemetry monitoring make treatment with IV DHE an attractive option in the outpatient setting. The benefits of outpatient IV DHE infusion also include less time commitment, less cost to both the patient and the healthcare system, and no exposure to noisy, brightly lit emergency departments.

### Aprepitant for the management of nausea with inpatient IV dihydroergotamine [^116FZEUt]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

IV dihydroergotamine (DHE) has been established as an effective acute treatment for refractory migraine. The most common side effect of DHE is nausea, and its control is associated with better treatment outcomes. Indeed, nausea and vomiting control is a practical and common issue in emergency departments in the management of acute migraine.

Typically, premedication regimens used to prevent DHE-associated nausea, or indeed nausea more generally in migraine, target dopamine, serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT 3), and histamine receptors. Aprepitant is a selective, high-affinity substance P/neurokinin-1 (NK 1) receptor antagonist, which mitigates the emetic effects of substance P. Aprepitant has been used in the prevention of postoperative and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. In patients for whom conventional antiemetics were not effective, we began to use aprepitant and here report our experience with this novel approach to DHE-associated nausea.

History of Dihydroergotamine

Dihydroergotamine (DHE) is an ergot alkaloid borne from the discovery of ergots, substances produced by rye fungus and recognized to have interesting biologic properties centuries ago. The first ergot used in modern medicine is ergotamine, which was isolated from its ergot predecessor in 1918. Ergotamine was initially used for its uterotonic effects in the field of gynecology and obstetrics under the name Gynergen (ergotamine tartrate) in 1921. Ergotamine was first used for the treatment of migraine in 1925 by Maier in Switzerland, when it was originally postulated that migraine was caused by increased sympathetic activity and that ergotamine could reverse that effect based on its properties. Not long after, Graham and Wolff showed a parallel decrease in temporal pulsations and headache after the use of intravenous (IV) ergotamine, inspiring the Vascular Theory of Wolff. This theory stated that an initial cerebral vasoconstriction would be followed by vasodilation and could explain symptoms of migraine such as aura (linked to vasoconstriction) and throbbing pain (caused by pulsating dilated arteries). Although today this theory is no longer considered valid, the supposition was that a vasoconstrictor such as an ergot could reverse the vasodilation and thus the pain of migraine. Ergotamine was introduced to the USA in 1934 following several European studies demonstrating its successful use in migraine treatment.

### Aprepitant for the management of nausea with inpatient IV dihydroergotamine [^117KEkSt]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

METHODS

We conducted a retrospective review of patients with migrainous disorders who were admitted to the University of California, San Francisco Headache Center for a 5-day course of IV DHE (cumulative dose of 11.25 mg) from June 1, 2011, through April 17, 2015, and received oral aprepitant as antiemetic therapy due to refractory nausea, either at the onset of DHE administration or later during their treatment course. The primary research question was whether aprepitant reduced nausea in patients receiving DHE for the treatment of medically refractory migraine. Aprepitant was given as a loading dose of 125 mg on day 1 and thereafter at 80 mg daily 30 minutes before the first daily dose of DHE.

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents.

The review was approved by the institutional review board of the University of California, San Francisco (12–09318).

Data collection.

Peak and average daily nausea scores were determined before and after aprepitant administration from patients' hourly diaries, whereby headache and nausea were rated on an 11-point visual analog graph, or with daily progress notes, or both. Daily medication administration records were reviewed for other concurrent antiemetic medications given either as standing premedications or as-needed doses for breakthrough nausea.

Efficacy assessment.

The efficacy of aprepitant was assessed by determining reduction (> 50%) in either average or peak daily nausea score (1 point), cessation of emesis following administration of aprepitant, and ≥ 50% reduction in the average daily number of as-needed antinausea medications. In addition, patients were surveyed for their subjective impression regarding the effectiveness of aprepitant in controlling nausea, vomiting, or both with an open-ended question.

Tolerability and adverse events.

Patient daily notes and diaries were reviewed for an assessment of any adverse events and to determine tolerability during inpatient use.

Data collection and analysis.

Data were abstracted from patient hourly diaries or medical records into a summary spreadsheet (Excel; Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Summary data are presented as proportions observed. Given the exploratory nature of the work, the add-on nature of the treatment, and the absence of a suitable control, we did not have a formal aim for hypothesis testing.

### Outcome and cost of inpatient hospitalization for intravenous dihydroergotamine treatment of refractory pediatric headache [^114mh6jQ]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

To determine the cost and efficacy of admitting patients for intravenous dihydroergotamine treatment and to identify factors associated with a higher likelihood of response to treatment.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all pediatric hospitalizations from 2001 to 2010 for intravenous dihydroergotamine therapy for headache. Data were collected using the REDcap database and consisted of multiple variables, including preadmission demographics, headache duration, use of prophylactic medications, inpatient therapies including dihydroergotamine dosing, procedures, consultations, total hospital cost, and headache severity at discharge and at follow-up.

Results

Seventy-four percent of the 145 individuals who were hospitalized were female. Mean age was 14.9 years. Headache was described as chronic or daily in almost all patients and 28 (19%) had status migrainosus. Sixty-six percent had a first-degree relative with migraine. The average length of stay was 3.7 days, and the average cost was $7569 per hospitalization. Patients received an average of eight doses of dihydroergotamine. At the time of discharge, 63% of patients reported improvement. Follow-up information was available for 68% of the cohort at a median of 42 days after discharge, and 21 of 99 patients (21%) experienced sustained relief of headache. Response to dihydroergotamine was correlated with a lower rate of comorbid diagnoses, lumbar puncture, and outpatient neuroimaging. Response also correlated to less expensive hospitalizations with an average cost of $5379 per hospitalization versus $7105 per hospitalization without positive response. Response was also correlated with a patient receiving more doses of intravenous dihydroergotamine.

Conclusions

Although intravenous dihydroergotamine is an effective abortive medication for intractable migraine, it may provide only short-term headache relief in many pediatric patients. Hospitalization is relatively costly with only modest long-term benefit, especially in patients with chronic migraine or chronic daily headache.

### Management of the acute migraine headache [^116CWeRJ]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

As many as 30 million Americans have migraine headaches. The impact on patients and their families can be tremendous, and treatment of migraines can present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for family physicians. Abortive treatment options include nonspecific and migraine-specific therapy. Nonspecific therapies include analgesics (aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opiates), adjunctive therapies (antiemetics and sedatives), and other nonspecific medications (intranasal lidocaine or steroids). Migraine-specific abortive therapies include ergotamine and its derivatives, and triptans. Complementary and alternative therapies can also be used to abort the headache or enhance the efficacy of another therapeutic modality. Treatment choices for acute migraine should be based on headache severity, migraine frequency, associated symptoms, and comorbidities.

### Intravenous dihydroergotamine for inpatient management of refractory primary headaches [^1124RpbQ]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine dosing and side effects of dihydroergotamine as they affect outcomes in primary headache disorders.

Methods

We audited our use of dihydroergotamine for inpatient management of disabling primary headache, focusing on the commonly treated problems.

Results

Of patients interviewed, 114 had chronic migraine, 38 had cluster headache, and 11 had new daily persistent headache (NDPH). The mean time to follow-up for the entire cohort was 11 months. The data suggest that IV dihydroergotamine given over 5 days produces improvement in headache and disability in patients with migraine more than shorter courses. It does so with a cumulative effect after discharge up to a month. Giving more dihydroergotamine predicts a greater pain-free rate. Patients with cluster headache benefit from IV dihydroergotamine. In patients with NDPH, only those with migrainous symptoms responded and in that group the response was less robust compared with that seen in the chronic migraine cohort.

Conclusions

Intravenous dihydroergotamine is well-tolerated, and longer treatments produce a better outcome. Nausea is the most common adverse effect, and its control is associated with a better outcome.

Abortive medications

Abortive medications are the first line of treatment for the acute treatment of migraine. The use of NSAIDs, such as naproxen sodium and ibuprofen, has been shown to be probably effective in alleviating a headache attack; however, patients taking NSAIDs on a daily or regular basis are at risk of exacerbating their existent headache and developing medication overuse headaches.

Ergotamine derivatives, such as dihydroergotamine (DHE), have been used for years for the treatment of moderate to severe migraine; however, triptans, because of their better tolerability and pharmacological specificity, have replaced ergotamine derivatives in the majority of cases.DHE is a 5-HT 1B and 5-HT 1D agonist, as well as acting at other receptors, and is useful in patients who have not responded to triptan therapy.DHE is available in intranasaland injectable preparations, the latter in particular being popularly used as an abortive agent in the emergency room.

Serotonin 5-HT 1B/1D receptor agonists (triptans), such as sumatriptan, are newer established medications for the acute treatment of migraine. Studies have shown that they affect neuronal activation, inhibiting the presynaptic release of CGRP at the TCC, and also act in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray and the thalamus.5-HT 1B/1D receptors are localized on the trigeminal ganglion in humans and rodents–and at the level of the TNC in humans.–5-HT 1B receptors are localized on human intracranial arteries. Sumatriptan has been shown to prevent central sensitization of TCC neurons, but not abort central sensitization. This may explain why triptans are effective when they are taken at the first sign of a migraine.

In addition to oral dosing formulations, subcutaneous and intranasal formulations offer a fast onset of action and are a good alternative for patients who experience gastrointestinal effects. The different pharmacokinetics between triptans should be considered when choosing the appropriate one for a patient.

### Aprepitant for the management of nausea with inpatient IV dihydroergotamine [^1176jHm5]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of oral aprepitant, a substance P/neurokinin A receptor antagonist, in controlling nausea associated with IV dihydroergotamine (DHE) administered for medically refractory migrainous headache in patients not responding to standard antiemetics or with a history of uncontrolled nausea with DHE.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review of prospectively collected hourly diary data and clinical notes of patients hospitalized between 2011 and 2015 for inpatient treatment with DHE. Patients were classified using the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (beta version). Peak and average daily nausea scores from hourly diaries, or daily entries of notes, and concurrent antiemetic use were collected and tabulated.

Results

Seventy-four patients, of whom 24 had daily diaries, with chronic migraine with or without aura, with or without medication overuse, or new daily persistent headache of a migrainous type, were identified. In 36 of 57 cases in which aprepitant was administered during hospitalization, there was a 50% reduction in the average daily number of as-needed antinausea medications. Of 57 patients, 52 reported that the addition of aprepitant improved nausea. Among 21 of 24 patients with hourly diary data, nausea scores were reduced and in all 12 with vomiting there was cessation of emesis after aprepitant was added. Aprepitant was well tolerated with no treatment emergent adverse events.

Conclusions

Aprepitant can be effective in the treatment of refractory DHE-induced nausea and emesis. Given the broader issue of troublesome nausea and vomiting in acute presentations of migraine, general neurologists may consider what place aprepitant has in the management of such patients.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with medically refractory migraine receiving IV DHE, oral aprepitant reduces nausea.

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^115Hu4XK]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Treatments with no recommendations — evidence synthesis indicates that the CGC found comparative evidence inconclusive to inform recommendations for monotherapy with a CGRP antagonist-gepant, dihydroergotamine, or lasmiditan, although these three options compared with placebo were efficacious; monotherapy with a CGRP antagonist-gepant may have a lower likelihood of pain freedom and pain relief at 2 hours, as well as sustained pain freedom up to 48 hours, than the combination of a triptan and an NSAID (low-certainty evidence); compared with triptan monotherapy, dihydroergotamine may not differ in pain relief at 2 hours (low-certainty evidence), whereas triptan monotherapy probably had a higher likelihood of freedom from nausea and vomiting at 2 hours (200 and 400 more events per 1000 people).

### Aprepitant for the management of nausea with inpatient IV dihydroergotamine [^113K3Vrj]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Seventy-four cases were identified (figure) with admission diagnoses, made by the authors and all checked by the senior author, of chronic migraine with or without aura, with or without medication overuse, or new daily persistent headache of a migrainous type.

Figure
Flowchart of cases

DHE = dihydroergotamine; PRN = as-needed.

Timing of use and concomitant antiemetics.

In 57 of these cases, aprepitant was administered midway through the IV DHE protocol for nausea that was refractory to other standing premedication antiemetics, including IV ondansetron, granisetron, oral domperidone, or IV promethazine. In the remaining 17 cases, aprepitant was initiated on admission because of the presence of severe nausea at baseline or known history of severe nausea with prior DHE treatment. Inpatient diaries recording hourly nausea scores were available for review in 24 of the first 57 cases.

Daily diary outcomes.

Mean or peak daily nausea scores, or both, were reduced following administration of aprepitant in 21 of the 24 patients (88%) whose diaries were available for review. Vomiting occurred in 12 patients before receiving aprepitant and ceased in all 12 cases post aprepitant. One patient developed emesis only after aprepitant was added.

Aprepitant outcome when added during admission.

Among 36 of the 57 patients (63%) who received aprepitant midway through hospitalization, there was a ≥ 50% reduction in the average daily number of as-needed antinausea medications post aprepitant. Finally, 52 of the 57 patients (91%) reported subjective improvement of their nausea following the addition of aprepitant. Two reported no benefit and data were unavailable for the remaining 3 patients.

Aprepitant at the onset of DHE.

Among the patients who received aprepitant at the onset of the DHE protocol (n = 17), 6 patients (35%) did not require any as-needed antinausea medications throughout the entire 5-day hospitalization. In these cases, other standing premedication nausea treatments given in addition to aprepitant on admission included ondansetron with domperidone (n = 4) or granisetron with domperidone (n = 1). Aprepitant was the sole premedication agent given in 1 of the 6 cases not requiring additional as-needed medications.

### Meeting acute migraine treatment needs through novel treatment formulations [^117Y6zPz]. Neurotherapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Migraineurs often do not use acute migraine-specific medications. Patient-reported satisfaction with triptans is modest. Patients are generally interested in obtaining more rapid and complete symptom relief. The role of trigeminal vascular activation may explain why some patients fail to respond to current treatment. Novel formulations of currently available acute migraine treatments have been developed, with improved clinical outcomes, response times, and pain-free rates. Currently available effective, novel, acute migraine therapies include needle-free injectable sumatriptan and effervescent diclofenac. Orally inhaled dihydroergotamine is a new treatment modality. These novel formulations may help patients achieve desirable outcomes, including faster and more complete relief, more consistent response, and improved drug tolerability.

### History of the use of ergotamine and dihydroergotamine in migraine from 1906 and onward [^111ZHUti]. Cephalalgia (2008). Low credibility.

Dale showed in 1906 in a seminal work that ergot inhibits the pressor effect of adrenaline. Stoll at Sandoz isolated ergotamine from ergot in 1918. Based on the belief that migraine was due to increased sympathetic activity, ergotamine was first used in the acute treatment of migraine by Maier in Switzerland in 1925. In 1938 Graham and Wolff demonstrated the parallel decrease of temporal pulsations and headache after ergotamine i.v. This inspired the vascular theory of Wolff: an initial cerebral vasoconstriction followed by an extracranial vasodilation. Dihydroergotamine (DHE) was introduced as an adrenolytic agent in 1943. It is still in use parenterally and by the nasal route. Before the triptan era ergotamine and DHE had widespread use as the only specific antimigraine drugs. From 1950 the world literature on ergotamine was dominated by two adverse events: ergotamine overuse headache and the relatively rare overt ergotism. Recently, oral ergotamine, which has an oral bioavailability of < 1%, has been inferior to oral triptans in randomized clinical trials. A European Consensus in 2000 concluded that ergotamine is not a drug of first choice. In an American review of 2003 it was suggested that ergotamine may be considered in the treatment of selected patients with moderate to severe migraine.

### Dihydroergotamine mesylate [^1143DzBb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Trials

The efficacy of dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray for the acute treatment of migraine headaches was evaluated in four randomized, double blind, placebo controlled studies in the U.S. The patient population for the trials was predominantly female (87%) and Caucasian (95%) with a mean age of 39 years (range 18 to 65 years). Patients treated a single moderate to severe migraine headache with a single dose of study medication and assessed pain severity over the 24 hours following treatment.

Headache response was determined 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after dosing and was defined as a reduction in headache severity to mild or no pain. In studies 1 and 2, a four-point pain intensity scale was utilized; in studies 3 and 4, a five-point scale was used that included both pain response and restoration of function for "severe" or "incapacitating" pain, a less clear endpoint. Although rescue medication was allowed in all four studies, patients were instructed not to use them during the four hour observation period. In studies 3 and 4, a total dose of 2 mg was compared to placebo. In studies 1 and 2, doses of 2 and 3 mg were evaluated, and showed no advantage of the higher dose for a single treatment. In all studies, patients received a regimen consisting of 0.5 mg in each nostril, repeated in 15 minutes (and again in another 15 minutes for the 3 mg dose in studies 1 and 2).

### Exacerbation of SUNCT and SUNA syndromes during intravenous dihydroergotamine treatment: a case series [^115fuH1m]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The management of short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) and with short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with autonomic symptoms (SUNA) remains challenging in view of the limited understanding of their pathophysiological mechanisms.

Methods

An initial observation that patients with both chronic migraine (CM) or cluster headache (CH) and SUNCT/SUNA receiving intravenous dihydroergotamine (IV DHE) had complained of dramatic worsening of the latter led to review of the case notes of patients with CM or CH and co-existent SUNCT/SUNA seen between 2008 and 2013 and who had a trial of IV DHE.

Results

Twenty-four patients were identified. IV DHE was ineffective for SUNCT/SUNA in 16 patients, while one patient reported a marginal improvement. Five patients reported dramatic worsening of the SUNCT/SUNA. Moreover, two patients developed new-onset SUNA during their first IV DHE infusion. Out of these seven patients, those requiring repeated courses of IV DHE consistently experienced exacerbations of SUNCT/SUNA which were suppressed with IV lidocaine.

Conclusions

DHE is an ineffective treatment option for SUNCT and SUNA. Physicians who intend to offer IV DHE to CH or CM patients should warn them that IV DHE could exacerbate and possibly even lead to a de novo onset of SUNCT/SUNA. In view of the reported worsening or new onset of SUNCT/SUNA in patients using dopamine agonists for the treatment of pituitary prolactinomas, we speculate that DHE might worsen or induce SUNCT and SUNA, at least in a sub-group of patients, through a perturbation in the dopaminergic system.

In the landscape of migraine treatment, many unanswered questions remain-particularly, which medications are most effective as acute agents and for which patients? Given the heterogeneity of patients, clinicians' practice, and the integration of new agents into migraine care, this is an ambitious question to address. 1 At the same time, this question is crucial both because proper acute treatment is an important metric of quality of care and such treatments are woefully underused in the general population. 2,3.

Recommendations for future research and clinical consideration emphasize gaps in high-quality evidence: "Although many preventive therapies reviewed herein are rated as Level C or U on the basis of the quality of evidence available, for some treatments extensive clinical experience supports a possible role in migraine prevention". Until stronger data are available, "practitioners are cautioned not to discount these agents because Class I prospective clinical studies are lacking", and "A case-by-case evaluation of these agents as treatment options is prudent". "Future directions should include validating these initial clinical observations in scientifically sound RCTs".

### Impact of insurance status on migraine care in the United States: a population-based study [^111D8jPs]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether insurance status is associated with differential outpatient treatment of migraine in the United States.

Methods

We analyzed 11 years of data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1997–2007), which survey patient visits to doctors' offices, hospital outpatient departments, and emergency departments (EDs) in the United States. We used logistic regression to determine whether insurance status was associated with the prescription of standard migraine therapy, defined as 1) a triptan or dihydroergotamine and 2) a prophylactic agent.

Results

We identified 6,814 individual patient visits for migraine, representing 68.6 million visits nationally. After controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, geographic location, and year, migraineurs with no insurance or Medicaid were less likely than the privately insured to receive abortive therapy (odds ratio [OR] for failure to receive medication 2.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3, 3.0] and 1.6 [95% CI 1.1, 2.3]) and prophylactic therapy (OR 2.0 [95% CI 1.3, 2.9] and 1.5 [95% CI 1.0, 2.1]). Adding site of care to the regression model suggested that one mechanism for this discrepancy was the reliance of the uninsured on EDs for migraine care, a site where standard migraine care is often omitted (OR for failure to receive abortive and prophylactic medication in the ED relative to physicians' offices 4.8 [95% CI 3.6, 6.3] and 8.7 [95% CI 6.4, 11.7]).

Conclusions

The uninsured, and those with Medicaid, receive substandard therapy for migraine, at least in part because they receive more care in emergency departments and less in physicians' offices.

### Treatment patterns of isolated benign headache in US emergency departments [^1173uzwU]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objective

I sought to describe and analyze the treatment of a large representative sample of adult US emergency department patients with isolated primary headache.

Methods

Information on adult patients with an isolated diagnosis of migraine headache or unspecified headache was extracted from the 100.4 million ED visits represented by the 1998 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Demographic and clinical information are presented with descriptive statistics. The treatment of migraine headache was assessed in light of Canadian and US practice parameters.

Results

The migraine headache and unspecified headache cohorts included 811,419 and 604,977 participants, respectively. The majority of patients were young, white, and female. Patients received a mean of 1.8 medications from a pharmacopoeia of 36 drugs. Most patients (84.8%) given a diagnosis of migraine headache received a parenteral agent. The most commonly used medications were meperidine (30.0%), ketorolac (21.4%), and prochlorperazine (16.7%). Adjunct antiemetics were commonly administered with parenteral opioids (89.8%). Promethazine and hydroxyzine, antiemetics without anti-headache effects, were used 6 times more commonly as adjuncts than the dopamine antagonists that have established anti-headache effects (ie, prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, droperidol; 78.0% versus 11.8%). The US and Canadian recommendations for the use of nonopioid abortive medications (dopamine-antagonist antiemetics, dihydroergotamine, and 5-hydroxytrypamine(1) [5-HT(1)] receptor agonists) are supported by strong evidence. However, parenterally treated patients with migraines received opioids as their only anti-headache medication more commonly than they received any of the aforementioned non-opioids in their regimen (45.7% versus 26.0%). Of all the opioid recipients, most (77%) did not receive any nonopioid abortive headache medication. Meperidine was the most commonly administered opioid (70%).

Conclusion

Polypharmacy and a broad pharmacopoeia characterize the US ED treatment of isolated benign headache. Opioid use, particularly meperidine, exceeds that of recommended nonopioid abortive migraine medications.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines for management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^111ibNgG]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a disorder recognized for its unique intensity of vomiting attacks and inordinate impact on quality of life. There is considerable symptom overlap with migraine. Due to the lack of evidence-based treatment algorithms, current management strategies vary.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines were formulated to replace prior expert consensus recommendations and to assist patients and clinicians in the management of pediatric CVS.

Methods

Guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts and a patient representative who prioritized questions relevant to medical providers and patients. The guidelines were developed based on systematic reviews with assessment of certainty of the evidence, following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including indirect evidence from pediatric migraine headache literature to strengthen the recommendations in areas with limited evidence. The panel used GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks to formulate recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel formulated 16 recommendations on the management of pediatric CVS using nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches. Recommendations were subdivided into abortive (acute) and prophylactic (preventive) interventions.

Conclusions

A strong recommendation was formulated for the use of anti-migraine agents in aborting CVS episodes in patients with a personal or family history of migraine. Conditional recommendations for abortive CVS therapies included the use of oral and intravenous (IV) 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT 3) and neurokinin 1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists and early presentation when requiring IV intervention. Conditional recommendations for prophylactic CVS therapies included nonpharmacological treatments such as trigger avoidance, supplements, and various biobehavioral and neuromodulation interventions. Conditional recommendations for prophylactic pharmacological therapies included the use of beta-blockers, NK-1 and 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT 2A) receptor antagonists, and tricyclic antidepressants. The panel cautioned regarding potential side effects with several pharmacological agents and the use of anti-convulsants only in refractory CVS.

### Dihydroergotamine (dihydroergotamine mesylate) [^115yhik9]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

There have been a few reports of serious adverse events associated with the co-administration of dihydroergotamine and potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors, such as protease inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics, resulting in vasospasm that led to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. The use of potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, erythromycin, clarithromycin, troleandomycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole) with dihydroergotamine is, therefore contraindicated (See WARNINGS: CYP 3A4 Inhibitors).

Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray should not be given to patients with ischemic heart disease (angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, or documented silent ischemia) or to patients who have clinical symptoms or findings consistent with coronary artery vasospasm including Prinzmetal's variant angina (See WARNINGS).

Because dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray may increase blood pressure, it should not be given to patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray, 5-HT1 agonists (e.g., sumatriptan), ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications or methysergide should not be used within 24 hours of each other.

Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray should not be administered to patients with hemiplegic or basilar migraine.

In addition to those conditions mentioned above, dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray is also contraindicated in patients with known peripheral arterial disease, sepsis, following vascular surgery, and severely impaired hepatic or renal function.

Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray is contraindicated in patients who have previously shown hypersensitivity to ergot alkaloids.

Dihydroergotamine mesylate should not be used with peripheral and central vasoconstrictors because the combination may result in additive or synergistic elevation of blood pressure.

### Advances in the understanding of headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^112EX5ig]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Migraine phenotype and prior history of headache before a diagnosis of IIH needs to be recognised by clinicians to avoid misdiagnosis. There is an unmet need to treat headaches in IIH. Future studies should consider core outcome measures for headache, as used in migraine trials, which would optimise meta-analysis. Migraine abortive and preventive therapies can be used, but currently there is no high-class evidence to help guide treatment decisions.

### Drugs for the acute treatment of migraine in children and adolescents [^111zBpMe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Numerous medications are available for the acute treatment of migraine in adults, and some have now been approved for use in children and adolescents in the ambulatory setting. A systematic review of acute treatment of migraine medication trials in children and adolescents will help clinicians make evidence-informed management choices.

Objectives

To assess the effects of pharmacological interventions by any route of administration versus placebo for migraine in children and adolescents 17 years of age or less. For the purposes of this review, children were defined as under 12 years of age and adolescents 12 to 17 years of age.

Search Methods

We searched seven bibliographic databases and four clinical trial registers as well as gray literature for studies through February 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included prospective randomized controlled clinical trials of children and adolescents with migraine, comparing acute symptom relieving migraine medications with placebo in the ambulatory setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts and reviewed the full text of potentially eligible studies. Two independent reviewers extracted data for studies meeting inclusion criteria. We calculated the risk ratios (RRs) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for dichotomous data. We calculated the risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) for proportions of adverse events. The percentage of pain-free patients at two hours was the primary efficacy outcome measure. We used adverse events to evaluate safety and tolerability. Secondary outcome measures included headache relief, use of rescue medication, headache recurrence, presence of nausea, and presence of vomiting. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We identified a total of 27 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of migraine symptom-relieving medications, in which 9158 children and adolescents were enrolled and 7630 (range of mean age between 8.2 and 14.7 years) received medication. Twenty-four studies focused on drugs in the triptan class, including almotriptan, eletriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, sumatriptan + naproxen sodium, and zolmitriptan. Other medications studied included paracetamol (acetaminophen), ibuprofen, and dihydroergotamine (DHE). More than half of the studies evaluated sumatriptan. All but one study reported adverse event data. Most studies presented a low or unclear risk of bias, and the overall quality of evidence, according to GRADE criteria, was low to moderate, downgraded mostly due to imprecision and inconsistency. Ibuprofen was more effective than placebo for producing pain freedom at two hours in two small studies that included 162 children (RR 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 3.04) with low quality evidence (due to imprecision). Paracetamol was not superior to placebo in one small study of 80 children. Triptans as a class of medication were superior to placebo in producing pain freedom in 3 studies involving 273 children (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.62, NNTB 13) (moderate quality evidence) and 21 studies involving 7026 adolescents (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.47, NNTB 6) (moderate quality evidence). There was no significant difference in the effect sizes between studies involving children versus adolescents. Triptans were associated with an increased risk of minor (non-serious) adverse events in adolescents (RD 0.13, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.18, NNTH 8), but studies did not report any serious adverse events. The risk of minor adverse events was not significant in children (RD 0.06, 95% CI - 0.04 to 0.17, NNTH 17). Sumatriptan plus naproxen sodium was superior to placebo in one study involving 490 adolescents (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.78 to 5.94, NNTB 6) (moderate quality evidence). Oral dihydroergotamine was not superior to placebo in one small study involving 13 children.

Authors' Conclusions

Low quality evidence from two small trials shows that ibuprofen appears to improve pain freedom for the acute treatment of children with migraine. We have only limited information on adverse events associated with ibuprofen in the trials included in this review. Triptans as a class are also effective at providing pain freedom in children and adolescents but are associated with higher rates of minor adverse events. Sumatriptan plus naproxen sodium is also effective in treating adolescents with migraine.

### Diphenhydramine as adjuvant therapy for acute migraine: an emergency department-based randomized clinical trial [^111jGMLp]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

More than 1 million patients present to US emergency departments (EDs) annually seeking care for acute migraine. Parenteral antihistamines have long been used in combination with antidopaminergics such as metoclopramide to treat acute migraine in the ED. High-quality data supporting this practice do not exist. We determine whether administration of diphenhydramine 50 mg intravenously+metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously results in greater rates of sustained headache relief than placebo+metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial comparing 2 active treatments for acute migraine in an ED. Eligible patients were adults younger than 65 years presenting with an acute moderate or severe headache meeting International Classification of Headache Disorders-2 migraine criteria. Patients were stratified according to presence or absence of allergic symptoms. The primary outcome was sustained headache relief, defined as achieving a headache level of mild or none within 2 hours of medication administration and maintaining this level of relief without use of any additional headache medication for 48 hours. Secondary efficacy outcomes included mean improvement on a 0 to 10 verbal scale between baseline and 1 hour, the frequency with which subjects indicated they would want the same medication the next time they present to the ED with migraine, and the ED throughput time. Sample size calculation using a 2-sided α of .05, a β of .20, and a 15% difference between study arms determined the need for 374 patients. An interim analysis was conducted when data were available for 200 subjects.

Results

Four hundred twenty patients were approached for participation. Two hundred eight eligible patients consented to participate and were randomized. At the planned interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board recommended that the study be halted for futility. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. Fourteen percent (29/208) of the sample reported allergic symptoms. Of patients randomized to diphenhydramine, 40% (40/100) reported sustained relief at 48 hours, as did 37% (38/103) of patients randomized to placebo (95% confidence interval [CI] for difference of 3%: -10% to 16%). One hour after medication administration, patients randomized to diphenhydramine improved by a mean of 5.1 on the 0 to 10 scale versus 4.8 for those randomized to placebo (95% CI for difference of 0.3: -0.6 to 1.1). Eighty-five percent (84/99) of the patients in the diphenhydramine arm reported they would want the same medication combination during a subsequent ED visit, as did 76% (77/102) of those who received placebo (95% CI for difference of 9%: -2% to 20%). Median ED length of stay was 122 minutes (interquartile range 84 to 180 minutes) in the diphenhydramine group and 139 minutes (interquartile range 90 to 235 minutes) in the placebo arm. Rates of adverse effects, including akathisia, were comparable between the groups.

Conclusion

Intravenous diphenhydramine, when administered as adjuvant therapy with metoclopramide, does not improve migraine outcomes.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines for management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^116DWxPa]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Figure 1 — Suggested cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) management algorithm based on GRADE evidence and expert consensus recommendations details non-pharmacological measures for all patients, severity thresholds, abortive care pathways, escalation steps for nonresponse, and prophylactic options. All patients receive behavioral interventions, trigger avoidance, supplements/alternative options, and neuromodulation, then severity is categorized as mild (≤ 4 episodes/year; ≤ 24 hours duration; no IV therapy required; function not impaired), moderate (> 4 episodes/year but < 1 episode/month; 24–48 hours duration; occasional ED visits/hospitalizations; function moderately impaired), or severe/refractory (≥ 1 episode/month; ≥ 48 hrs duration; repeated ED visits/hospitalizations; function severely impaired). Abortive care includes non-pharmacological stress reduction and pharmacological options such as NSAIDs ± triptans for migraine feature, NK-1 R antagonist (e.g., aprepitant), 5HT3 R antagonists (e.g., ondansetron), and sedatives (e.g., anti-histamines, melatonin), with nonresponsive branches specifying early presentation for IV fluid therapy, IV 5HT3 R antagonist (e.g., ondansetron), IV NK-1 R antagonist (e.g., fosaprepitant), IV NSAID if pain/migraine feature, and sedatives (e.g. IV anti-histamines or IV benzodiazepines). Prophylactic pharmacological options include β-blockers (e.g., propranolol), 5HT2 antagonists (e.g., cyproheptadine), NK-1 R antagonist (e.g., aprepitant), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline), and oral contraceptives for catamenial CVS, and refractory notes list anticonvulsants (topiramate, valproate) with the directive to consider re-evaluation for alternative etiologies if nonresponsive to treatment.

Conclusions

Migraine is a ubiquitous neurological disorder that adds substantially to the global burden of disease. Despite the existence of comprehensive diagnostic criteria and a multitude of therapeutic options, diagnosis and clinical management of migraine remain suboptimal worldwide. This Consensus Statement was developed by experts from Europe to provide generally applicable recommendations for the diagnosis and management of migraine and to promote best clinical practices. The recommendations are based on published evidence and expert opinion, and will be updated when new information and treatments emerge.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^1165RaQb]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.1.4. Frequency of attacks

Recommendations:

1.1.4.1. Attacks of migraine should occur two to eight times per month.

1.1.4.2. The frequency of other headaches (including non-target) must be no greater than 1 day per month.

1.1.4.3. There should be at least 48 hours of freedom from headache between attacks of migraine under study.

1.1.4.4. Subjects should experience fewer than 15 headache days per month.

Comments:

A minimum of two attacks per month is recommended. The maximum frequency of eight attacks per month reduces the probability that those with incipient medication overuse, medication-overuse headache, or chronic migraine will be included in the trial. Allowing 48 hours of freedom from headache between migraine attacks permits clear identification of individual attacks and distinction from relapse, and it avoids the use of multiple treatments for a single prolonged attack. The evaluation of three to five consecutive attacks provides information on consistency of response and may attenuate the placebo effect on the first attack (refer to Section 1.2.12 for more information about consistency of response).

1.1.5. Duration of migraine

Recommendation:

Migraine should be present for at least 1 year prior to inclusion in a clinical trial.

Comments:

Because there are no objective signs or biomarkers for the diagnosis of migraine, and the 1-year requirement increases the specificity of the diagnostic criteria, a minimum course of 1 year is advised to exclude people with headache types that may mimic migraine. The history may be based on subject recall or physician evaluation of medical records. At least five prior attacks of migraine without aura or two prior attacks of migraine with aura are required for diagnoses using ICHD criteria.

1.1.6. Age at onset

Recommendation:

The age at onset of migraine should be less than 50 years.

Comments:

Few adults will be excluded by this criterion, as migraine beginning after the age of 50 years is rare, and the prevalence of secondary headaches or organic diseases mimicking migraine increases after age 50. The inclusion of subjects with onset of migraine after 50 years of age can be considered in phase IV trials, as long as the migraine diagnosis is well established by ICHD criteria, and secondary headaches have been ruled out.

### Dihydroergotamine-induced vasospastic angina in a patient taking a calcium channel blocker [^1131FGD1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a probable case of vasospastic angina after administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate in a patient without coronary artery disease.

Case Summary

A 49-year-old woman with relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis was admitted for severe headache and pain crisis. She received a single dose of intravenous dihydroergotamine and, within 30 minutes, experienced chest pain, nausea, and vomiting. No changes on electrocardiogram were noted, but cardiac enzyme levels were elevated. Brief episodes of chest pain persisted for several days and resolved spontaneously before the woman's discharge. She had several cardiac risk factors, including cigarette smoking, hypertension, and a family history of coronary artery disease, but cardiac catheterization on hospital day 5 revealed no underlying coronary artery disease.

Discussion

Although cardiovascular adverse reactions have been reported with ergotamine tartrate, dihydroergotamine has rarely been linked with such reactions, including coronary vasospasm and myocardial infarction. Prescribing information for dihydroergotamine cautions against its use in patients with coronary artery disease or risk factors for underlying coronary artery disease without a cardiac workup before initiation of therapy. This patient had several cardiac risk factors, but cardiac catheterization revealed no underlying coronary artery disease. Concomitant verapamil therapy for hypertension did not prevent the vasospastic effects of dihydroergotamine. The Naranjo probability scale revealed a probable adverse reaction of vasospastic angina associated with dihydroergotamine.

Conclusions

Health-care professionals should be aware of the possibility for vasospastic angina in patients receiving dihydroergotamine who have no underlying coronary artery disease. Prescribing information should be closely followed.

### Randomized study of IV prochlorperazine plus diphenhydramine vs IV hydromorphone for migraine [^113wHCMo]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine outcomes among patients with migraine in the emergency department (ED) who receive IV hydromorphone vs IV prochlorperazine + diphenhydramine.

Methods

This study was conducted in 2 EDs in New York City. Patients who met international criteria for migraine were eligible for participation if they had not used an opioid within the previous month. Clinicians, participants, investigators, and research personnel were blinded to treatment. Patients were randomized in blocks of 4. Participants received hydromorphone 1 mg or prochlorperazine 10 mg + diphenhydramine 25 mg. Diphenhydramine was administered to prevent akathisia, a common side effect of IV prochlorperazine. The primary outcome was sustained headache relief, defined as achieving a headache level of mild or none within 2 hours of medication administration and maintaining that level for 48 hours without the requirement of rescue medication. A planned interim analysis was conducted once 48-hour data were available for 120 patients.

Results

The trial was halted by the data monitoring committee after 127 patients had been enrolled. The primary outcome was achieved in the prochlorperazine arm by 37 of 62 (60%) participants and in the hydromorphone arm by 20 of 64 (31%) participants (difference 28%, 95% confidence interval 12–45, number needed to treat 4, 95% confidence interval 2–9).

Conclusions

IV hydromorphone is substantially less effective than IV prochlorperazine for the treatment of acute migraine in the ED and should not be used as first-line therapy.

Clinicaltrialsgov Identifier

NCT02389829.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class I evidence that for patients in the ED with migraine, IV prochlorperazine + diphenhydramine is superior to IV hydromorphone.

### A prospective, randomized trial of intravenous prochlorperazine versus subcutaneous sumatriptan in acute migraine therapy in the emergency department [^112U5FXC]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Intravenous (IV) prochlorperazine with diphenhydramine is superior to subcutaneous sumatriptan in the treatment of migraine patients presenting to the emergency department (ED).

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, after providing written informed consent, patients presenting to the ED with a chief complaint of migraine received a 500-mL bolus of IV saline solution and either 10 mg prochlorperazine with 12.5 mg diphenhydramine IV plus saline solution placebo subcutaneously or saline solution placebo IV plus 6 mg sumatriptan subcutaneously. Pain intensity was assessed with 100-mm visual analog scales (visual analog scale at baseline and every 20 minutes for 80 minutes). The primary outcome was change in pain intensity from baseline to 80 minutes or time of ED discharge if subjects remained in the ED for fewer than 80 minutes after treatment. Sedation and nausea were assessed every 20 minutes with visual analog scale scales, and subjects were contacted within 72 hours to assess headache recurrence.

Results

Sixty-eight subjects entered the trial, with complete data for 66 subjects. Baseline pain scores were similar for the prochlorperazine/diphenhydramine and sumatriptan groups (76 versus 71 mm). Mean reductions in pain intensity at 80 minutes or time of ED discharge were 73 mm for the prochlorperazine/diphenhydramine group and 50 mm for those receiving sumatriptan (mean difference 23 mm; 95% confidence interval 11 to 36 mm). Sedation, nausea, and headache recurrence rates were similar.

Conclusion

IV prochlorperazine with diphenhydramine is superior to subcutaneous sumatriptan in the treatment of migraine.

### Chronic migraine [^114EG324]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Chronic migraine is a disabling neurologic condition that affects 2% of the general population. Patients with chronic migraine have headaches on at least 15 days a month, with at least eight days a month on which their headaches and associated symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for migraine. Chronic migraine places an enormous burden on patients owing to frequent headaches; hypersensitivity to visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli; nausea; and vomiting. It also affects society through direct and indirect medical costs. Chronic migraine typically develops after a slow increase in headache frequency over months to years. Several factors are associated with an increased risk of transforming to chronic migraine. The diagnosis requires a carefully performed patient interview and neurologic examination, sometimes combined with additional diagnostic tests, to differentiate chronic migraine from secondary headache disorders and other primary chronic headaches of long duration. Treatment takes a multifaceted approach that may include risk factor modification, avoidance of migraine triggers, drug and non-drug based prophylaxis, and abortive migraine treatment, the frequency of which is limited to avoid drug overuse. This article provides an overview of current knowledge regarding chronic migraine, including epidemiology, risk factors for its development, pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and guidelines. The future of chronic migraine treatment and research is also discussed.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114tAu1x]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Antimigraine ergot derivatives — methysergide and ergotamine — have been linked to valve fibrosis and right-sided heart failure (HF), and they should be avoided; triptans have a favorable cardiovascular safety profile in appropriate patients. Case reports found both drugs to be associated with mitral, aortic, and tricuspid valve lesions that in some cases led to right-sided HF, with onset typically after years of long-term administration and abnormalities that did not completely resolve after drug discontinuation. With the advent of newer agents to acutely treat migraines (eg, triptans), both methysergide and ergotamine should be avoided, and according to the Triptan Cardiovascular Safety Expert Panel, triptans' safety profile appears to reflect a very low risk of serious cardiovascular adverse events in patients without known or suspected coronary artery disease.

1.2.10. Number of attacks treated

Recommendations:

1.2.10.1. Determining the effect of an acute treatment on the first migraine attack should be the primary objective. The attack to be considered should be clearly specified in the protocol.

1.2.10.2. If multiple attacks are treated, the first treated attack or the attack that will be considered for assessing the primary objective can be randomly selected.

Comments:

In most clinical trials of acute treatment, the first treated attack will be used in the evaluation of efficacy. Refer to Section 1.2.12 for information about multiple-attack trials addressing consistency of response as a primary objective.

1.2.11. Rescue medication

Recommendations:

1.2.11.1. The use of rescue medication should be allowed at any time after the first primary efficacy time point, typically 2 hours after the initial administration of treatment.

1.2.11.2. Use of rescue medication before the 2-hour endpoint should be considered a treatment failure unless an earlier time point for rescue was pre-specified in the trial protocol.

Comments:

The time interval to using rescue medication can be reduced when the primary efficacy time point is before 2 hours, which is often the case in assessments of parenteral drugs or trials involving paediatric subjects. Little can be learned from delaying rescue medications beyond the primary efficacy time point. Furthermore, delays may unduly discomfort subjects and prolong the attack and associated disability, which are ethically unacceptable. Rescue medication can be taken before the time of the primary endpoint if subjects require it, but such use should be recorded as a treatment failure.

### Dihydroergotamine mesylate [^115Jh4tJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug-Associated Cerebrovascular Events and Fatalities

Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with D.H.E. 45 Injection; and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the D.H.E. 45 Injection having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. It should be noted that patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack).

Other Vasospasm Related Events

Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray, like other ergot alkaloids, may cause vasospastic reactions other than coronary artery vasospasm. Myocardial and peripheral vascular ischemia have been reported with dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray.

Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray associated vasospastic phenomena may also cause muscle pains, numbness, coldness, pallor, and cyanosis of the digits. In patients with compromised circulation, persistent vasospasm may result in gangrene or death, dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray should be discontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of vasoconstriction develop.

1.3.4.9. Rescue medication

Recommendations:

1.3.4.9.1. The percentage of patients taking rescue medication 2 hours after intake of the test treatment can be used as a secondary efficacy measure.

1.3.4.9.2. The assessment of rescue use medication can be earlier if the primary outcome measure is specified at a time earlier than 2 hours after treatment.

Comments:

Theoretically, use of rescue medication at the primary efficacy time point reflects a judgement of the inefficacy of the test treatment, but subjects in clinical trials may use rescue medication for conditions other than headache (e.g. anxiety, sleep, or associated symptoms). Rates of rescue medication usage have been found to be as sensitive as 2-hour pain-free rates in some trials, but not in others. The use of rescue medication should not be postponed beyond 2 hours after treatment; its use may be permitted at 1 hour after treatment in paediatric trials and in trials where the primary time point for efficacy is at 1 hour after treatment.

1.3.4.10. Global evaluation

Recommendations:

1.3.4.10.1. Subjects' global impression of acute treatment effect can be used as a secondary outcome measure. Efficacy and tolerability should be evaluated separately.

1.3.4.10.2. A simple Likert-type verbal scale is recommended (e.g. very poor, poor, no opinion, good, very good).

1.3.4.10.3. Investigator's impression of treatment effect should not be used.

Comments:

Subject's global impression of change from baseline — the global impression of an investigational treatment's effect — is one of the most clinically relevant outcomes because it is a composite assessment of treatment effects on headache, associated symptoms, and AEs (tolerability). Several scales, including the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C), have been used to assess global impression of change in migraine trials (,–). Global impression of change is recommended for use in phase III and IV trials, as well as for clinical trials comparing two or more active treatments.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Sumatriptan tablets should not be given to patients with history, symptoms, or signs of ischemic cardiac, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular syndromes. In addition, patients with other significant underlying cardiovascular diseases should not receive sumatriptane tablets. Ischemic cardiac syndromes include, but are not limited to, angina pectoris of any type (e.g., stable angina of effort, vasospastic forms of angina such as the Prinzmetal variant), all forms of myocardial infarction, and silent myocardial ischemia.

Cerebrovascular syndromes include, but are not limited to, strokes of any type as well as transient ischemic attacks. Peripheral vascular disease includes, but is not limited to, ischemic bowel disease (see WARNINGS).

Because sumatriptan tablets may increase blood pressure, they should not be given to patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

Concurrent administration of MAO-A inhibitors or use within 2 weeks of discontinuation of MAO-A inhibitor therapy is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

Sumatriptan tablets should not be administered to patients with hemiplegic or basilar migraine.

Sumatriptan tablets and any ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medication (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) should not be used within 24 hours of each other, nor should sumatriptan and another 5-HT agonist.

Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sumatriptan or any of their components.

Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

### Pharmacological interventions for acute attacks of vestibular migraine [^112J9bhD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

How the intervention might work

For many of these interventions, the precise mechanism of action is uncertain. However, the use of these medications for headache migraine attacks has resulted in their uptake for vestibular migraine. Interventions may target the underlying processes that are thought to trigger vestibular migraine, or treat the associated symptoms, including headache, nausea and vomiting.

Triptans are commonly used as a treatment for headache migraine. They act as agonists at serotonergic 5HT1B/D receptors. Their effects include vasoconstriction of intracranial vessels, as well as altering the release of other neurotransmitters, which may interrupt the early pathways involved in a migraine attack (Tepper 2002).

Ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine or ergotamine) were the first specific anti‐migraine therapy available. Ergot alkaloids target serotonergic receptors, but unlike triptans they also affect dopamine and norepinephrine receptors (reviewed in Tfelt‐Hansen 2000 and Bigal 2003). With the emergence of the triptans, ergot alkaloids are used less often in the treatment of migraine.

Dopamine antagonists have been suggested to have some efficacy in treating acute attacks of migraine, but it is not clear whether this is dependent on their effects on dopamine receptors, or due to some other mechanism (reviewed in Akerman 2007).

Antihistamines have been used for their well‐known antiemetic and anti‐vertiginous properties. They are widely used for management of acute vestibular disorders (Hunter 2022). 5‐HT3 receptor antagonists are also primarily used for their anti‐emetic effects.

CGRP is a neurotransmitter found in numerous locations within the central nervous system and peripheral sensory nerves. Levels of this neurotransmitter have been found to be elevated during headache migraine episodes (Goadsby 1990), and to decrease with the use of triptans (Goadsby 1993). Gepants are novel molecules that target the calcitonin gene‐related peptide receptor, and are increasingly used for headache migraine (reviewed in Moreno‐Ajona 2020).

Magnesium has also been suggested to be of benefit in acute headache migraine episodes (Bigal 2002), although the mechanism of action is unclear.

A variety of analgesics have been used for migraine attacks, including paracetamol and NSAIDs. They may be effective for headache symptoms, but it is uncertain whether they have any benefit for vestibular symptoms. Caffeine is sometimes used in conjunction with analgesics to promote pain relief (Derry 2014a). As well as their analgesic properties, NSAIDs may have additional effects on the underlying pathophysiology of migraine (reviewed in Pardutz 2010).

### Targeted 5-HTTherapies for migraine [^116VJEt5]. Neurotherapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Ergot Alkaloids

The first specific antimigraine drugs that were developed are the ergot alkaloids. Ergot alkaloids consist of ergotamine and dihydroergotamine, used as acute treatments, and methysergide, used as preventive treatment. All ergot alkaloids are non-specific 5-HT 1 receptor agonists that also bind α-adrenoceptors and dopamine receptors. Although the main action of ergot alkaloids is still unknown, initially, it was thought that their pharmacological effect of the greatest interest in migraine was arterial vasoconstriction through binding to 5-HT 1B receptors and α-adrenoceptors. However, they also exert a central effect through activation of 5-HT 1B, 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1F receptors on trigeminal nerve terminals, inhibiting in turn the release of vasoactive peptides preventing vasodilatation in migraine.

Triptans

Triptans were introduced as a migraine treatment in the 1990s, implicating a major step forward in the better treatment for this disorder. Since then, new research has focused on new administration methods and formulations, including triptan combination therapies with NSAIDs.

Triptans are selective 5-HT 1B/1D receptor agonists, although some have also affinity for the 5-HT 1F receptor, that lack many of the side effects induced by ergot alkaloids and that are selective to only migraine pain. Although the effect of triptans as antimigraine therapy is based on reducing neurotransmitter release from neurons mainly through the activation of 5-HT 1D receptors, their use is limited by their potential of blood vessel vasoconstriction through the activation of 5-HT 1B receptors which are found within the smooth muscle and in cerebral blood vessels endothelium. For this reason, the use of triptans is contraindicated in migraine patients with cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension and/or with particular forms of hemiplegic migraine. Furthermore, their efficacy is limited as it has been described that in up to 25% of the patients none of the triptans is effective. Of notice, the use of triptans on 10 or more days per month for at least 3 months has been linked to the development of medication overuse headache.

Triptans can be divided into two groups. One group includes almotriptan, eletriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan, which have faster onset and higher efficacy but have a higher propensity for recurrence. The other group includes frovatriptan and naratriptan, which have a better tolerability.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines for management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^1136YQ6X]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Recommendation 8 — For acute cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) episodes not responding to outpatient abortive therapies in children and adolescents, the guideline panel suggests using an IV 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (e.g., ondansetron) with a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects. Ondansetron is readily available, familiar and widely used both in home and ED settings and is considered probably effective, especially in those patients with lower-intensity attacks; decreasing nausea and vomiting may dampen anticipatory anxiety that can trigger recurrent CVS attacks and may also facilitate the maintenance of hydration and concomitant anti-migraine medication such as NSAIDs, triptans, and sedatives such as diphenhydramine that may facilitate sleep. Alternate formulations, including orally dissolving tablets and topical forms, were noted to be effective based on positive clinical experience by the expert panel, and early intervention with a topical formulation may provide relief of nausea and facilitate tolerance for subsequent oral abortive agents including aprepitant. Background notes that ondansetron is a potent, highly selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with established antiemetic efficacy and tolerability in the prevention of pediatric CINV, and that oral ondansetron is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has lower bioavailability compared with the IV form.

Clinical context for preventive therapy selection underscores individualized care and study limitations: "Treatment regimens, therefore, need to be designed case by case, which may include complex or even nontraditional approaches". "A shortcoming of migraine prevention clinical studies is the relatively brief treatment duration (often only 12–16 weeks)". "Long-term assessment of the efficacy and safety of migraine preventive treatments is needed". Additional considerations include that "It seems reasonable that a clinician be mindful of comorbid and coexistent conditions in patients with migraine, to maximize potential treatment efficacy and minimize AE risk", and "Because migraine is frequent in women of childbearing age, the potential for adverse fetal effects related to migraine prevention strategies is particularly concerning".

### Lack of drug interaction between the migraine drug MAP0004 (orally inhaled dihydroergotamine) and a CYP3A4 inhibitor in humans [^116sJb6x]. Cephalalgia (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Dihydroergotamine (DHE), a proven migraine treatment, currently has product labeling warning against concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors because of potential drug interactions. However, no reported studies of such interactions with DHE administered by any route are available.

Methods

The pharmacokinetics (PK) of MAP0004, an investigative inhaled DHE formulation, were assessed in human subjects with and without CYP3A4 inhibition by ketoconazole to evaluate the potential for drug interaction, elevation of DHE levels, and increased adverse effects.

Results

After MAP0004 alone vs. MAP0004 plus ketoconazole, the DHE maximum concentrations (C(max)) and area-under-the-curve (AUC(0–48) and AUC(0-∞)) were not statistically significantly different nor was the C(max) of the primary metabolite, 8'-OH-DHE. A difference in 8'-OH-DHE AUCs was observed between MAP0004 with and without ketoconazole; however, the concentrations were very low. MAP0004 was well tolerated after both treatments.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated that CYP3A4 inhibition had little to no effect on DHE PK after MAP0004 administration, apparently because of its high systemic and low gastrointestinal bioavailability. CYP3A4 inhibition slowed elimination of the metabolite 8'-OH-DHE, but concentrations were too low to be pharmacologically relevant.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^116XHMJM]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.2.5. Stratification

Recommendations:

1.2.5.1. There is usually no need for stratification in acute treatment trials.

1.2.5.2. Stratification may be considered when an imbalance between the treatment groups or an important factor may influence the results of a trial.

Comments:

Randomization alone may not ensure full comparability between subjects in different treatment groups, especially in smaller trials, and stratified randomization is sometimes used to circumvent potential imbalances. The EMA recommends that stratification variables usually be included as covariates in primary analyses, regardless of their prognostic value. In controlled trials for migraine, the use of stratification by prognostic factors should be limited to a few variables and only to those that have historically demonstrated effects on primary efficacy endpoint(s). Stratification variables that have been used in acute treatment trials include age, body weight, headache intensity at baseline, migraine type (i.e. with or without aura), menstrual versus non-menstrual attacks, and concomitant preventive treatment. Given the preponderance of females with migraine, sex may also be used as a stratification factor to control for imbalances in treatment groups.

1.2.6. Intention to treat

Recommendations:

1.2.6.1. Randomized controlled trials of acute treatments for migraine should follow the principle of intention to treat (ITT), which implies that analyses should include all randomised subjects in the groups to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of treatment received.

1.2.6.2. The full analysis set may be modified to exclude subjects from the analysis if no treatment was taken or if no data points after treatment were recorded. A plan should be provided prospectively as to how participants missing the 2-hour endpoint or who treat but do not record data will be handled. Those who treat but do not record data should probably be counted as failures, and those who use rescue medication before the 2-hour time assessment should be counted as failures.

Comments:

The ITT principle encourages, where reasonable, the inclusion of subjects who withdrew, were lost to follow-up, or did not fully adhere to trial protocol. The ITT principle should be adhered to when the primary outcome is a variable that measures a change from baseline to any post-dose time point or to the end of the trial. When the primary outcome is defined as a rate of change, and the analysis will therefore imply a slope or rate of calculation, only subjects who have received at least one dose and recorded at least one data point should be included.
