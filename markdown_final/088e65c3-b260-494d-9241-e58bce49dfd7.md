## Question

Spindle cell cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about spindle cell carcinoma across organs, including its definition, pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, prognosis, and management, with explicit self-verification of each step. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and nomenclature. Then, I should verify the pathogenesis and molecular features. Next, I will review epidemiology and risk factors by site. After that, I need to examine clinical presentation patterns. Then, I will outline a diagnostic algorithm emphasizing immunohistochemistry and molecular testing. Next, I should assess prognosis across organs. Finally, I will synthesize management principles and highlight special scenarios and pitfalls, ensuring I double-check areas where terminology can mislead care decisions.

> Let me first confirm the definition and nomenclature so I don't conflate entities. Spindle cell carcinoma is best understood as a sarcomatoid carcinoma, i.e., a carcinoma with mesenchymal/spindle differentiation; synonyms include carcinosarcoma and sarcomatoid carcinoma, and the spindle component may be pure or mixed with conventional carcinoma, which is why "biphasic" and "monophasic" descriptors are used in practice and in organ-specific algorithms such as the breast [^114R4MMT] [^117XVi4Y]. Wait, let me verify the lung taxonomy: contemporary WHO frameworks categorize spindle cell carcinoma within the sarcomatoid carcinoma spectrum, reinforcing that the spindle cells are epithelial in origin despite their morphology [^115B4dB4] [^1165xUX5].

> I need to check the pathogenesis next. The prevailing model is epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with downregulation of epithelial markers and acquisition of mesenchymal features. Molecularly, TP53 mutations are frequent in metaplastic breast carcinomas and often shared between epithelial and spindle components, supporting a monoclonal origin with phenotypic divergence, while head and neck spindle carcinomas show miR-200 family and miR-205 downregulation and cadherin dysregulation consistent with EMT biology [^115wugwY] [^1165nvMh]. Hold on, I should verify that this EMT framework is also invoked broadly for sarcomatoid carcinomas across organs. Yes, EMT is repeatedly cited as the unifying mechanism explaining spindle morphology and aggressive behavior in these tumors [^114R4MMT].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and risk factors by site, but I need to be cautious not to overgeneralize. In the lung, sarcomatoid carcinomas including spindle cell variants are rare, roughly 0.1–0.4% of NSCLC, with strong male predominance and smoking association; SEER analyses show most cases are diagnosed after age 60, with peak incidence in the 70s and frequent poor differentiation at presentation [^1165xUX5] [^116DMnYj]. In the head and neck, spindle cell carcinoma is uncommon and behaves more aggressively than conventional SCC in oral cavity and oropharynx cohorts, with worse overall survival even after adjustment, and female sex may portend worse disease-specific survival in some datasets [^11123DMe] [^116a5Td1]. In the vulva, spindle cell morphology occurs in about 20% of VSCC and is linked to non-HPV pathways and worse prognosis, including higher nodal risk at diagnosis [^11414guL]. In the breast, metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma is rare and often triple-negative, with variable behavior depending on grade and subtype, and in the kidney, mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma is a distinct, generally indolent entity that only rarely undergoes sarcomatoid transformation [^1132hgLp] [^114UJZsV].

> I will now examine clinical presentation patterns, but wait, let me verify organ-specific nuances. Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas often present with cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and chest pain, frequently as large peripheral masses with necrosis; many are diagnosed at advanced stages, which contributes to poor outcomes [^1165xUX5]. Head and neck spindle cell carcinomas tend to present with rapidly enlarging masses, pain, and early locoregional spread; recurrence risk is high and often early, underscoring the need for close surveillance even after apparently adequate therapy [^11713y9C]. Cutaneous spindle cell SCCs can mimic benign scars or dermatofibromas and may be misdiagnosed without careful immunohistochemistry, delaying definitive management [^116DG1Xb]. In the breast, spindle cell lesions span reactive to malignant, and accurate classification requires clinicoradiologic correlation and targeted immunohistochemistry to avoid under- or overtreatment [^114NoWyn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis without a structured approach. I should confirm a stepwise diagnostic algorithm: start with morphology on H&E, then apply a broad but targeted immunohistochemistry panel to detect epithelial differentiation and exclude mimics, and finally consider molecular testing when morphology and immunophenotype are discordant or to distinguish overlapping entities such as metaplastic carcinoma versus malignant phyllodes tumor in the breast [^117XVi4Y] [^115s8B2z]. For suspected spindle cell carcinoma, I need to ensure keratin stains are included because spindle components often show weak or focal cytokeratin positivity; p63 and high-molecular-weight keratins like 34βE12 improve sensitivity, while vimentin is typically positive and S-100, desmin, SMA, and endothelial markers help exclude melanoma, leiomyosarcoma, and angiosarcoma, respectively [^114B259V] [^116UsJg6]. In the lung, comprehensive panels can reclassify many sarcomatoid carcinomas as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, guiding therapy and molecular testing, which I should remember to leverage when planning treatment [^112A1teL].

> But wait, what if the breast lesion is a phyllodes tumor masquerading as metaplastic carcinoma? I should double-check molecular discriminators. TP53 mutations are common in metaplastic breast carcinoma and uncommon in phyllodes tumors, and EGFR amplification is more characteristic of metaplastic carcinoma, whereas EGFR activating mutations favor malignant phyllodes; these patterns can help adjudicate difficult cases, especially on limited biopsies [^115wugwY]. Let me reconsider the role of NGS more broadly: in sarcomatoid carcinomas of unknown primary, molecular profiling can support epithelial origin and guide targeted therapy, aligning with the modern emphasis on reclassifying these tumors when possible [^114R4MMT].

> Next, I should review prognosis by organ, and I need to ensure I cite the strongest available data. In the lung, sarcomatoid carcinomas including spindle cell variants have poor survival with median overall survival around 15 months and low long-term survival; larger tumor size and advanced stage correlate with worse outcomes, and even early-stage disease can relapse early with short post-relapse survival, arguing for aggressive multimodality consideration in operable patients [^1115j7gb] [^111aULKg]. In head and neck spindle cell carcinoma, survival is worse than conventional SCC in oral cavity and oropharynx, with high locoregional recurrence rates and early recurrences, necessitating vigilant follow-up and consideration of aggressive local therapy when feasible [^11123DMe] [^11713y9C]. In vulvar SCC with spindle cell morphology, 5-year disease-specific survival is markedly reduced compared with conventional VSCC, and spindle morphology independently predicts worse survival even after multivariable adjustment, reinforcing its prognostic significance [^11414guL]. In the breast, outcomes vary by metaplastic subtype, with high-grade spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma behaving aggressively, whereas low-grade fibromatosis-like variants have lower metastatic potential but meaningful local recurrence risk, mandating clear margins and judicious adjuvant therapy [^113ZF4JX] [^112rEXPt].

> I will now synthesize management principles, but hold on, I should verify site-specific standards. For localized disease, surgical resection with negative margins is foundational across sites; in the lung, complete resection offers the best chance for prolonged survival, though adjuvant therapy evidence is limited and many patients relapse early, so I should discuss adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation selectively based on stage and performance status [^111aULKg] [^116DMnYj]. In the head and neck, surgery with or without adjuvant radiation is standard, with attention to margin status and neck management; given high recurrence risk, close surveillance intervals are prudent, and I should confirm that no single clinicopathologic factor reliably predicts recurrence in some cohorts, which supports defaulting to closer follow-up [^11713y9C]. For cutaneous spindle cell SCC, Mohs micrographic surgery achieves high local control and tissue conservation, and adjuvant radiation can be considered for poorly differentiated or high-risk features; I need to ensure clear communication about the "sarcomatoid" terminology to avoid patient anxiety and misinterpretation of prognosis [^116EoPiD] [^114SD3B6]. In the breast, management follows triple-negative breast cancer paradigms for high-grade metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma, with chemotherapy for early-stage disease showing associations with improved survival in some series, and careful attention to local control given recurrence risk [^113ZF4JX].

> Let me consider systemic therapy advances, and I should verify where immunotherapy fits. Sarcomatoid carcinomas often exhibit elevated PD-L1 and an immune-inflamed microenvironment, and case-level evidence suggests exceptional responses to checkpoint blockade in some spindle cell SCCs, including the tongue; while not definitive, this supports considering PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in metastatic or unresectable cases, ideally within trials or multidisciplinary review [^114R4MMT] [^116vTqt4]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought chemotherapy is uniformly ineffective in sarcomatoid lung cancer; I should correct that nuance: conventional NSCLC regimens have limited efficacy and early relapse is common, but selected patients still undergo surgery with adjuvant therapy, and ongoing studies explore combinations, so I should avoid overgeneralizing "chemoresistant" when discussing individualized plans [^111aULKg] [^116DMnYj].

> I should double-check special scenarios and pitfalls so we don't miss critical distinctions. In the breast, distinguishing metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma from malignant phyllodes tumor or other spindle cell lesions on core biopsy can be impossible without a targeted immunohistochemical panel and, at times, molecular testing; underdiagnosis risks undertreatment, whereas overdiagnosis risks overtreatment, so I need to ensure adequate sampling and ancillary studies before finalizing management [^117XVi4Y] [^115wugwY]. In the skin, desmoplastic or spindle cell SCC can mimic scar or benign fibrohistiocytic lesions; careful attention to atypia, mitoses, and focal squamous differentiation, plus keratin and p63 staining, prevents misclassification and delays in definitive therapy [^116DG1Xb]. In the lung, reclassifying sarcomatoid carcinomas with immunohistochemistry can unlock standard NSCLC-targeted options in a subset, so I should confirm that pathology teams apply comprehensive panels and consider molecular testing when morphology is discordant [^112A1teL].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient counseling addresses terminology and prognosis transparently. The term "sarcomatoid" can provoke anxiety because patients may equate it with sarcoma. I should explain that spindle cell carcinoma is an epithelial cancer with mesenchymal morphology and clarify the prognosis by site and stage, providing written context when "sarcomatoid" is used in reports to mitigate confusion and unnecessary alarm [^114SD3B6] [^115o3mx7]. Let me verify that guidelines endorse documenting spindle cell features in cutaneous SCC reports. Yes, NCCN includes spindle cell among reportable histologic features, supporting explicit documentation and clear communication in pathology reports [^114uAgds].

Spindle cell cancer refers to **malignant tumors with spindle-shaped cells** that can mimic sarcomas but are often epithelial in origin (sarcomatoid carcinoma) [^114R4MMT]. Diagnosis relies on **immunohistochemistry** (cytokeratins, p63/p40, EMA) to confirm epithelial origin and exclude sarcoma, melanoma, and other mimics [^116hhjmA] [^114B259V]. These tumors are aggressive, with high recurrence and metastasis rates; prognosis depends on stage, grade, and resectability [^116DMnYj]. Management is **multidisciplinary**, with surgical resection for localized disease and adjuvant chemoradiation for advanced cases; immunotherapy is emerging for select sites (e.g. head and neck) [^116vTqt4]. Prognosis is generally poor, especially in lung and head and neck sites, with 5-year survival rates around 20–40% in early disease and much lower in advanced stages [^116DMnYj] [^113wo2zc].

---

## Clinical presentation and epidemiology

- **Demographics**: More common in older adults (> 60 years); male predominance in pulmonary and head and neck sites [^116DMnYj] [^11713y9C].
- **Sites**: Lung (most common), head and neck, breast, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, and skin [^notfound].
- **Symptoms**: Depend on location; pulmonary lesions present with cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, chest pain, and weight loss [^1115j7gb].

---

## Histopathological features

- **Morphology**: Elongated, spindle-shaped cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei, and prominent nucleoli [^113wCi2U].
- **Growth pattern**: Infiltrative, often with necrosis and high mitotic activity [^112mwhTZ].
- **Differentiation**: May show squamous or adenocarcinomatous differentiation; some are purely spindle cell [^112A1teL].

---

## Immunohistochemical markers

| **Marker** | **Typical expression in spindle cell carcinoma** | **Role in diagnosis** |
|-|-|-|
| Cytokeratins (AE1/AE3, CK5/6, CAM5.2) | Positive in epithelial components | Confirm epithelial origin |
| p63, p40 | Positive in squamous differentiation | Confirm squamous lineage |
| EMA | Positive in epithelial cells | Confirm epithelial origin |
| Vimentin | Positive in mesenchymal-like areas | Indicates sarcomatoid differentiation |
| S-100, HMB-45, Melan-A | Negative | Exclude melanoma |
| Desmin, SMA | Negative | Exclude sarcoma |

---

## Molecular and genetic characteristics

- **EMT**: Downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin and N-cadherin are common [^notfound].
- **Mutations**: TP53, KRAS, and EGFR mutations have been reported [^notfound].
- **PD-L1**: Frequently expressed, suggesting potential responsiveness to immunotherapy [^114R4MMT].

---

## Diagnostic challenges and differential diagnosis

- **Mimics**: Sarcoma, melanoma, and other spindle cell neoplasms [^114B259V].
- **Biopsy**: Limited sampling can hinder diagnosis; immunohistochemistry is essential [^1144bFh6].
- **Molecular testing**: May help distinguish from other spindle cell neoplasms [^115wugwY].

---

## Treatment strategies

- **Surgery**: Primary treatment for localized disease; complete resection with negative margins is critical [^113UbA5W].
- **Radiation therapy**: Adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy, particularly in head and neck and lung cancers [^116DMnYj].
- **Chemotherapy**: Cisplatin-based regimens are commonly used; response rates are variable [^notfound].
- **Immunotherapy**: Emerging option, particularly in PD-L1-positive tumors and head and neck cancers [^116vTqt4].

---

## Prognosis and survival rates

Prognosis is **generally poor** due to aggressive behavior and late presentation [^116DMnYj]. Five-year survival is approximately 20–40% in early-stage disease and drops to less than 10% in advanced stages. Prognostic factors include stage at diagnosis, tumor size, histological grade, and completeness of surgical resection [^116DMnYj] [^11123DMe].

---

## Recent advances and emerging therapies

- **Immunotherapy**: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors show promise in select cases [^116gQpNa].
- **Targeted therapy**: Ongoing research into agents targeting EMT and specific mutations [^1165xUX5].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Improved outcomes with coordinated surgical, oncologic, and radiotherapeutic management [^notfound].

---

Spindle cell cancer is an aggressive epithelial malignancy with spindle morphology; **accurate diagnosis requires immunohistochemistry**, and management is multimodal. Prognosis is poor, but emerging immunotherapies and targeted agents offer hope for improved outcomes.

### Immunohistochemical distinction of cutaneous spindle cell carcinoma [^114B259V]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2008). Low credibility.

Cutaneous spindle cell squamous carcinoma is an uncommon variant of squamous cell carcinoma in which keratinocytes infiltrate the dermis as single cells with elongated nuclei rather than as cohesive nests or islands, and signs of keratinization of conventional squamous cell carcinoma are insubstantial or nonexistent. Spindle cell carcinoma must be distinguished from spindle cell/desmoplastic melanoma, cutaneous leiomyosarcoma, atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX), and scar. In instances when there is no definitive evidence of squamous differentiation, immunohistochemical studies may confer diagnostic discrimination. Twenty-four cases consisting of 12 spindle cell squamous cell carcinomas, 3 AFXs, 3 leiomyosarcomas, 3 desmoplastic melanomas, and 3 scars were evaluated with a battery of immunohistochemical stains, with the specificity and sensitivity of each marker calculated. The immunohistochemical battery consisted of S-100, desmin, CD68, and smooth muscle actin and cytokeratins P KER (keratins predominantly of molecular weight 56 and 69 kd) and low-molecular weight keratin (CAM 5.2), AE1/AE3, p63, and 34 beta E12 (CK903). Spindle cell squamous carcinomas were negative for S-100, CD68, smooth muscle actin, and desmin with the exception of 2 cases with weak staining for smooth muscle actin. 34 beta E12 provided positive results for each spindle cell squamous carcinoma. The other cytokeratin stains were less sensitive for spindle cell squamous carcinoma than 34 beta E12. The final immunohistochemical results were as follows: 34 beta E12 (12/12, 100%), p63 (10/12, 80%), AE1/AE3 (8/12, 67%), low-molecular weight keratin (7/12, 58%), and P KER (4/12, 33%). The 3 AFXs were positive for CD68 and negative for all other stains, whereas the 3 leiomyosarcomas stained positively for desmin and smooth muscle actin and negatively for all other stains. The 3 melanomas stained positively for S-100 and negatively for all other immunohistochemistry. The scars were negative for all stains. In conclusion, our study of 34 beta E12 proved most promising in distinguishing spindle cell squamous carcinoma from the histologic mimickers, AFX, spindle cell melanoma, scar, and leiomyosarcoma.

### 7-mm crusted papule on an elderly man's ear [^116Z8F8h]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Presentation

A 73-year-old man presented for Mohs micrographic surgery with a biopsy-confirmed basal cell carcinoma on his right ear and requested the additional examination of a skin lesion on his left ear. The examination showed a 7-mm, thin, crusted papule on the midhelix (Fig 1), and a shave biopsy was performed to evaluate for basal and squamous cell carcinoma. Pathology showed a tumor composed predominantly of spindle-shaped cells with pleomorphic nuclei and multiple mitoses, with positivity to CD10 immunoperoxidase, transected at the base (Figs 2 and 3 [hematoxylin-eosin, original magnifications ×100 and ×200, respectively]).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Desmoplastic melanoma
B. Atypical fibroxanthoma
C. Morpheic basal cell carcinoma
D. Clear cell sarcoma
E. Squamous cell carcinoma

### Polysemous terms need context: a case of poorly differentiated spindle cell cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma [^115Mx6Gs]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

While the exact frequency of the term "sarcomatoid" to describe poor differentiation in cSCC with spindle cell features is unknown, in a search of reports from one of the author's laboratories over the past 10 years, a diagnosis of sarcomatoid cSCC was rendered by different pathologists at least 40 times. This terminology is commonly used in the literature and is linguistically accurate. Nevertheless, to avoid confusion between patients and treating physicians, we would advocate limiting the use of "sarcomatoid". Poorly differentiated cSCCs with spindle cell features can be reported as such, and rare truly biphasic tumors with elements of both squamous cell carcinoma and sarcoma may be best termed carcinosarcoma or biphasic carcinoma/sarcoma. If the term "sarcomatoid" is used to describe poor differentiation in cSCC with spindle cell features, an explanatory comment as part of the pathology report should be considered to explicitly state that this description does not imply the diagnosis of a true sarcoma. An explanatory comment to provide context and clarity may help to minimize patient anxiety and the subsequent additional provider burden that can occur with the immediate release of test results.

### Immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis and classification of breast tumors [^115s8B2z]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Context —

In the clinical practice of breast pathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) of different markers is widely used for the diagnosis and classification of breast lesions.

Objective —

To provide an overview of currently used and recently identified IHC stains that have been implemented in the field of diagnostic breast pathology.

Data Sources —

Data were obtained from literature review and clinical experience of the authors as breast pathologists.

Conclusions —

In the current review, we summarize the common uses of IHC stains for diagnosing different types of breast lesions, especially invasive and noninvasive breast lesions, and benign and malignant spindle cell lesions. In addition, the cutting-edge knowledge of diagnostic carcinoma markers will lead us to further understand the different types of breast carcinoma and differentiate breast carcinomas from other carcinomas of similar morphology. Knowing the strengths and limitations of these markers is essential to the clinical practice of breast pathology.

### A diagnostically challenging spindle cell carcinoma of the neck: treatment with mohs micrographic surgery and clinical course [^115bMD38]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cutaneous spindle cell carcinoma describes a heterogenous group of tumors that share an atypical spindle cell morphology and infiltrative growth pattern. Examples include dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, desmoplastic melanoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, leiomyosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma. Given their common histopathologic appearance with hematoxylin and eosin stain, immunohistochemistry is typically used to distinguish their cell of origin, although despite this, rare variants may obscure a clear diagnosis. We report a patient with a diagnostically challenging cutaneous spindle cell carcinoma, its treatment with Mohs micrographic surgery, and subsequent aggressive clinical course.

### Spindle cell morphology is related to poor prognosis in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma [^112KMPgA]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Vulvar cancer is the fourth most common gynaecological malignancy, with an annual incidence of 2 out of 100,000 women. Although most cases of early stage vulvar cancer have a good prognosis, recurrence and rapid tumour progression can occur. We investigated the prevalence of spindle cell morphology in vulvar cancer and its association with survival.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included 108 patients with primary vulvar squamous cell carcinoma who were treated at the Leiden University Medical Center during 2000–2009. Paraffin-embedded tissue was examined for the presence of spindle cell morphology. Survival and histology data were compared between cases with spindle and without spindle cell morphology.

Results

Twenty-two (20%) tumours showed spindle cells infiltrating the stromal tissue. All spindle cell tumours were human papillomavirus (HPV) negative. Spindle cell morphology was strongly associated with poor prognosis and with a high risk of lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis (relative risk 2.26 (95% CI 1.47–3.47)). Five-year disease-specific survival was lower in patients with vs without spindle cell morphology (45.2% vs 79.7%, respectively; P = 0.00057).

Conclusion

Vulvar spindle cell morphology occurs frequently and seems to develop through the non-HPV pathway. It is associated with a worse prognosis than conventional vulvar squamous cell carcinoma.

### Cutaneous spindle cell carcinoma misdiagnosed as atypical fibroxanthoma based on immunohistochemical stains [^111PEHkp]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Poorly differentiated spindle cell neoplasms pose a diagnostic challenge for dermatopathologists because of a lack of specific morphologic features on standard histopathology. Further characterization with immunohistochemical (IHC) studies is frequently required. We present a fatal case of spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) misdiagnosed as atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) based on a limited panel of IHC markers.

### Prognostic significance of head and neck spindle cell carcinoma [^113wo2zc]. Head & Neck (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Our study investigates the prognostic significance of spindle cell histology on overall survival (OS) of conventional head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

Methods

The 2004 to 2017 National Cancer Database was queried for patients with head and neck spindle cell carcinoma (HNSpCC) (n = 1572) or HNSCC (n = 242697) of the oral cavity, major salivary glands, sinonasal tract, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx treated with curative intent.

Results

Patients with HNSpCC presented more frequently with higher-grade tumors and cN0 disease than those with HNSCC (p < 0.001). In the oral cavity, the HR for death for SpCC compared with SCC was 1.33 (p < 0.001). In the oropharynx, the HR for death for SpCC compared with SCC was 1.47 (p = 0.028).

Conclusions

After adjusting for patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics, SpCC histology had an independent adverse prognostic effect on OS in the oral cavity and oropharynx. SpCC histology does not necessarily portend poorer survival in all HNSCC.

### Spindle cell morphology is related to poor prognosis in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma [^112sSfPb]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Regarding the survival and overall incidence of spindle cells, selection bias could have been introduced by our inclusion of patients who were treated primarily by surgery. Patients who were treated by excision biopsy alone were not selected for this series, and such patients usually have smaller tumours and a better prognosis. On the other hand, patients with inoperable tumours, and likely a worse prognosis, were also not selected, so patient selection cannot fully explain the differences in survival. Notably, correcting for tumour size did not change the finding that spindle cell morphology patients have a significantly worse prognosis.

These results may have implications for the clinical management of VSCC. Spindle cells can be detected by a trained pathologist and, if necessary, be visualised using commonly available keratin stains. Given our finding that spindle cell morphology does not affect the risk of local recurrent disease, the current advice to perform a local radical tumour resection with 8-mm tumour-free margins after fixation seems appropriate. However, the increased risk of lymph node metastasis and poorer prognosis could influence the choice to perform adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy in vulvar spindle cell morphology patients.

### Low-grade fibromatosis-like spindle cell carcinoma of the breast [^112rEXPt]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Low-grade fibromatosis-like spindle cell carcinoma is a rare tumor in the breast, and represents a variant of the very heterogeneous group of metaplastic carcinomas of the breast. These tumors warrant distinction because of their resemblance to pure fibromatosis, their propensity for local recurrence, and their favorable prognosis among the metaplastic carcinomas of the breast. The diagnosis is potentially challenging, particularly on core needle biopsies, because of the morphologic overlap with other low-grade spindle cell lesions. Recognition of a proliferation of cytologically bland spindle cells with areas of epithelial differentiation in combination with immunohistochemistry using antibodies against cytokeratins and myoepithelial markers should aid in producing a definitive diagnosis. These tumors can be locally aggressive with an increased incidence of local recurrence, but the potential for lymph node or distant metastasis is low. Complete excision with adequate margins is considered curative in the majority of cases.

### Spindle cell tumors of the mediastinum [^115eGdK8]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Spindle cell tumors originating in the mediastinum are extremely rare. Due to the profusion of structures and organs located in the mediastinum, a wide variety of spindle cell neoplastic processes can develop in this location. These include various different tumor types including epithelial, vascular, lipomatous, fibroblastic and neural tumors among others. Many of these different tumor types are associated with specific immunohistochemical and molecular genetic profiles that help differentiate them from each other. Although spindle cell morphology has traditionally been associated with mesenchymal neoplasms, in the mediastinum the most common spindle cell tumor is spindle cell thymoma, an epithelial rather than mesenchymal neoplasm. Except for neurogenic tumors originating in the posterior mediastinum, mesenchymal neoplasms are quite rare in mediastinal locations and require clinical correlation to rule out the possibility of a metastasis from an extra-mediastinal soft tissue or somatic sarcoma. Herein we will review the most common types of spindle cell neoplasms that occur in the mediastinum, with particular emphasis in their differential diagnosis and the role of ancillary techniques for diagnosis.

### Guidelines for pathologic diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma: 2012 update of the consensus statement from the international mesothelioma interest group [^113Z6kzN]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an uncommon tumor that can be difficult to diagnose.

Objective

To provide updated practical guidelines for the pathologic diagnosis of MM.

Data Sources

Pathologists involved in the International Mesothelioma Interest Group and others with an interest in the field contributed to this update. Reference material includes peer-reviewed publications and textbooks.

Conclusions

There was consensus opinion regarding (1) distinction of benign from malignant mesothelial proliferations (both epithelioid and spindle cell lesions), (2) cytologic diagnosis of MM, (3) key histologic features of pleural and peritoneal MM, (4) use of histochemical and immunohistochemical stains in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of MM, (5) differentiation of epithelioid MM from various carcinomas (lung, breast, ovarian, and colonic adenocarcinomas, and squamous cell and renal cell carcinomas), (6) diagnosis of sarcomatoid mesothelioma, (7) use of molecular markers in the diagnosis of MM, (8) electron microscopy in the diagnosis of MM, and (9) some caveats and pitfalls in the diagnosis of MM. Immunohistochemical panels are integral to the diagnosis of MM, but the exact makeup of panels used is dependent on the differential diagnosis and on the antibodies available in a given laboratory. Immunohistochemical panels should contain both positive and negative markers. It is recommended that immunohistochemical markers have either sensitivity or specificity greater than 80% for the lesions in question. Interpretation of positivity generally should take into account the localization of the stain (eg, nuclear versus cytoplasmic) and the percentage of cells staining (> 10% is suggested for cytoplasmic membranous markers). These guidelines are meant to be a practical reference for the pathologist.

### Cutaneous spindle cell carcinoma following basal cell carcinoma [^1117CaxZ]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2005). Low credibility.

A spindle cell carcinoma arose three years after the seeming excision of a so-called "infiltrative" basal cell carcinoma (IBCC) in the cheek of an 87-year-old Japanese woman. The patent had no history of irradiation. The tumor was composed of short fascicles and whorling arrangements of spindle to polygonal cells without residual IBCC. Immunohistochemically, the tumor was positive for vimentin, cytokeratin 8 & 18, epithelial membrane antigen, and alpha-smooth muscle actin. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells had tonofilaments and desmosomes. The patient died after a local recurrence with metastatic lesions in the lung and the neck lymph nodes that were indicated by CT scanning and MRI at nine months after diagnosis. This case and others support the concept that spindle cell carcinoma can pursue an aggressive clinical course.

### An update on the pathological classification of breast cancer [^1132hgLp]. Histopathology (2023). Medium credibility.

ILC is often considered to be a single tumour type characterized by loss of function of the cell adhesion protein, E‐cadherin, with subsequent cell dyscohesion but comprises a spectrum of tumours with different histological features and clinical behaviour. The classical variant is the most common subtype, typically Nottingham grade 2, and shows a distinct clinical behaviour. Most of the data on the clinical behaviour of ILC are derived from this variant, with less available information on the clinical behaviour of other variants. The solid ILC variant is characterized by a solid growth pattern, shows high mitotic activity, and may be associated with aggressive clinical behaviour. The pleomorphic ILC variant is characterized by high‐grade cytological features and a poor prognosis, whereas the alveolar and tubulo‐lobular variants are characterized by a good prognosis. Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) comprises a heterogeneous group of tumours with a range of histological features and clinical behaviour, but is also sometimes considered by pathologists and clinicians to represent a single tumour type. MBC subtypes reflect variable differentiation pathways that are distinct from the adenocarcinoma differentiation pathways. Two main differentiation pathways are recognized in MBC: squamous and mesenchymal, the latter including spindle cell and matrix producing differentiation. MBC includes indolent low‐grade tumours such as fibromatosis‐like spindle cell MBC and low‐grade adenosquamous carcinoma and the aggressive high‐grade spindle cell MBC and high‐grade adenosquamous carcinoma. Intermediate nuclear grade (grade 2) spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma can rarely be encountered, and these tumours have intermediate risk between the fibromatosis like and the high‐grade spindle cell MBC. In practice, we observe two main types of MBC: (1) tumours with metaplastic and adenocarcinomatous components with morphological and/or biomarker overlap, considered as MBC regardless of the percentage of the tumour occupied by metaplastic elements. In these tumours, the adenocarcinomatous component are typically high grade and shows a triple‐negative phenotype and the transition between the two components is gradual, and (2) tumours with a distinct metaplastic component (e.g. spindle cell, matrix producing or squamous) that may coexist with IBC‐NST or another special type component. The second component (IBC‐NST or special type) in these tumours may show receptor positivity and there is a clear distinction between such a component and the metaplastic tumour component. Although not specified in the WHO book, these tumours can be regarded as pure MBC if the metaplastic component exceeds 90%, and as mixed metaplastic and NST tumours if the metaplastic component accounts for > 10% and < 90% of the tumour. In general, the presence of a high‐grade metaplastic element is associated with aggressive clinical behaviour and is likely to drive the behaviour of the mixed tumours regardless of percentage. Therefore, it is advised that the presence of high‐grade metaplastic component in mixed tumours to be stated even if it is a minor component.

### Disease-specific survival with spindle cell carcinoma of the head and neck [^11123DMe]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

(1) Determine factors influencing survival in patients diagnosed with spindle cell carcinoma (SpCC), a rare variant of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). (2) Compare survival of patients with SpCC to those with conventional SCC.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 database (years 2004–2009).

Subjects and Methods

Among patients receiving treatment for a single primary in the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx, 118 subjects with SpCC and 18,298 subjects with SCC were identified with complete data for the variables of age, sex, grade, tumor size, stage group, and TNM stage. Disease-specific survival curves were compared. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine the effects of each factor on survival over all sites and within each of 3 sites.

Results

Univariate analysis of the combination of the 3 anatomic subsites showed survival with SpCC was worse than with conventional SCC (P < .001). Three-year disease-specific survival with SpCC was 49.5%, and 5-year disease-specific survival was 40.2%. Compared with conventional SCC, survival was worse for SpCC of the oral cavity (P < .001) and oropharynx (P < .001) but no different for the larynx and hypopharynx site (P = 0.15). Multivariate analysis identified age (P = 0.02), tumor size (P = 0.006), and M stage (P < .001) as the only variables significantly affecting survival with SpCC. All variables significantly affected survival with conventional SCC.

Conclusions

Spindle cell carcinoma carries a worse prognosis than SCC. Larger tumor size, older age, and metastatic disease portend worse survival with SpCC of the head and neck.

### Spindle cell carcinoma of head and neck: an immunohistochemical and molecular approach to its pathogenesis [^112yyHv1]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Spindle cell carcinoma (SpCC) is a rare microscopic type of cancer of the mouth and oropharynx. Although SpCC is thought to arise from squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), it carries a worse prognosis.

Aim

To find out the difference in immunohistochemical expression of cytokeratin, vimentin and smooth-muscle actin, and mutational alterations in the K-ras oncogene between the two tumours, in an attempt to characterise SpCC.

Methods

Immunohistochemical analysis was performed by standard avidin-biotin complex method in 35 cases each of SpCCs and SCCs. DNA extracted from paraffin wax-embedded tumours was used for PCR followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism for mutational analysis of K-ras exon 1 and exon 2.

Results

In the SpCC group, cytokeratin positivity was significantly higher in epithelial areas (52.2%) than in spindle cell areas (16.1%), whereas vimentin was more positive in spindle cell areas (18.7%) than epithelial areas (2.7%). Cells intermediate between epithelial and spindle cell areas were consistently positive for both cytokeratin and vimentin. Cytokeratin was found to be significantly more positive in SCC (72.6%) than the squamous component and spindle cell component of SpCC. In this study, no mutation was detected in the K-ras gene of either the SpCC or SCC group.

Conclusions

The spindle cell component of SpCC is intermixed with cells that are morphologically mesenchymal but express dual antigen-positivity characteristic of epithelial (cytokeratin) and mesenchymal (vimentin) cells. These, possibly, are cells in transition suggesting that SpCC may be a sarcomatous metaplasia of SCC.

### Mild replication stress causes chromosome mis-segregation via premature centriole disengagement [^113UP96L]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Here we show that mild replication stress in non-cancerous cells provokes spindle architecture defects that are classically associated with chromosome gain/loss in cancer cells. Replication stress causes mis-segregation of entire or near-entire chromosomes via premature centriole disengagement and transient multipolar spindles. This disengagement depends on ATR, Cdk1 and Plk1 activity in G2, consistent with the idea that mild replication stress might deregulate the pathways controlling mitotic entry, resulting in an asynchrony between the DNA and the centrosome cycle. In addition, in a non-cancerous background mild replication stress may lead to higher microtubule stability, a condition that we find to favour premature centriole disengagement by itself. Replication-stress dependent premature centriole disengagement could be also observed in several CIN+ colorectal and breast cancer cell lines, implying that this mechanism may contribute to numerical aneuploidy in cancer tissues. Pre-cancerous lesions and cancer cells are frequently chromosomally instable, and chromosome gain or loss during mitosis is an important component of CIN, that results in numerical aneuploidy. Merotely due to spindle architecture defects or deregulated microtubule stability is the main mitotic dysfunction contributing to chromosome mis-segregation. The different sources of these phenotypes, are however unclear: while multipolar spindles due to supernumerary centrosomes can be observed in some cancer tissues, their frequency is insufficient to explain the prevalence of numerical CIN observed in many different tumours and precancerous lesions; mutations or deletions of mitotic genes that would explain the microtubule stability deregulation (e.g. microtubule depolymerases) are rare, most likely because these genes are essential at the cellular level. Here, we show in non-cancer and cancer cells that mild replication stress may be one of the unknown causes underlying multipolar spindles (Fig. 6c). Transient multipolarity due to centrosome overduplication has long been shown to induce lagging chromosomes in anaphase. Here we show that in RPE1 cells mild replication stress led to premature centriole disengagement in 20–25% of the cells (we suspect that the lower spatial resolution explains the lower rate seen in live cell imaging), and we found that transient multipolar spindles resulting from premature centriole disengagement lead to lagging DNA in 1/5 of the cases. This indicates that replication stress-induced premature centriole disengagement can lead to a chromosome mis-segregation rate that is comparable to the one seen in cancer cells (in the order of 5%), instead of the 0.5% found in RPE1 cells. Moreover, it suggests that many more cancer cells might form transient multipolar spindles than just the subset of cells with extra centrosomes, and that drugs targeting spindle pole clustering might have a broader range of applications as originally anticipated. In addition our data indicate that mild replication stress also led to microtubule stabilization in a non-cancerous background. We find that this increased microtubule stability itself contributes to premature centriole disengagement, but it is likely to lead to segregation errors on its own by preventing correction of merotely, as seen for Kif2a/MCAK depletion. Thus our results demonstrate how interphase stress can change mitotic parameters, illustrating how numerical CIN and structural CIN are in a complex relationship. Moreover, it provides a mechanism for the recent studies reporting that replication stress increases the incidence of whole lagging chromosomes.

### Clinical and pathologic predictors of recurrence and survival in spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma [^11713y9C]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine clinicopathologic predictors of recurrence and survival in patients with spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma (SpSCC).

Study Design

Historical cohort study.

Setting

Tertiary care hospital.

Subjects and Methods

Forty-eight patients (mean age, 65.2 years; 35 men, 13 women) who underwent definitive treatment for pathologically confirmed SpSCC between 1987 and 2009 were identified and reviewed. The main outcome measures were time to recurrence and overall survival, while controlling for clinical and pathologic parameters (age, sex, TNM classification, stage, tumor subsite, smoking status, treatment modality, margin status).

Results

Of 48 patients, there were 25 oral cavity, 15 laryngeal, 7 oropharyngeal, and 1 maxillary sinus tumors. Treatment included surgery in 32, radiation in 9, and concurrent chemoradiation in 7 patients. The 3-year overall survival for the cohort was 62% with a median follow-up of 59 months; 52.1% (25/48) of patients developed a recurrence, and 88% (22/25) recurred locally or locoregionally. Recurrence occurred within 2 years in 72% (18/25) of patients. Age, sex, initial T and N classification, overall stage, tumor subsite, smoking status, treatment modality, and margin status were not predictive of recurrence or overall survival.

Conclusion

Patients with SpSCC are at high risk of developing locoregional recurrence, but no measured clinical or pathologic parameter was predictive of survival. Although overall survival is similar to that of patients with conventional SCC, closer follow-up should be considered in these patients to allow earlier detection and treatment of these locally aggressive tumors.

### Spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma: a brief diagnostic review and differential diagnosis [^112oTUB3]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare variant of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma that has a predilection for young males and most commonly involves the paratesticular region followed by head and neck. Histopathology demonstrates elongated spindle cells with fusiform to cigar-shaped nuclei and indistinct eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in fascicles or whorls. Although the tumor demonstrates increased cellularity and moderate atypia, the microscopic and architectural patterns can allow this tumor to be confused with multiple entities, such as leiomyosarcoma, spindle cell carcinoma, desmoplastic melanoma, or fibrosarcoma, with important therapeutic implications. Immunohistochemical workup demonstrates sarcomeric differentiation with reactivity for desmin, myogenin, and MyoD1 markers. Compared with other subtypes, the spindle cell variant in children is associated with a favorable outcome; however, in the adult population there does not appear to be any prognostic advantage.

### Polysemous terms need context: a case of poorly differentiated spindle cell cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma [^114SD3B6]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our case study highlights the confusion that can occur when patients access their own pathology reports, especially if more than one interpretation is possible. Specifically in this case, the use of the term "sarcomatoid" to describe a poorly differentiated spindle cell cSCC, despite being linguistically correct (the suffix "oid" means "resembling" or "like"), caused significant anxiety in a patient who mistook the use of this terminology to mean that he had a more aggressive tumor with elements of true sarcoma. To alleviate this concern, multiple additional communications were required between the dermatology provider and patient.

The terms "sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma" or "sarcomatoid carcinoma" are commonly used in reference to cutaneous tumors in 2 primary scenarios: (1) as a descriptive term in the case of poorly differentiated cSCCs, which are predominately spindled, thus resembling a sarcoma by light microscopy, but which express epithelial markers by immunocytochemistry (such as in our patient, Fig 3); (2) in cases where the tumor is biphasic, exhibiting co-mingled epithelial and mesenchymal malignant elements. The prognosis in the first scenario is that of a poorly differentiated cSCC. The prognosis for the exceedingly rare and more aggressive second scenario is significantly worse and is generally considered to be poor regardless of the organ involved due to frequent metastasis and chemo-resistance. Such tumors have been variously termed sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, spindle cell carcinoma, and pleomorphic carcinoma.

### Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma: a review of histopathology and clinical and prognostic implications [^112RhZo5]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinomas are rare kidney tumors with generally indolent behavior. As the name suggests, classic histomorphology reveals bland spindle cells, tubules, and mucinous stroma. Uncommon histologic features include mucin-poor stroma, high nuclear grade, cellular pleomorphism, and presence of necrosis. Rare cases can show aggressive growth and distant metastasis. Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma has characteristic chromosomal abnormalities and the molecular signature remains the same, irrespective of the varied histomorphology.

### Long-term survival in a patient with pulmonary spindle cell carcinoma treated with traditional Chinese medicine [^112grzAV]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Spindle cell carcinoma (SCC) is a rare pulmonary malignancy, accounting for only 0.2%–0.3% of all lung cancers. Therefore, the prognosis and treatment of pulmonary SCC is unclear. There are only 13 reported cases in literature, only three of which had a survival of more than 11 months. Here we reported a long-term survival of a patient with pulmonary SCC who underwent treatment with traditional Chinese medicine. At the most recent follow-up in July 2018, her survival after diagnosis is 48 months and she continues to do well. To our knowledge, this is the longest survival of late stage SCC with the largest tumour burden.

### Long-term survival in a patient with pulmonary spindle cell carcinoma treated with traditional Chinese medicine [^113obr7h]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Spindle cell carcinoma (SCC) is a highly malignant pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma. There is no standard treatment for this disease, though chemotherapy, surgery and radiation therapy may be considered. Here we reported a 58-year-old woman diagnosed with pulmonary SCC who prolonged her survival with the treatment of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in China. Due to her overall weak state and financial hardships, she had chosen not to receive surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. TCM was the last option for this patient. After drinking Chinese herbal soup, her tumour has not only remained stable, but her general condition has also improved. To date, this is the longest survival with baseline quality of life of pulmonary SCC, reported in literature.

### Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast [^112fQxAo]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast is a rare but aggressive type of breast cancer that has been recognized as a unique pathologic entity by the World Health Organization. Morphologically, it is characterized by the differentiation of neoplastic epithelium into squamous cells and/or mesenchymal-looking elements (squamous cells, spindle cells, cartilage or bone, etc). It shares many similarities with invasive ductal carcinoma and benign lesions on mammography, which further complicates the diagnosis. Treatment for metaplastic breast carcinoma is relatively unknown because of the rarity of the disease, but studies suggest that removal of the tumor and adjuvant radiation therapy has the greatest benefit.

### Squamous cell carcinoma variants of the upper aerodigestive tract [^111EgUYN]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is by far the most common malignancy of the upper aerodigestive tract. Most conventional-type SCCs do not present the surgical pathologist with diagnostic difficulty. Certain variants, however, can histologically mimic benign and other malignant diseases. In such cases, correct diagnosis is important for prognostic and therapeutic reasons. This article discusses the clinicopathologic features of the upper aerodigestive tract variants of SCC, including verrucous carcinoma, papillary squamous cell carcinoma, basaloid squamous cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, adenoid squamous cell carcinoma, and undifferentiated carcinoma. It also discusses the differential diagnoses that must be considered and the use of ancillary testing, especially immunohistochemical analysis, for determining the correct diagnosis.

### Benign spindle cell lesions of the breast: a diagnostic approach to solitary fibrous tumour, nodular pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia and nodular fasciitis [^114LqmqM]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Benign spindle cell lesions of the breast include neoplastic and reactive entities that are diagnostically challenging given their rarity and similar histomorphology. Accurate diagnosis on percutaneous core biopsy within this category is essential as some lesions require excision and surveillance, whereas others may be observed. We present three cases of rare benign spindle cell lesions of the breast that reflect the diversity of this group: solitary fibrous tumour, nodular pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia and nodular fasciitis. Through these cases, we discuss the associated differential diagnosis and demonstrate how emerging ancillary studies can be integrated into a diagnostic approach. We highlight distinctive clinical and histopathological features and summarise recent updates to the clinical management of these lesions. An organised approach to the broad differential of spindle cell lesions is essential for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

### Spindle cell morphology is related to poor prognosis in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma [^112fJ13a]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate vulvar spindle cell morphology in a large group of patients with VSCC. Spindle cell morphology occurred frequently in our series and was found in 20% of the VSCCs examined. Carcinoma with spindle cell morphology has not been reported as a separate entity in vulvar cancer before this report. A spray pattern of invasion, which also includes spindle cell morphology, has been reported in a few papers and was found in 11 out of 26 VSCCs by. In the latter study, which was relatively small, a spray pattern of invasion was significantly associated with poor survival after correction for FIGO stage alone.

Our study of a large cohort of VSCC patients shows that patients with spindle cell morphology have a worse prognosis than patients with conventional squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva. The disease-specific and overall survival was almost half that of non-spindle squamous cell carcinoma patients. After correcting for multiple possible confounders, vulvar spindle cell morphology remains an independent prognostic factor. None of the patients with spindle cell morphology showed HPV infection, strongly suggesting that these tumours arise through the non-HPV pathway.

The vulvar spindle cell morphology patients reported having symptoms for a similar length of time before diagnosis than non-spindle cell patients, but VSCC patients presented with higher FIGO stages, possibly because of the aggressive character of spindle cells and the rapid progression of this type of tumour.

Although this series is the largest reported in the literature, the number of patients in this study is still too small to correct for all potential confounders. However, even after correcting for multiple tumour characteristics that are likely to be part of the causal path (tumour size, infiltration depth, positive resection margins, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis), vulvar spindle cell morphology patients had a hazard ratio for disease-specific death of 4.14 (95% CI 1.61–10.60) relative to non-spindle cell patients, suggesting that the poor prognosis of these patients is associated with spindle cell morphology and is independent of other tumour characteristics. Caution has to be taken when interpreting multivariate analysis in small cohorts of patients. Given the distinct differences in survival, we suggest that this retrospective study be replicated at other large institutions to determine the added prognostic value of spindle cell morphology in a prognostic model.

### A diagnostically challenging spindle cell carcinoma of the neck: treatment with mohs micrographic surgery and clinical course [^112WZd2v]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case description

An immunocompetent 74-year-old woman with a history of basal cell carcinoma presented to her dermatologist with a painful "marble-sized" tumor on the left lateral side of the neck for several weeks. Concerned about hardware contamination from spinal surgery a month before, her orthopedic surgeon cautioned against a biopsy. The tumor was treated twice during a 2-month period with cryotherapy, but it more than tripled in size. Subsequent biopsy revealed a spindle cell tumor proliferation with immunohistochemistry negative for SOX10, AE1/AE3, CK5/6, HMB-45, Melan-A, S-100, and desmin. CD31 and CD34 highlighted background blood vessels only. Smooth muscle actin was focally positive. The tumor was diagnosed as a "pseudotumor" or "low-grade" spindle cell sarcoma, which prompted a referral for Mohs micrographic surgery. Our working clinical diagnosis was a sarcomatoid dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans or spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma. Given our success with Mohs micrographic surgery as a curative treatment for these tumors, combined with the obscure pathology, we proceeded with Mohs micrographic surgery to remove the 3.5 × 3.0-cm ulcerated mass (Fig 1). There was no palpable lymphadenopathy on examination.

Fig 1
A painful, rapidly growing, 3.5 × 3.0-cm tumor that had been present for 3 months on the left lateral side of the neck.

Histologically tumor-free margins were obtained after 2 stages of Mohs micrographic surgery. Fascicles of atypical spindled cells were noted within subcutaneous fat and skeletal muscle on frozen histopathologic sections (Fig 2). The surgical wound measured 5.4 × 4.8 cm and extended around major neck vasculature and nerves, which were carefully dissected (Fig 3). The surgical defect was repaired with a Mercedes advancement flap. Frozen sections obtained during Mohs micrographic surgery were sent for pathologic consultation. In comparison with those in the original biopsy, the spindle cells appeared more cellular and atypical, and were thought to represent a fibrosarcoma or dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.

### A rare presentation of orbital spindle cell carcinoma a case report and brief review of the literature [^116GDzcd]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Spindle cell carcinomas are considered a rare variant of SCC, with a predilection for the upper respiratory and digestive tracts. Most studies have found a high male preponderance, and have suggested that spindle cell carcinomas behave more aggressively than their SCC counterparts. However, other studies have suggested that tumor behavior and metastatic potential depend on the site of origin. In addition, overall prognosis is often poor.

Most primary spindle cell carcinomas of the periocular region arise from the conjunctiva. There have been very few reports of spindle cell carcinoma of the orbit. Moreover, all known cases have been either distant metastases of other primary sources or secondary to regional spread from paranasal sinuses. To the best of our knowledge, there have been only a few reports of primary spindle cell carcinomas arising in the orbit. Also, there have been few reports of primary orbital SCC, some of which have occurred following retinal surgery. This has led some others to hypothesize that these lesions arise as a result of implantation of conjunctival epithelial cells, with subsequent malignant degenerations.

Some studies have suggested that spindle cell carcinomas either arise as a result of mesenchymal transformation of carcinoma cells or originate from a single pluripotent stem cell that differentiates into epithelial and mesenchymal components. Since the orbit is known to harbor a population of these pluripotent stem cells, one could postulate that primary spindle cell carcinomas of the orbit might originate as a result of malignant degeneration of these stem cells into epithelial and mesenchymal components.

Very little is known about the clinical behavior of primary SCC of the orbit, and almost nothing is known about primary orbital spindle cell carcinomas. In addition, the optimal management strategy is also not described due to the small number of reported cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the one of few known case of primary orbital spindle cell carcinoma. This case is also unique since it describes an atypical presentation of an orbital tumor with limbal ischemia and exudative retinal detachment.

To the date, we did not found any specific mechanism that may relate limbal ischemia to the spindle cell carcinoma. Further cases reports, however, are needed to describe the different clinical presentations and management strategies of this rare clinical entity.

### Perianal cutaneous spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma with myxoid stroma: case report and literature review [^115Fm52t]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma with myxoid stroma is a rare variant of squamous cell carcinoma with sarcomatoid morphology. We report a case of a 75-year-old woman with an ulcerated polypoid cutaneous mass in the perianal area. The patient had a history of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Microscopy revealed an invasive myxoid spindle cell carcinoma without the classic squamous cell carcinoma component. The immunohistochemical study demonstrated diffuse positive reactions for p63, AE1/3, and CK5/6. The tumor cells were negative for desmin, smooth muscle actin, S100, and CD34. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was negative for EWSR1 gene rearrangement. Follow-up was remarkable for recurrence of tumor in 2 months after complete resection with negative surgical margin. This is the first case report of perianal spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma with myxoid stroma with a literature review of previous case reports from different locations.

### Loss of heterozygosity in clonal evolution with genetic progression and divergence in spindle cell carcinoma of the gallbladder [^114Z9GYa]. Human Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Spindle cell carcinoma (SpCC) of the gallbladder is a rare neoplasm that shows carcinoma with a variable component of sarcomatoid spindle cells. The clinical and pathological features of this neoplasm have been well documented, but the histogenesis has long been a matter of speculation. In an attempt to clarify the clonality and genetic relationships involved in the evolution of this neoplasm, we microdissected a total of 18 carcinomatous and sarcomatous foci from 2 gallbladder SpCCs and analyzed the allelic status with 42 microsatellite markers on chromosomal arms 1p, 1q, 3p, 4q, 5q, 6q, 8p, 9p, 10q, 11p, 11q, 13q, 16q, 17p, 17q, 18q, and 22q. The 2 cases examined had a polypoid tumor in the gallbladder, in which both adenocarcinomatous and sarcomatoid spindle cell components were identified histologically. In both SpCCs, homogenous allelic losses were identified in both the carcinomatous and sarcomatous components; 17p, 18q, and 5q in case 1 and 17p and 11q in case 2. These indicated that both SpCCs had a single clonal origin. In case 1, additional loss of heterozygosity (LOH; 6q) consisting of genetic progression occurred in both the carcinomatous and sarcomatoid components. In case 2, there was additional LOH (9p) in the carcinomatous components and additional microsatellite instability at D5S644 in both the carcinomatous and sarcomatoid components, indicating a monoclonal neoplasm with genetic progression and divergence. In the 2 cases, the genetic changes indicated that an original clone of a pure adenocarcinoma apparently acquired sarcomatoid spindle cell phenotype by successive genetic changes. On the other hand, we saw no evidence of tumors in which a sarcomatoid spindle cell appeared to give rise to a carcinomatous subclone in the examined cases. In conclusion, the current study includes the first LOH analyses of SpCC of the gallbladder. Our data support the concept that gallbladder SpCC is derived from a single clone originating from a carcinoma. Furthermore, we showed genetic heterogeneity accompanying the phenotypic divergence, with patterns of genetic alterations that are consistent with both the progression and divergence within the individual tumors.

### Spindle cell sarcomatoid tumour of the trachea: a rare primary malignant tumour [^116YXN2q]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Spindle cell carcinoma is a subtype of sarcomatoid carcinoma, which has previously been described in various anatomical locations, though rarely in the trachea. We present the case of a woman in her 70s who presented with a sore throat and stridor. Fibreoptic nasendoscopy demonstrated a tracheal mass occupying 80% of the airway from the cricoid cartilage to the third tracheal ring, infiltrating the thyroid gland. Subsequent CT demonstrated pulmonary emboli and vertebral metastasis. Biopsy of the infiltrated thyroid confirmed the diagnosis of spindle cell carcinoma. The length of the tumour and metastasis at presentation made this surgically unresectable, and she was referred for a palliative stent but died after an acute deterioration. This pathology has been reported only five times previously in the literature, with management strategies varying greatly between patients. Primary tracheal tumours are difficult to manage as, due to their rarity, there are no clear guidelines.

### Proteins required for centrosome clustering in cancer cells [^116USj15]. Science Translational Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Current cancer chemotherapies are limited by the lack of tumor-specific targets, which would allow for selective eradication of malignant cells without affecting healthy tissues. In contrast to normal cells, most tumor cells contain multiple centrosomes, which tend to cause the formation of multipolar mitotic spindles, chromosome segregation defects, and cell death. Nevertheless, many cancer cells divide successfully because they can cluster multiple centrosomes into two spindle poles. Inhibition of this centrosomal clustering, with consequent induction of multipolar spindles and subsequent cell death, would specifically target cancer cells and overcome one limitation of current cancer treatments. We have performed a genome-wide RNA interference screen to identify proteins involved in the prevention of spindle multipolarity in human cancer cells with supernumerary centrosomes. The chromosomal passenger complex, Ndc80 microtubule-kinetochore attachment complex, sister chromatid cohesion, and microtubule formation via the augmin complex were identified as necessary for centrosomal clustering. We show that spindle tension is required to cluster multiple centrosomes into a bipolar spindle array in tumor cells with extra centrosomes. These findings may explain the specificity of drugs that interfere with spindle tension for cancer cells and provide entry points for the development of therapeutics.

### Guidelines for pathologic diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma 2017 update of the consensus statement from the international mesothelioma interest group [^115urozD]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Context

- Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an uncommon tumor that can be difficult to diagnose.

Objective

- To provide updated, practical guidelines for the pathologic diagnosis of MM.

Data Sources

- Pathologists involved in the International Mesothelioma Interest Group and others with an interest and expertise in the field contributed to this update. Reference material included up-to-date, peer-reviewed publications and textbooks.

Conclusions

- There was discussion and consensus opinion regarding guidelines for (1) distinguishing benign from malignant mesothelial proliferations (both epithelioid and spindle cell lesions), (2) cytologic diagnosis of MM, (3) recognition of the key histologic features of pleural and peritoneal MM, (4) use of histochemical and immunohistochemical stains in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of MM, (5) differentiating epithelioid MM from various carcinomas (lung, breast, ovarian, and colonic adenocarcinomas, and squamous cell and renal cell carcinomas), (6) diagnosis of sarcomatoid MM, (7) use of molecular markers in the diagnosis of MM, (8) electron microscopy in the diagnosis of MM, and (9) some caveats and pitfalls in the diagnosis of MM. Immunohistochemical panels are integral to the diagnosis of MM, but the exact makeup of panels employed is dependent on the differential diagnosis and on the antibodies available in a given laboratory. Depending on the morphology, immunohistochemical panels should contain both positive and negative markers for mesothelial differentiation and for lesions considered in the differential diagnosis. Immunohistochemical markers should have either sensitivity or specificity greater than 80% for the lesions in question. Interpretation of positivity generally should take into account the localization of the stain (eg, nuclear versus cytoplasmic) and the percentage of cells staining (> 10% is suggested for cytoplasmic and membranous markers). Selected molecular markers are now being used to distinguish benign from malignant mesothelial proliferations. These guidelines are meant to be a practical diagnostic reference for the pathologist; however, some new pathologic predictors of prognosis and response to therapy are also included.

### Spindle cell morphology is related to poor prognosis in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma [^116Ugrut]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

A specific histological type of squamous cell carcinoma, termed spindle cell carcinoma, is seen occasionally. Spindle cell carcinoma is also referred to as pseudosarcoma or carcinosarcoma. Spindle cells are thin, slender, elongated cancer cells that infiltrate stromal tissue and that occur either as single cells or as cords of cells rather than as groups or islands (Figure 1). Spindle cell carcinoma is seen in many different types of cancer and is associated with a worse prognosis in cancers of the oral cavity, oesophagus and lung. Spindle-shaped epithelial cancer cells have lost their typical epithelial characteristics and seem to gain the ability to infiltrate the underlying stroma and metastasize.

Spindle cell carcinomas consisting of spindle cells alone have been reported only incidentally in vulvar carcinoma, and it is thought to be an aggressive tumour type that occurs in 1–5% of all VSCC patients. Some VSCCs show a specific pattern of invasion in which there is infiltration of the stroma by single cells or cords of tumour cells adjacent to the 'conventional' squamous cell carcinoma cells. This pattern is also called 'spray pattern invasion'. This spray pattern invasion is seen more often than the rare vulvar spindle cell carcinoma and has been described before. A subpopulation of these vulvar carcinomas with a spray pattern of invasion clearly shows areas of infiltrating cells that resemble spindle cell carcinoma. We suggest that these tumours be termed 'vulvar squamous cell carcinomas with spindle cell morphology' and describe the criteria used to characterise these tumours in the Materials and Methods section. The characteristics of tumours with this pattern of invasion and their association with survival have, to our knowledge, not been studied in a large cohort of patients. We hypothesize that tumours with spindle cell morphology, that is, tumours consisting of both 'conventional' squamous cell carcinoma cells and spindle cells, may share some of the aetiology and clinical behaviour with the aggressive spindle cell carcinomas. We considered whether spindle cell morphology is a possible risk factor and studied its prevalence and possible relation with prognosis.

### Spindle cell sarcomatoid carcinoma of the trachea: first case report of surgical resection [^111kgaXc]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Primary tracheal tumors are rare, with malignancy occurring at a rate of 0.1 new cases per 100,000 every year, corresponding to 0.2% of all tumors involving the respiratory tract. Primary tracheal cancers are more common in current or former male cigarette smokers, with peak incidence in the sixth decade of life. Due to the central location and tendency to protrude into the lumen of the large airways, patients typically present with symptoms of dry cough, hemoptysis, progressive dyspnea, hoarseness, and fevers secondary to recurrent pneumonia, often leading to misdiagnosis of asthma or chronic pulmonary disease. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) make up nearly two thirds of primary tracheal cases. Tracheal tumors apart from these are extremely uncommon and consist of a heterogeneous group of benign and malignant tumors, with only one other reported case of primary tracheal spindle cell carcinomas to date.

Spindle cell carcinoma belongs to a group of poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinomas known as sarcomatoid carcinomas. According to the World Health Organization 2004 classifications of lung tumors, this group contains components of sarcoma or sarcoma-like (spindle cell or giant cell) differentiation, consisting of only spindle shaped cells that form cohesive nests and irregular fascicles of malignant cells with features including nuclear hyperchromasia and distinct nucleoli. These tumor masses include scattered and focally dense regions of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates throughout.

Due to the rarity of these tracheal cases, there is often a delay in diagnosis and inappropriate treatment approaches. Additionally, no universally accepted TNM classification for tracheal malignancies exists, and proposed staging systems are based on a small number of considered cases. Generally, tracheal carcinomas have poor prognosis, with 5-year survival rates of up to 15% and 10-year survival rates of 7%. On the other hand, the spindle cell group of carcinomas are described to be aggressive and thought to have worse clinical outcomes than conventional non-small cell carcinomas. Five-year survival rates are only 20% despite many patients presenting with stage I disease. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation do not seem to play a helpful role in treatment of spindle cell type tumors, and thus resection remains the mainstay of tumor eradication. Here we report a case of a former smoker presenting with progressive dyspnea, discovered to have primary tracheal spindle cell sarcomatoid carcinoma treated definitively with surgical resection.

### Early and exceptional response to immunotherapy in metastatic spindle cell carcinoma of the tongue [^116vTqt4]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Sarcomatoid carcinoma is also known as spindle cell carcinoma. It is a rare biphasic tumour and an aggressive variant of squamous cell carcinoma. An accurate diagnosis of this rare variant of squamous cell carcinoma is crucial due to its aggressive behaviour and potential for early metastasis. We present a unique case of a female patient in her 60s with advanced sarcomatoid carcinoma of the tongue, characterised by an atypical clinical course and an exceptional response to immunotherapy, aiming to raise awareness of this rare malignancy and its treatment.

### Best practices in diagnostic immunohistochemistry: pleomorphic cutaneous spindle cell tumors [^116UsJg6]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Pleomorphic cutaneous spindle cell tumors can be difficult to distinguish solely on histologic grounds. The use of ancillary immunohistochemical studies can greatly assist in this differential diagnosis.

Objective

To review histologic and immunohistochemical aspects of cutaneous spindle cell tumors and discuss a basic panel of markers to assist in the differential diagnosis.

Data Sources

English-language literature published between 1981 and 2005.

Conclusions

A basic immunohistochemistry panel for high-molecular-weight cytokeratin, melanocytic markers (S100 protein, HMB-45, Melan-A), smooth muscle actin, desmin, and endothelial markers (CD31, CD34) is effective in diagnosing most cutaneous spindle cell tumors.

### A diagnostically challenging spindle cell carcinoma of the neck: treatment with mohs micrographic surgery and clinical course [^116gQpNa]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although immunohistochemical stains are often useful in differentiating cutaneous spindle cell tumors, special stains may be insufficient. The immunostaining studies showed negative staining results for SOX-10, CD34, desmin, intratumoral CD31, AE1/AE3, and CK5/6, which are typical markers in desmoplastic melanoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, myofibrosarcoma, cutaneous angiosarcoma, and spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. Although these results were inconclusive, the tumor's rapid growth and our patient's pain prompted expedient surgical intervention and subsequent metastatic evaluation. Her marked clinical response to pembrolizumab, a checkpoint protein antibody approved for nonresectable metastatic melanoma, made spindle cell melanoma the leading differential diagnosis.

Despite thorough evaluations, ambiguous diagnoses and diagnostic challenges exist. Reaching a definitive diagnosis before surgery is not always feasible, given the inherent delays in tissue testing and the necessity at times for clinical action. In hindsight, although Mohs micrographic surgery did not provide the intended cure, it debulked a rapidly growing tumor, offered immediate pain relief, secured additional tissue for histopathologic examination, and established a more definitive course of action. This scenario may be encountered during rare Mohs micrographic surgery cases in which the infiltrative growth of squamous cell carcinomas or other spindle cell neoplasms (eg, atypical fibroxanthoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans), and in some unfortunate instances aggressive basal cell carcinomas, cannot be appreciated beforehand.

In most academic or university settings, presentation of diagnostic and management conundrums at multidisciplinary tumor boards is particularly beneficial for collaborative learning and therapeutic guidance. A recent report highlighted the benefits of such a multidisciplinary approach in dermatologic surgery, but it also noted the practical difficulties in gathering the numerous specialists, which can be particularly challenging for private-practice clinicians. Our patient would have benefitted from tumor board discussion, in which evaluation and treatment could have initially been guided by numerous informed subspecialists. Furthermore, our intention was to minimize morbidity and maximize cost-effectiveness by performing Mohs micrographic surgery, given the information we had at patient presentation. In retrospect, although Mohs micrographic surgery was not curative, it was used to facilitate the patient's subsequent evaluation and treatment.

Our case demonstrates that expedient interdisciplinary care and an oncologic evaluation for extracutaneous involvement for aggressive, diagnostically challenging cutaneous spindle cell carcinomas may be a reasonable approach despite ostensibly clear margins involving Mohs micrographic surgery.

### Spindle cell sarcomatoid carcinoma of the trachea: first case report of surgical resection [^113UbA5W]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Surgical management is well established as the definitive treatment for primary tracheal tumors. Resectability of these tumors depends most on locoregional disease characteristics over distant characteristics and is associated with survival superior to palliative therapy, especially when complete resection with negative margins is achieved. The role for adjuvant therapy with chemotherapy or radiation is variable and most recommendations are based on retrospective analysis for non-specific squamous cell histology-associated outcomes and/or for cases where there is advanced disease, other than R0 resection, unresectable tumors or when the patient is not a surgical candidate. Among patients with tracheal tumors, survival in those undergoing complete resections is significantly longer than those undergoing alternative modalities of treatment, although the rarity of these tumors and complexity in selecting treatment options has allowed for limited analysis of outcomes.

In the first reported case of primary tracheal spindle cell carcinoma, cisplatin-based chemotherapy with radiation was the treatment chosen by patient preference, however, the regimen was not completed due to patient death within five months of diagnosis. In our case, a complete tracheal sleeve resection was performed, with anastomosis of the regions above and below the resected region (Figs. 2 and 3). Resection alone has thus far proved to be effective in management of this rare case, as the patient has been without complications throughout his postoperative period. Further follow up will be needed to assess the long-term success of this treatment option.

### Spindle cell carcinoma in maxilla [^113Lk7Vh]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Spindle cell carcinomas (sarcomatoid carcinomas) are rare tumours. It is a variant of squamous cell carcinoma which has spindled tumour cells, which simulate a true sarcoma, but are epithelial in origin. They are extremely uncommon in the head and neck region. Only five cases with maxillary origin have been discussed in the literature. As compared to squamous cell carcinoma of maxilla, this variant is associated with poor diagnosis and advanced disease at presentation, as is demonstrated in the case presented. There are no standard recommendations for management owing to the rarity of this histology. Surgery and radiotherapy form the mainstays of treatment. We report a rare case of spindle cell carcinoma involving the maxilla.

### Prognostic factors in metaplastic carcinoma of the breast: a multi-institutional study [^113ZF4JX]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a rare type of breast cancer that has basal-like characteristics and is perceived to have poorer prognosis when compared with conventional no specific type/ductal carcinomas (ductal/NST). However, current data on MBC are largely derived from small case series or population-based reports. This study aimed to assess the clinicopathological features and outcome of MBC identified through an international multicentre collaboration.

Methods

A large international multicentre series of MBC (no = 405) with histological confirmation and follow-up information has been included in this study. The prognostic value of different variables and outcome has been assessed and compared with grade, nodal status and ER/HER2 receptor-matched ductal/NST breast carcinoma.

Results

The outcome of MBC diagnosed in Asian countries was more favourable than those in Western countries. The outcome of MBC is not different from matched ductal/NST carcinoma but the performance of the established prognostic variables in MBC is different. Lymph node stage, lymphovascular invasion and histologic subtype are associated with outcome but tumour size and grade are not. Chemotherapy was associated with longer survival, although this effect was limited to early-stage disease. In this study no association between radiotherapy and outcome was identified. Multivariate analysis of MBC shows that histologic subtype is an independent prognostic feature.

Conclusions

This study suggests that MBC is a heterogeneous disease. Although the outcome of MBC is not different to matched conventional ductal/NST breast carcinoma, its behaviour is dependent on the particular subtype with spindle cell carcinoma in particular has an aggressive biological behaviour. Management of patients with MBC should be based on validated prognostic variables.

### Proteomic profiling identifies novel diagnostic biomarkers and molecular subtypes for mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma of the kidney [^114UJZsV]. The Journal of Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma (MTSCC) of the kidney is a relatively rare renal epithelial neoplasm characterized by tubular formations merging with bland spindle cells and a myxoid stroma, which was first recognized as a distinct entity in the 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) tumor classification as well as in the newly revised 4th edition published in 2016. It occurs more frequently in females, with a female‐to‐male ratio of 3–4:1. Most tumors have an indolent clinical behavior; a small but distinct subset with high‐grade transformation (mainly sarcomatoid differentiation) may show distant metastasis and can be fatal. There is a lack of comprehensive understanding of this cancer because of its rare occurrence (only about 100 cases reported in the English language literature).

The main differential diagnostic consideration for MTSCC is type 1 papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC), particularly the solid variant, which has predominantly solid or tubular architectural patterns or contains low‐grade spindle cell areas. Immunohistochemical profiles of these two types of tumors also show significant overlap, with a majority of cases exhibiting immunoreactivity to CK7, AMACR, and EMA. Therefore, it remains unclear whether MTSCC is molecularly distinct from PRCC variants and how pathologists should practically manage those cases with overlapping histologic features.

### High-risk lesions of the breast: concurrent diagnostic tools and management recommendations [^111ebAtR]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Bland-looking spindle cell lesions

Bland-looking spindle cell lesions encompass a heterogenous group of tumor-like and tumor entities, ranging from benign reactive to low-grade malignant neoplasms with metastatic potential. The more common spindle cell lesions encountered in the breast are spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma, which is a malignant lesion; myofibroblastoma, pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH), and fibromatosis, which are benign lesions; and phyllodes tumor, which is consider histologically a B3 lesion. As for the differential diagnosis of spindle cell lesions, these lesions show considerable morphologic and immunophenotypic overlap. As such, definitive classification of a spindle cell lesion may not be possible with the limited sampling of a CNB where defining histologic features may not be present. A targeted immunohistochemical panel is frequently needed to fully evaluate and classify spindle cell lesions of the breast. For the purpose of this review which focuses on B3 lesions, we will go into details for only phyllodes tumors.

### Spindle and cuboidal renal cell carcinoma, a tumour having frequent association with nephrolithiasis: report of 11 cases including a case with hybrid conventional renal cell carcinoma / spindle and cuboidal renal cell carcinoma components [^111wHp3Q]. Histopathology (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

We present the largest series of an unclassified subtype of renal cell carcinoma, which seems to be a distinct morphological entity and which is sometimes designated as spindle and cuboidal renal cell carcinoma.

Methods and Results

Eleven cases of spindle and cuboidal renal cell carcinoma were found among 7000 primary renal cell tumours in Pilsen's routine and consultation files. The patients were five men and six women. They ranged in age from 22 to 65 years (mean 56.8). Microscopically, the tumours were composed of two main populations of cells. First, the preponderant type of cells was formed by flattened, spindle cells with sparse cytoplasm. The second cell type was a small cuboidal cell with clear to light eosinophilic cytoplasm. Spindle-shaped cells were arranged in a fascicular pattern often reminiscent of low-grade smooth muscle tumours. Solid areas of spindle cells were also present. Small cuboidal cells formed sparse tubular structures lined by a row of single cells. In addition to all previous published cases of spindle and cuboidal renal cell carcinoma we observed an association of nephrolithiasis in our cases. It was seen in 3/11 of our patients. A previously unreported feature is the occurrence of a conventional renal cell carcinoma component in one of our cases. Seven of our patients are currently well without signs of recurrence or metastasis, one had metastasis in a regional lymph node at the time of nephrectomy, one died of an unrelated condition, and two were lost to follow-up.

Conclusions

We present 11 cases of spindle and cuboidal renal cell carcinoma, which is believed to be a distinctive morphological entity. Our cases were histologically, immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally similar to the previously reported cases of spindle and cuboidal renal cell carcinoma. In contrast to all previously reported cases of spindle and cuboidal renal cell carcinoma, we observed an association with nephrolithiasis in three of our cases; moreover, one of our tumours had a conventional renal cell carcinoma component and another revealed a metastatic focus in a regional lymph node. None of our patients died of the disease. This study confirms that spindle and cuboidal renal cell carcinoma has a low malignant potential.

### Spindle cell lesions of the breast: a diagnostic algorithm [^117XVi4Y]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Context —

Spindle cell lesions of the breast represent a broad spectrum of entities, ranging from nonneoplastic reactive conditions to high-grade malignant tumors. The wide range makes breast spindle cell lesions a diagnostic pitfall.

Objective —

To review the classification of spindle cell lesions of the breast, including clinical features, morphologic characteristics, and the role of immunohistochemistry as well as molecular tools in assisting the differential diagnosis. A diagnostic algorithm will be proposed.

Data Sources —

Literature and personal experience are the sources for this study.

Conclusions —

Spindle cell lesions of the breast can be classified as biphasic or monophasic, with the former including both spindle cell and epithelial components, and the latter including only spindle cell elements. Each category is further subclassified as low or high grade. In the biphasic low-grade group, fibroadenoma and benign phyllodes tumor are the most common lesions. Other uncommon lesions include hamartoma, adenomyoepithelioma, and pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia. In the biphasic high-grade group, borderline/malignant phyllodes tumor and biphasic metaplastic carcinoma are the main lesions to consider. In the monophasic low-grade group, reactive spindle cell nodule, nodular fasciitis, myofibroblastoma, fibromatosis, and fibromatosis-like metaplastic carcinoma have to be considered. In the monophasic high-grade group, the possible lesions are monophasic spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma, primary breast sarcoma, and metastases. Awareness of the clinical history and careful evaluation of any epithelial differentiation (with a large immunohistochemical panel) are crucial in the distinction.

### Spindle cell and pleomorphic ("sarcomatoid") carcinomas of the lung: an immunohistochemical analysis of 86 cases [^112A1teL]. Human Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Spindle cell and pleomorphic carcinomas are currently grouped among sarcomatoid carcinomas of the lung. Because of their unusual occurrence, these tumors have not been properly assessed by immunohistochemistry. We performed a comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis of 86 of these tumors. Seventy-four pleomorphic carcinomas (57 with differentiated elements) and 12 spindle cell carcinomas were subjected to immunohistochemistry with CAM5.2, cytokeratin (CK) 7, thyroid transcription factor 1, napsin A, CK5/6, p40, desmocollin 3, Sox2, calretinin, and D2–40. The percentage of positive tumor cells as well as the staining intensity were evaluated and scored. The spindle/giant elements were positive for CAM5.2 (93%), CK7 (79%), thyroid transcription factor 1 (41%), napsin A (20%), calretinin (20%), Sox2 (13%), CK5/6 (9%), p40 (8%), D2–40 (6%), and desmocollin 3 (3%). Of 29 cases in which immunohistochemistry was performed on spindle/giant cell and corresponding differentiated elements, 21 (72%) showed a consistent staining pattern in both components, whereas in 8 cases (28%), the immunophenotype in the spindle/giant cells was less lineage-specific than in the differentiated component. Therefore, we consider that 42% of neoplasms otherwise classified as sarcomatoid carcinoma can be reclassified as adenocarcinoma and 14% as squamous cell carcinoma, while the remaining 44% failed to show a more specific immunophenotype. The use of a comprehensive immunohistochemical panel allows reclassification of the majority of sarcomatoid carcinomas as poorly differentiated variants of adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Such reclassification will facilitate clinical management and allow molecular testing and pursuit of targeted treatment strategies. Application of immunohistochemistry should become the standard in the workup of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas.

### Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma with aggressive histomorphology – a sarcomatoid variant [^115XNMAC]. Human Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma (MTSCC) is a recently described renal epithelial tumor. The bland cytomorphology of the spindled component and low-grade behavior help in its differentiation from sarcomatoid renal carcinoma. Sarcomatoid change has been reported in most histologic variants of renal cell carcinoma apart from MTSCC. Herein we report a case of an MTSCC in a 72-year-old female patient with high-grade spindled areas resembling fibrosarcomatous and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma patterns with metaplastic bone. This index case also demonstrates a high proliferation index and extensive necrosis representing the first documented case of sarcomatoid change in MTSCC.

### Proteomic profiling identifies novel diagnostic biomarkers and molecular subtypes for mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma of the kidney [^114Wd4Mj]. The Journal of Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma (MTSCC) is a relatively rare renal epithelial neoplasm resembling type 1 papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) morphologically and immunohistochemically. The accurate diagnosis of MTSCC remains a challenge. Here, by using proteomic profiling, we characterized MTSCC and PRCC to identify diagnostic biomarkers. We found that the MTSCC tumor proteome was significantly enriched in B‐cell‐mediated immunity when compared with the proteome of adjacent normal tissues of MTSCC or tumors of PRCC. Importantly, we identified MZB1, VCAN, and SOSTDC1 as diagnostic biomarkers to distinguish MTSCC from the solid variant of type 1 PRCC, with an AUC of 0.985 when combined. MZB1 was inversely correlated with tumor clinical stage and may play an anti‐tumor role by activating the complement system. Finally, unsupervised clustering revealed two molecular subtypes of MTSCC, displaying different morphology, expression signatures of oxidative phosphorylation, and aggravation. In summary, our analyses identified a three‐protein diagnostic panel and molecular subtypes for MTSCC. © 2022 The Authors.

### Outcomes and molecular profiles in sarcomatoid carcinoma of unknown primary: the mayo clinic experience [^114R4MMT]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sarcomatoid carcinomas (SC) represent a distinctive group of uncommon tumors with mixed histological features of carcinomas and sarcomas. These spindle cell malignancies arise either adjacent to morphologically recognizable carcinomas or in local recurrences or distant metastases from previously documented conventional carcinomas. Historically, terms such as "carcinosarcoma", "metaplastic carcinoma", and "spindle cell carcinoma" have been used interchangeably; however, "sarcomatoid carcinoma" is preferred to emphasize the epithelial nature of these tumors.

SCs have been identified in virtually every organ susceptible to carcinoma development. Regardless of their origin, SCs exhibit aggressive behavior, poor survival, higher tumor programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and an immune-inflamed tumor microenvironment. In the United States, the incidence rate of SC is ~1.26 per 100 000 people per year. When extensive diagnostic efforts fail to identify the primary tumor site, these lesions are diagnosed as "sarcomatoid carcinoma of unknown primary" (SCUP), an exceedingly rare occurrence, with only a handful of cases documented in the literature.

The mechanisms behind the evolution and progression of SCs remain largely unknown, with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) being the most widely accepted theory. EMT involves the gradual acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype by epithelial cells, resulting in sarcomatoid morphology and often weak expression of epithelial markers such as keratins.EMT is typically associated with metastasis, resistance to traditional chemotherapy, and a generally poor prognosis in cancer.

Despite existing research on this uncommon histological pattern, significant gaps remain in understanding SCUP. Furthermore, the absence of clear guidelines complicates effective management, adversely impacting patient outcomes. This study aims to address these gaps by providing a thorough analysis of SCUP cases diagnosed and treated at Mayo Clinic Rochester.

### Polysemous terms need context: a case of poorly differentiated spindle cell cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma [^115o3mx7]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In pathology reports and in the cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) literature, the term "sarcomatoid" is sometimes used as a descriptive term in reference to poorly differentiated cSCC with spindle cell features that resemble a sarcoma in routine histologic sections. Confusion may arise because "sarcomatoid" is also used in reference to a rare biphasic tumor with mixed malignant squamous epithelial and malignant mesenchymal stromal elements (representing true sarcoma), which carries a much worse prognosis. Today, as part of a federal mandate from the 21st Century Cures Act Final Rule, patients are provided immediate electronic access to test results including pathology reports. This has resulted in increased worry for some patients as well as increased messaging between patients and their providers, oftentimes to alleviate this anxiety. Our case report highlights the importance of providing context with the polysemous term "sarcomatoid" to avoid confusion in our patients.

### Association between sex and survival in patients with head and neck spindle cell carcinoma [^116a5Td1]. Head & Neck (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Head and neck spindle cell carcinoma (HNSpCC) is a rare histological variant associated with worse outcomes. Our objective was to identify clinicopathological factors associated with survival in patients with HNSpCC compared to patients with conventional head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

Methods

Using clinical data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we performed a survival analysis in patients with HNSpCC or HNSCC between 2004 and 2016.

Results

A total of 458 HNSpCC and 77104 HNSCC were identified, including 17% and 16% female, respectively. Five-year disease-specific survival (DSS) was 63.90% and 73.90% in patients with HNSpCC and HNSCC, respectively. Sex (hazard ratio [HR] for females = 2.816; CI: 1.139–6.965; p = 0.025) was significantly associated with DSS in HNSpCC while no association was observed between sex and DSS in HNSCC.

Conclusion

HNSpCC in women is a specific subgroup of HNSCC, which is associated with a poor prognosis.

### A rare presentation of orbital spindle cell carcinoma a case report and brief review of the literature [^111xyJY9]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Spindle cell carcinoma, also known as carcinosarcoma or sarcomatoid carcinoma, is a rare variant of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) characterized by dual malignant histologic differentiation of squamous and mesenchymal cells. Some studies have suggested that spindle cell carcinoma is more aggressive than typical SCC, with distant metastasis being more common at presentation.

Periocular spindle cell carcinoma is a rare occurrence, with most cases involving the conjunctiva and/or cornea. Orbital involvement is even rarer, and cases have been reported secondary to distant metastases or local invasion from adjacent structures. Due to the small number of reported cases, periocular behavior of these tumors is mostly unknown.

In this study, we report the first case of primary orbital spindle cell carcinoma presenting with limbal ischemia. We also briefly review the current literature on this rare tumor.

### Spindle cell morphology is related to poor prognosis in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma [^111FU6zw]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Comparison of the clinical outcomes for patients with spindle and non-spindle cell morphology

Of the 108 tumours that were analysed, 22 tumours (20%) were identified as having spindle cell morphology and 86 (80%) as being non-spindle cell carcinomas. Table 2 summarises the outcome measurements for patients with carcinomas with spindle cell and non-spindle cell morphology. The mean age did not differ between the two groups. Vulvar spindle cell carcinoma patients were diagnosed at a higher FIGO stage than non-spindle patients, though the duration of symptoms before diagnosis did not differ.

Forty-one of the 108 patients had lymph node metastases at the time of diagnosis, 15 of which were also positive for spindle cells. This gives a relative risk of lymph node metastasis in spindle cell morphology patients of 2.26 (95% CI 1.47–3.47) compared with patients without spindle cell morphology. Eighteen of 108 patients tested positive for HPV (type 16 (n = 10), 18 (n = 2) or 33 (n = 5); one patient tested positive for both HPV types 16 and 33). None of these patients had carcinomas with spindle cell morphology.

### Down-regulation of microRNAs of the miR-200 family and miR-205, and an altered expression of classic and desmosomal cadherins in spindle cell carcinoma of the head and neck – hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal transition [^1165nvMh]. Human Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

MicroRNAs are small, noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by posttranscriptional regulation of target genes. miR-200 family and miR-205 have been shown experimentally to regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition. As epithelial-mesenchymal transition is the postulated pathogenetic mechanism in spindle cell carcinoma, we analyzed the expression of these microRNAs in spindle cell carcinoma of the head and neck in comparison to conventional squamous cell carcinoma of similar location and stage. We also analyzed the expression of classic and desmosomal cadherins, which are believed to be important targets during epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Forty-five cases of spindle cell carcinoma and 45 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction for microRNAs, and immunohistochemistry for classic cadherins (E- and N-cadherins) and desmosomal cadherins. We found a significant down-regulation of the miR-200 family and miR-205, loss of desmosomal cadherins, and an altered expression of classic cadherins in spindle cell carcinoma in comparison to squamous cell carcinoma. Down-regulation of the miR-200 family and miR-205 strongly supports the postulated role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in spindle cell carcinoma. These microRNAs act on transcription repressors that were also up-regulated in our cases of spindle cell carcinoma, both on mRNA and on protein levels. The result is not only an altered expression of classic cadherins in adherens junctions but also a complete loss of desmosomal cadherins.

### Long-term survival in a patient with pulmonary spindle cell carcinoma treated with traditional Chinese medicine [^1159wPc8]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Spindle cell carcinoma (SCC) is a rare pulmonary malignancy, accounting for only 0.2%-0.3% of all lung cancers. Therefore, the prognosis and treatment of pulmonary SCC is unclear. There are only 13 reported cases in literature, only three of which had a survival of more than 11 months. Here we reported a long-term survival of a patient with pulmonary SCC who underwent treatment with traditional Chinese medicine. At the most recent follow-up in July 2018, her survival after diagnosis is 48 months and she continues to do well. To our knowledge, this is the longest survival of late stage SCC with the largest tumour burden.

### Solid variant of papillary renal cell carcinoma with spindle cell and tubular components [^113vzagS]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The solid variant of papillary renal cell carcinoma, when strictly defined as a tumor in which no true papillae can be identified, is extremely rare, with only a few cases reported in the literature. This tumor is characterized histologically by solid sheets of cells without true papillae; nevertheless, immunohistochemical and genetic analysis supports the classification of this tumor as a variant of papillary renal cell carcinoma. We report a case of solid variant of papillary renal cell carcinoma affecting a young man and provide histologic and clinical follow-up data, adding an additional case of this extremely rare pathology to the literature. In addition, we describe the first case, to our knowledge, of a solid variant of papillary renal cell carcinoma to contain a high-grade (sarcomatoid) spindle cell component.

### Polysemous terms need context: a case of poorly differentiated spindle cell cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma [^115nRFm5]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 75-year-old male presented with a 1 cm papule on the right forehead, which was signed out as a "poorly differentiated sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma". The tumor was composed of fascicles and sheets of poorly differentiated spindle cells that showed weak to moderate reactivity with pankeratin, partial reactivity with p63, and negative reactivity with S-100 protein on immunocytochemistry. Final staging was American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) stage T1, and Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) stage T2a based on poor differentiation. He underwent a magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck, which showed a likely venous structure with an inability to exclude a possible perineural invasion at the supraorbital notch and a recommendation for further imaging later. Clear margins were obtained at Mohs surgery without evidence of microscopic perineural invasion, and the defect was primarily closed. Based on the poor differentiation, he chose to receive adjuvant radiation after surgery. Around 4 months postoperatively, the patient sent an urgent message after he conducted a Google search for "sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma" and was alarmed to find that his perceived diagnosis was associated with a median survival of 10 months (Fig 1). To alleviate his anxiety, his treating physician messaged him, and an addendum was issued to the pathology report (Fig 2).

### Pleomorphic carcinoma of the trachea after chemoradiotherapy for laryngeal cancer [^116hSGZG]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

At this point, we had considered the tumour to be tracheal recurrence of laryngeal cancer, but the pathological type and location was different. Pathological findings showing the epithelial and spindle cell components were decisive in diagnosis. The spindle cell component was greater than 10%, and from this result we diagnosed the tumour as pleomorphic carcinoma, a subtype of sarcomatoid carcinoma.

### Wide spectrum screening keratin as a marker of metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma of the breast: an immunohistochemical study of 24 patients [^116hhjmA]. Histopathology (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

Metaplastic spindle cell carcinomas may be difficult to distinguish histologically from other spindle cell lesions in the breast. Variable staining with cytokeratin immunomarkers has been reported for metaplastic carcinomas. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of anti-cytokeratin polyclonal antibody, wide spectrum screening keratin, to assess spindle cell breast lesions.

Methods and Results

Twenty-four patients with spindle cell breast carcinoma and 31 patients with benign or malignant spindle cell tumours were studied using a panel of antibodies directed against multiple cytokeratins (AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, wide spectrum screening keratin), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and vimentin. Sites of origin for the 31 controls included breast, bone, and soft tissue. All but one (95.8%) metaplastic carcinomas stained positively with wide spectrum screening keratin. Only rare or focal immunoreactivity was observed with AE1/AE3 in four cases; however, sensitivity of AE1/AE3 was improved in 13 cases using steam EDTA as an antigen retrieval technique. Three cases were immunoreactive with CAM5.2 and eight cases were immunoreactive with EMA. All control cases lacked immunoreactivity with the cytokeratin panel and EMA. The spindle cells in the metaplastic breast tumours (88%) and in the controls (97%) stained with vimentin.

Conclusions

Wide spectrum screening keratin may be the most useful and convenient antibody in differentiating metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma from other spindle cell lesions in the breast.

### An approach to the diagnosis of spindle cell lesions of the breast [^1144bFh6]. Histopathology (2016). Low credibility.

Although most breast spindle cell lesions (BSCLs) are rare, they constitute a wide spectrum of diseases, ranging from reactive processes to aggressive malignant tumours. Despite their varied histogenesis and behaviour, some lesions show an overlap of morphological features, making accurate diagnosis a challenging task, particularly in needle core biopsies. Clinical history and immunohistochemistry can help in making a correct diagnosis in morphologically challenging cases. To make an accurate diagnosis, it is important to maintain a wide differential diagnosis and be familiar with the diverse morphological appearances of these different entities. BSCLs can generally be classified into bland-looking and malignant-looking categories. In the former, the commonest diagnosis is scarring. However, it is important to distinguish low-grade spindle cell metaplastic breast carcinoma from other benign entities, as the management is clearly different. In the malignant category, it is important to differentiate metaplastic carcinoma from other malignant primary and metastatic malignant spindle cell tumours of the breast, such as malignant phyllodes tumour, angiosarcoma, and melanoma. This review focuses on the classification and histological and molecular diagnosis of various BSCLs, with an emphasis on the diagnostic approach, including in core biopsies.

### Sarcomatoid lung cancer (spindle / giant cells): an aggressive disease? [^112mwhTZ]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

We investigated the clinical, surgical, and pathologic features of sarcomatoid lung carcinomas with spindle/giant cells, giving special attention to the prognostic behavior of these rare tumors.

Methods

Surgical specimens from 39 patients (29 men and 10 women; mean age, 61 years) were examined by means of light microscopy. Preoperative and postoperative data were collected, and survival was calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Results

Nineteen patients were diagnosed with cancer preoperatively. Only one sarcomatoid tumor had been diagnosed. Presenting symptoms were noted in 85% of patients, and complete resection was achieved in 37 tumors. Postoperative pTNM staging: T2/T3/T4, 22/15/2; N0/N1/N2, 28/8/3; 15 stage IB, 14 stage IIB, 7 stage IIIA, 2 stage IIIB, and 1 stage IV. Histopathologic analysis revealed necrosis in 90% of the tumors (34 pleomorphic, 3 spindle cell, and 2 giant cell carcinomas). During follow-up (median, 24 months), 21 patients died of disease recurrence, and 3 died of postoperative complications. The 5-year survival rate (33%; median, 11 months) was negatively influenced by large tumors (7.5% survival for ≥ 7 cm vs 56% for < 7 cm, P = 0.0026). The disease-free interval was significant for patients who relapsed (0% for disease-free interval < 6 months vs 33% for disease-free interval ≥ 6 months, P = 0.0019).

Conclusions

A highly heterogeneous group, spindle/giant cell lung carcinomas tend to be symptomatic, peripheral, and necrotic. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult. Most patients in our study relapsed and died the first year after surgical intervention. Surgical intervention can permit long-term survival, but adjuvant therapy warrants consideration because of the aggressive nature of these tumors.

### Common and uncommon histologic subtypes of renal cell carcinoma: imaging spectrum with pathologic correlation [^114q2Tuk]. Radiographics (2006). Low credibility.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality, with an estimated 35,000 new cases and 12,480 deaths in the United States in 2003. Recent advances in imaging technology, pathology, urology, and oncology permit early diagnosis of RCC and facilitate optimal management. The 2004 World Health Organization classification for renal neoplasms recognizes several distinct histologic subtypes of RCC. These subtypes include clear cell RCC, papillary RCC, chromophobe RCC, hereditary cancer syndromes, multilocular cystic RCC, collecting duct carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma, neuroblastoma-associated RCC, Xp11.2 translocation-TFE3 carcinoma, and unclassified lesions. Different histologic subtypes of RCC have characteristic histomorphologic and biologic profiles. Clear cell RCC is the most common subtype and has a less favorable prognosis (stage for stage) than do papillary RCC and chromophobe RCC. Collecting duct carcinoma and renal medullary carcinoma are associated with aggressive clinical behavior and a poor prognosis.

### "Sarcomatoid" carcinomas of the lung: a clinicopathological study of 86 cases with a new perspective on tumor classification [^1115j7gb]. Human Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma includes a heterogenous group of tumors difficult to diagnose and treat. We report the clinicopathological features of 86 such tumors, including 74 pleomorphic and 12 spindle cell carcinomas, and propose a novel approach to the classification of these neoplasms in an attempt to better guide patient management. The patients were 47 men and 39 women aged 36 to 87 years (mean, 63 years) who primarily presented with shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Eighty-six percent of patients had a smoking history. Histologically, the pleomorphic carcinomas consisted of spindle and/or giant cells with varying proportions of conventional non-small cell carcinoma in the form of adenocarcinoma (n = 29), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 10), or large cell carcinoma (n = 18); 17 cases contained a mix of spindle and giant cells only. The 12 spindle cell carcinomas consisted of spindle cells only. Based on the combined histopathologic and immunohistochemical features of these tumors, we were able to reanalyze the spectrum of these lesions and reclassify them accordingly. Statistical analysis revealed an overall survival at 3, 5, and 10 years of 42.9%, 34.6%, and 23.5%, respectively, and a median survival of 15 months. Log-rank test showed that in multivariate analysis, only pathological T stage was a factor associated with prognosis. The current classification of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas precludes optimal triaging of these tumors with the risk of denying patients access to novel treatment. Our proposal for a reclassification of these tumors would more accurately guide patient management and facilitate targeted therapies.

### A rare presentation of orbital spindle cell carcinoma a case report and brief review of the literature [^114jZSQ3]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

To describe a case of orbital spindle cell carcinoma which presented with limbal ischemia and briefly review the literature.

Methods

Retrospective case report and brief literature review.

Results

A 61-year old man presented with blepharoptosis, periorbital pain, decreased vision and limbal ischemia. He did not mention any previous illness and did not take any kind of drugs. Imaging revealed an orbital mass that was positive for SMA, Vimentin and CD99 and negative for S100. We treated the patient with chemotherapy and followed him for other complications that occurred throughout disease course.

Conclusion

Spindle cell carcinomas are a rare variant of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with dual malignant histologic differentiation of squamous and mesenchymal cells. Few cases of orbital spindle cell carcinoma have been reported, which have been either secondary to distant metastasis or regional spread. In this study, we have reported the first case of primary orbital spindle cell carcinoma presenting with limbal ischemia. Further studies are needed to describe the different clinical presentations and management strategies of this rare clinical entity.

### Spindle cell neoplasms encountered in dermatologic surgery: a review [^116EoPiD]. Dermatologic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Cutaneous spindle cell tumors share the common feature of appearing as spindle-shaped cells on light microscopy. Their pathogenesis, presentation, and prognosis are highly variable, and numerous techniques for workup and treatment have been reported. We performed an analysis of the available scientific literature in order to codify the clinical, immunohistochemical, and biologic features of these tumors and to provide insight into the most effective practices for their management, with a focus on Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). In this article, the clinical and histopathological characteristics of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, atypical fibroxanthoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma, superficial leiomyosarcoma, desmoplastic melanoma, cutaneous angiosarcoma, and myofibrosarcoma are described, and methods for diagnosis, workup, treatment, and surveillance are evaluated. Cutaneous spindle cell neoplasms are diverse in origin, presentation, and behavior. Immunostaining assists in differentiating among the various types. Further workup is sometimes indicated to characterize local invasion or assess for metastatic disease. Surgery is typically the first-line treatment, and MMS is associated with low recurrence rates and a tissue-sparing advantage for many tumors. Adjuvant treatments, including radiation therapy, molecular-targeted therapy, and conventional chemotherapy, are sometimes indicated, and close clinical surveillance is required after treatment.

### Spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma showing continuous mesenchymal dedifferentiation in a single tumor [^113wCi2U]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

We report the case of an 85-year-old man who presented with an enlarging tumor on the right temple. Histologically, spindle-shaped cells were proliferating continuously within well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma that was immunohistochemically negative for vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA) but positive for cytokeratin (AE1/3). These spindle-shaped cells expressed vimentin and ASMA but not cytokeratin (AE1/3). Intermediate cells with round nuclei and small amounts of cytoplasm displayed slight expression of vimentin, ASMA, and cytokeratin. This case illustrated spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma with mesenchymal metaplasia of malignant epithelial cells.

### Spindle cell morphology is related to poor prognosis in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma [^11414guL]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background:

Vulvar cancer is the fourth most common gynaecological malignancy, with an annual incidence of 2 out of 100 000 women. Although most cases of early stage vulvar cancer have a good prognosis, recurrence and rapid tumour progression can occur. We investigated the prevalence of spindle cell morphology in vulvar cancer and its association with survival.

Methods:

This retrospective cohort study included 108 patients with primary vulvar squamous cell carcinoma who were treated at the Leiden University Medical Center during 2000–2009. Paraffin-embedded tissue was examined for the presence of spindle cell morphology. Survival and histology data were compared between cases with spindle and without spindle cell morphology.

Results:

Twenty-two (20%) tumours showed spindle cells infiltrating the stromal tissue. All spindle cell tumours were human papillomavirus (HPV) negative. Spindle cell morphology was strongly associated with poor prognosis and with a high risk of lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis (relative risk 2.26 (95% CI 1.47–3.47)). Five-year disease-specific survival was lower in patients with vs without spindle cell morphology (45.2% vs 79.7%, respectively; P = 0.00057).

Conclusion:

Vulvar spindle cell morphology occurs frequently and seems to develop through the non-HPV pathway. It is associated with a worse prognosis than conventional vulvar squamous cell carcinoma.

### Analysis of molecular pathologic and clinical features of 36 patients with pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma [^1165xUX5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma(PSC) is a rare type of non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) with sarcomatoid cell or sarcomatoid (spindle/giant cell) differentiation, and accounts for about 0.1–0.4% of all NSCLC cases. In the 2015 edition, WHO classified PSC into 5 subtypes, including pleomorphic carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, giant cell carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and pulmonary blastoma. Pleomorphic carcinoma is the most common subtype, and is defined as a class of poorly differentiated NSCLC, i.e. squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma containing at least 10% spindle cells and/or giant cells. Spindle cell carcinoma consists only of spindle cells that are tightly nested and arranged in irregular bundles, and resemble those seen in pleomorphic carcinoma. Giant cell carcinoma is composed exclusively of giant cells, including polymorphic mononuclear and/or multinucleated neoplastic giant cells. Unlike the giant cells observed in pleomorphic carcinoma, those in giant cell carcinoma are mostly dispersed. Carcinosarcoma is a mixed malignancy consisting of NSCLC cells (mainly squamous or adenocarcinoma cells) and sarcomatous cells (rhabdomyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma and osteosarcoma cells), and has bidirectional differentiation characteristics. Carcinosarcoma and pleomorphic carcinoma are primarily distinguished on the basis of these heterologous components. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of epithelial tumor, followed by adenocarcinoma and adeno-squamous carcinoma. The most common mesenchymal tumor is rhabdomyosarcoma, followed by osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma. Pulmonary blastoma is a rare malignancy comprising of primitive epithelial and mesenchymal cells similar to well-differentiated fetal adenocarcinoma.

PSC patients do not exhibit any obvious clinical symptoms at the early stage, and most of them are diagnosed at the advanced stage that precludes the possibility of surgery. In addition, PSC is recalcitrant to the conventional chemotherapeutic drugs for lung cancer, which seriously affects the quality of life and prognosis of patients. In this study, we performed high-throughput sequencing on the tumor specimens collected from 36 PSC patients to identify mutations in the oncogene exons. The influence of the clinical characteristics and gene mutations on the overall survival (OS) of the patients were analyzed to identify possible therapeutic targets.

### Sarcomatoid larynx carcinoma differential clinical evolution, on field statistical considerations [^115Ek3g7]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Spindle cell larynx carcinoma (SpCC) represents around 3% of laryngeal cancers. It is originated by a single cancer stem cell undergoing epithelial to mesenchymal transition. This explains the aggressiveness, the peculiar resistance to conventional therapy and the frequent relapses. We focused on this particular cancer subset characteristics in patients, in early and advanced stages primarily aiming to define and highlight the differences with Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LSCC) focusing on clinical features, treatments, follow-up and survival in a patient's cohort composed by comparable cases from two subgroups.

### Neoplastic spindle cells are an independent prognostic factor in pancreatic cancer [^1153NE5W]. Pancreas (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Several reports showed that neoplastic spindle cells (NSCs) may be strongly involved in the invasion, metastasis, and poor prognosis, as well as in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It has not yet been investigated that NSCs relate to the recurrence and prognosis in various cancers. Furthermore, NSCs participate in EMT in pancreatic cancer (PC) too. We clinicopathologically investigated the association between NSCs and the recurrence, prognosis, and EMT in PC.

Methods

We studied 68 PC patients. Cancer cells with a spindle or oval shape that do not exhibit luminal structures were defined as NSCs. We graded NSCs regarding to an area of NSCs at hematoxylin and eosin stain (NSC grade) and examined the participation in NSCs and EMT by immunohistostaining of snail antibody and E-cadherin antibody.

Results

In multivariate analysis, NSC grade was an independent risk factor for disease-free survival and overall survival. This was independent of TNM stage and histological grade. Neoplastic spindle cells were related to EMT pattern in immunohistostaining significantly.

Conclusions

Neoplastic spindle cell grade significantly related to the recurrence and prognosis of PC. The NSC grade assessment can be not only performed inexpensively and conveniently, but also used to guide future individualized therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, NSCs were found to relate to EMT profoundly.

### Epidemiology, treatment, and outcomes in locally advanced spindle cell lung cancer… [^116DMnYj]. ASCO (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract e21048 Background: Spindle cell lung cancer is a rare type of NSCLC which portends a poor prognosis. Due to the rarity of diagnosis, there is a dearth of information about the epidemiology and overall survival for these patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis using the SEER database from 1975–2016 to study the demographics, treatment modalities and outcomes for patients with locally advanced SpCC. Data regarding age, sex, race, pathological grade, staging, treatment, overall and disease specific survival was extracted. Hazards ratios were calculated to identify any difference in mortality between patients who received surgery alone versus those who received adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation. Results: A total of 936 cases of SpCC were identified, out of which 367 patients had locally advanced disease. 84% cases were diagnosed after the age of 60, with peak incidence occurring in the 70–74 age group.

87% were Caucasians, and 56% were males. 68% of the tumors were poorly differentiated. In terms of the treatment modalities for locally advanced SpCC, surgical resection was performed only in 58. 5% cases. 27% patients received systemic chemotherapy, out of which 50% was in the adjuvant setting after surgery. 32% patients received radiation therapy, only 38. 5% of which was in the adjuvant setting. No statistically significant difference in mortality was seen in patients who received surgery alone vs adjuvant RT vs adjuvant chemotherapy. However, pts who did not receive surgery had a higher odds of mortality. Similarly, pts who only received chemotherapy alone had a higher odds of mortality vs those who received chemotherapy along with surgery, Overall survival was 25% for patients with localized disease, 9. 5% for regional and only
2. 6% for distant metastatic disease.

For locally advanced SpCC, the observed cumulative 1-year survival was 54. 8% and declined to
29. 2% after 5 years. Conclusions: Majority of the spindle cell carcinoma cases are poorly differentiated and present at an advanced stage at the time of diagnosis. For locally advanced SpCC, surgical resection can improve survival. Randomized trials are needed to test efficacy of adjuvant therapies.

### Spindle cell lesions of the breast: multimodality imaging and clinical differentiation of pathologically similar neoplasms [^114NoWyn]. European Journal of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Spindle cell lesions of the breast comprise a wide-range of entities including reactive, benign and malignant proliferations. They can be pathologically challenging to differentiate as there is often immunohistochemical and morphologic similarities with characteristic spindle shaped cellular patterns. Radiological and pathological correlation is essential. Radiology detects, defines the size and extent, and assists in localizing the lesions. Pathology confirms the diagnosis and provides prognostic parameters. Familiarity with the clinicoradiological features of these diagnostically challenging lesions helps to establish an accurate pathological diagnosis and subsequent clinical decision making.

### 2004 WHO classification of the renal tumors of the adults [^116fmouj]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The recently introduced 2004 World Health Organisation (WHO) classification of the adult renal epithelial neoplasms is meant to replace the previous 1998 WHO classification.

Methods and Results

The 2004 WHO classification is based on pathology and genetic abnormalities. The description of categories has been expanded to improve their recognition and new diagnostic categories are included. Emphasis has been placed on defining familial renal cancer, carcinoma associated with Xp11 translocations, carcinoma associated with neuroblastoma, multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma, tubular, mucinous and spindle cells carcinoma; and mixed epithelial and stromal tumour. The potentially aggressive epithelioid angiomyolipoma is recognised.

Conclusions

Recognising these categories may have important implications in patients' clinical management.

### Next-generation sequencing in breast pathology: real impact on routine practice over a decade since its introduction [^115wugwY]. Histopathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis between metaplastic carcinoma, malignant phyllodes tumour and other spindle cell tumours of the breast

Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a rare special type of breast cancer while being part of a heterogeneous group of tumours. Malignant epithelial cells in metaplastic carcinoma differentiate into squamous, mesenchymal element or spindle‐shaped cells. MBC can be monomorphic or biphasic, i.e. forming a mixed tumour with two or more components, such as an adenocarcinoma component admixed with squamous or chondroid elements. Numerous MBCs are of high histological grade and display a triple‐negative phenotype.

PT are biphasic fibroepithelial neoplasms with increased stromal cellularity. They are classified as benign, borderline or malignant tumours based on microscopic criteria such as mitotic index, the degree of stromal overgrowth, atypia, hypercellularity and infiltrative borders.

Due to these histological features, monophasic high‐grade spindle cell MBC can be misdiagnosed as another high‐grade spindle‐cell tumour of the breast and particularly as a malignant PT if the epithelial component is not visualised in the diagnostic sample. In difficult cases with overlapping morphologies, molecular testing can help to orientate the correct diagnosis.

To illustrate, 53% of MBCs have been shown to harbour TP53 mutations. Notably, TP53 alterations were identified in both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components of MBCs, supporting the monoclonal origin of these components as being morphologically distinct. Conversely, mutations in TP53 have been reported in borderline and malignant PT at a much lower frequency, ranging from 4%to 10%.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification has been reported in up to 80% of squamous MBC, whereas no activating mutations in EGFR were detected, Conversely, mutations in EGFR have been observed in rare borderline and malignant PT, while EGFR amplifications were detected in only 2–16% of all PT and nearly 20% of malignant PT. Taken together, concerning the prevalence of EGFR molecular alterations, activating mutations are more correlated with malignant PT, while EGFR amplifications are correlated with MBC. Thus, these molecular findings are probably instrumental in the differential diagnosis between MBC and malignant PT.

### Desmoplastic / spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. A diagnostically challenging tumor mimicking a scar: clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study of 6 cases [^116DG1Xb]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2010). Low credibility.

Desmoplastic cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are rare neoplasms with an increased risk of local recurrence and metastasis usually affecting sun-exposed skin of the elderly. Microscopically, they are characterized by elongated cords of atypical epithelial cells associated with a prominent (usually reactive) desmoplastic stroma. To expand this clinicopathologic spectrum, we report 6 cases of an unusual variant of desmoplastic SCC in which the "desmoplastic" areas are predominantly composed of cytologically bland malignant spindle cells mimicking a reactive/benign scarring process. Five patients were males and a patient was a female. The median age at presentation was 72 years. Three patients had history of several years of immunosuppressive therapy for solid organ transplant. All tumors affected sun-damaged skin of the head and commonly infiltrated into the subcutaneous fat and deeper structures. Histopathologically, they were predominantly composed of relatively bland spindle cells in a fascicular pattern. Mitoses ranged from 2 to 4 per 10 high power fields. Pleomorphism was focally seen in all cases. Squamous differentiation in the invasive component was focally seen in 4 cases. SCC in situ was seen in all cases. All cases showed reactivity for keratin immunostains. Median follow-up was 19 months. Two of 6 patients died of metastatic SCC; 1 patient died of unrelated causes; and 3 patients were alive without evidence of disease. Accurate recognition of this entity is essential because of potential misdiagnosis as a benign process including scar and dermatofibroma. Careful search for atypical features and squamous differentiation, immunohistochemical studies, and, in some cases, deeper sections are required to establish the diagnosis.

### Cytologic and immunohistochemical evaluation of low-grade spindle cell lesions of the gastrointestinal tract [^116DGRTv]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Spindle cell lesions of the gastrointestinal tract are relatively uncommon compared with the frequency of their epithelial counterparts. Although gastrointestinal stromal tumors and leiomyomas are the most commonly encountered spindle cell lesions in the stomach and esophagus, respectively, there are other less common diagnostic entities that should be considered for accurate diagnoses as well as appropriate patient treatment and clinical follow-up. Given the morphologic overlap of low-grade spindle cell lesions on cytologic preparations, ancillary studies play a key role in differentiating these lesions from one another.

### Clinicopathological characteristics, survival outcomes and prognostic factors in pleomorphic carcinoma: a SEER population-based study [^115B4dB4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pleomorphic carcinoma (PC) is a rare type of poorly differentiated non-small cell lung carcinoma, containing at least a 10% component of spindle and/or giant cells, or a carcinoma that consists entirely of spindle and/or neoplastic giant cells. According to 2004 WHO Classification of Tumours Editorial Board, PC was one of the five subtypes of sarcomatoid carcinomas, including spindle cell carcinoma, giant cell carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, pleomorphic carcinoma, and pulmonary blastoma. But according to the 2021 WHO Classification, PC is a subtype of sarcomatoid carcinoma, while PC has three subtypes: pleomorphic carcinoma, giant cell carcinoma and spindle cell carcinoma. PC could be found in almost any site in the body and most of this originated from the respiratory system. This tumor originating from the respiratory system is called pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma (PPC). The clinical symptoms of PC are non-specific compared with other non-small cell lung cancers but the prognosis is relatively poor. In the past, because of the lack of a conclusive definition and the rarity of pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma, no consensus had been reached regarding its diagnosis. After 1999, a unified diagnostic standard was established for PPC, which was recognized as a neoplasm with pleomorphic, sarcomatoid or sarcomatous elements in the category of carcinomas. Because of pleomorphic differentiation and atypical cell morphology, the definitive diagnosis of pleomorphic carcinoma may be rendered only in surgical specimens.

PPC had a worse outcome than other NSCLC and the optimal treatment of patients remains unknown. Treatment modalities of PPC has varied across previous reports. In the early stage of this type of cancer, surgical excision may be the preferred method of treatment and the key to prevent recurrence and metastasis. However, some researchers documented that the prognosis of patients with pleomorphic carcinoma was poor despite surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, even in the case of local disease. Effective therapeutic modalities combined with surgery should be evaluated to improve outcomes, even when the tumor is at an early stage. Thus, systemic therapy of PPC needed to be explored.

As PPC is a rare histologic subtype, patients with this type of pathology are rare. A review of the literature did not find any specific systematic reports of this tumor. The general population, clinicopathological characteristics of patients with this type of pathology are not well known. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with PPC by using the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database, to predict the trends in overall demographic features, basic clinicopathologic characteristics and compare treatment modalities and outcome of PPC.

### Spindle cell carcinoma of the palatine tonsil: report of a diagnostic pitfall and literature review [^112RmKa1]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2008). Low credibility.

Spindle cell carcinomas of the tonsil are very rare tumors. We present an additional case that occurred in a 58-year-old woman. She presented with a tumor of the right tonsil. Histologic sections of tonsillar biopsies suggested that this tumor was a squamous cell carcinoma. She underwent a transoral resection of the right oropharynx. The final diagnosis was spindle cell carcinoma. We emphasize the difficulties in diagnosing this type of tumor and discuss therapeutic approaches to this rare tumor, which shows little response to radiotherapy; the literature is reviewed. We offer this case study in an effort to increase awareness of this rare malignancy.

### On the road to cancer: aneuploidy and the mitotic checkpoint [^112FjfDe]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2005). Medium credibility.

Abnormal chromosome content - also known as aneuploidy - is the most common characteristic of human solid tumours. It has therefore been proposed that aneuploidy contributes to, or even drives, tumour development. The mitotic checkpoint guards against chromosome mis-segregation by delaying cell-cycle progression through mitosis until all chromosomes have successfully made spindle-microtubule attachments. Defects in the mitotic checkpoint generate aneuploidy and might facilitate tumorigenesis, but more severe disabling of checkpoint signalling is a possible anticancer strategy.

### Childhood rhabdomyosarcoma treatment-national cancer institute… [^116mBYZA]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

- **Spindle cell/sclerosing**: The spindle cell type occurs most often in the paratesticular area. There are two other spindle cell/sclerosing subtypes. One is more common in infants and is found in the trunk area. The other can affect children, adolescents, and adults. It is often found in the head and neck area, and is more aggressive.
- Pleomorphic: This is the least common type of rhabdomyosarcoma in children. See the following PDQ treatment summaries for information about other types of soft tissue sarcoma: Sentinel lymph node biopsy: The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node in a group of lymph nodes to receive lymphatic drainage from the primary tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the primary tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes.

The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. Sometimes, a sentinel lymph node is found in more than one group of nodes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy may be used for patients with rhabdomyosarcoma of the limbs or trunk when enlarged lymph nodes are not found with imaging or physical exam. Stage 1 In stage 1, the tumor is any size, may have spread to lymph nodes, and is found in only one of the following "favorable" sites:

- Eye or area around the eye.
- Head and neck.
- Gallbladder and bile ducts.
- Ureters or urethra.
- Testes, ovary, vagina, or uterus.
- CTLA-4 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body's immune responses in check.

When CTLA-4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. CTLA-4 inhibitors attach to CTLA-4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells. Ipilimumab is being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back or progressed during treatment.

### Clinicopathologic study of 53 metaplastic breast carcinomas: their elements and prognostic implications [^116QifZ7]. Human Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast is a relatively rare cancer and includes various histologic types. In this cancer, metaplastic elements are heterogeneous and sometimes mixed. We investigated, by histopathologic means, these elements and clinical implications that could indicate the clinical course (including the prognosis). Fifty-three metaplastic breast carcinoma cases and their prognoses were investigated by initially examining the presence or absence of spindle-cell elements, and then the presence or absence of other elements. Spindle cells were classified as high or low grade. The number of spindle-cell-positive cases was 24 (45%) of 53. The 24 spindle-cell (+) cases were subdivided into 12 high-grade (HGsp) (distant metastatic rate per 100 person-years, 13.27) and 12 low-grade (LGsp) (0.00) patients. Spindle-cell (-) cases were subdivided into 22 pure squamous cell carcinomas (5.93) and 7 matrix-producing carcinomas (0.00). There were significant differences among the 4 groups with regard to the disease-free period (P = 0.0081, log-rank test). The distant metastatic risks in the HGsp and pure squamous cell carcinomas groups were significantly higher than that in the matrix-producing carcinoma + LGsp group (nonmetastatic groups) after controlling for the effects of tumor size and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.019 and P = 0.016, respectively, Poisson regression model). The presence of high-grade spindle cells was related to the prognosis, and some histologic subtypes may be important with respect to the prognosis. The presence of high-grade spindle cells in metaplastic breast carcinoma may indicate aggressive behavior.

### Spindle cell morphology is related to poor prognosis in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma [^111sFTmB]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

VSCC with spindle cell morphology appears to be an aggressive tumour type. In this series of patients, this cancer type had a worse prognosis than conventional VSCC as well as an increased risk of lymph node metastases at the time of diagnosis.

### Definition of spindle cell hemangioma-national cancer institute… [^112FahrZ]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

spindle cell hemangiomaListen to pronunciationA benign blood vessel tumor that forms on or under the skin. Spindle cell hemangiomas have cells called spindle cells that look long and slender under a microscope. These tumors are painful red-brown or bluish lesions that usually appear on the arms or legs. One or more lesions may form, and they can sometimes rupture and bleed. Spindle cell hemangiomas usually occur in young adults but can sometimes occur in children. They are a type of vascular tumor.

### GATA3 positive spindle cell neoplasm involving the liver diagnosed as metastatic sarcomatoid chromophobe renal cell carcinoma at autopsy [^1142d9Wh]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

GATA3 is expressed in a subset of renal cell carcinomas, particularly ChRCC with sarcomatoid differentiation. In the setting of a kidney mass with a biopsy at a metastatic site showing a GATA3 positive spindle cell neoplasm, the differential diagnosis should include sarcomatoid ChRCC.

### Pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung: a surgical outcome [^111aULKg]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung, a rare malignant disease with a dual-cell component of spindle and/or giant cells, and of epithelial cells, was defined in the World Health Organization classification updated in 1999. Reported prognoses are heterogeneous, and optimal treatment remains undefined.

Methods

Data were retrospectively examined for 45 consecutive patients (41 men and 4 women) who had undergone surgical resection for pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma.

Results

Sarcomatous elements were as follows: 23 spindle cell types (51.1%), 11 giant cell types (24.4%), and 11 combined spindle and giant cell types (24.4%). Epithelial components were adenocarcinoma in 25 (55.6%) patients, squamous cell carcinoma in 8 (17.8%) patients, and large call carcinoma in 12 (26.7%) patients. Nodal status was classified as pN0 disease in 28 (62.2%) patients, pN1 disease in 5 (11.1%) patients, and pN2 disease in 12 (26.7%) patients. Even patients with pN0 disease frequently manifested vascular invasion (16/28 [57.1%]). Five-year overall survival and disease-free survival were 39.2% and 47.1%, respectively. Although the subtype of epithelial components, as well as sarcomatous elements, did not affect prognosis, overall survival (P = 0.02) and disease-free survival (P = 0.002) in patients with pN1/N2 disease were significantly worse than those in patients with pN0 disease. Most recurrences occurred at distant sites (14/20 [70.0%]), and recurrence within 6 months after resection was found in 10 patients (10/20 [50.0%]). Moreover, median survival time after confirmation of initial relapse was 2.6 months.

Conclusions

Pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma, which often presented in symptomatic male smokers as a large peripheral lesion, carried a poor prognosis, even when early-stage disease was diagnosed and resected. Distant metastases occurred more frequently and earlier, and the survival after relapse was very short, suggesting that this entity should be considered to have a tremendously aggressive malignant behavior. Further investigation of biologic features of pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma and therapeutic response is a high-priority issue, so that suitable treatment strategies can be planned.

### Spindle cell transformation of papillary carcinoma: an aggressive entity distinct from anaplastic thyroid carcinoma [^111d6ZrJ]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Spindle cells are not routinely encountered in the context of thyroid pathology and are most often present in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and benign conditions such as Riedel struma or de Quervain granulomatous thyroiditis. Only a few publications have reported papillary thyroid carcinoma admixed with a prominent spindle cell component. While these tumors are clearly distinct from anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, prognostication as to their oncologic potential is not yet established. We describe a unique case of spindle cell transformation of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The blandness of the spindle cells was so impressive as to dissuade us from a malignant diagnosis on preoperative biopsies. However, this patient unfortunately died shortly after transformation of this papillary thyroid carcinoma. We conclude that this peculiar and rare spindle cell transformation should be regarded as a potentially lethal variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma.

### Combined large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and spindle cell carcinoma of the lung [^114uMLPg]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

We report a unique case of a combined pulmonary large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and spindle-cell carcinoma. The patient was a 54-year-old female smoker who presented with a 4-month history of increased left-sided chest pain and exertional dyspnea. The left upper lobectomy specimen revealed an 8.0-cm mass with central necrosis. Microscopically, the epithelial areas were composed of well-defined nests of large cells with peripheral palisading expressing low-molecular-weight keratin, synaptophysin, chromogranin, and neuron-specific enolase. The spindle-cell component consisted of pleomorphic cells arranged in fibrosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma-like patterns. These spindle cells were positive for low-molecular-weight keratin and vimentin with focal expression of CD68 and muscle-specific actin. Electron microscopy in the spindle-cell areas showed cell junctions and numerous tonofilaments, indicative of epithelial differentiation. The tumor behaved aggressively and the patient died with extensive metastases 4 months after surgery. The combination of neuroendocrine malignancies and spindle-cell carcinomas appears to be uncommon in the lung. Previous reports have described this association in single case reports of anaplastic small-cell carcinoma and atypical carcinoid, but not in large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.

### Benign postoperative spindle cell nodule of the urinary bladder? don't think so [^11454NLb]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

According to colleagues specializing in genitourinary pathology, the so-called postoperative spindle cell nodule of the bladder can be extremely difficult to distinguish from a spindle cell sarcomatoid carcinoma. What I have learned in 25 years about spindle cell sarcomatoid carcinoma of the larynx may, by analogy, possibly help with the genitourinary pathology problem.

### Spindle cell sarcomatoid carcinoma of the trachea: first case report of surgical resection [^1128x9hY]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Primary malignant tracheal tumors are rare, accounting for approximately 0.2% of respiratory tract tumors yearly, with squamous cell carcinomas and adenoid cystic carcinomas accounting for two-thirds of these cases. Sarcomatoid carcinomas are a group of poorly differentiated non-small cell lung carcinomas containing a component of sarcoma or sarcoma-like (spindle and/or giant cell) differentiation, categorized into five morphologic subgroups. Spindle cell sarcomatoid carcinoma is a rare variant of sarcomatoid carcinomas, consisting of only spindle-shaped tumor cells. Only one other case has been reported as a primary tracheal tumor.

Case Presentation

We present a 75-year-old male, having progressive dyspnea and cough, with a spindle cell sarcomatoid carcinoma tumor visualized on chest computed tomography scan and confirmed with biopsy.

Conclusions

Due to its low incidence, knowledge of treatment methods, prognostic factors, and etiology is limited thus approaches to eradication have widely varied. We are reporting the second published case of spindle cell sarcomatoid carcinoma of the trachea and the first reported successful outcome of definitive treatment with tracheal resection.

### Delayed diagnosis of a high-grade spindle cell sarcoma… [^112mPbwj]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: Soft tissue masses commonly present in family medicine and range from benign lipomas to high-grade soft tissue sarcomas. A subset of soft tissue sarcomas includes a spindle cell sarcoma, which is a rare connective tissue tumor that originates in the layers of tissue found below the skin. 1 Spindle cell sarcomas can be found on any part of the body, but most occur on the trunk and extremities. 2 Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for spindle cell sarcomas, but treatment can also include a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.

1. A previously healthy 45-year-old woman had a mechanical fall resulting in ecchymosis of the left eye and left thigh pain. Two weeks after the fall, she noticed a small bump on her left thigh. The patient made an appointment with her family physician.

The initial evaluation included ultrasonography, but ultimately magnetic resonance imaging of the left leg revealed a large collection in the lateral thigh consistent with a hematoma. A neoplastic process could not be ruled out. Over the next month, the mass on the patient's thigh continued to grow. A general surgeon ordered a computed tomography angiogram of the pelvis and bilateral lower extremities that showed a moderate-sized fluid collection within the soft tissues anterior to the left hip, suggestive of a chronic hematoma. The patient was referred to surgical oncology and had a core needle biopsy of the mass done. Biopsy results showed completely necrotic cells with no visible tumor cells present. The patient was taken to the operating room by general surgery for excision of the thigh mass and drain placement. During the surgery, a large, encapsulated mass measuring 17 cm by 17 cm, with serous mucinous fluid was removed with the capsule intact.

The pathology of the encapsulated mass revealed an unclassified high-grade spindle cell sarcoma which had been mimicking an intramuscular hematoma. The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable. The diagnosis of sarcoma is often delayed because of its rarity and nonspecific presenting symptoms. 3This case illustrates the importance of including sarcoma in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with a soft tissue mass and hematoma.

### Useful histopathologic features for diagnosing focal liver lesions with spindle cell morphology: a clinicopathologic study [^112a2uX3]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Focal liver lesions with spindle cell morphology are rare in the daily practice of pathology. The differential diagnosis is broad, including both tumors and tumor-like lesions. Initial radiologic assessment is sometimes inaccurate. Histopathology is needed to arrive at the correct diagnosis. This study analyzed discrepancies between histopathology and radiologic findings of focal liver lesions with spindle cell morphology.

Methods

A six-year retrospective analysis was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Thailand. All focal liver lesions with spindle cell morphology were retrieved. Clinicopathologic features of these cases were analyzed. The pathological diagnosis was rendered primarily based on routine histopathology, using other ancillary studies as an adjunct.

Results

287 biopsies and 151 resection specimens with focal liver lesions were identified. In 12 (2.7%) cases, tumors or tumor-like lesions with spindle cell morphology were retrieved. A total of five cases had discrepancies between histopathology and radiologic findings. These lesions encompassed primary liver tumors (EBV-associated smooth muscle tumor and leiomyosarcoma); metastatic tumors (gastrointestinal stromal tumor, small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma); and a tumor-like lesion (endometriosis). Several morphologic findings (i.e., cytologic grades, dense and loose areas, intratumoral lymphocytes, distinct perinuclear vacuoles, and hemosiderin) are important clues to diagnose these spindle cell lesions.

Conclusions

Pathologists play a critical role in diagnosing focal liver lesions with spindle cell morphology, particularly those with limited clinical data at the initial presentation. A thorough evaluation of histomorphology on routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides is essential for correct diagnosis.
