## Question

Can patients have cluster headaches for one month

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient can have cluster headaches for one month. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic criteria and how episodic versus chronic cluster headache are defined. Then, I should verify typical bout durations in population data. Next, I will examine regional variability, especially Asian cohorts where bouts may be shorter. After that, I need to check for atypical or secondary causes that could truncate or modify a bout. Finally, I will synthesize whether a one-month bout fits within recognized patterns and what that implies clinically and diagnostically.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework. Cluster headache is defined by recurrent attacks of severe unilateral orbital/supraorbital/temporal pain lasting 15–180 minutes, occurring from once every other day up to eight times per day, with ipsilateral autonomic features and/or restlessness; episodic cluster headache has attack periods (bouts) separated by remission periods longer than three months, whereas chronic cluster headache lacks remission longer than three months within a year or persists beyond one year, so I need to ensure I'm not conflating attack duration with bout duration here [^113RiWBU] [^111sPLtZ] [^115mxdTu].

> Now, I should review typical bout durations. Wait, let me verify the classic teaching: bouts commonly last 6–12 weeks, which is longer than one month, and this is consistently described in contemporary reviews and practice summaries, so a one-month bout would sit at the shorter end of typical durations rather than being incompatible with the diagnosis [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify whether shorter bouts are documented. In Asian cohorts, bout durations are indeed shorter on average: in China, 42.5% of patients have bouts lasting ≤ 1 month and 75% ≤ 2 months; in Japan, 79% have bouts ≤ 2 months; in Korea, the median bout duration in episodic cluster headache is about 4 weeks; in Taiwan, the average bout is around 5 weeks, so a one-month bout is well within the observed distribution in these populations [^1118KCLW] [^116Wng5m].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "shortest possible bout is 7 days", but I should double-check that. The 7-day minimum comes from older ICHD-era language about cluster periods lasting 7–365 days; current VA/DoD criteria emphasize the attack frequency and remission structure rather than a hard lower bound on bout length, so while 7 days has been cited historically, the modern emphasis is on the pattern of attacks and remissions rather than a strict minimum bout duration, meaning a one-month bout is acceptable if the attack phenotype and remission pattern otherwise meet criteria [^111sPLtZ] [^113RiWBU].

> Next, I should review atypical or secondary considerations. Let me consider whether a truncated one-month bout could reflect an atypical presentation or a secondary cluster-like headache; case series and reviews document cluster-like headaches from secondary causes and atypical phenotypes, so if the history is atypical, red flags are present, or the course deviates markedly from prior bouts, I need to ensure appropriate evaluation for secondary etiologies before anchoring on primary cluster headache [^116vxGDr] [^1166fPhx] [^114QQPbS].

> I will now examine the clinical implications. A one-month bout is compatible with episodic cluster headache, particularly in patients with shorter typical bouts or Asian ancestry, and it does not by itself change acute or preventive management principles; standard acute therapy with high-flow oxygen and subcutaneous sumatriptan remains first-line, and preventive strategies such as verapamil, transitional corticosteroids, or galcanezumab for episodic disease are guideline-supported, with the caveat that galcanezumab is effective in episodic but not chronic cluster headache, so I should confirm subtype before selecting it [^111RHZ2m] [^112Q1UKN] [^114UhN9G].

> But wait, what if the short bout reflects an early or evolving phenotype? I should confirm that cluster headache can transition between episodic and chronic forms. Prospective and interview-based studies show measurable one- and five-year conversion rates, so a brief initial bout does not preclude later evolution, and clinicians should counsel patients accordingly and monitor for phenotype shifts over time [^111nBWc1] [^113z2EKj].

> In summary, yes — patients can have cluster headaches for one month. This duration sits at the shorter end of typical bouts but is well within the recognized spectrum, especially in Asian populations, and remains consistent with episodic cluster headache if the attack phenotype and remission criteria are met. I need to ensure the diagnosis is sound and consider secondary causes if the presentation is atypical or the course is unusual [^1118KCLW] [^116Wng5m] [^113RiWBU].

Patients can have cluster headaches for one month, as **bout durations vary** [^115mmjf4] and some last 2–4 weeks, especially in Asian populations [^1118KCLW] [^116Wng5m]. A one-month bout is within the normal range for episodic cluster headache, which typically lasts 2–12 weeks [^11574a5q] and is separated by remission periods of ≥ 3 months [^115A9ZTM]. Chronic cluster headache is defined by attacks recurring for > 1 year without remission or with remissions < 3 months [^111sPLtZ]; therefore, a one-month bout alone does not meet chronic criteria. Management includes **acute treatments** (high-flow oxygen, subcutaneous sumatriptan) [^111RHZ2m] and **preventives** (verapamil, corticosteroids, galcanezumab for episodic cases) [^112Q1UKN] [^114UhN9G].

## Typical duration of cluster headache bouts

- **Episodic cluster headache (ECH)**: Characterized by recurrent bouts of attacks lasting 2–12 weeks [^notfound], separated by remission periods of ≥ 3 months [^115A9ZTM].

- **Chronic cluster headache (CCH)**: Defined by attacks recurring for > 1 year without remission or with remissions lasting < 3 months [^111sPLtZ].

- **Variability**: Bout durations vary widely; some last only 2–4 weeks, particularly in Asian populations [^1118KCLW] [^116Wng5m].

---

## Clinical evidence of one-month cluster headache bouts

Recent studies confirm that **one-month bouts occur**, particularly in Asian cohorts:

| **Study** | **Population** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Chinese Cluster Headache Register Individual Study (CHRIS) | China | - 44% of patients had bouts lasting 2 weeks to 1 month [^116Wng5m] <br/> - Median bout duration: 4 weeks |
| Korean study | Korea | Median bout duration: 4 weeks |
| Japanese study | Japan | 79% had bouts ≤ 2 months [^1118KCLW] |

---

These data show that **one-month bouts are not rare**, especially in Asian populations [^1118KCLW].

---

## Clinical features of one-month cluster headache bouts

One-month bouts have the **same core features** as longer bouts:

- **Severe unilateral pain**: Orbital, supraorbital, or temporal [^113RiWBU].

- **Autonomic symptoms**: Ipsilateral lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, ptosis, miosis [^113RiWBU].

- **Restlessness**: Agitation or restlessness during attacks [^115spsxM].

- **Frequency**: 1–8 attacks per day [^1172UUof].

- **Duration**: 15–180 minutes per attack [^113RiWBU].

---

## Management of one-month cluster headache bouts

Management mirrors that of longer bouts and includes **acute treatments** — high-flow oxygen (100% at ≥ 12 L/min) [^111RHZ2m] and subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg — and **preventive treatments** such as verapamil (240–480 mg/day), short-term corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone 60–100 mg/day taper), and galcanezumab 300 mg monthly for episodic cluster headache [^112Q1UKN] [^114UhN9G]. Given the shorter duration, **preventive therapy may be tapered** after the bout ends, typically continuing 2–4 weeks after the last attack [^1167mHjp].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

One-month bouts are part of the **typical episodic pattern** [^11574a5q], with recurrences separated by months to years. Over time, bout frequency and severity may decrease, and some patients enter prolonged remission [^113Nz5H4] [^115HtJa5].

---

## Conclusion

Patients can have cluster headaches for one month; this duration is within the normal range for episodic cluster headache, particularly in Asian populations [^1118KCLW]. Management is **similar to longer bouts**, with acute and preventive treatments tailored to attack frequency and patient preference.

### Subtype shift, relapse rate and risk factors of frequent relapse in cluster headache: a multicenter, prospective, longitudinal observation [^112GtiPX]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

AimTo prospectively determine subtype shift, relapse rate and risk factors of frequent relapse in cluster headache (CH). MethodsThis multicenter cohort study recruited patients with CH at baseline visits between September 2016 and January 2019 and planned to prospectively follow them up for up to five years. The subtype (episodic vs. chronic) was reassessed at baseline visit 2 (2–4 weeks) and serial follow-up visits if unremitted. We assessed the subtype shift of the index bout (i.e. the bout at the baseline visit) in all patients and relapse rates in those with episodic CH who were in an active bout at the time of recruitment. Relapse (i.e. bout recurrence) was prospectively collected via clinic visit or telephone interview at 3 ± 1 months, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years (each ± 6 months) after the baseline visit. Risk factors of frequent relapse were analyzed by comparing the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of relapse using Poisson regression analysis (model 1, static variables in all patients; model 2, time-related variables in patients with two or more lifetime bouts) accounted for different follow-up periods using an offset term. ResultsIn 295 patients (58 with first-ever bouts) enrolled, CH subtypes were episodic, chronic and unclassified in 252, 11 and 32 at baseline. At baseline V2, CH subtype was re-determined to be chronic in seven (12.1%) of 58 patients with first-onset CH ("primary chronic CH") and nine (3.8%) of 237 with a history of episodic CH ("secondary chronic CH"). When excluding known chronic CHs at baseline, the incidence of chronic CH newly found during a prospective observation was 3.8% in patients with first-onset CH and 1.4% in those with a history of episodic CH. In 244 patients with episodic CH in an active bout at the time of recruitment, the relapse rate was 0.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.27–0.32; p < 0.001) per person-year after 5.9 ± 1.37 follow-up visits over a mean duration of 4.2 ± 1.32 years. Models 1 and 2 indicated that age (adjusted IRR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.95–0.98), longer disease duration (adjusted IRR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.95–1.00), first-ever bout (adjusted IRR = 0.35; 95% CI = 0.20–0.57), regular (one or more per week) alcohol consumption (adjusted IRR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.45–0.81), and longer between-bout interval of previous bouts (adjusted IRR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.60–0.87) were associated with less relapse. Seasonal rhythmicity (adjusted IRR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.20–2.33) and increasing attack intensity across bouts (adjusted IRR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.06–2.59) were associated with frequent relapse. ConclusionsThe present study provides data on the subtype shift and relapse rate of CH based on the prospective observation. Although our observation is only limited to a five-year time frame, our findings may suggest that disease activity increases after onset and then regress with age and time, and that seasonal rhythmicity and increasing attack intensity across bouts indicate higher propensity to relapse.

### Trial of galcanezumab in prevention of episodic cluster headache [^114UhN9G]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Episodic cluster headache is a disabling neurologic disorder that is characterized by daily headache attacks that occur over periods of weeks or months. Galcanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to calcitonin gene-related peptide, may be a preventive treatment for cluster headache.

Methods

We enrolled patients who had at least one attack every other day, at least four total attacks, and no more than eight attacks per day during a baseline assessment, as well as a history of cluster headache periods lasting at least 6 weeks, and randomly assigned them to receive galcanezumab (at a dose of 300 mg) or placebo, administered subcutaneously at baseline and at 1 month. The primary end point was the mean change from baseline in the weekly frequency of cluster headache attacks across weeks 1 through 3 after receipt of the first dose. The key secondary end point was the percentage of patients who had a reduction from baseline of at least 50% in the weekly frequency of cluster headache attacks at week 3. Safety was also assessed.

Results

Recruitment was halted before the trial reached the planned sample size of 162 because too few volunteers met the eligibility criteria. Of 106 enrolled patients, 49 were randomly assigned to receive galcanezumab and 57 to receive placebo. The mean (± SD) number of cluster headache attacks per week in the baseline period was 17.8 ± 10.1 in the galcanezumab group and 17.3 ± 10.1 in the placebo group. The mean reduction in the weekly frequency of cluster headache attacks across weeks 1 through 3 was 8.7 attacks in the galcanezumab group, as compared with 5.2 in the placebo group (difference, 3.5 attacks per week; 95% confidence interval, 0.2 to 6.7; P = 0.04). The percentage of patients who had a reduction of at least 50% in headache frequency at week 3 was 71% in the galcanezumab group and 53% in the placebo group. There were no substantial between-group differences in the incidence of adverse events, except that 8% of the patients in the galcanezumab group had injection-site pain.

Conclusions

Galcanezumab administered subcutaneously at a dose of 300 mg once monthly reduced the weekly frequency of attacks of episodic cluster headache across weeks 1 through 3 after the initial injection, as compared with placebo. (Funded by Eli Lilly; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02397473.).

### Exploration of prolonged remission and the natural course of cluster headache: an interview-based cohort study [^113LzN1y]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The aim of this study was to gain insight into the intriguing yet sparsely documented phenomenon of prolonged remission in CH. We aim to identify characteristics, patterns, and factors associated with prolonged remission as well as phenotypical changes before remission in CH. As a result, we can provide patients with more accurate information regarding their potential disease course. Furthermore, by increasing our understanding of spontaneous remission in CH, we hope to uncover potential underlying mechanisms that can help therapeutic research to instigate therapeutic prolonged remission in people with active CH.

### Cluster headache [^112Vs6Tc]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The revised International Headache Society (IHS) criteria for cluster headache are: attacks of severe or very severe, strictly unilateral pain, which is orbital, supraorbital, or temporal pain, lasting 15 to 180 minutes and occurring from once every other day to eight times daily.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to abort cluster headache? What are the effects of interventions to prevent cluster headache? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 23 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: baclofen (oral); botulinum toxin (intramuscular); capsaicin (intranasal); chlorpromazine; civamide (intranasal); clonidine (transdermal); corticosteroids; ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (oral or intranasal); gabapentin (oral); greater occipital nerve injections (betamethasone plus xylocaine); high-dose and high-flow-rate oxygen; hyperbaric oxygen; leuprolide; lidocaine (intranasal); lithium (oral); melatonin; methysergide (oral); octreotide (subcutaneous); pizotifen (oral); sodium valproate (oral); sumatriptan (oral, subcutaneous, and intranasal); topiramate (oral); tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs); verapamil; and zolmitriptan (oral and intranasal).

### Cluster headache beyond the pain phase: a prospective study of 500 attacks [^112U2kLt]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the nature, prevalence, and duration of symptoms in the preictal, ictal, and postictal phases of cluster headache (CH) attacks.

Methods

Fifty-seven patients with episodic or chronic CH participated in this prospective, observational study. In a questionnaire concerning 33 CH and migraine-related symptoms, patients reported the clinical features of up to 10 CH attacks/patient. The questionnaire was divided into 3 sections: a preictal phase, ictal phase, and postictal phase. For each phase, patients documented whether the given symptom was present, and if possible estimated the duration of the symptom.

Results

In total, 500 CH attack descriptions were obtained. In the preictal phase, general symptoms (most frequently concentration difficulties, restlessness, and mood changes) occurred 20 minutes prior to 46.0% of attacks. Local painful and autonomic symptoms were observed 10 minutes prior to 54.6% and 35% of attacks, respectively. Postictally, pain and autonomic symptoms resolved over 20 minutes, leaving patients with fatigue (36.2%), decreased energy (39.0%), and concentration difficulties (27.6%), lasting a median of 60 minutes.

Conclusions

Preictal and postictal symptoms are very frequent in CH, demonstrating that CH attacks are not composed of a pain phase alone. Since the origin of CH attacks is unresolved, studies of preictal and postictal symptoms could contribute to the understanding of CH pathophysiology and, potentially, early, abortive treatment strategies.

Differential diagnosis

Cluster headache shares many features with the other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. The one that most closely resembles cluster headache is paroxysmal hemicrania; both conditions have a relatively short severe attack duration with overlap in their duration criteria. Paroxysmal hemicrania attacks are also unilateral and last 2–30 min, but the attacks are usually more frequent than in cluster headache. Paroxysmal hemicrania attacks can occur more than five times a day, up to 40 times a day, with a mean of 11. They do not have the same nocturnal tendency as cluster headache and alcohol is not reliably a trigger. As complex as it makes the question, an absolute response to an adequate dose indomethacin is the sine qua non of PH.

### Does this patient with headache have a migraine or need neuroimaging? [^114N3xxx]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

In assessing the patient with headache, clinicians are often faced with 2 important questions: Is this headache a migraine? Does this patient require neuroimaging? The diagnosis of migraine can direct therapy, and information obtained from the history and physical examination is used by physicians to determine which patients require neuroimaging.

Objective

To determine the usefulness of the history and physical examination that distinguish patients with migraine from those with other headache types and that identify those patients who should undergo neuroimaging.

Data Sources and Study Selection

A systematic review was performed using articles from MEDLINE (1966-November 2005) that assessed the performance characteristics of screening questions in diagnosing migraine (with the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria as a gold standard) and addressed the accuracy of the clinical examination in predicting the presence of underlying intracranial pathology (with computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging as the reference standard).

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, abstract data, and classify methodological quality using predetermined criteria. Disagreement was resolved by consensus with a third author.

Data Synthesis

Four studies of screening questions for migraine (n = 1745 patients) and 11 neuroimaging studies (n = 3725 patients) met inclusion criteria. All 4 of the migraine studies illustrated high sensitivity and specificity if 3 or 4 criteria were met. The best predictors can be summarized by the mnemonic POUNDing (Pulsating, duration of 4–72 hOurs, Unilateral, Nausea, Disabling). If 4 of the 5 criteria are met, the likelihood ratio (LR) for definite or possible migraine is 24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–388); if 3 are met, the LR is 3.5 (95% CI, 1.3–9.2), and if 2 or fewer are met, the LR is 0.41 (95% CI, 0.32–0.52). For the neuroimaging question, several clinical features were found on pooled analysis to predict the presence of a serious intracranial abnormality: cluster-type headache (LR, 10.7; 95% CI, 2.2–52); abnormal findings on neurologic examination (LR, 5.3; 95% CI, 2.4–12); undefined headache (ie, not cluster-, migraine-, or tension-type) (LR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.0–7.1); headache with aura (LR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6–6.6); headache aggravated by exertion or a valsalva-like maneuver (LR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4–3.8); and headache with vomiting (LR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2–2.6). No clinical features were useful in ruling out significant pathologic conditions.

Conclusions

The presence of 4 simple historical features can accurately diagnose migraine. Several individual clinical features were found to be associated with a significant intracranial abnormality, and patients with these features should undergo neuroimaging.

### Managing cluster headache [^112bP2zD]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cluster headache is a neurological disorder that presents with unilateral severe headache associated with ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. Cluster headache attacks often occur more than once a day, and typically manifesting in bouts. It has a point prevalence of 1 in 1000 and is the most common trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia. This article aims to guide general neurologists to an accurate diagnosis and practical management options for cluster headache patients.

### Female cluster headache in the United States of America: what are the gender differences? Results from the United States cluster headache survey [^113US3pZ]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To present results from the United States Cluster Headache Survey regarding gender differences in cluster headache demographics, clinical characteristics, diagnostic delay, triggers, treatment response and personal burden.

Background

Very few studies have looked at the gender differences in cluster headache presentation. The United States Cluster Headache Survey is the largest study of cluster headache sufferers ever completed in the United States and it is also the largest study of female cluster headache patients ever presented.

Methods

The total survey consisted of 187 multiple choice questions which dealt with various issues related to cluster headache including: demographics, clinical characteristics, concomitant medical conditions, family history, triggers, smoking history, diagnosis, treatment response and personal burden. A group of questions were specifically targeted to female cluster headache patients. The survey was placed on a website from October to December 2008. For all survey responders the diagnosis of cluster headache needed to be made by a neurologist but there was no validation of the headache diagnosis by the authors.

Results

1134 individuals completed the survey (816 male, 318 female). Key Points that define the differences between female and male cluster headache include: a. Age of onset: women develop cluster headache at an earlier age than men and are more likely to develop a second peak of cluster headache onset after 50 years of age. b. Family history: woman cluster headache sufferers are more likely to have a family history of both cluster headache and migraine and have an increased familial risk of Parkinson's disease. c. Comorbid conditions: female cluster headaches sufferers are significantly more likely to experience depression and have asthma than males. d. Aura issues: aura with cluster headache is equally common in both sexes, but aura duration is shorter in women. Women are much more likely to experience sensory, language and brainstem auras. e. Pain location: cluster headache pain is typically retro-orbital in location in both sexes but women are significantly more likely to experience cluster headache pain in the jaw, cheek and ear than men. f. Associated symptoms: women with cluster headache develop more "migrainous" associated symptoms than men, especially nausea and they are also more likely to have self-injurious behavior than men. g. Triggers: women with cluster headache are much less likely to have alcohol trigger a headache, but are significantly more likely to have "migrainous" triggers for their cluster headaches than men. h. Smoking issues: women are much less likely to have a smoking history than male cluster headache sufferers, more likely to have never smoked prior to cluster headache onset. i. Cycle issues: spring and fall are the most common time to start a cluster headache cycle in both sexes. Women are statistically significantly less likely to start a cluster headache cycle in the months of October–December than men. Women have more attacks per day and higher pain intensity nighttime attacks than men. j.

Treatment

in regard to acute treatment women statistically were less response to sumatriptan injectable and nasal spray than men, but statistically more likely to respond to inhaled lidocaine. There was equal efficacy in the sexes to inhaled oxygen but slower response in women. For preventive treatment no significant gender differences were noted, but overall women were less responsive to almost all preventives than men. k. Diagnostic delay: there remains a significant diagnostic delay for cluster headache patients in both sexes but women were more likely to be diagnosed after 10 years of symptom onset than males and significantly fewer women were diagnosed correctly at an initial physician visit than men. l. Female specific issues: cluster headache does not appear to be influenced by menses or menopause but 50% of the survey responders stated their headaches improved with pregnancy. Cluster headache does not appear to alter fertility rates in female cluster headache sufferers. m. Personal burden: cluster headache causes significantly more personal burden in women than men with more loss of employment and/or need of disability, as well as more homebound days.

Conclusion

Overall women and men with cluster headache have a similar presentation but there are some distinct differences that have been suggested in smaller studies of female cluster headache that we have now verified, while some of our study conclusions have not been shown previously. One major limitation to the study is a lack of validation of diagnosis. A substantial false positive cluster headache diagnosis rate, especially in females, cannot be excluded by the study methods utilized.

### Etiology… [^112vg3Yd]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and optimal management of cluster headache remain challenging. This most painful of primary headaches affects 0. 1 percent of adults. Clinical Features and Classification In 2004, the International Headache Society published new criteria for diagnosing cluster headache. To fulfill criteria for diagnosis, patients must have had at least five attacks occurring from one every other day to eight per day; and attributable to no other disorder. 5 Episodic cluster headache is defined as at least two cluster periods lasting seven to 365 days and separated by pain-free remission periods of one month or longer. Chronic attacks recur over more than one year without remission or with remission lasting less than one month.
5. Called "suicide headache" because of its severity and "alarm clock" headache because of its periodicity, cluster headache is characterized by unilateral excruciating pain in the ocular, frontal, or temporal areas.

Pain often radiates to the upper teeth, jaw, and neck. 6 Other symptoms include facial flushing or pallor, tenderness on palpation of the ipsilateral carotid artery, bradycardia, and abnormal feeling of scalp hairs. The absence of aura, nausea, or vomiting has helped distinguish cluster from migraine headaches, but recent studies indicate that 14 percent of patients with cluster headache experience aura, 51 percent have a personal or family history of migraine, 56 percent report photophobia, 43 percent report phonophobia, and 23 percent report osmophobia. 7 Thus, the presence of aura, nausea, vomiting, or photophobia should not rule out a diagnosis of cluster headache. 8 A characteristic feature of cluster headache, noted by 93 percent of patients in one study, 7 is restlessness, with behaviors such as pacing and rocking the head and trunk with head in hands. 9 Most of these headaches last 15 minutes to three hours and recur at the same time of day, often at night.

Many attacks begin during the first rapid-eye-movement sleep phase. Patients may report a seasonal pattern, with spring and autumn peaks. Cluster headache is diagnosed by history, and the key feature is a pattern of recurrent bouts of near-daily attacks lasting for days, weeks, or months. Patients fearing an attack may be afraid to go to sleep. Precipitants of cluster headache include hypoxia, which may occur with sleep apnea. Vasodilators such as nitroglycerin, alcohol, and carbon dioxide may trigger a headache during a cluster period.

### Management of cluster headache: treatments and their mechanisms [^117Af1Hj]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of cluster headache is similar to that of other primary headache disorders and can be broadly divided into acute and preventive treatments. Acute treatments for cluster headache are primarily delivered via rapid, non-oral routes (such as inhalation, nasal, or subcutaneous) while preventives include a variety of unrelated treatments such as corticosteroids, verapamil, and galcanezumab. Neuromodulation is becoming an increasingly popular option, both non-invasively such as vagus nerve stimulation when medical treatment is contraindicated or side effects are intolerable, and invasively such as occipital nerve stimulation when medical treatment is ineffective. Clinically, this collection of treatment types provides a range of options for the informed clinician. Scientifically, this collection provides important insights into disease mechanisms.

Methods

Two authors performed independent narrative reviews of the literature on guideline recommendations, clinical trials, real-world data, and mechanistic studies.

Results

Cluster headache is treated with acute treatments, bridge treatments, and preventive treatments. Common first-line treatments include subcutaneous sumatriptan and high-flow oxygen as acute treatments, corticosteroids (oral or suboccipital injections) as bridge treatments, and verapamil as a preventive treatment. Some newer acute (non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation) and preventive (galcanezumab) treatments have excellent clinical trial data for episodic cluster headache, while other newer treatments (occipital nerve stimulation) have been specifically tested in treatment-refractory chronic cluster headache. Most treatments are suspected to act on the trigeminovascular system, the autonomic system, or the hypothalamus.

Conclusions

The first-line treatments have not changed in recent years, but new treatments have provided additional options for patients.

### Exploration of prolonged remission and the natural course of cluster headache: an interview-based cohort study [^113Nz5H4]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The aim of this study was to gain rare insight into prolonged cluster headache (CH) remission by (1) identifying patterns and factors associated with and (2) phenotypical changes before prolonged remission. The results can help patients better understand their disease course and uncover mechanisms behind spontaneous remission.

Methods

In this cross-sectional cohort study, all participants with a history of (probable) CH from the Leiden University Medical Center cohort were invited to complete a screening survey. Participants in prolonged remission were invited for a telephone interview. Prolonged remission was defined as (1) no current prophylactic treatment and (2) an attack-free period of ≥ 5 years and/or twice the mean between-episode time. Main outcomes are average age at prolonged remission onset and disease duration. Data were collected between April 10 and August 9, 2024, and analyzed using descriptive and survival statistics.

Results

Of those invited, 43.2% (778/1,801) responded; 625 were included in the survey analysis, and 125 (20%) met prolonged remission criteria during interview. The median age at inclusion was 58 years (interquartile range [IQR] 48–67) with 32% female. Remission occurred on average at age 55 (IQR 48–63) after a disease duration of 23 (15–33) years. In 62% (N = 78), remission occurred abruptly. Of those with gradual remission (38%, N = 47), attack frequency (65%) and intensity (59%) decreased and between-episode intervals increased (52%) before remission. Probability of prolonged remission was higher in those with episodic CH (hazard ratio [HR] 6.60, 95% CI 3.55–12.31), who had quit smoking (HR 2.53, 95% CI 1.66–3.86), who had a higher attack intensity (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.08–1.52), and who had a higher age at disease onset (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03–1.06).

Discussion

This cohort offers rare insight into prolonged CH remission, typically starting around the mid-50s after 25 years of active disease. Prolonged remission is not tied to a single factor such as disease duration. Remission onset does not peak at a specific age, and disease duration varies widely between patients with remission. Remission probability is higher in the episodic form despite a longer disease duration compared with the chronic form. The association between quitting smoking and prolonged remission supports a causal link with smoking and disease activity. These preliminary retrospective results require confirmation in future studies.

### Scoping review: the role of psychedelics in the management of chronic pain [^114avqtu]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Cluster Headache

The use of psychedelics for the management of chronic pain caused by cluster headaches was explored in a survey study that included 53 patients who had used psilocybin and/or LSD to treat their cluster headaches. Of these users, 22 of 26 psilocybin users reported that it aborted headache episodes, while 25 of 48 psilocybin users and 7 of 8 LSD users reported cluster period termination. Of the psilocybin and LSD users, 18 of 19 and 4 of 5, respectively, reported remission period extension. This study was the first of its kind to explore the use of sub-hallucinogenic doses of psychedelics for the treatment of cluster headaches.

Given that the promising results of psychedelics in treating cluster headache are limited by the hallucinogenic properties and the Schedule I controlled drug classification, a modified form of LSD was developed. Alteration of the LSD compound's chemical structure (hydrogenation of the double bond in the D ring and substitution with a bromine group at the R2) results in the loss of its hallucinogenic properties. Using this saturated and brominated version, 2-bromo-LSD, which had been previously tested in vascular headaches, an open, nonrandomized case series was performed. Patients were administered orally 30 micrograms/kg/body weight of 2-bromo-LSD once every 5 days for a total of 3 doses to 5 patients (1 with episodic and 4 with chronic) cluster headaches who were resistant to conservative and/or invasive management. One patient reported resolution of her cluster headaches for > 6 months, and 2 reported significant reduction in episode frequency, remission for 1 month, and converted to episodic cluster headaches. One patient reported a significant reduction in headache frequency with remission lasting < 1 month but was able to discontinue acute headache management medications. Finally, while the final patient reported a profound reduction in pain acutely, the patient unfortunately did not experience long-term pain reduction, although reported a reduction in attack intensity.

### European Academy of Neurology guidelines on the treatment of cluster headache [^111RHZ2m]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Cluster headache is a relatively rare, disabling primary headache disorder with a major impact on patients' quality of life. This work presents evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of cluster headache derived from a systematic review of the literature and consensus among a panel of experts.

Methods

The databases PubMed (Medline), Science Citation Index, and Cochrane Library were screened for studies on the efficacy of interventions (last access July 2022). The findings in these studies were evaluated according to the recommendations of the European Academy of Neurology, and the level of evidence was established using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation).

Recommendations

For the acute treatment of cluster headache attacks, there is a strong recommendation for oxygen (100%) with a flow of at least 12L/min over 15min and 6mg subcutaneous sumatriptan. Prophylaxis of cluster headache attacks with verapamil at a daily dose of at least 240mg (maximum dose depends on efficacy and tolerability) is recommended. Corticosteroids are efficacious in cluster headache. To reach an effect, the use of at least 100mg prednisone (or equivalent corticosteroid) given orally or at up to 500mg iv per day over 5days is recommended. Lithium, topiramate, and galcanezumab (only for episodic cluster headache) are recommended as alternative treatments. Noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation is efficacious in episodic but not chronic cluster headache. Greater occipital nerve block is recommended, but electrical stimulation of the greater occipital nerve is not recommended due to the side effect profile.

Regarding medical management for cluster headache, more specifically with respect to preventative therapy, triptans, EAN 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering frovatriptan 2.5–5 mg/day as a short-term prophylaxis and in patients with attacks during the night. Consider offering 2.5 mg PO in the late evening if attacks occur at night.

### Exploration of prolonged remission and the natural course of cluster headache: an interview-based cohort study [^116ZmXBR]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In comparison with earlier studies, in our cohort, prolonged remission occurred when patients were older and had a longer disease duration, despite having a similar age at onset of CH. Contrary to our observations in the outpatient headache clinic, our results indicate that older individuals with a long disease duration can still have active CH. Perhaps, the lack of older patients in the outpatient clinic is not caused by a lack of disease, but the fact that "experienced" CH patients with a long disease duration no longer consult a doctor at recurrence of headache attacks because they are familiar with the pain and possible treatments.

The observation that prolonged remission is not preceded by 1 unique pattern but can occur abruptly or gradually likely explains the discrepancy between reports that describe unchanged phenotypes during the disease course on one hand and improving CH symptoms before prolonged remission on the other hand. In some of our patients, the disease course remained unchanged for decades, while in others, CH symptoms gradually ameliorated. In addition to the previously reported observation of lengthening between-episode interval without shortening of the episodes before prolonged remission, we also observed a decrease in attack frequency and intensity.

The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 5) shows a slower remission rate than might be expected when compared with the median disease duration of 23 years in participants with remission. The discrepancy is caused by the methodological differences between survival analyses and descriptive statistics. The Kaplan-Meier analysis includes the total population, resulting in a reduced sample size at the end of follow-up because the total follow-up duration (CH onset until remission or inclusion) was not the same for all participants. It uses censoring to account for the possibility of patients whose CH will remit in the future, and it does not assume that all patients will eventually go into remission but represents the probability of remission over time for the entire population, including those who may never achieve it. Therefore, the discrepancy between the descriptive statistic and survival analysis is likely due to a combination of factors: differences in methodology and, therefore, interpretation; a decreasing sample size with longer follow-up; and the unanswered question of whether all patients with CH will eventually achieve remission.

### Prevalence of pre-cluster symptoms in episodic cluster headache: is it possible to predict an upcoming bout? [^116B2scp]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Early symptoms prior to a cluster headache bout have been reported to occur days or weeks before the actual beginning of the cluster headache bouts. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of pre-cluster (premonitory) symptoms and examine the predictability of an upcoming cluster headache bout.

Methods

100 patients with episodic cluster headache were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. All patients underwent a semi-structured interview including 25 questions concerning pre-cluster symptoms.

Results

Pre-cluster symptoms were reported by 86% of patients with a mean of 6.8 days (interquartile range 3–14) preceding the bout. An ability to predict an upcoming bout was reported by 57% with a mean 4.6 days (interquartile range 2–7) before the bout. Occurrence of shadow attacks was associated with increased predictability (odds ratio: 3.06, confidence interval: 1.19–7.88, p -value = 0.020). In remission periods, 58% of patients reported mild cluster headache symptoms and 53% reported occurrence of single shadow attacks.

Conclusions

The majority of episodic cluster headache patients experienced pre-cluster symptoms, and more than half could predict an upcoming bout, suggesting the significant potential of early intervention. Furthermore, the experience of mild cluster headache symptoms and infrequent shadow attacks in remission periods is common and suggest an underlying pathophysiology extending beyond the cluster headache bouts.

### Pathophysiology of cluster headache: a trigeminal autonomic cephalgia [^112oVNgR]. The Lancet: Neurology (2002). Medium credibility.

Cluster headache is a form of primary neurovascular headache with the following features: severe unilateral, commonly retro-orbital, pain accompanied by restlessness or agitation, and cranial (parasympathetic) autonomic symptoms, such as lacrimation or conjunctival injection. It occurs in attacks typically of less than 3 h in length and in bouts (clusters) of a few months during which the patient has one or two attacks per day. The individual attack involves activation of the trigeminal-autonomic reflex; thus, such headaches can be broadly classified with the other trigeminal-autonomic cephalgias, such as paroxysmal hemicrania and the syndrome of short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing. Observations of circadian biological changes and neuroendocrine disturbances have suggested a pivotal role for the hypothalamus in cluster headache. Functional neuroimaging with PET and anatomical imaging with voxel-based morphometry have identified the posterior hypothalamic grey matter as the key area for the basic defect in cluster headache.

### Recent advances in diagnosing, managing, and understanding the pathophysiology of cluster headache [^112Y5G6f]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Cluster headache, characterised by attacks of severe, recurrent, unilateral headache and ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms, remains a primary headache with an elusive pathophysiology. Recent advances have introduced effective treatments and broadened understanding of the clinical features of cluster headache. These features are similar in patients globally, but regional differences in prevalence and burden exist. International collaborations have led to identification of eight genetic loci associated with cluster headache. The pathophysiological mechanisms are still not fully understood but recent studies show that targeting the trigeminal autonomic reflex by neurostimulation, or targeting the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), might lessen the attack burden. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved galcanezumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CGRP, as the first specific preventive treatment for episodic cluster headache. However, a preventive effect was not replicated in chronic cluster headache, and the European Medicines Agency did not approve galcanezumab, restricting its availability in Europe. Owing to the low prevalence of cluster headache, continued collaboration through multicentre clinical trials and data sharing will be imperative for further breakthroughs in understanding and management.

### Sex differences in clinical features, treatment, and lifestyle factors in patients with cluster headache [^1117pwdk]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

The literature is conflicting when comparing the clinical presentation of cluster headache in male and female patients. Although some studies could not see major differences in clinical characteristics between the sexes, others have observed discrepancies in age at onset, pain location, attack duration, associated symptoms, and comorbid conditions, such as depression.

Because there appears to be a clear divergence for various aspects of cluster headache in male and female participants, we performed an in-depth analysis of a large validated cluster headache cohort. We examined and compared not only clinical phenotype and patterns of chronobiology but also heredity, treatment, trigger, and lifestyle factors between male and female patients with cluster headache from Sweden.

### Sex differences in clinical features, treatment, and lifestyle factors in patients with cluster headache [^1169ZacQ]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cluster headache is a severely painful primary headache disorder characterized by unilateral, orbitally located head pain and is often accompanied by autonomic symptoms, such as lacrimation or ptosis, or a feeling of restlessness. During an active bout, headache attacks occur up to 8 times per day and last between 15 and 180 minutes. In patients with episodic cluster headache, active bouts are separated by symptom-free remission periods, whereas in patients with chronic cluster headache, these remissions last less than 3 months per year. As many as 1 per 500 is estimated to have cluster headache, and although it is considered a male-dominated disease, the reported male-to-female ratio has shifted over the years from about 6:1 before 1960 to 5.1–2.5:1 in 2018. This shift is suggested to be an effect of lifestyle changes in both male and female patients, but possibly also due to increased recognition of the disease.

A prominent feature of cluster headache is the striking diurnal and seasonal rhythmicity. For many patients, a cluster bout can arise during a certain time of the year while headache attacks recur with clock-like regularity at the same time of the day, leading to the premise that cluster headache is partly a disease of hypothalamic function and the circadian system. The hypothalamus displays a large variety of functions, such as regulation of metabolic and neuroendocrine processes and sleep and circadian rhythm. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), located within the hypothalamus, is considered the master clock of the brain orchestrating the daily cycles of behavior and physiology by synchronizing the peripheral circadian clocks of the body. The peripheral clocks are regulated on a molecular level by the so-called clock genes, including circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), which has been associated with cluster headache. In addition, studies could detect alterations in hormone levels for patients with cluster headache, including melatonin, supporting a hypothalamic involvement in cluster headache. These findings also pose the question how male and female patients with cluster headache are affected differently by the disease, specifically due to structural and functional sex differences in the hypothalamus. Of interest, the diurnal attack cycle is advanced by 1 hour in male compared with female patients with cluster headache, suggesting sex differences in cluster headache chronobiology.

### Cluster headache in the Taiwanese – a clinic-based study [^116oCJ4V]. Cephalalgia (2004). Low credibility.

Cluster headache has not been fully investigated in Asians. One hundred and four patients (90M/14F; mean age 39.2 ± 12.2 years) with cluster headache were recruited from two major headache clinics in Taiwan. They filled out a structured cluster headache questionnaire. All participants were diagnosed to have episodic cluster headache. Mean age of onset was 26.9 years; mean latency of diagnosis was 8.1 years. A trend of decrease in male/female ratio with time was noted. Seventy-three percent were ex- or current smokers (M: 79%, F: 36%). Restlessness was reported by 51% patients. Only 1 patient (1%) reported visual aura. Patients responded well to standard acute and prophylactic treatment. The monthly incidence of cluster period was inversely related to sunshine duration. Compared to Western series, our patients were different in several aspects including the absence of chronic cluster headaches and a low prevalence of restlessness and aura. Racial and geographical factors might contribute to these discrepancies.

### Neurostimulation in the treatment of primary headaches [^111yyJoQ]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Headache conditions can be classified into episodic and chronic forms (box 1). Chronic headache is a major global health issue affecting up to 4% of the population. Most patients with chronic headache attending neurology centres have chronic migraine or cluster headache. The estimated prevalence of chronic migraine is 2% and of chronic cluster is 0.02%. Although most patients are helped with medical treatments, a significant minority cannot tolerate or prove refractory to pharmacological treatments. Neurostimulation therapies with peripheral or central targets may help these patients. Here, we provide an overview of this emerging field of headache management.

Box 1
Classification of episodic and chronic headache

Episodic headache

Headache occurs on < 15 days a month for > 3 months.

Chronic headache

Headache occurs on > 15 days a month for > 3 months.

### Transition of cluster headache phenotype: an interview-based study [^113z2EKj]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background Cluster headache exists diagnostically in a chronic and episodic variant between which patients can convert. We aimed to describe how many patients change phenotype, elucidate possible factors associated with this transition and identify differences in clinical features between primary and secondary phenotypes. Methods 540 well-defined cluster headache patients according to current ICHD-criteria completed a cross-sectional semi-structured interview. Results Total transition-incidence for the cohort was 20.7%. Conversion from chronic to episodic was reported by 6.3% and transition from episodic to chronic by 14.4% with attack side shift as a possible predictor (p = 0.007). Compared to primary chronic patients, secondary chronic patients had more frequent (60 vs 34 per month, p = 0.0487), but shorter (60 vs 90 minutes, p = 0.041) attacks. Secondary episodic patients experienced shorter remission periods than primary episodic patients (6 vs 11 months, p = 0.010). Treatment response was poor in all groups and only one third had effective prevention. Conclusion Cluster headache is a fluctuating disorder with a fifth of our cohort having experienced at least one phenotype change during course of disease. Apart from attack side shifts, no predictors for transition were identified. Severity differed between primary and secondary subtypes. Overall, there is an urgent need for better understanding of cluster headache.

### Evaluation of guideline-adherent treatment in cluster headache [^117Rr8V6]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Several treatment guidelines exist for cluster headache. However, it is not yet known how many cluster headache patients are treated according to these guidelines.

Methods

We enrolled 434 cluster headache patients with confirmed diagnosis referred to two tertiary pain centers. The history of treatment was registered and analyzed according to the treatment guidelines of the European Federation of Neurological Societies.

Results

Regarding acute attack treatment, 62.1% of the episodic and 71.0% of the chronic cluster headache patients were treated according to the guidelines. The efficacy rate was above 92% in both groups. Regarding prophylactic treatment, 31.3% of the episodic and 50.9% of the chronic cluster headache patients were treated according to the guidelines. The efficacy rate was 92.8% for episodic and 70.9% for chronic cluster headache.

Conclusion

The rate of guideline-adherent treatment in cluster headache is about 70% for acute treatment and about 35% for prophylactic treatment. The efficacy of this treatment is significantly higher than the efficacy of non-guideline-adherent treatment.

### Cyclic nocturnal awakening: a warning sign of a cluster bout [^116r1joA]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cluster headache is an excruciating unilateral headache with autonomic symptoms whose periodic nocturnal activity, which interrupts sleep, has been attributed to a hypothalamic generator.

Case Report

We describe a patient with a longstanding episodic cluster headache who experienced, on two occasions, a period of nocturnal awakenings without pain or autonomic symptoms, lasting one week before the onset of a cluster bout. Awakenings occurred twice/night at the same hours of impending cluster attacks and had no apparent trigger, being unusual for this patient who had no previous sleep disturbances. Neurological examination and brain imaging were normal.

Discussion

This case documents two new aspects of cluster headache. It suggests that repeated nocturnal awakenings can be a warning sign of an impending cluster period, a finding that may have therapeutic implications, and also that hypothalamic activation may begin several days before trigemino-autonomic symptoms, thus behaving as a true bout generator.

### Cluster headache [^116dyag8]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Cluster headache causes severe unilateral temporal or periorbital pain, lasting 15 to 180 minutes and accompanied by autonomic symptoms in the nose, eyes, and face. Headaches often recur at the same time each day during the cluster period, which can last for weeks to months. Some patients have chronic cluster headache without remission periods. The pathophysiology of cluster headache is not fully understood, but may include a genetic component. Cluster headache is more prevalent in men and typically begins between 20 and 40 years of age. Treatment focuses on avoiding triggers and includes abortive therapies, prophylaxis during the cluster period, and long-term treatment in patients with chronic cluster headache. Evidence supports the use of supplemental oxygen, sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan for acute treatment of episodic cluster headache. Verapamil is first-line prophylactic therapy and can also be used to treat chronic cluster headache. More invasive treatments, including nerve stimulation and surgery, may be helpful in refractory cases.

### Cluster headache in Asian populations: similarities, disparities, and a narrative review of the mechanisms of the chronic subtype [^113GYkXE]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Headache disorders like migraine show geographic and ethnic differences between Asian and European/North American countries. In cluster headache, these differences are rarely mentioned and discussed. This article aimed to review the characteristics of cluster headache in Asian countries and compare the clinical features to those in European and North American populations.

Methods

We conducted a narrative literature review on the demographics, clinical presentations, and treatments of cluster headache in Asian countries.

Results

Patients with cluster headache in Asian populations showed a stronger male predominance compared to European and North American populations. Chronic cluster headache was rare in Asian countries. The clinical presentation of restlessness was not as common in Asian as it was in European and North American countries, and Asian patients with aura were extremely rare. Patients in Asian countries may have a lower circadian rhythmicity of cluster headache and a lower headache load, as demonstrated by lower attack frequencies per day, bout frequencies, and bout durations.

Conclusions

Regional differences in the presentation of cluster headache exist. Greater awareness for cluster headache should be raised in Asian regions, and further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms behind observed differences.

### Exploration of prolonged remission and the natural course of cluster headache: an interview-based cohort study [^113orQwf]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cluster headache (CH) is a very severe form of headache that is characterized by unilateral headache attacks that are accompanied by various ipsilateral autonomic symptoms or restlessness. The prevalence of CH in the general population is around 1 in 1,000.

In episodic CH (ECH), the most common form of the disease, the attacks occur in episodes lasting weeks or months, with remission intervals of months to years. People with chronic CH (CCH, 20% of patients) have headache attacks with less than 3 consecutive months of remission per year. The chronic form can be unremitting from onset (primary CCH) or can evolve from the episodic form (secondary CCH), and the chronic form can become episodic (secondary ECH). The overall incidence of a subtype switch ranges from 20.7% to 31.6%, with a 5-year risk of 12.3% for conversion into secondary CCH and 25% to secondary ECH. Before transitioning from ECH to CCH, an increase in disease burden is commonly observed. Cluster episodes become longer and attacks are more frequent while the attack-free intervals between episodes shorten.

CH typically starts around age 25–35 yearswith a higher age at onset in primary CCH compared with primary ECH for both men and women. While some epidemiologic data are available on the onset of CH, little is known about the "end" of CH. The average disease duration and onset age of prolonged remission have not been described in detail. Based on clinical experience, we assume that CH goes into remission with advancing age, mainly substantiated by the fact that few older persons with CH are treated in outpatient headache clinics. Patients are informed that CH is a self-limiting disease that will remit at some point during their lifetime. Earlier small case series report patients whose CH progressively ameliorated and tended to remit with age. Suggested precipitating factors for prolonged CH remission are increased intervals between episodes and episodes with decreasing seasonality, unilaterality of attacks, and fewer autonomic symptoms. However, no predictor of prolonged remission has been found; the occurrence of prolonged remission seems not directly related to older age, longer disease duration, or an accumulation of lifetime episodes. While the abovementioned supports the hypothesis that CH gradually ameliorates during the disease course, other small studies reported unchanged phenotypes during the course of a follow up period of 3–40 years.

### Characteristics of pre-cluster symptoms in cluster headache: a cross-sectional multicentre study [^113PS5S2]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Contrary to pre-attack symptoms before an individual cluster headache attack, little is known about the pre-cluster symptoms before the onset of cluster bouts. We previously described pre-attack symptoms before cluster headache attacks. The aim of this study was to investigate characteristics of pre-cluster symptoms in patients with episodic cluster headache.

Methods

In this multicentre study, 184 patients with episodic cluster headache were recruited between October 2018 and December 2020. They were interviewed by investigators and completed a structured questionnaire. To investigate pre-cluster and pre-attack symptoms, we assessed 20 symptoms and signs using the questionnaire.

Results

The upcoming cluster bout was predictable in 35.3% (n = 65/184) of the patients. When present, pre-cluster symptoms occurred at a median duration of 7 days (interquartile range, 2.3–14 days) before the onset of the cluster bout. Patients with pre-cluster symptoms showed a higher proportion of women, prevalence of pre-attack symptoms and seasonal rhythmicity, frequency of cluster headache attacks per day, and total number of cluster bouts compared to patients without pre-cluster symptoms. In univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses, female sex was associated with the predictability of pre-cluster symptoms (odds ratio = 2.297, p = 0.016).

Conclusions

The upcoming cluster bout was predicted in approximately 35% of patients with episodic cluster headache, which may allow for an earlier preventive treatment and help understand the pathophysiology.

### Managing cluster headache [^1167mHjp]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Melatonin

There are many plausible theories to explain the potential link between melatonin and cluster headache attacks. Melatonin 10 mg at night can help to prevent attacks of episodic cluster headache, however, a trial of melatonin in chronic cluster headachecould not reproduce that positive effect. However, one might argue that the formulation used or the timing of dosing might have been confounding factors.

Due to its tolerable side effect profile, melatonin is still widely used in preventing cluster headache, at doses between 10 and 25 mg in the evening.

Topiramate

The evidence for efficacy of topiramate in preventing cluster headache is limited to an open-label study using high doses (100–200 mg/day) with reported good efficacy in up to more than two thirds of patients.

Side effects are major hurdle for topiramate use, in particular cognitive slowing, teratogenicity, nephrolithiasis and low mood as well as its potential effect on oral contraceptive efficacy, which can be a significant factor on preventive choice.

When to stop preventive therapy

There is no clear guideline on how long to continue oral preventive therapy; it is generally accepted that preventive therapy should continue for up 4 weeks after attacks have settled, as evidenced by lack of 'shadows' or response to triggers, or after the usual length of the bout.

Patients' experience with their previous bouts can guide the decision to stop preventive therapy in episodic cluster headache. It is important to stop preventive treatment after each bout and not to have patients simply continue, given the wide range of side effects as well as the possibility of losing efficacy. When restarting a preventive such as verapamil for future bouts, there is usually no need to retitrate; provided the baseline ECG is normal, patients can be restarted at the dose that was effective for the last bout.

### Emerging treatments for cluster headache: hopes and disappointments [^112xfpHR]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cluster headache stands among the worst debilitating pain conditions. Available treatments for cluster headache have often disabling side effects, are not tolerated, or are ineffective. The management of drug-refractory chronic forms is challenging. New treatments are warranted and reported here.

Recent Findings

In cluster headache acute treatment, delivery systems like Demand Valve Oxygen or nonrebreather-type masks could enhance the effectiveness of inhaled oxygen therapy. Noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation relieves cluster headache pain at short-term in episodic patients. Sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation combines acute and preventive properties in subsets of patients and is of interest in selected refractory chronic forms. In cluster headache prevention, 'hypothalamic' deep brain stimulation is being refined using slightly different stereotactic coordinates or lower risk methods like endoventricular stimulation. Anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies provide interesting results in episodic cluster headache, have a good safety profile, but do not appear effective in chronic cluster headache.

Summary

These novel approaches provide additional alternatives to conventional cluster headache management, but results obtained in chronic forms are often disappointing. Research on cluster headache is often hampered by the lack of awareness in the medical world and by the relatively low prevalence of cluster headache compared with migraine. However, common features shared by these two primary headaches could help developing disease-specific therapies.

### Sex differences in clinical features, treatment, and lifestyle factors in patients with cluster headache [^116cNyqL]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Cluster headache is considered a male-dominated disorder, but we have previously suggested that female patients may display a more severe phenotype. Studies on sex differences in cluster headache have been conflicting; therefore, this study, with the largest validated cluster headache material at present, gives more insights into sex-specific characteristics of the disease. The objective of this study was to describe sex differences in patient demographics, clinical phenotype, chronobiology, triggers, treatment, and lifestyle in a Swedish cluster headache population.

Methods

Study participants were identified by screening medical records from 2014 to 2020, requested from hospitals and neurology clinics in Sweden for the ICD-10 code G44.0 for cluster headache. Each study participant answered a detailed questionnaire on clinical information and lifestyle, and all variables were compared with regard to sex.

Results

A total of 874 study participants with a verified cluster headache diagnosis were included. Of the participants, 575 (66%) were male and 299 (34%) were female, and biological sex matched self-reported sex for all. Female participants were to a greater extent diagnosed with the chronic cluster headache subtype compared with male participants (18% vs 9%, p = 0.0002). In line with this observation, female participants report longer bouts than male participants (p = 0.003) and used prophylactic treatment more often (60% vs 48%, p = 0.0005). Regarding associated symptoms, female participants experienced ptosis (61% vs 47%, p = 0.0002) and restlessness (54% vs 46%, p = 0.02) more frequently compared with male participants. More female than male study participants had a positive family history of cluster headache (15% vs 7%, p = 0.0002). In addition, female participants reported diurnal rhythmicity of their attacks more often than male participants (74% vs 63%, p = 0.002). Alcohol as a trigger occurred more frequently in male participants (54% vs 48%, p = 0.01), whereas lack of sleep triggering an attack was more common in female participants (31% vs 20%, p = 0.001).

Discussion

With this in-depth analysis of a well-characterized cluster headache population, we could demonstrate that there are significant differences between male and female participants with cluster headache, which should be regarded at the time of diagnosis and when choosing treatment options. The data suggest that female patients generally may be more gravely affected by cluster headache than male patients.

### Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled study of galcanezumab in patients with chronic cluster headache: results from 3-month double-blind treatment [^1169bBT5]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cluster headache (CH) is a primary headache disorder characterized by attacks of intense unilateral headache, restlessness or agitation, and ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. Attacks occur near daily to multiple times daily during cluster periods. The two subtypes, episodic CH (eCH) and chronic CH (cCH), are differentiated by the presence and duration of attack-free remission periods. Chronic cluster headache, affecting up to 20% of patients, is associated with cluster periods lasting 1 year or longer without remission or with remission periods lasting less than 3 months. The disease burden of cCH is substantial. Current guidelines for CH prevention are based on a small body of evidence and few controlled trials. Additional evidence-based preventive treatments are needed.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is implicated in the pathophysiology of CH and migraine. CGRP is highly expressed in anatomical locations activated during cluster headache and migraine, such as the trigeminal ganglion neurons and peripheral projections of the trigeminal nerve. Similar to migraine, CGRP levels were elevated during CH attacks in patients with eCH and normalized after spontaneous resolution or acute treatment with oxygen or subcutaneous sumatriptan. More recently, infusion of CGRP was shown to induce cluster headache attacks in patients with episodic and less predictably in chronic CH.

Galcanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds CGRP and prevents its biological activity. In Phase 3 trials in patients with episodic and chronic migraine, galcanezumab treatment demonstrated clinically meaningful changes in migraine headache days, and a favorable safety profile. Galcanezumab also demonstrated efficacy in reducing CH attack frequency in a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with eCH. Here we report results from the 12-week double-blind period of a Phase 3 trial of galcanezumab in patients with cCH that have been reported in abstract form previously.

### Recent advances in the diagnosis and management of cluster headache [^115mxdTu]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Cluster headache, a primary headache disorder, consists of short (15–180 minutes), frequent (up to eight a day), unilateral attacks of facial pain with associated ipsilateral autonomic features and restlessness. The attacks are suspected to be one of the most painful human experiences, and the disorder is associated with a high rate of suicidal ideation. Proper diagnosis is key, as some of the most effective treatments, such as high flow oxygen gas, are rarely used in other headache disorders. Yet diagnostic delay is typically years for this disorder, as it is often confused with migraine and trigeminal neuralgia, and secondary causes may be overlooked. This review covers the clinical, pathophysiologic, and therapeutic features of cluster headache. Recent updates in diagnosis include the redefinition of chronic cluster headache (remission periods lasting less than three months instead of the previous one month), and recent advances in management include new treatments for episodic cluster headache (galcanezumab and non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation).

### Cluster headache pathophysiology-insights from current and emerging treatments [^114dzHhZ]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Cluster headache is a debilitating primary headache disorder that affects approximately 0.1% of the population worldwide. Cluster headache attacks involve severe unilateral pain in the trigeminal distribution together with ipsilateral cranial autonomic features and a sense of agitation. Acute treatments are available and are effective in just over half of the patients. Until recently, preventive medications were borrowed from non-headache indications, so management of cluster headache is challenging. However, as our understanding of cluster headache pathophysiology has evolved on the basis of key bench and neuroimaging studies, crucial neuropeptides and brain structures have been identified as emerging treatment targets. In this Review, we provide an overview of what is known about the pathophysiology of cluster headache and discuss the existing treatment options and their mechanisms of action. Existing acute treatments include triptans and high-flow oxygen, interim treatment options include corticosteroids in oral form or for greater occipital nerve block, and preventive treatments include verapamil, lithium, melatonin and topiramate. We also consider emerging treatment options, including calcitonin gene-related peptide antibodies, non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation, sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation and somatostatin receptor agonists, discuss how evidence from trials of these emerging treatments provides insights into the pathophysiology of cluster headache and highlight areas for future research.

### Effect of calcitonin gene-related peptide (-receptor) antibodies in chronic cluster headache: results from a retrospective case series support individual treatment attempts [^113YRD3a]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

The data from two patients who, in spite of a good response, were treated for only 1 month (Figure 1(b)) suggest that the effect of CGRP(R) antibody treatment may rapidly decline starting from week 5 (this result is purely exploratory and has to be confirmed in larger samples). It is not known if this would be different after several months of continued treatment. In migraine, a rather gradual decline of effect has been reported after discontinuation of a 6–12 month CGRP(R) antibody treatment.

We also tested if demographic or cluster headache characteristics were associated with treatment response. No such association was found for age, gender, duration of cluster headache in years, total number of previous preventive treatments, and number of attacks per week at baseline. This is similar to the results of the galcanezumab RCT, which also did not identify any interaction with age, sex, or baseline attack frequency. The number of patients treated with erenumab (n = 6) vs. galcanezumab (n = 16) was too small to derive a meaningful comparison between substances. This will have to be analysed when more cases become available. While this manuscript was under review, a case series reporting five cluster headache patients treated with erenumab because of concomitant migraine was published. All five patients had an improvement of their cluster headache, but only after 3 months of treatment with erenumab at the high dose (140 mg), so maybe our case series underestimated the effect of erenumab.

### Impact of galcanezumab on total pain burden: a post hoc analysis of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with episodic cluster headache [^113yhWHa]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Episodic cluster headache (CH) is a debilitating disease characterized by daily attacks of intense unilateral headache with autonomic symptoms such as lacrimation, nasal congestion, forehead and facial sweating, restlessness, and agitation. The headache attacks occur over periods lasting from 7 days to 1 year and are separated by pain-free periods of at least 3 months. Patients with episodic CH can experience multiple, sometimes excruciatingly painful, headache attacks each day, lasting from 15 minutes to 3 hours. The pain associated with CH has been described as one of the most severe types of pain experienced by humans; consequently, the disease has a significant negative impact on patients' health-related quality of life. The periods of CH attack can increase the risk of self-injurious behaviorand suicidal ideation.CH also poses a significant economic burden due to absenteeism and presenteeism.

The realistic goal of treatment for episodic CH is to shorten the cluster period and to reduce the frequency and/or severity of CH attacks. Guidelines recognize the need for both acute (abortive) treatment (treatment taken at the start of a headache attack to shorten the attack duration and reduce its severity) and preventive treatment (prophylaxis; treatment to reduce the frequency of headache attacks, starting as early as possible after the start of a new cluster period). For acute treatment, subcutaneous or intranasal sumatriptan and high-flow oxygen are recommended. For preventive treatment, verapamil and lithium are among the treatment options used. Some preventive treatments (such as suboccipital corticosteroid injections or oral steroids), known as transitional treatments, are reserved for short-term use or for "bridge" therapy to provide rapid relief, while another preventive treatment (such as verapamil) takes effect.

### Headache management: pharmacological approaches [^1172UUof]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Cluster headache

Cluster headache is the most common of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. Patients experience excruciating unilateral pain lasting 15–180 min at an attack frequency of 1–8 per day, usually at predictable times. The attacks occur in bouts of weeks to months and may repeat multiple times in a year with circannual periodicity. Pain is typically in an orbital, supraorbital and temporal distribution with associated autonomic features and agitation. Around 80% of cluster is episodic but in about 1 in 10 becomes chronic — headache attacks occurring for over 12 months without remission or with remission periods of less than 1 month.

### Medication-overuse headache: a review [^116NJEAj]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Pathogenesis

Approximately half of those who experience headache on ≥ 15 days per month have MOH. Most headache experts regard the association between overuse of acute medication and development of MOH as causal. Improvement in two thirds to three quarters of patients after successful medication withdrawal supports its causative role in generating or maintaining chronic headache. However, it is still a matter of debate whether the overuse is a consequence or cause of chronic headache. Further, not all headache patients with medication-overuse develop MOH, and the mechanism behind how chronic exposure to abortive medication leads to MOH remains unclear.

Virtually all acute headache medication may cause MOH. It has been suggested that the mean critical duration of overuse is shortest for triptans (1.7 years), longer for ergotamine (2.7 years), and longest for simple analgesics (4.8 years). The mean critical monthly intake frequency in the same study was lowest for triptans, higher for ergotamine, and highest for analgesics.

A pre-existing headache disorder seems to be required to develop MOH. Patients with migraine or tension-type headache have a higher potential for developing MOH than other primary headaches. However, patients with cluster headaches may also develop MOH, but most of these patients have co-occurrence of migraine or a positive family history of migraine.MOH does not develop in persons without a history of headache when medication is taken regularly for other conditions, such as arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, a connection between headache-specific pain pathways and the effects of headache medication seems to be a central factor in generating a more chronic pain. However, since the different primary headaches have different underlying pathophysiology, and the different medications have different pharmacological actions, it is unlikely that MOH is caused by the specific action of any single agent. Mechanisms may differ from one class of overused drug to another, and different possible pathogenetic mechanisms have been suggested. It is of course possible that there is a common as yet unknown mechanism by which pharmacologically different medications lead to MOH independently of underlying primary headache. However, at present, it is possible only to describe mechanisms (mostly from preclinical studies) that appear to be associated with or may predispose people to develop MOH.

### Differential efficacy of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation for the acute treatment of episodic and chronic cluster headache: a meta-analysis [^113kGrgG]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cluster headache is a highly disabling brain disorder typically characterized by attacks of excruciating unilateral headache associated with ipsilateral cranial autonomic features and often an urge to move. Attacks last from 15 minutes to 3 hours and may occur up to eight times a day, frequently at night. About 80% of patients have episodic cluster headache, in which attacks come in periods lasting from 1 week to several months and are separated by attack-free periods of more than 1 month. The remaining 20% experience chronic cluster headache, in which attacks continue to recur for more than 1 year without attack-free periods longer than a month.

Research into differential treatment effects among episodic and chronic cluster headache subtypes warrants further attention in clinical trials. Cluster headache therapy for the acute treatment of both subtypes should preferably have a low adverse event profile and be easy to use and must be fast acting because the pain builds up quickly and is extremely severe. Current acute treatments for cluster headache, although limited, have shown efficacy, but clinical disadvantages include daily dosing limitations, cardiovascular contraindications, inconvenience, and/or unavailability. Pain-free rates of up to 49% (subcutaneous sumatriptan) at 15 minutes have been reported in clinical studies of triptans for the acute treatment of cluster headache, and inhalation of 100% oxygen was shown to relieve attacks at 15 minutes in 78% of patients. Results for episodic and chronic cluster headache subtypes are not commonly evaluated separately, likely because of the much smaller chronic cluster headache subgroups typically enrolled. Studies that separately evaluated both subtypes demonstrated higher treatment effects in episodic cluster headache than in chronic cluster headache but were not powered to dissect any differential effects. Consistent with these findings, recent data suggested that a monoclonal antibody targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand was ineffective for the preventive treatment of chronic cluster headache but effective for preventing attacks in episodic cluster headache.

Figure 1
Flow Diagram Showing Inclusion and Exclusion of Patients With Cluster Headache for Study Participation

A total of 1,484 individuals were recruited for inclusion in our cluster headache biobank. Four hundred ninety-six were excluded due to the following: deceased before study start (n = 17), did not wish to participate (n = 31), or had not replied at the specific time point of data collection (n = 448). A G44.0 diagnosis could not be confirmed in 114, and in total, 874 study participants validated with a G44.0 diagnosis participated in this questionnaire study.

Of interest, the proportion of male participants with chronic cluster headache was lower than for female participants (9.4% vs 18.4%, OR [95% CI]:0.46 [0.31–0.70], p = 0.0002). In line with this observation, bout length, but not attack frequency or attack duration, differed between male and female participants (p = 0.004), with female participants tending to have longer cluster headache bouts than male participants. Pain intensity was reported equally high for both sexes, and associated symptoms occurred similarly except for ptosis (47.0% vs 60.5%, OR [95% CI]:0.58 [0.43–0.76], p = 0.0002) and restlessness (45.6% vs 53.9%, OR [95% CI]:0.72 [0.54–0.95], p = 0.024), which were both more common in participants. The mean body mass index (BMI) differed significantly between male and female participants (26.5 ± 4.1 vs 25.0 ± 4.9, p < 0.0001). In addition, fewer male than female participants have self-reported migraine (12.5% vs 29.4%, OR [95% CI]:0.34 [0.24–0.49], p < 0.0001), and male participants suffered less from tension-type headache than female participants (44.3% vs 57.6%, OR [95% CI]:0.58 [0.44–0.78], p = 0.0002).

### Suboccipital injection with a mixture of rapid-and long-acting steroids in cluster headache: a double-blind placebo-controlled study [^112959ta]. Pain (2005). Low credibility.

Oral steroids can interrupt bouts of cluster headache (CH) attacks, but recurrence is frequent and may lead to steroid-dependency. Suboccipital steroid injection may be an effective 'single shot' alternative, but no placebo-controlled trial is available. The aim of our study was to assess in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial the preventative effect on CH attacks of an ipsilateral steroid injection in the region of the greater occipital nerve. Sixteen episodic (ECH) and seven chronic (CCH) CH outpatients were included. ECH patients were in a new bout since no more than 1 week. After a one-week run-in period, patients were allocated by randomization to the placebo or verum arms and received on the side of attacks a suboccipital injection of a mixture of long- and rapid-acting betamethasone (n = 13; Verum-group) or physiological saline (n = 10; Plac-group). Acute treatment was allowed at any time, additional preventative therapy if attacks persisted after 1 week. Three investigators performed the injections, while four others, blinded to group allocation, followed the patients. Follow-up visits were after 1 and 4 weeks, whereafter patients were followed routinely. Eleven Verum-group patients (3 CCH) (85%) became attack-free in the first week after the injection compared to none in the Plac-group (P = 0.0001). Among them eight remained attack-free for 4 weeks (P = 0.0026). Remission lasted between 4 and 26 months in five patients. A single suboccipital steroid injection completely suppresses attacks in more than 80% of CH patients. This effect is maintained for at least 4 weeks in the majority of them.

### Natural course of untreated cluster headache: a retrospective cohort study [^115HtJa5]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Objective To determine the natural course of cluster headache. Methods We screened patients with cluster headache who were diagnosed at Samsung Medical Center and lost to follow-up for ≥ 5 years. Eligible patients were interviewed by phone about the longitudinal changes in headache characteristics and disease course. Remission was defined as symptom-free 1) for longer than twice the longest between-bout period and 2) for ≥ 5 years. Results Forty-two patients lost to follow-up for mean 7.5 (range, 5.0–15.7) years were included. The length of the last bout did not differ from the first one, while the last between-bout period was longer than the first one (p = 0.012). Characteristics of cluster headache decreased over time: Side-locked unilaterality (from 92.9% to 78.9%), seasonal and circadian rhythmicity (from 63.9% to 60.9% and from 62.2 to 40.5%, respectively), and autonomic symptoms (from 95.2% to 75.0%). Remission occurred in 14 (33.3%) patients at a mean age of 42.3 (range, 27–65) years, which was not different from the age of last bouts in active patients (p = 0.623). There was a trend for more seasonal and circadian predilection at baseline in the active group (p = 0.056 and 0.063, respectively) and fewer lifetime bouts and shorter disease duration in patients in remission (p = 0.063 and 0.090). Conclusions This study first shows the natural courses of cluster headache. Features of cluster headache become less prominent over time. Remission occurred regardless of age. Although no single predictor of remission was found, our data suggest that remission of cluster headache might not be a consequence of more advanced age, longer duration of disease, or accumulation of lifetime bouts.

### Cluster headache: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^116SWVd8]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Cluster headache is a stereotyped primary pain syndrome characterised by strictly unilateral severe pain, localised in or around the eye and accompanied by ipsilateral autonomic features. The syndrome is characterised by the circadian rhythmicity of the short-lived attacks, and the regular recurrence of headache bouts, which are interspersed by periods of complete remission in most individuals. Headaches often start about 1–2 h after falling asleep or in the early morning, and show seasonal variation, suggesting that the hypothalamus has a role in the illness. Consequently, the vascular theory has been superseded by recognition that neurovascular factors are more important. The increased familial risk suggests that cluster headache has a genetic component in some families. Neuroimaging has broadened our pathophysiological view and has led to successful treatment by deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus. Although most patients can be treated effectively, some do not respond to therapy. Fortunately, time to diagnosis of cluster headache has improved. This is probably the result of a better understanding of the pathophysiology in combination with efficient treatment strategies, leading to a broader acceptance of the syndrome by doctors.

Headache

Classification According to the International Headache Society, primary headaches can be classified into migraine headaches, cluster headaches and tension-type headaches. Migraine headaches result from migraine disorders, which are further categorized as migraine with aura, migraine without aura, childhood migraine or retinal migraine depending upon the presentation.– Secondary headaches may be caused due to an underlying disorder such as tumors.
Diagnosis Preliminary diagnosis can be performed through symptom assessment and detailed evaluation of patient profile and history or presence of underlying disorders. A typical migraine attack is triggered by physical activity and may be suspected if symptoms involve severe pulsating or throbbing headache on one or both sides of the head, sometimes accompanied by visual aura, sensitivity to light, nausea or vomiting. Frequently occurring migraine attacks (≥ 15 days per month for > 3 months) despite continuing medication may be regarded as chronic migraine; the duration of headache may be 4–72 hours. Tension-type headaches, also known as ordinary headaches, may be triggered by stress. The pain is usually bilateral, with pressing/tightening quality and is not usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting or light sensitivity. Persistent tension-type headache may indicate the presence of serious underlying disorders. These headaches may last from a few minutes to days (up to 7 days). Cluster headaches usually involve severe unilateral pain around the eyes (orbital pain), forehead or sides of the head (temporal pain). These headaches may last for 10 minutes to 4 hours. Diagnosis by neuroimaging techniques should be reserved for patients who have persistent pain lasting 6-month duration, often in the absence of migraine and accompanied by neurologic symptoms such as confusion, visual problems and hallucinations; also to be used in the case of patients with history of such disorders in the past (B).
Treatment Migraine headache: begin initial treatment with oral triptans (sumatriptan or zolmitriptan), followed by the antiemetics prochlorperazine or chlorpromazine in case of nausea and vomiting (A); opioids and antidepressants may be considered as second-line therapy. In children, initial treatment may be initiated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, followed by sumatriptan nasal spray or oral triptans (A).– Cluster and tension-type headaches: treatment for cluster and tension-type headaches should consist of acetaminophen, low-dose NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac), followed by an NSAID–caffeine or acetaminophen–caffeine combination as second-line therapy (A).–

### Cluster headache: an overview of established and emerging treatments [^115SNisY]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cluster headache is a rare but disabling neurological disorder, characterised, according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders-3 (ICHD-3), by unilateral severe headache with associated autonomic features and agitation. Despite proven abortive and preventive treatments, many cases remain refractory, leading to adverse psychosocial and employment outcomes. Understanding the efficacy of current and emerging therapies may help to improve clinical management of such cases.

This month's journal club reviews three papers relating to treatment of cluster headache. The first explores the effectiveness and adverse effects of a range of acute treatments for cluster headache, based on a large international sample. The second is a pooled analysis of two previous trials evaluating non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) as an acute treatment for cluster headache. The third paper describes a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study assessing the monoclonal antibody galcanezumab as a preventive agent for cluster headache.

Bout frequency and bout duration

The CH bout frequencies in Asian regions also differ from those in European countries. One UK study showed that 43% of episodic CH patients (eCH) had an average of one cluster bout per year, whereas in Norway most patients reported ≥ 2 bouts per year and in Denmark, the average number of bouts per year was 1.9 (28). In a German study, eCH patients had an average bout frequency of 1.2 ± 1.1 per year. In Asian studies, a bout frequency of > 1 per year is relatively rare. In Taiwan, only 11.5% reported ≥ 1 bout per year, and in Japan, most commonly (40%) patients have less than 1 bout per year. In Korea, patients enrolled during their within-bout period presented approximately 1 bout per year, whereas the average inter-bout duration ranged from 16–20 months, and the estimated bout frequency was < 1 per year when patients of within- and inter-bout periods were taken together. In China, most patients with CH had a bout frequency of < 1 per year (38.3%), followed by 1–2 per year (35.8%). Patients in Asian countries may have a lower bout frequency compared to their European and North American counterparts, but this awaits further confirmation by studies using the same methodology to allow for a direct comparison. Before drawing a firm conclusion on differences in bout frequencies between Asian and European/North American regions, we should consider the study settings and inclusion criteria of patient enrolment in these studies. If only patients during a bout are enrolled, they are more likely to have an increased disease activity, thus the bout frequency would be higher compared to studies where all patients regardless of their current status are enrolled. This is also associated with country-specific differences in healthcare systems, which we will discuss in the Limitations section.

### Atypical presentations of cluster headache [^114QQPbS]. Cephalalgia (2002). Low credibility.

Recently, cluster headache has been shown to occur with aura, suggesting that as more cluster patients are seen by headache specialists new forms of this well-defined primary headache syndrome will be identified. This study presents three atypical presentations of cluster headache: persistent or unremitting cluster, periodic cluster, and reflex or event-related cluster. Case reports are presented with an explanation as to why these headaches should be considered cluster headache.

### Transition of cluster headache: depicting side-changing attacks as a chronic trait in an interview-based follow-up study [^111nBWc1]. Cephalalgia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cluster headache presents in an episodic and chronic form, between which patients can convert during the course of disease. We aimed to quantify the rate of cluster headache patients changing phenotype within one and five years and investigate the earlier proposed association between chronification and having side-shifting attacks.

Methods

In total, 430 cluster headache patients well-characterized according to current International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria, who were all participants in a prior transition-study, were re-interviewed in an observational, retrospective, cross-sectional follow-up study design at the Danish Headache Center.

Results

The transition rate for the whole cohort was 6.5% within one year and 19.8% within five years. The risk of becoming chronic if episodic was 4.0% within one year and 12.3% within five years. For conversion from chronic to episodic, the corresponding risk was 11.1% and 25.0%, respectively. Alterations in attack-side were reported in 32% of all chronic patients, generating an odds ratio of 2.24 of being chronic as opposed to episodic if experiencing side-shifting attacks.

Conclusions

A higher transition rate since the original cross-sectional study demonstrates cluster headache as a non-static condition. Identifying a risk of transition within one and five years, based on current phenotype along with high odds of being chronic when experiencing a shift of attack-side, offers a valuable clinical compass in the dialogue with the patient.

### Impact of galcanezumab on total pain burden: a post hoc analysis of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with episodic cluster headache [^111rSsjJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In CH, a study of patients receiving hyperbaric oxygen treatment for preventive treatment of the disease assessed the frequency and severity of headaches by calculating a headache index (sum of [the number of attacks × the degree of severity]). More recently, the Cluster Headache Severity Scale was developed, which includes the three dimensions of attack frequency per day, attack duration (in minutes), and duration of the CH period (in months). This provides a single score ranging from 3 to 12 but does not include a measure of attack severity. A matched-control cohort study used the Cluster Headache Index, which incorporates daily CH attack frequency and duration as well as the duration of each cluster period and the yearly cluster frequency.

Galcanezumab is the first anti-CGRP agent that reduces the frequency of headache attacks to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of episodic CH. Results of the current post hoc analyses suggest that galcanezumab also reduces the total pain burden of this disease when using a composite measure of three pain dimensions (attack frequency, duration, and severity).

### Epidemiology, burden and clinical spectrum of cluster headache: a global update [^115mmjf4]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

This narrative review aims to broaden our understanding of the epidemiology, burden and clinical spectrum of cluster headache based on updated findings with a global perspective.

Methods

We conducted a literature search on the following topics: (a) epidemiology; (b) burden: quality of life, disability, economic burden, job-related burden and suicidality; and (c) clinical spectrum: male predominance and its changes, age, pre-cluster and pre-attack symptoms, aura, post-drome, attack characteristics (location, severity, duration and associated symptoms), bout characteristics (attack frequency, bout duration and bout frequency), circadian and seasonal rhythmicity and disease course.

Results

New large-scale population-based reports have suggested a lower prevalence than previous estimations. The impact of cluster headache creates a significant burden in terms of the quality of life, disability, economic and job-related burdens and suicidality. Several studies have reported decreasing male-to-female ratios and a wide age range at disease onset. The non-headache phases of cluster headache, including pre-cluster, pre-attack and postictal symptoms, have recently been revisited. The latest data regarding attack characteristics, bout characteristics, and circadian and seasonal rhythmicity from different countries have shown variability among bouts, attacks, individuals and ethnicities. Studies on the disease course of cluster headache have shown typical characteristics of attacks or bouts that decrease with time.

Conclusions

Cluster headache may be more than a "trigeminal autonomic headache" because it involves complex central nervous system phenomena. The spectrum of attacks and bouts is wider than previously recognised. Cluster headache is a dynamic disorder that evolves or regresses over time.

### Cluster headache in Asian populations: similarities, disparities, and a narrative review of the mechanisms of the chronic subtype [^1118KCLW]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

The bout duration may be relatively shorter in Asian countries: In China, 42.5% and 75.0% of the patients have a bout duration of ≤ 1 month and ≤ 2 months, respectively; in Japan, 79.0% of CH patients have a bout duration of ≤ 2 months; in Korea, the median bout duration is 4 weeks in eCH patients, whereas another Korean study combining eCH and cCH cases reported a mean of 6.1 weeks; and in Taiwan, the average bout duration was 5 weeks. Compared to an average of 5–6 weeks in Asian countries, most European and North American studies showed an average bout duration of ≥ 8 weeks: 8.6 weeks in the UK, 8.5 weeks in Germany, 8.7 weeks in Norway, and 8.3 weeks in Denmark.

In summary, the frequency and duration of bouts are different in Asian countries compared to European and North American countries. Even though the attack duration is similar, European and North American populations experience more attacks per day. Furthermore, the average bout durations in European and North American countries are longer than those in Asian countries. In short, the headache load in patients with eCH, as defined by the time one experiences headache, is lower in Asian patients with CH compared to European and North American populations.

### Chronic cluster headache is a rare disease: implications for diagnosis, treatment and public health [^1172Pfr2]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

Cluster headache (CH) is a rare and painful primary headache disorder characterized by severe unilateral pain and cranial autonomic symptoms. This perspective examines the epidemiological evidence supporting the classification of chronic cluster headache (CCH) as a rare disease, noting a prevalence of CH of approximately 124 per 100,000 individuals, with only 3.5–13.7% manifesting CCH. This prevalence meets criteria established by both the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for rare disease designation. The rarity of CCH creates substantial clinical and research challenges, including prolonged diagnostic delays, limited research funding and a dearth of approved treatments. The economic burden is particularly notable, with annual costs exceeding €20,000 per patient. Addressing these challenges requires a coordinated approach focusing on increased research funding, enhanced policy advocacy, improved diagnostic training and the development of comprehensive disease registries to advance both patient care and scientific understanding of this devastating neurological condition.

### COVID-19 vaccination elicitedand recurrence of cluster headache: a case series [^115uoy7Q]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent pharmacovigilance studies suggested that cluster headache could be a potential adverse effect after coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccination; however, the possibility of coincidence could not be excluded. Detailed case studies might help elucidate their potential link and implicate potential pathogenic mechanisms.

Methods

Patients who developed cluster headache in close temporal relationship to COVID-19 vaccination were identified from two tertiary medical centers in Japan and Taiwan respectively through 2021–2022. Detailed characteristics of the headaches and time between the onset of the index cluster episode and antecedent COVID-19 vaccination were reported. In patients with previous cluster headaches, the duration from previous bout was also recorded.

Results

Six patients with new cluster headache bout 3–17 days after COVID-19 vaccination were identified. Two of them were de novo cases. The others either had been attack-free for a long time or developed new cluster bout in seasons atypical to prior bouts. The vaccines included mRNA, viral vector, or protein subunit vaccines.

Conclusions

COVID-19 vaccines, regardless of vaccine types, may elicit de novo or relapse of cluster headache. Future studies are needed to confirm the potential causality and explore the potential pathogenic mechanism.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — definite diagnostic thresholds for common primary headaches specify minimum attack counts and durations: tension-type headache requires "at least 10 headaches lasting 30 minutes to 7 days", migraine requires "at least 5 headaches lasting 4–72 hours", and cluster headache requires "at least 5 headaches of severe to very severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, temporal pain or any combination of such pain lasting 15–180 minutes and occurring once every other day to no more than eight times a day". Cluster criteria further state "Either or both autonomic features and a feeling of restless or agitation are required" and "Definite" cluster headache must fulfill all these criteria".

### Exploration of prolonged remission and the natural course of cluster headache: an interview-based cohort study [^113zg2f1]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This cross-sectional observational study provides a comprehensive insight into prolonged remission of CH. Prolonged remission was confirmed in 20% of this cohort. On average, prolonged remission of CH starts at age 55 (48–63) after a disease duration of 23 (15–33) years. Our data did not identify 1 unique pattern preceding prolonged remission. While most reported an abrupt onset of prolonged remission, gradual onset was present in almost 40%. When prolonged remission started gradually, this was characterized by decreased frequency and intensity of cluster attacks and lengthening intervals between episodes before prolonged remission. No common trigger for prolonged remission was reported. In this cohort, patients with ECH who had a higher attack intensity, a higher age at CH onset, and quit smoking had a shorter disease duration before prolonged remission was reached.

In our cohort, almost 90% of intervals between episodes are shorter than 2.5 years, which supports the suitability of our scientific definition for prolonged remission (attack free for ≥ 5 years or twice the mean between-episode time, eFigure 4).

Our findings suggest that prolonged remission is not a direct effect of age or longer disease duration and the clinical observation that prolonged remission seems to be more common in older patients can likely be attributed to cumulative risk. We observed a considerable variation in disease duration until remission, ranging from 6 weeks to 55 years. In addition, the distribution of the age at remission onset does not exhibit a peak at a specific age but instead follows a broad distribution, with the youngest participant achieving remission at 15 and the oldest at 74. Finally, patients with ECH have a higher likelihood of remission despite its longer disease durations compared with those with CCH. Neither selection bias nor differences in prolonged remission criteria between ECH and CCH could explain the high prevalence of episodic patients experiencing prolonged remission, suggesting that this trend is not caused by the study design but may be a feature of prolonged remission. These findings imply that prolonged remission is not merely a result of advancing age or disease duration but rather the result of a complex multifactorial process.

### Treatment of cluster headache: the American Headache Society evidence-based guidelines [^114jidML]. Headache (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cluster headache:

- **Definition**: CH is a primary headache disorder characterized by severe unilateral pain mainly in the first division of the trigeminal nerve accompanied by ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms and a sense of agitation and restlessness during attacks.
- **Pathophysiology**: CH is caused by the activation of trigeminovascular complex and trigeminal-autonomic reflex.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include excruciating, unilateral headache over the peri- and retro-orbital regions and the temple accompanied by ipsilateral lacrimation, eye redness, eye discomfort, ptosis, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, aural fullness, throat swelling, flushing, sense of restlessness, and agitation. Episodic headaches may subsequently become chronic headaches or may remit with age.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: CH is not associated with increased mortality.

### Ten years of chronic cluster – attacks still cluster [^115rvphH]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

The chronic variant can be found in 10–20% of all cluster headache patients. While circadian and circannual rhythmicity are characteristic of the episodic variant, little is known on chronobiology in chronic cluster headache. We report a patient with chronic cluster evolved from episodic who recorded a total of 5447 attacks over 10 years. After spectral analysis, cosinor models were calculated within the frequency ranges of 23–25 h (circadian) and 11–13 months (circannual), respectively. Significant results (P < 0.01) were found for 24-h periods, but not for circannual intervals (12 months). However, with regard to circannual periodicity, a semi-circannual rhythm (5–7 months) was suitable for curve fit and yielded significant results in the cosinor analysis at 6 months (P < 0.05). This remarkable long observation period of 10 years shows that, at least for secondary chronic cluster headache which evolved from the episodic form, a typical circadian and circannual rhythmicity comparable to that of episodic cluster headache exists.

### The spectrum of cluster headache: a case report of 4600 attacks [^1167A7X5]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Knowledge of the clinical features of cluster headache is mainly based on retrospective and cross-sectional studies. Here, we present a case of a chronic cluster headache patient who prospectively recorded timing and clinical features of all attacks for 6 years, aiming to describe the clinical spectrum and timing of cluster headache symptoms experienced and to identify daily and/or seasonal rhythmicity.

Methods

Registration of attack timing, duration, associated symptoms and severity was done prospectively on a smartphone application. Pain severity was recorded on a 0–10 scale. Attacks were divided into mild, moderate, severe, and very severe. We analysed diurnal rhythmicity by multimodal Gaussian analysis and spectral analysis.

Results

In total, 4600 attacks were registered (mean duration 39.3 (SD 18.5) min. Mean severity 3.6 (SD 1.28)). Mild attacks accounted for 14.2%, moderate 65.7%, severe 16.9% and very severe 3.2% of all attacks. Nocturnal attacks were more severe than daytime attacks. The number of autonomic symptoms and duration of attacks increased with pain severity. Peak chronorisk (risk of attacks occurring according to hour of day) was at 12.48 in the registration period. Over time, circadian rhythmicity and attack frequency varied.

Conclusion

Clinical characteristics of cluster headache attacks can vary greatly within the individual patient. Clinicians attempting to personalise the administration of preventive treatment should pay notice to the variation over time in diurnal rhythmicity. The recorded self-limiting mild attacks that do not fulfill the ICHD-3 criteria for a cluster headache attack warrant further investigation, as they could hold important information about disease activity.

### Profile of Chinese cluster headache register individual study (CHRIS): clinical characteristics, diagnosis and treatment status data of 816 patients in China [^116Wng5m]. Cephalalgia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical profile of cluster headache may differ among different regions of the world, warranting interest in the data obtained from the initial Chinese Cluster Headache Register Individual Study (CHRIS) for better understanding.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, prospective, longitudinal cohort study on cluster headache across all 31 provinces of China, aiming to gather clinical characteristics, treatment approaches, imaging, electrophysiological and biological samples.

Results

In total 816 patients were enrolled with a male-to-female ratio of 4.33:1. The mean age at consultation was 34.98 ± 9.91 years, and 24.89 ± 9.77 years at onset. Only 2.33% were diagnosed with chronic cluster headache, and 6.99% had a family history of the condition. The most common bout was one to two times per year (45.96%), lasting two weeks to one month (44.00%), and occurring frequently in spring (76.23%) and winter (73.04%). Of these, 68.50% experienced one to two attacks per day, with the majority lasting one to two hours (45.59%). The most common time for attacks was between 9 am and 12 pm (75.86%), followed by 1 am and 3 am (43.48%). Lacrimation (78.80%) was the most predominant autonomic symptom reported. Furthermore, 39.22% of patients experienced a delay of 10 years or more in receiving a correct diagnosis. Only 35.67% and 24.26% of patients received common acute and preventive treatments, respectively.

Conclusion

Due to differences in ethnicity, genetics and lifestyle conditions, CHRIS has provided valuable baseline data from China. By establishing a dynamic cohort with comprehensive multidimensional data, it aims to advance the management system for cluster headache in China.

### Pre-attack signs and symptoms in cluster headache: characteristics and time profile [^113aK39P]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction In contrast to the premonitory phase of migraine, little is known about the pre-attack (prodromal) phase of a cluster headache. We aimed to describe the nature, prevalence, and duration of pre-attack symptoms in cluster headache. Methods Eighty patients with episodic cluster headache or chronic cluster headache, according to ICHD-3 beta criteria, were invited to participate. In this observational study, patients underwent a semi-structured interview where they were asked about the presence of 31 symptoms/signs in relation to a typical cluster headache attack. Symptoms included previously reported cluster headache pre-attack symptoms, premonitory migraine symptoms and accompanying symptoms of migraine and cluster headache. Results Pre-attack symptoms were reported by 83.3% of patients, with an average of 4.25 (SD 3.9) per patient. Local and painful symptoms, occurring with a median of 10minutes before attack, were reported by 70%. Local and painless symptoms and signs, occurring with a median of 10minutes before attack, were reported by 43.8% and general symptoms, occurring with a median of 20minutes before attack, were reported by 62.5% of patients. Apart from a dull/aching sensation in the attack area being significantly (p < 0.05) more frequent among men and episodic patients, compared with women and chronic patients respectively, no other differences in the prevalence of pre-attack symptoms were identified between groups. Conclusion Pre-attack symptoms are frequent in cluster headache. Since the origin of cluster headache attacks is still unresolved, studies of pre-attack symptoms could contribute to the understanding of cluster headache pathophysiology. Furthermore, identification and recognition of pre-attack symptoms could potentially allow earlier abortive treatment.

### Cluster headache: when to worry? Two case reports [^1166fPhx]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Background The clinical criteria for cluster headache (CH) are included in Chapter 3 of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd beta edition (ICHD-III). CH may sometimes be secondary to other pathologies. Case reports We report two patients in whom the clinical features of CH initially fulfilled the ICHD-III criteria, but who later presented some radical modifications in headache natural history as a result of a secondary pathology. The first case of CH was secondary to a pontine cavernous angioma and the second to a cerebral venous thrombosis. Conclusion We highlight the importance of clinical modifications of CH that could suggest clinical investigations should be performed or repeated to exclude a secondary pathology in a previously diagnosed cluster headache. Some of the pathological mechanisms of CH and brain lesions are discussed.

### Exploration of prolonged remission and the natural course of cluster headache: an interview-based cohort study [^112BGnam]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this cohort provides a rare insight into prolonged CH remission and shows (1) an average age of 30 at CH onset followed by (2) 23 years of active CH before (3) prolonged remission onset when patients reach their mid-50s (eFigure 5). Possible precipitating signs of prolonged remission were decreasing attack frequency and intensity or lengthening between-episode intervals. This study's definition for prolonged remission (attack free for ≥ 5 years or twice the mean between-episode time) was verified as suitable for future research. Prolonged remission seems complex and cannot be attributed to a single factor such as long disease duration. The distribution of remission onset does not peak at a specific age, and disease duration differs greatly between patients. Remission probability is higher in the episodic form despite a longer disease duration compared with the chronic form. The association between quitting smoking and prolonged remission supports a causal link with smoking and disease activity. These preliminary and retrospective results require confirmation in future studies.

Chronic classification across primary headaches is defined differently: for migraine and tension-type headache (TTH), chronic refers to frequent headaches occurring on 15 or more days per month for more than 3 months; for cluster headache, chronic refers to headaches occurring for 1 year or longer without remission or with remission periods lasting fewer than 3 months; because primary headaches are recurrent, a single or first-time headache should prompt appropriate evaluation for secondary causes, and these criteria apply only if the diagnosis is not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.

### More precise phenotyping of cluster headache using prospective attack reports [^1147VEs4]. European Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

The clinical characteristics of cluster headache (CH) are based mainly on retrospective attack descriptions of 'usual' attacks, but whether these reports are reliable is uncertain. The aim was to compare retrospective and prospective attack descriptions and describe the within- and between-patient variability of attacks.

Method

Fifty-seven CH patients underwent a semi-structured interview obtaining a retrospective account of usual CH attacks. Patients thereafter prospectively recorded the clinical characteristics of up to 10 attacks per patient in a headache diary. Four different attack characteristics were investigated: (i) severity, (ii) duration, (iii) number of autonomic symptoms and (iv) number of migrainous symptoms. Retrospective and prospective data were compared. Within- and between-patient variability of attacks was assessed.

Results

Retrospective attack descriptions (n = 57) were significantly longer (P = 0.046) and more severe (P < 0.0001) for untreated attacks compared with prospective reports (n = 500). The number of autonomic symptoms was significantly higher in the retrospective reports compared to the prospective reports (P < 0.0001). Within-patient variability for attack duration, pain severity and number of autonomic and migrainous symptoms was low. Compared to men, more women reported longer (P = 0.026) and more severe (P = 0.028) attacks with more migrainous symptoms (P = 0.033).

Conclusions

Important differences were found between prospectively and retrospectively reported attacks with duration and severity of untreated attacks overestimated in retrospective attack descriptions. CH attacks display low within-patient variability, but the presentation of CH attacks varies between patients. The high prevalence of symptoms typically associated with migraine should raise more diagnostic awareness for CH, especially in women who are more often misdiagnosed as having migraine.

### Cluster-like headache. A comprehensive reappraisal [^116vxGDr]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

Among the primary headaches, cluster headache (CH) presents very particular features allowing a relatively easy diagnosis based on criteria listed in Chapter 3 of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II). However, as in all primary headaches, possible underlying causal conditions must be excluded to rule out a secondary cluster-like headache (CLH). The observation of some cases with clinical features mimicking primary CH, but of secondary origin, led us to perform an extended review of CLH reports in the literature. We identified 156 CLH cases published from 1975 to 2008. The more frequent pathologies in association with CLH were the vascular ones (38.5%, n = 57), followed by tumours (25.7%, n = 38) and inflammatory infectious diseases (13.5%, n = 20). Eighty were excluded from further analysis, because of inadequate information. The remaining 76 were divided into two groups: those that satisfied the ICHD-II diagnostic criteria for CH, 'fulfilling' group (F), n = 38; and those with a symptomatology in disagreement with one or more ICHD-II criteria, 'not fulfilling' group (NF), n = 38. Among the aims of this study was the possible identification of clinical features leading to the suspicion of a symptomatic origin. In the differential diagnosis with CH, red flags resulted both for F and NF, older age at onset; for NF, abnormal neurological/general examination (73.6%), duration (34.2%), frequency (15.8%) and localization (10.5%) of the attacks. We stress the fact that, on first observation, 50% of CLH presented as F cases, perfectly mimicking CH. Therefore, the importance of accurate, clinical evaluation and of neuroimaging cannot be overestimated.

### Long-term occipital nerve stimulation for drug-resistant chronic cluster headache [^114ZxoeU]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction Chronic cluster headache is rare and some of these patients become drug-resistant. Occipital nerve stimulation has been successfully employed in open studies to treat chronic drug-resistant cluster headache. Data from large group of occipital nerve stimulation-treated chronic cluster headache patients with long duration follow-up are advantageous. Patients and methods Efficacy of occipital nerve stimulation has been evaluated in an experimental monocentric open-label study including 35 chronic drug-resistant cluster headache patients (mean age 42 years; 30 men; mean illness duration: 6.7 years). The primary end-point was a reduction in number of daily attacks. Results After a median follow-up of 6.1 years (range 1.6–10.7), 20 (66.7%) patients were responders (≥ 50% reduction in headache number per day): 12 (40%) responders showed a stable condition characterized by sporadic attacks, five responders had a 60–80% reduction in headache number per day and in the remaining three responders chronic cluster headache was transformed in episodic cluster headache. Ten (33.3%) patients were non-responders; half of these have been responders for a long period (mean 14.6 months; range 2–48 months). Battery depletion (21 patients 70%) and electrode migration (six patients - 20%) were the most frequent adverse events. Conclusions Occipital nerve stimulation efficacy is confirmed in chronic drug-resistant cluster headaches even after an exceptional long-term follow-up. Tolerance can occur years after improvement.

### Health-related quality of life in patients with cluster headache during active periods [^112ACCDr]. Cephalalgia (2002). Low credibility.

Cluster headache is characterized by excruciatingly painful headaches which occur one or several times during the day. Little is known about the functional consequences of this severe headache form. We assessed health-related quality of life in 56 consecutive patients, 34 of whom were episodic cluster headache patients during an active period, and 22 had chronic cluster headache. All patients completed the Short Form-36 (SF-36). We found lower scores in the studied patients than in those reported in the general population for all SF-36 domains. For most scales the difference was significant (P < 0.0001, Student's t-test, Bonferroni correction). Our findings suggest that cluster headache has marked functional consequences even when appropriate treatments are used.

### Managing cluster headache [^11574a5q]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical diagnosis

As with most neurological conditions, and certainly with all primary headache disorders, the diagnosis of cluster headache relies on an accurate history. The International Classification of Headache Disorders — 3rd edition outlines the criteria for diagnosis, and although developed for research purposes, it remains a useful practical guide. There are always challenging cases that fall outside any criteria in neurological practice and these will be covered later in this article.

Attack phenotype: Patients describe a cluster headache attack as an intense and severe strictly unilateral pain, typically in the supraorbital, retro-orbital, temporal regions and arising from deep within. It has been said anecdotally, and recently studied, that patients describe it as their worst ever headache, using comparisons such as childbirth, fractures and renal stones. The pain ramps up quite quickly once it starts and typically remains for 15–180 min when untreated. During this time, patients are agitated and restless, preferring to rock in a sitting position, pace, fidget and push their hands into the area of most pain. Cluster headache attacks can occur once every other day in the start of a bout and increase to up to eight times a day. The attacks can have a circadian pattern with a nocturnal preference. They are usually associated with prominent cranial autonomic symptoms: lacrimation, conjunctival injection, nasal symptoms, aural fullness, periorbital swelling, ptosis or miosis, which are ipsilateral to the pain.

Attack patterns: Cluster headache is subdivided into episodic and chronic cluster headache depending on the duration between attacks. Patients with episodic cluster headache have 'bouts', describing when they have a cluster of attacks. These bouts tend to last 6–12 weeks and often have a circannual pattern, with more attacks in the spring or autumn. Patients are deemed to have episodic cluster headache if the break between the bouts lasts longer than 3 months, while not taking a preventive treatment. Patients have bouts of attacks with breaks of less than 3 months between are classified as having chronic cluster headache. This differentiation, although somewhat arbitrary, has important management implications. When in bout, cluster headache attacks can be triggered by alcohol, food containing nitrates, nitroglycerinand strong odours such as petroleum, paint and nail varnish.
