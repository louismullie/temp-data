## Question

Cons of Methylphanidate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of the cons (harms, risks, uncertainties) of methylphenidate, organized by category and supported by evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-level regulatory and evidence-quality constraints that frame risk interpretation. Then, I should categorize adverse effects by organ system and clinical severity. Next, I will examine special populations and long-term outcomes. After that, I need to assess evidence quality, bias, and uncertainty. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical implications and monitoring recommendations, while double-checking areas where the literature is conflicting or underpowered.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory and evidence-quality context, because that shapes how confident we can be about any risk estimate. Methylphenidate carries boxed warnings for abuse, misuse, and addiction, and for serious cardiovascular events, which immediately flags these as top-tier safety concerns that must be screened for and monitored in all patients [^notfound] [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify the certainty of benefit–harm data: multiple high-quality systematic reviews and guideline appraisals conclude that the certainty of evidence for both benefits and harms is very low, largely due to high risk of bias, short durations, and selective reporting, which means true risk magnitudes remain uncertain and may be underestimated in trials [^117NtF7x] [^1124UCwg] [^112tnJo1] [^115BuZ5J].

> Now, I will examine abuse, misuse, and dependence liability, since this is a boxed warning and a frequent clinical concern. Methylphenidate is a Schedule II controlled substance with high abuse and misuse potential; misuse can precipitate overdose and death, and risk rises with higher doses or non-oral routes like snorting or injection, so I need to ensure pre-prescription risk assessment, secure storage counseling, and ongoing monitoring are routine [^111w6P1J] [^114DybZK] [^112SQb6P]. Wait, let me verify formulation nuances: extended-release formulations reduce, but do not eliminate, abuse potential compared with immediate-release, so diversion risk remains clinically relevant, especially in adolescents and young adults [^114TCdAZ].

> Next, I should review serious cardiovascular risks, because these are rare but potentially catastrophic. Sudden death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and hypertension have been reported at therapeutic doses; labels advise avoiding use in patients with structural cardiac disease, cardiomyopathy, serious arrhythmias, or coronary artery disease, and mandate evaluation of exertional chest pain or syncope during therapy [^notfound] [^113y7HgL]. I need to check the magnitude of short-term risk signals: a large 2024 cohort suggests a small, approximately 10% relative increase in cardiovascular events within 6 months of initiation, with absolute risk remaining low in typical users, but this reinforces the need for individualized risk–benefit assessment and baseline cardiovascular screening in those with risk factors [^114WaYZE] [^1174iwTt]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: case-only analyses also describe a transient early-treatment signal for arrhythmias in high-risk cardiac populations, underscoring early monitoring after initiation rather than blanket avoidance in all patients [^116ggLk8].

> I will now examine common non-serious adverse effects, because these drive tolerability and adherence. Very common effects include insomnia, decreased appetite, weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, irritability, and emotional lability; these occur in a substantial proportion of patients and often necessitate dose adjustments or discontinuation if persistent [^114mCerE] [^113JF5di] [^115pKEWG]. Let me double-check quantitative estimates: meta-analyses in children show a 29% relative increase in any non-serious adverse event versus placebo, with particularly large increases for decreased appetite and sleep problems, which aligns with clinical experience and mandates anticipatory guidance and monitoring plans [^111N3rU7] [^115BuZ5J].

> But wait, what about growth effects in pediatrics, since families frequently worry about stunting. Consistently medicated children may show a temporary slowing of growth averaging about 2 cm less height and 2.7 kg less weight over 3 years, though growth often attenuates over time; thus, growth should be monitored and treatment interruptions considered if growth falters [^111fsTdS]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should reconcile this with newer data: the 2-year ADDUCE study did not find a significant effect on height velocity after 24 months, suggesting that long-term growth suppression may be less pronounced than older estimates, but the directionality of small vital sign increases still warrants routine monitoring [^116ajxaS].

> I need to check psychiatric adverse effects, including psychosis and mania, because these are rare but clinically consequential. Labels warn that stimulants can induce new psychotic or manic symptoms even without prior history, with pooled estimates around 0.1% in short-term trials, and they can exacerbate preexisting psychosis or precipitate manic episodes in bipolar spectrum patients, so screening and prompt discontinuation if symptoms emerge are essential [^1138o1Ji] [^116QxGYv]. Hold on, I should verify population-level signals: large observational data suggest a small absolute increase in psychotic events, particularly early after initiation, though confounding by indication remains a concern; nonetheless, this reinforces caution in patients with personal or family history of psychosis or mania and the need for close early follow-up [^116uVh6z] [^114GAGMe].

> Let me consider other serious but uncommon adverse effects so I don't miss clinically important warnings. Priapism, including prolonged painful erections requiring surgical intervention, has been reported and warrants urgent care if it occurs; peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon and rare digital ulceration, can emerge at therapeutic doses; and hematologic abnormalities such as thrombocytopenia and leukopenia have been described in postmarketing reports, so new bruising, infections, or mucocutaneous bleeding should prompt evaluation [^1125uLka] [^114RM5f4]. I should confirm seizure considerations: large observational studies generally do not show increased seizure risk with methylphenidate, with one study suggesting only a transient early-initiation signal in the first month, so baseline seizure history should guide monitoring rather than automatic exclusion from therapy [^1133q3V6].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with preschoolers under 6 years. Regulatory labeling indicates higher plasma exposure and higher rates of adverse reactions, most notably weight loss, and recommends against use under 6 years; pediatric guidelines allow cautious consideration of methylphenidate in 4–5-year-olds only if behavioral therapy fails and impairment is moderate-to-severe, with explicit risk–benefit discussion and growth monitoring [^113WmqkR] [^1141WQfZ] [^115Xj9pb]. Hold on, I should verify that families are counseled on appetite and growth trajectory expectations before initiating therapy in this age band [^114htLQw].

> I will now examine pregnancy and lactation, since maternal and infant safety must be balanced. Human data are limited; methylphenidate is detectable in breast milk at low relative infant doses, with no consistent reports of adverse infant effects, but long-term neurodevelopmental consequences are unknown, so shared decision-making and infant monitoring for agitation, poor feeding, or sleep changes are prudent if treatment is continued during breastfeeding [^1141WQfZ] [^111bq2T7]. I need to ensure that animal data suggesting potential fetal harm are discussed, even though human data remain insufficient to define risk [^114iqmar].

> Let me consider older adults, where evidence is sparse. Geriatric use has not been well studied, and cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse effects may be less well tolerated; therefore, if used, start low, go slow, and monitor closely for blood pressure, heart rate, mood, and cognition changes, recognizing the lack of robust safety data in this group [^114htLQw]. I should double-check that comorbidities and polypharmacy are reviewed carefully before initiation in older adults [^notfound].

> Next, I should review evidence quality and uncertainty, because this directly affects how confidently we can counsel patients. Across pediatric and adult reviews, most trials are short, small, and at high risk of bias due to unblinding from adverse effects, selective reporting, and industry sponsorship; consequently, GRADE ratings are very low for both benefits and harms, and trial sequential analyses suggest current evidence is underpowered for serious adverse events, meaning true risks may be higher or different than reported [^117NtF7x] [^112tnJo1] [^115BuZ5J] [^1123B9K1]. Hold on, I should verify whether any authoritative body has weighed in on this uncertainty: WHO declined to include methylphenidate on the Essential Medicines List citing uncertainties in benefit–harm estimates, reinforcing the need for individualized decisions and cautious extrapolation from short-term data [^1124UCwg].

> I should now translate this into practical clinical implications and monitoring. Before prescribing, screen for personal and family history of structural heart disease, arrhythmias, hypertension, substance use disorder, psychosis or mania, and tics; obtain baseline height, weight, heart rate, and blood pressure; and counsel on abuse risk, storage, and disposal with a signed agreement when appropriate [^116QxGYv] [^113y7HgL]. During treatment, monitor growth, vitals, mood, and sleep at each visit, especially in the first month after initiation or dose changes; educate families to report chest pain, syncope, sustained erections, digital color changes, or emergent mood or psychotic symptoms promptly; and titrate to maximal benefit with tolerable side effects rather than chasing a fixed dose ceiling, documenting rationale and response [^112BUW8u] [^1121eNFn]. But wait, what if adverse effects emerge early? Real-world data suggest clinicians often discontinue too quickly; many early adverse effects are manageable with timing adjustments, dose changes, or formulation switches, so a structured tolerability strategy may preserve benefit while mitigating harms [^111kfS7x].

> In summary, methylphenidate's most consistent and clinically salient cons include a high potential for abuse and misuse with boxed warnings, a small but real short-term cardiovascular risk signal that warrants screening and monitoring, frequent non-serious adverse effects such as insomnia and appetite suppression that can impair adherence, potential transient slowing of pediatric growth that requires monitoring, and rare but serious psychiatric and vascular events; critically, the certainty of evidence for both benefits and harms is low, so shared decision-making, careful selection of candidates, and proactive monitoring are essential to balance risks and benefits in routine care [^111w6P1J] [^114WaYZE] [^111N3rU7] [^111fsTdS] [^117NtF7x] [^1124UCwg].

Methylphenidate has **important limitations** that must be weighed against its benefits. The most common cons are **insomnia, appetite suppression, and weight loss** [^114mCerE], which can limit tolerability and adherence [^113aTNkZ]. It also carries risks of **cardiovascular events** (hypertension, tachycardia, rare sudden death) [^114WaYZE], psychiatric effects (anxiety, irritability, psychosis) [^1138o1Ji], and growth suppression in children [^111fsTdS]. Abuse and dependence are concerns given its Schedule II status [^111mXT7y], and long-term safety data remain limited [^115STcf5]. Use is contraindicated in patients with significant cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, or a history of substance abuse; careful screening and monitoring are essential [^116QxGYv].

---

## Common adverse effects

- **Insomnia**: Very common, often dose-limiting, and may require dose adjustments or timing changes [^114mCerE] [^1168r4xn].

- **Appetite suppression and weight loss**: Very common, especially in children, and may necessitate nutritional counseling or dose modification [^114mCerE] [^111fsTdS].

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dyspepsia are common and can affect adherence [^114mCerE].

- **Headache and dizziness**: Common and usually mild but may require dose adjustment [^114mCerE].

- **Emotional lability and irritability**: Common, particularly in pediatric populations [^114mCerE].

---

## Serious adverse effects

- **Cardiovascular risks**: Methylphenidate can cause hypertension, tachycardia, and rare serious cardiovascular events, including sudden death, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions [^116QxGYv].

- **Psychiatric effects**: Anxiety, agitation, psychosis, and mania have been reported, especially in patients with a history of psychiatric disorders [^1138o1Ji] [^116QxGYv].

- **Growth suppression**: Long-term use in children has been associated with slowed growth, necessitating regular monitoring of height and weight [^111fsTdS] [^114RM5f4].

- **Seizures**: Rarely, methylphenidate may lower the seizure threshold, particularly in patients with a history of seizures [^notfound].

---

## Abuse and dependence potential

Schedule II status reflects a **high potential for abuse and dependence** [^111w6P1J]; misuse can lead to serious psychological and physiological consequences, including overdose and death [^114DybZK].

---

## Long-term safety concerns

Long-term safety data are **limited**, with uncertainty regarding chronic cardiovascular, psychiatric, and neurological effects; ongoing monitoring and periodic reassessment are recommended [^116ajxaS] [^115STcf5].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **significant cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, severe anxiety, or a history of substance abuse** [^notfound]. Precautions include careful monitoring of cardiovascular status, psychiatric symptoms, and growth parameters, especially in pediatric patients [^114htLQw].

---

## Comparison with other ADHD medications

Compared with other ADHD medications, methylphenidate has a **similar or higher risk of insomnia and appetite suppression** but a lower risk of certain cardiovascular events than amphetamines. Atomoxetine, a non-stimulant, has a lower abuse potential but may be less effective for some patients [^112Fk15S].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

Age significantly affects **risk**; younger children are more susceptible to growth suppression and appetite suppression, whereas adolescents and adults have higher risks of abuse and dependence. Comorbidities — including cardiovascular disease, psychiatric disorders, and substance use disorders — increase the risk of adverse effects and may necessitate alternative treatments [^116QxGYv].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **individualized risk–benefit assessment**, careful screening for contraindications, and regular monitoring of cardiovascular status, psychiatric symptoms, and growth parameters [^112BUW8u] [^111uhjrX].

---

Methylphenidate is effective for ADHD but has notable limitations, including common adverse effects, serious cardiovascular and psychiatric risks, abuse potential, and uncertain long-term safety. These risks necessitate **careful patient selection, monitoring, and individualized treatment planning** [^117NtF7x].

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^117NtF7x]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Is treatment with methylphenidate associated with benefits or harms for children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?

Bottom Line

Methylphenidate is associated with improvement in ADHD symptoms, general behavior, and quality of life; however, due to the very low quality of the evidence, the magnitude of the associated improvement is uncertain. Methylphenidate was associated with an increased risk of nonserious adverse events. There are too few data to assess the association with serious adverse events.

---

### Methylphenidate and short-term cardiovascular risk [^114WaYZE]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study found evidence supporting a small (10%) increased risk of cardiovascular events in individuals receiving methylphenidate compared with matched controls after 6 months of treatment. The probability of finding a difference in risk between users and nonusers decreased when considering risk of 20% or larger, with no evidence of differences between those with and without a CVD history. Overall, while the findings suggest the decision to initiate methylphenidate should incorporate considerations of potential adverse cardiovascular effects, they do not establish evidence of markedly elevated cardiovascular risk. Rather, they provide probabilistic evidence most consistent with a small increased rate of cardiovascular events attributable to methylphenidate exposure over 6 months that warrants consideration among the broader benefits and risks of treatment for individual patients.

### The jury is still out on the benefits and harms of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^112X4TsE]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Much remains unclear about the benefits and harms of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Between 2012 and 2018, we conducted two Cochrane systematic reviews on methylphenidate for ADHD. This article explores the main findings in relation to evidence-based practice and our current understanding of ADHD.

### Methylphenidate and short-term cardiovascular risk [^1174iwTt]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the cardiovascular risk associated with short-term methylphenidate use?

Findings

In this cohort study of 252 382 individuals, methylphenidate-treated individuals showed a higher (10%) cardiovascular event rate compared with non-treated matched controls in the 6 months after treatment. However, there was no evidence for a more substantial difference (≥ 20%) or difference based on preexisting cardiovascular disease.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that the small cardiovascular risk associated with short-term methylphenidate use should not be a reason to withhold treatment but suggest the need for individualized risk-benefit assessment and risk monitoring.

### Extended-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^112tnJo1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric diagnosis increasingly used in adults. The recommended first-line pharmacological treatment is central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, such as methylphenidate, but uncertainty remains about its benefits and harms.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of extended-release formulations of methylphenidate in adults diagnosed with ADHD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases and four clinical trial registries up to February 2021. We searched 12 drug regulatory databases for clinical trial data up to 13 May 2020. In addition, we cross-referenced all available trial identifiers, handsearched reference lists, searched pharmaceutical company databases, and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trials comparing extended-release methylphenidate formulations at any dose versus placebo and other ADHD medications in adults diagnosed with ADHD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data. We assessed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs), and rating scales and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risks of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We meta-analysed the data using a random-effects model. We assessed three design characteristics that may impair the trial results' 'generalisability'; exclusion of participants with psychiatric comorbidity; responder selection based on previous experience with CNS stimulants; and risk of withdrawal effects. Our prespecified primary outcomes were functional outcomes, self-rated ADHD symptoms, and serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes included quality of life, ADHD symptoms rated by investigators and by peers such as family members, cardiovascular variables, severe psychiatric adverse events, and other adverse events.

Main Results

We included 24 trials (5066 participants), of which 21 reported outcome data for this review. We also identified one ongoing study. We included documents from six drug regulatory agencies covering eight trials. Twenty-one trials had an outpatient setting and three were conducted in prisons. They were primarily conducted in North America and Europe. The median participant age was 36 years. Twelve trials (76% of participants) were industry-sponsored, four (14% of participants) were publicly funded with industry involvement, seven (10% of participants) were publicly funded, and one had unclear funding. The median trial duration was eight weeks. One trial was rated at overall unclear risk of bias and 20 trials were rated at overall high risk of bias, primarily due to unclear blinding of participants and investigators, attrition bias, and selective outcome reporting. All trials were impaired in at least one of the three design characteristics related to 'generalisability'; for example, they excluded participants with psychiatric comorbidity such as depression or anxiety, or included participants only with a previous positive response to methylphenidate, or similar drugs. This may limit the trials' usefulness for clinical practice, as they may overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms. Extended-release methylphenidate versus placebo (up to 26 weeks) For the primary outcomes, we found very low-certainty evidence that methylphenidate had no effect on 'days missed at work' at 13-week follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.15 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.11 to 1.81; 1 trial, 409 participants) or serious adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.43, CI 95% CI 0.85 to 2.43; 14 trials, 4078 participants), whereas methylphenidate improved self-rated ADHD symptoms (small-to-moderate effect; SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.30; 16 trials, 3799 participants). For secondary outcomes, we found very low-certainty evidence that methylphenidate improved self-rated quality of life (small effect; SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.05; 6 trials, 1888 participants), investigator-rated ADHD symptoms (small-to-moderate effect; SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.36; 18 trials, 4183 participants), ADHD symptoms rated by peers such as family members (small-to-moderate effect; SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.14; 3 trials, 1005 participants), and increased the risk of experiencing any adverse event (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.37; 14 trials, 4214 participants). We rated the certainty of the evidence as 'very low' for all outcomes, primarily due to high risk of bias and 'indirectness of the evidence'. One trial (419 participants) had follow-up at 52 weeks and two trials (314 participants) included active comparators, hence long-term and comparative evidence is limited.

Authors' Conclusions

We found very low-certainty evidence that extended-release methylphenidate compared to placebo improved ADHD symptoms (small-to-moderate effects) measured on rating scales reported by participants, investigators, and peers such as family members. Methylphenidate had no effect on 'days missed at work' or serious adverse events, the effect on quality of life was small, and it increased the risk of several adverse effects. We rated the certainty of the evidence as 'very low' for all outcomes, due to high risk of bias, short trial durations, and limitations to the generalisability of the results. The benefits and harms of extended-release methylphenidate therefore remain uncertain.

### Methylphenidate for ADHD rejected from the WHO essential medicines list due to uncertainties in benefit-harm profile [^1124UCwg]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder with estimated global prevalence rates between 3% and 5% in children and 2.5% in adults, depending on the classification system used. The psychostimulant methylphenidate is one of the most frequently used medications for ADHD. In this analysis article we describe shortly the evidence in the field, an application for inclusion of methylphenidate on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the comments raised to the application and the WHO Expert Committee's decision. The application of getting methylphenidate on the WHO list was overzealous in reporting potential benefits, without highlighting key uncertainties and harms. Decisions encompassing medicines candidate to the WHO Model List should not be based on speculation about potential benefits and should fully incorporate areas of uncertainties. Even though methylphenidate has been used for over 60 years, the evidence concerning the benefits of this medication in children, adolescents and adults with ADHD is uncertain. The decision of the committee was to not include methylphenidate in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines 'due to uncertainties in the estimates of benefit, and concerns regarding the quality and limitations of the available evidence for both benefit and harm'.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^111N3rU7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention, they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the drug most often prescribed to treat children and adolescents with ADHD but, despite its widespread use, this is the first comprehensive systematic review of its benefits and harms.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.

Search Methods

In February 2015 we searched six databases (CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Conference Proceedings Citations Index), and two trials registers. We checked for additional trials in the reference lists of relevant reviews and included trials. We contacted the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture methylphenidate to request published and unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. At least 75% of participants needed to have an intellectual quotient of at least 70 (i.e. normal intellectual functioning). Outcomes assessed included ADHD symptoms, serious adverse events, non-serious adverse events, general behaviour and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Seventeen review authors participated in data extraction and risk of bias assessment, and two review authors independently performed all tasks. We used standard methodological procedures expected within Cochrane. Data from parallel-group trials and first period data from cross-over trials formed the basis of our primary analyses; separate analyses were undertaken using post-cross-over data from cross-over trials. We used Trial Sequential Analyses to control for type I (5%) and type II (20%) errors, and we assessed and downgraded evidence according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for high risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness, heterogeneity and publication bias.

Main Results

The studies. We included 38 parallel-group trials (5111 participants randomised) and 147 cross-over trials (7134 participants randomised). Participants included individuals of both sexes, at a boys-to-girls ratio of 5:1, and participants' ages ranged from 3 to 18 years across most studies (in two studies ages ranged from 3 to 21 years). The average age across all studies was 9.7 years. Most participants were from high-income countries. The duration of methylphenidate treatment ranged from 1 to 425 days, with an average duration of 75 days. Methylphenidate was compared to placebo (175 trials) or no intervention (10 trials). Risk of Bias. All 185 trials were assessed to be at high risk of bias. Primary outcomes. Methylphenidate may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.90 to -0.64; 19 trials, 1698 participants; very low-quality evidence). This corresponds to a mean difference (MD) of -9.6 points (95% CI -13.75 to -6.38) on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS; range 0 to 72 points; DuPaul 1991a). A change of 6.6 points on the ADHD-RS is considered clinically to represent the minimal relevant difference. There was no evidence that methylphenidate was associated with an increase in serious (e.g. life threatening) adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.22; 9 trials, 1532 participants; very low-quality evidence). The Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted intervention effect was RR 0.91 (CI 0.02 to 33.2).

Secondary Outcomes

Among those prescribed methylphenidate, 526 per 1000 (range 448 to 615) experienced non-serious adverse events, compared with 408 per 1000 in the control group. This equates to a 29% increase in the overall risk of any non-serious adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.51; 21 trials, 3132 participants; very low-quality evidence). The Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted intervention effect was RR 1.29 (CI 1.06 to 1.56). The most common non-serious adverse events were sleep problems and decreased appetite. Children in the methylphenidate group were at 60% greater risk for trouble sleeping/sleep problems (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.23; 13 trials, 2416 participants), and 266% greater risk for decreased appetite (RR 3.66, 95% CI 2.56 to 5.23; 16 trials, 2962 participants) than children in the control group. Teacher-rated general behaviour seemed to improve with methylphenidate (SMD -0.87, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.71; 5 trials, 668 participants; very low-quality evidence). A change of seven points on the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ; range 0 to 100 points; Landgraf 1998) has been deemed a minimal clinically relevant difference. The change reported in a meta-analysis of three trials corresponds to a MD of 8.0 points (95% CI 5.49 to 10.46) on the CHQ, which suggests that methylphenidate may improve parent-reported quality of life (SMD 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.80; 3 trials, 514 participants; very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The results of meta-analyses suggest that methylphenidate may improve teacher-reported ADHD symptoms, teacher-reported general behaviour, and parent-reported quality of life among children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD. However, the low quality of the underpinning evidence means that we cannot be certain of the magnitude of the effects. Within the short follow-up periods typical of the included trials, there is some evidence that methylphenidate is associated with increased risk of non-serious adverse events, such as sleep problems and decreased appetite, but no evidence that it increases risk of serious adverse events. Better designed trials are needed to assess the benefits of methylphenidate. Given the frequency of non-serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, the particular difficulties for blinding of participants and outcome assessors point to the advantage of large, 'nocebo tablet' controlled trials. These use a placebo-like substance that causes adverse events in the control arm that are comparable to those associated with methylphenidate. However, for ethical reasons, such trials should first be conducted with adults, who can give their informed consent. Future trials should publish depersonalised individual participant data and report all outcomes, including adverse events. This will enable researchers conducting systematic reviews to assess differences between intervention effects according to age, sex, comorbidity, type of ADHD and dose. Finally, the findings highlight the urgent need for large RCTs of non-pharmacological treatments.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^115BuZ5J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children and adolescents with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention and they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the psychostimulant most often prescribed, but the evidence on benefits and harms is uncertain. This is an update of our comprehensive systematic review on benefits and harms published in 2015.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases and two trials registers up to March 2022. In addition, we checked reference lists and requested published and unpublished data from manufacturers of methylphenidate.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. The search was not limited by publication year or language, but trial inclusion required that 75% or more of participants had a normal intellectual quotient (IQ > 70). We assessed two primary outcomes, ADHD symptoms and serious adverse events, and three secondary outcomes, adverse events considered non-serious, general behaviour, and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment for each trial. Six review authors including two review authors from the original publication participated in the update in 2022. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Data from parallel-group trials and first-period data from cross-over trials formed the basis of our primary analyses. We undertook separate analyses using end-of-last period data from cross-over trials. We used Trial Sequential Analyses (TSA) to control for type I (5%) and type II (20%) errors, and we assessed and downgraded evidence according to the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 212 trials (16,302 participants randomised); 55 parallel-group trials (8104 participants randomised), and 156 cross-over trials (8033 participants randomised) as well as one trial with a parallel phase (114 participants randomised) and a cross-over phase (165 participants randomised). The mean age of participants was 9.8 years ranging from 3 to 18 years (two trials from 3 to 21 years). The male-female ratio was 3:1. Most trials were carried out in high-income countries, and 86/212 included trials (41%) were funded or partly funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Methylphenidate treatment duration ranged from 1 to 425 days, with a mean duration of 28.8 days. Trials compared methylphenidate with placebo (200 trials) and with no intervention (12 trials). Only 165/212 trials included usable data on one or more outcomes from 14,271 participants. Of the 212 trials, we assessed 191 at high risk of bias and 21 at low risk of bias. If, however, deblinding of methylphenidate due to typical adverse events is considered, then all 212 trials were at high risk of bias.

Primary Outcomes

methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.88 to -0.61; I² = 38%; 21 trials; 1728 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This corresponds to a mean difference (MD) of -10.58 (95% CI -12.58 to -8.72) on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS; range 0 to 72 points). The minimal clinically relevant difference is considered to be a change of 6.6 points on the ADHD-RS. Methylphenidate may not affect serious adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.67; I² = 0%; 26 trials, 3673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The TSA-adjusted intervention effect was RR 0.91 (CI 0.31 to 2.68).

Secondary Outcomes

methylphenidate may cause more adverse events considered non-serious versus placebo or no intervention (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37; I² = 72%; 35 trials 5342 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The TSA-adjusted intervention effect was RR 1.22 (CI 1.08 to 1.43). Methylphenidate may improve teacher-rated general behaviour versus placebo (SMD -0.62, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.33; I² = 68%; 7 trials 792 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but may not affect quality of life (SMD 0.40, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.83; I² = 81%; 4 trials, 608 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The majority of our conclusions from the 2015 version of this review still apply. Our updated meta-analyses suggest that methylphenidate versus placebo or no-intervention may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms and general behaviour in children and adolescents with ADHD. There may be no effects on serious adverse events and quality of life. Methylphenidate may be associated with an increased risk of adverse events considered non-serious, such as sleep problems and decreased appetite. However, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes is very low and therefore the true magnitude of effects remain unclear. Due to the frequency of non-serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, the blinding of participants and outcome assessors is particularly challenging. To accommodate this challenge, an active placebo should be sought and utilised. It may be difficult to find such a drug, but identifying a substance that could mimic the easily recognised adverse effects of methylphenidate would avert the unblinding that detrimentally affects current randomised trials. Future systematic reviews should investigate the subgroups of patients with ADHD that may benefit most and least from methylphenidate. This could be done with individual participant data to investigate predictors and modifiers like age, comorbidity, and ADHD subtypes.

### Evaluation of methylphenidate safety and maximum-dose titration rationale in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a meta-analysis [^1121eNFn]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Evidence on the titration of stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is lacking. However, this lack of evidence has not prevented medication guidelines from specifying apparently arbitrary dose limitations, which could discourage clinicians from titrating methylphenidate to higher and, perhaps for some patients, more efficacious doses.

Objective

To determine the evidence on dose titration and adverse events associated with dose titration of stimulants for ADHD.

Data Sources

MEDLINE from 1946, Embase from 1974, and PsycINFO from 1806 through April 1, 2019, were searched to identify relevant articles.

Study Selection

The inclusion criteria were that (1) the study was conducted on children up to 18 years of age; (2) children had a diagnosis of ADHD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or hyperkinetic disorder according to the International Classification of Diseases codes; and (3) the dose of methylphenidate was determined by titration.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The PRISMA guidelines for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity were followed. Quality assessment was undertaken using the Jadad scoring system. Statistical analysis was undertaken using a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The outcomes of interest were (1) the doses used in published clinical trials, (2) the clinical justification given by researchers for their selected dose range, and (3) the adverse effects associated with methylphenidate when the dose is established by titration.

Results

A total of 11 randomized clinical trials and 38 cohort studies were analyzed. The randomized clinical trials involved 1304 participants treated with methylphenidate and 887 controls; the 38 cohort studies included 5524 participants. Maximum doses of methylphenidate ranged from 0.8 to 1.8 mg/kg/d. Some studies detailed their method of titration, including starting dose, titration interval, increment dose, and maximum dose. Not all of these studies reported justification for the chosen dose range. Common adverse effects of methylphenidate included insomnia (odds ratio, 4.66; 95% CI, 1.99–10.92; P < .001), anorexia (5.11 higher than for those who took placebo; 95% CI, 1.99–13.14; P < .001), abdominal pain (1.9 times more likely; 95% CI, 0.77–4.77; p = 0.16), and headache (14% of participants; 95% CI, 10%-20%; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

A range of maximum doses for methylphenidate was recommended in clinical studies; no discernable scientific justification for any particular dose was given. Reports of life-threatening adverse events were absent; further studies of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of methylphenidate titrated purely on clinical grounds, without reference to any set maximum dose, are needed.

### Can parents believe websites' information about methylphenidate's side effects? [^111feeUN]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Methylphenidate prescribing for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder is common and it is associated with a wide variety of side effects.
Parents and families often seek information rapidly from the internet and social media connections to complement that given by their healthcare professionals.
The reliability of information to families on the adverse effects of methylphenidate on the internet is unknown.

What this study adds?

Most easily accessible websites contain reasonably dependable information about methylphenidate's side-effects.
It provides clinicians with some reassurance regarding the reliability of information about methylphenidate's adverse effects on commonly found internet websites.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^112ZLrM5]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated childhood psychiatric disorders, with a prevalence of 3.4%. It is increasingly seen as a developmental disorder, which has high comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Diagnosis is made through recognition of excessive inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity in children before 12 years of age, which impairs their functioning or development.

Methylphenidate has been used for the treatment of ADHD for over 50 years and is now globally the most common drug treatment for the disorder. Despite the widespread use of methylphenidate no comprehensive systematic review has been done of both benefits and harms. Fifteen reviews of the effect of methylphenidate on the symptoms of ADHD in children and adolescents have been published. None of them were conducted using Cochrane methodology and none prepublished a peer reviewed protocol. Thirteen did not undertake subgroup analyses on comorbidity influencing treatment effectsnor did they control for the treatment effect on subtypes of ADHD. Ten did not consider dosage. Seven meta-analyses combined outcome data across raters and observersand eight did not separate outcomes for inattention and hyperactivity or impulsivity. Nine failed to present spontaneous adverse eventsand 14 did not report adverse events measured by rating scales. Eleven reviewsdid not follow 'gold standard' guidelines — that is, the Cochrane Handbook or the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Risk of random errors, risk of bias, and trial quality were not systematically assessed in 11 reviews. Language bias (exclusion of non-English publications) was present in four reviews, and narrow or unreported search strategies in four reviewsmay have compromised data collection and, ultimately the meta-analyses.

To avoid these flaws we conducted a systematic review of the benefits and harms of methylphenidate in children and adolescents with ADHD using the Cochrane Handbook and PRISMA guidelines. This article presents the results of a systematic review focusing on the benefits and harms of methylphenidate in randomised clinical trials. A second systematic review will focus on harms in non-randomised studies.

### Methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents-assessment of adverse events in non-randomised studies [^116uVh6z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood. The psychostimulant methylphenidate is the most frequently used medication to treat it. Several studies have investigated the benefits of methylphenidate, showing possible favourable effects on ADHD symptoms, but the true magnitude of the effect is unknown. Concerning adverse events associated with the treatment, our systematic review of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrated no increase in serious adverse events, but a high proportion of participants suffered a range of non-serious adverse events.

Objectives

To assess the adverse events associated with methylphenidate treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD in non-randomised studies.

Search Methods

In January 2016, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, 12 other databases and two trials registers. We also checked reference lists and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included non-randomised study designs. These comprised comparative and non-comparative cohort studies, patient-control studies, patient reports/series and cross-sectional studies of methylphenidate administered at any dosage or formulation. We also included methylphenidate groups from RCTs assessing methylphenidate versus other interventions for ADHD as well as data from follow-up periods in RCTs. Participants had to have an ADHD diagnosis (from the 3rd to the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the 9th or 10th edition of theInternational Classification of Diseases, with or without comorbid diagnoses. We required that at least 75% of participants had a normal intellectual capacity (intelligence quotient of more than 70 points) and were aged below 20 years. We excluded studies that used another ADHD drug as a co-intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Fourteen review authors selected studies independently. Two review authors assessed risk of bias independently using the ROBINS-I tool for assessing risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions. All review authors extracted data. We defined serious adverse events according to the International Committee of Harmonization as any lethal, life-threatening or life-changing event. We considered all other adverse events to be non-serious adverse events and conducted meta-analyses of data from comparative studies. We calculated meta-analytic estimates of prevalence from non-comparative cohorts studies and synthesised data from patient reports/series qualitatively. We investigated heterogeneity by conducting subgroup analyses, and we also conducted sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

We included a total of 260 studies: 7 comparative cohort studies, 6 of which compared 968 patients who were exposed to methylphenidate to 166 controls, and 1 which assessed 1224 patients that were exposed or not exposed to methylphenidate during different time periods; 4 patient-control studies (53,192 exposed to methylphenidate and 19,906 controls); 177 non-comparative cohort studies (2,207,751 participants); 2 cross-sectional studies (96 participants) and 70 patient reports/series (206 participants). Participants' ages ranged from 3 years to 20 years. Risk of bias in the included comparative studies ranged from moderate to critical, with most studies showing critical risk of bias. We evaluated all non-comparative studies at critical risk of bias. The GRADE quality rating of the evidence was very low. Primary outcomesIn the comparative studies, methylphenidate increased the risk ratio (RR) of serious adverse events (RR 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.57; 2 studies, 72,005 participants); any psychotic disorder (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.57; 1 study, 71,771 participants); and arrhythmia (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.74; 1 study, 1224 participants) compared to no intervention. In the non-comparative cohort studies, the proportion of participants on methylphenidate experiencing any serious adverse event was 1.20% (95% CI 0.70% to 2.00%; 50 studies, 162,422 participants). Withdrawal from methylphenidate due to any serious adverse events occurred in 1.20% (95% CI 0.60% to 2.30%; 7 studies, 1173 participants) and adverse events of unknown severity led to withdrawal in 7.30% of participants (95% CI 5.30% to 10.0%; 22 studies, 3708 participants). Secondary outcomesIn the comparative studies, methylphenidate, compared to no intervention, increased the RR of insomnia and sleep problems (RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.24 to 5.34; 3 studies, 425 participants) and decreased appetite (RR 15.06, 95% CI 2.12 to 106.83; 1 study, 335 participants). With non-comparative cohort studies, the proportion of participants on methylphenidate with any non-serious adverse events was 51.2% (95% CI 41.2% to 61.1%; 49 studies, 13,978 participants). These included difficulty falling asleep, 17.9% (95% CI 14.7% to 21.6%; 82 studies, 11,507 participants); headache, 14.4% (95% CI 11.3% to 18.3%; 90 studies, 13,469 participants); abdominal pain, 10.7% (95% CI 8.60% to 13.3%; 79 studies, 11,750 participants); and decreased appetite, 31.1% (95% CI 26.5% to 36.2%; 84 studies, 11,594 participants). Withdrawal of methylphenidate due to non-serious adverse events occurred in 6.20% (95% CI 4.80% to 7.90%; 37 studies, 7142 participants), and 16.2% were withdrawn for unknown reasons (95% CI 13.0% to 19.9%; 57 studies, 8340 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Our findings suggest that methylphenidate may be associated with a number of serious adverse events as well as a large number of non-serious adverse events in children and adolescents, which often lead to withdrawal of methylphenidate. Our certainty in the evidence is very low, and accordingly, it is not possible to accurately estimate the actual risk of adverse events. It might be higher than reported here. Given the possible association between methylphenidate and the adverse events identified, it may be important to identify people who are most susceptible to adverse events. To do this we must undertake large-scale, high-quality RCTs, along with studies aimed at identifying responders and non-responders.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^113Ei3Ai]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Study question Is methylphenidate beneficial or harmful for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents?

Methods Electronic databases were searched up to February 2015 for parallel and crossover randomised clinical trials comparing methylphenidate with placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents with ADHD. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (TSA) were conducted. Quality was assessed using GRADE. Teachers, parents, and observers rated ADHD symptoms and general behaviour.

Study answer and limitations The analyses included 38 parallel group trials (n = 5111, median treatment duration 49 days) and 147 crossover trials (n = 7134, 14 days). The average age across all studies was 9.7 years. The analysis suggested a beneficial effect of methylphenidate on teacher rated symptoms in 19 parallel group trials (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.77, n = 1698), corresponding to a mean difference of −9.6 points on the ADHD rating scale. There was no evidence that methylphenidate was associated with an increase in serious adverse events (risk ratio 0.98, nine trials, n = 1532; TSA adjusted intervention effect RR 0.91). Methylphenidate was associated with an increased risk of non-serious adverse events (1.29, 21 trials, n = 3132; TSA adjusted RR 1.29). Teacher rated general behaviour seemed to improve with methylphenidate (SMD −0.87, five trials, n = 668) A change of 7 points on the child health questionnaire (CHQ) has been deemed a minimal clinically relevant difference. The change reported in a meta-analysis of three trials corresponds to a mean difference of 8.0 points on the CHQ (range 0–100 points), which suggests that methylphenidate may improve parent reported quality of life (SMD 0.61, three trials, n = 514). 96.8% of trials were considered high risk of bias trials according to the Cochrane guidelines. All outcomes were assessed very low quality according to GRADE.

What this study adds The results suggest that among children and adolescents with a diagnosis of ADHD, methylphenidate may improve teacher reported symptoms of ADHD and general behaviour and parent reported quality of life. However, given the risk of bias in the included studies, and the very low quality of outcomes, the magnitude of the effects is uncertain. Methylphenidate is associated with an increased risk of non-serious but not serious adverse events.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^117Eh4hh]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Quality of evidence

For each included trial, data extractors independently evaluated all risk of bias domains (listed below), resolving any disagreements by discussion. We assigned each bias domain to one of three categories: low risk of bias, uncertain risk of bias, or high risk of bias, according to the Cochrane guidelines. Owing to the risk of overestimation of beneficial intervention effects and underestimation of harmful intervention effects in randomised clinical trials with unclear or high risk of bias, we assessed the influence of the risk of bias on our results (see subgroup analyses). We used the following domains to assess the risk of bias in the included trials: generation of allocation sequence, allocation of concealment, blinding of participants and staff, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and vested interest (trial was funded by parties that might have had a conflict of interest (for example, a manufacturer of methylphenidate) or there were potential conflicts of interests among authors because they had been working for companies producing or selling methylphenidate, or both). We considered trials with low risk of bias in all domains to be at low risk of bias and trials with one or more unclear or inadequate component to be at high risk of bias. For 32% (59/185) of the included trials we noted a specific type of bias occurring before randomisation. Non-responders to methylphenidate, responders to placebo, or participants who had adverse events due to the drug were excluded as a consequence of exclusion criteria or after a titration phase. Such trials have limited external validity and, to identify whether this cohort selection bias had an effect on estimates of effects, we did subgroup analyses (see above).

We assessed and graded the evidence according to the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) for high risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness, heterogeneity, and publication bias. The analyses were conducted with Review Manager 5.3 (Review Manager 2014) and the trial sequential analysis program.

Strength and limitations of this study

This systematic review has several strengths. We developed a protocol for this review according to instructions provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Our protocol was published before we embarked on the review itself. We conducted extensive searches of relevant databases, and we requested published and unpublished data from pharmaceutical companies manufacturing methylphenidate, including Shire, Medice (represented in Denmark by HB Pharma), Janssen-Cilag, and Novartis. Two review authors, working independently, selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with team members. We assessed risk of bias in all trials according to recommendations provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. In addition, this review meta-analysed adverse events for the same intervention and used trial sequential analysis methodology to control the risks of false positive results in meta-analysis owing to sparse data and repetitive analyses of data.

It may be considered a drawback that we did not search the databases of the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for unpublished trials. The median duration of drug treatment was less than two months and few trials had a duration of more than six months. Therefore there is little that can be concluded about the benefits and harms of methylphenidate use for longer than six months. When comparing short term trials (six months or less) with long term trials (more than six months), we found that the treatment effect for teacher rated symptoms of ADHD decreased over time. This was not the case for independent assessor rated and parent rated symptoms of ADHD, where there were no significant differences between short term and long term duration of trials. We could identify no trials that examined the effect of more extended use of treatment on young people's general behaviour. Overall, there is a lack of evidence about the long term effects of methylphenidate in children and adolescents with ADHD.

Some researchers have argued that parents' evaluations of the symptoms of ADHD may not be as reliable as those of other raters such as teachers of preschool childrenor college students. One study suggested that there was inconsistency in ratings between parents. In the Multimodal ADHD Treatment (MTA) trial, information provided by parents was not always thought to be strong. However, we found no differences between different raters.

Regarding medical management for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, more specifically with respect to pharmacotherapy, methylphenidate, AAP 2019 guidelines recommend to consider offering methylphenidate in pediatric patients aged 4–5 years if behavioral interventions do not provide significant improvement and there is a moderate-to-severe continued disturbance in the patient's functioning. Weigh the risks of initiating medication before the age of 6 years against the harm of delaying treatment in areas where evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available.

### Safety of therapeutic methylphenidate in adults: a systematic review of the evidence [^117Mojwo]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often persists into adulthood. Stimulant drugs, including methylphenidate, have showed efficacy in trials for ADHD in adults. Adult psychiatrists are likely to encounter increasing numbers of adult patients who may benefit from methylphenidate. A systematic review of the literature was made to examine the evidence on the safety of methylphenidate, when used therapeutically in adults. Twenty-six placebo-controlled trials were found, in which 811 adults received methylphenidate for ADHD and other conditions. In the short term, methylphenidate was well tolerated and no serious side effects were observed. There is little information on the long-term safety of methylphenidate in adults, although the number of serious adverse effects reported to regulatory authorities has, so far, been low. Methylphenidate is associated with a modest rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Surveys of stimulant use in US universities show that misuse of prescribed medication, for recreation or to enhance study, is fairly common although the level of harm that arises from this practice is unclear.

### Comparing the abuse potential of methylphenidate versus other stimulants: a review of available evidence and relevance to the ADHD patient [^1115cbqQ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

The use of psychostimulants to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been controversial for a number of reasons. In an effort to clarify the extent to which the psychostimulant methylphenidate has abuse potential, the existing published evidence has been reviewed and is summarized here, with an emphasis on delineating a number of related but independent issues that are often confused. Methylphenidate produces behavioral effects associated with abuse potential as assessed by traditional assays, but the relevance of this literature to the clinical use of the drug in the treatment of ADHD is ambiguous at best. Existing neuropharmacologic data suggest that methylphenidate has pharmacokinetic properties that reduce its abuse potential as compared with other stimulant drugs of abuse, such as cocaine.

American Academy of Pediatrics ADHD guideline — preschool-aged children (4–5 years of age): For preschool-aged children (4–5 years of age), the primary care clinician should prescribe evidence-based parent- and/or teacher-administered behavior therapy as the first line of treatment (quality of evidence A/strong recommendation) and may prescribe methylphenidate if the behavior interventions do not provide significant improvement and there is moderate-to-severe continuing disturbance in the child's function. In areas in which evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available, the clinician needs to weigh the risks of starting medication at an early age against the harm of delaying diagnosis and treatment (quality of evidence B/recommendation). Aggregate evidence quality: A for behavior; B for methylphenidate. Harms/risks/costs: Both therapies increase the cost of care, and behavior therapy requires a higher level of family involvement, whereas methylphenidate has some potential adverse effects. Benefits-harms assessment: Given the risks of untreated ADHD, the benefits outweigh the risks. Role of patient preferences: Family preference is essential in determining the treatment plan. Strength: strong recommendation.

### The use of methylphenidate among students: the future of enhancement? [^112QikmQ]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2010). Low credibility.

During the past few years considerable debate has arisen within academic journals with respect to the use of smart drugs or cognitive enhancement pharmaceuticals. The following paper seeks to examine the foundations of this cognitive enhancement debate using the example of methylphenidate use among college students. The argument taken is that much of the enhancement debate rests upon inflated assumptions about the ability of such drugs to enhance and over-estimations of either the size of the current market for such drugs or the rise in popularity as drugs for enhancing cognitive abilities. This article provides an overview of the empirical evidence that methylphenidate has the ability to significantly improve cognitive abilities in healthy individuals, and examines whether the presumed uptake of the drug is either as socially significant as implied or growing to the extent that it requires urgent regulatory attention. In addition, it reviews the evidence of side-effects for the use of methylphenidate which may be an influential factor in whether an individual decides to use such drugs. The primary conclusions are that neither drug efficacy, nor the benefit-to-risk balance, nor indicators of current or growing demand provide sufficient evidence that methylphenidate is a suitable example of a cognitive enhancer with mass appeal. In light of these empirically based conclusions, the article discusses why methylphenidate might have become seen as a smart drug or cognitive enhancer.

### Can parents believe websites' information about methylphenidate's side effects? [^111yXmGL]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common behavioural disorders, affecting around 5% of the global population. Methylphenidate is recommended as the first-line drug treatment for ADHD for children over the age of 5 in the UK. It can have many side effects and it is important that families are well informed. Other than their healthcare professionals and friends, the major information source for families is the internet.

Aims

To evaluate the validity of online information regarding the adverse effects of methylphenidate.

Methods

Side-effects of methylphenidate hydrochloride listed in the British National Formulary for Children (BNFC) were taken as the 'gold standard' and compared with online websites for accuracy. The first 10 websites found on each of nine different search engines were used as comparators.

Results

From the 90 hits, 10 top hits found in each of 9 search engines, 25 unique websites were identified. A quarter (six sites; 24%) documented only side-effects that all appeared in the BNFC. Three quarters (19 websites; 76%) had at least one side-effect that did not appear in the BNFC; with six websites documenting more than five side-effects not found in the BNFC.

Conclusions

Methylphenidate's frequent use makes it important that the general public are provided with accurate, reliable and easily accessible information. Most websites have dependable quality information on side effects, but several seem to list excessive side-effects.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^113RrqKf]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Implications for research

Better designed trials are needed to assess the benefits of methylphenidate. Because of the frequency of non-serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, the particular difficulties for blinding of participants and outcome assessors point to the advantage of large, "nocebo tablet" controlled trials. These use a placebo-like substance that causes adverse events in the control arm that are comparable to those associated with methylphenidate. Such trials ought first to be conducted in adults with ADHD. We also acknowledge that investigators can directly carry out nocebo controlled trials in children and adolescents if they can argue that young people with ADHD are different from adults with the disorder.

Future trials should publish depersonalised individual participant data and report all outcomes, including adverse events. This will enable researchers conducting systematic reviews to assess differences between intervention effects according to sex, age, type of ADHD, presence of co-morbidities and dose. Finally, the findings highlight the urgent need for large randomised trials of non-pharmacological treatments.

Conclusions

Methylphenidate use in children and adolescents may improve the symptoms of ADHD, general behaviour, and quality of life. It does not seem to cause an increased risk of serious adverse events in the short term but was associated with a relatively high risks of non-serious adverse events. These findings should be interpreted in the light of several limitations, including the lack of blinding, outcome reporting bias, heterogeneity, and the consequent very low quality of evidence for all outcomes. More long term randomised nocebo tablet (active placebo) controlled clinical trials without risks of bias are necessary to allow firm decisions on methylphenidate treatment in children and adolescents with ADHD. We believe that nocebo controlled trials should be conducted first in adults with ADHD.

### Methylphenidate and short-term cardiovascular risk [^114WLPZr]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition affecting approximately 5% to 10% of school-aged children and 2% to 5% of adults. Characterized by persistent and developmentally inappropriate inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity, ADHD can co-occur with several mental and physical conditions, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), leading to a substantial burden on the health care system.

Methylphenidate, a central nervous system stimulant, has long been used as a first-line medication for the treatment of ADHD. It has been shown to be efficacious in randomized clinical trials and useful in observational studies in decreasing ADHD symptom severity and related impairments. However, despite its widespread use, there is still ongoing debate about the safety of methylphenidate. Among possible adverse effects, there is evidence showing small but statistically significant increases in blood pressure and heart rate following its use. However, it is not clear whether and to what extent this increase in blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular conditions, as existing evidence is mixed. Some prospective and retrospective cohort studies have reported an increased risk of cardiovascular events in individuals receiving methylphenidate treatment. In contrast, other retrospective, population-based cohort studies did not find any association between methylphenidate use and cardiovascular events.,

There are 2 crucial limitations in previous studies investigating the possible association between methylphenidate use and cardiovascular events. First, several studies did not adequately control unmeasured confounding factors that may lead to biased estimations. A within-individual design, in which each individual serves as their own control, can address, at least partially, this methodologic limitation. Second, available studies based their conclusions on null hypothesis significance testing. While this is a widely used statistical method, it has several limitations. Bayesian inference offers several advantages over null hypothesis significance testing, and is often considered to be a more reliable and flexible method for statistical analysis. Bayesian statistics, with its inherent capacity to express parameters and hypotheses as probabilities, offers clinicians an analytical framework with potential utility within the realm of medical practice. By encapsulating uncertainty through the lens of probabilities, bayesian inference allows for a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of clinical phenomena, facilitating informed decision-making and fostering personalized patient care.

### Editorial: on the safety of long-term methylphenidate treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in early childhood [^1148wTvZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical manifestations of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often emerge before 6 years of age, and an early onset can portend a more marked and severe clinical course. Given that untreated ADHD can have a negative impact on educational attainment and social functioning, early treatment is indicated, as it might translate into better distal outcomes. For this age group, the current recommendation from clinical guidelines and ADHD experts is to administer behavioral therapy as first-line treatment. Because only limited information has been available on the possible safety implications of long-term pharmacological treatment at young ages, the use of methylphenidate is reserved for cases with impairing ADHD symptoms unresponsive to psychosocial intervention. 1.

### Risk of bias and quality of evidence for treatment of ADHD with stimulant medication [^113fZ84q]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Storebø et al. provide a concise summary of two Cochrane reviews about benefits and harms of treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with methylphenidate: (1) a review of 185 randomized controlled trials that estimated benefits (e.g., moderate-to-large reduction in teacher-rated ADHD symptoms) and (2) a review of 260 nonrandomized trials that estimated harms (e.g., infrequent serious but frequent nonserious adverse events). They also mention (without providing much detail) additional information from the structured Cochrane method about the risk for bias in the trials reviewed (assessed as being high) and quality of evidence of the outcomes considered (rated as being very low). This led to the conclusion that "the jury is still out on benefits and harms". A similar conclusion of the first review generated an extensive debate in the literature. Some details will be summarized and discussed herein to provide context in case the recent review and the summary by Storebø et al. revive the debate.

### Advances in understanding and treating ADHD [^114NQAX5]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Research has continued to suggest that osmotic-release oral system (OROS) methylphenidate lessens ADHD symptoms throughout the day and has greater adherence, thought to be associated with the convenience of once-daily dosing. Dexmethylphenidate extended-release (XR) and transdermal methylphenidate also offer this benefit. Dexmethylphenidate comes in capsules that can be opened and mixed with food, and has the earliest onset of efficacy of the long-acting preparations. Transdermal methylphenidate bypasses the oral route entirely, and in short-term studies is associated with efficacy throughout the day, with improved family quality of life, and when carefully titrated, little effect on sleep. Greater absorption of medication occurs when the patch is applied to the buttocks rather than to the subscapular area.

Comorbid anxiety was not found to affect stimulant efficacy in a recent study, and some studies suggest that treatment with stimulants can help to lessen the likelihood of other psychiatric comorbidities during adolescence, including cigarette use and substance abuse. However, meta-analyses of stimulants and other ADHD medications in the treatment of ADHD comorbid with tic disorders concluded that supratherapeutic doses of dextroamphetamine should be avoided in this population. These studies also indicated that methylphenidate gave the best control for ADHD and that α-2-agonists produced the best improvement in both tics and ADHD.

The commonest side-effects of stimulants (decreased appetite, trouble with sleep onset) have also continued to receive recent research interest. Some research suggests that it is difficult to predict which children with ADHD will have adverse effects, based upon demographic and clinical characteristics. Although rare, serious cardiovascular side-effects have been identified with stimulant use; however, the common effects on blood pressure, heart rate and exercise parameters are usually of no clinical significance. Consensus has been reached in the United States, Canada and Europe that routine electrocardiography screening and/or cardiology investigations are needed before starting stimulant use only in those with a positive family or personal cardiac history. Likewise, no cytogenetic side-effects from stimulant use have been reported. However, a recent review article has shown that treatment with stimulants in childhood modestly reduced expected height and weight. These effects were dose-dependent and attenuated over time. The general consensus on cardiovascular side-effects at this point is that the short/medium term side-effects are usually of no clinical significance, but the long-term potential side-effects are less certain.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

During the past 15 years, several reviews investigating the efficacy of methylphenidate for ADHD (with or without meta-analyses) have been published. Fifteen reviews on the efficacy of methylphenidate treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD have pooled the results of ADHD rating scales. These reviews have several shortcomings, as described in our introduction. Most did not assess the risk of bias of the included studies or adverse events. Moreover, none of these reviews considered the risks of random errors. Therefore, the true estimate of the treatment is not known and information about adverse events from several randomised clinical trials is missing. All of these reviews and meta-analyses reported a large effect of methylphenidate. The meta-analysis in our review showed an effect of methylphenidate on some outcomes but because we identified that almost all of the trials have a high risk of bias, we do not know the true intervention effect. We also found a large risk of outcome reporting bias in the outcomes for both serious and non-serious adverse events

A recent Cochrane systematic review evaluated the effects of methylphenidate in adults with ADHD. The effect sizes across the different assessments of symptoms were similar to those found in our analyses (standardised mean difference 0.60). The authors noted that data on adverse events were limited by the short duration of the included trials. Despite the similar effects of methylphenidate on symptoms observed in our reviews, we have judged the quality of evidence in our own review, as well as that in Epstein 2014, to be lower than that of Epstein and colleagues'.

Implications for practice

The results of meta-analyses suggest that methylphenidate may improve teacher reported ADHD symptoms, teacher reported general behaviour, and parent reported quality of life among children and adolescents with a diagnosis of ADHD. However, the low quality of the underpinning evidence means that we cannot be certain of the magnitude of the effects.

Within the short follow-up periods typical of the included trials, there is some evidence that methylphenidate is associated with increased risk of non-serious adverse events, such as sleep problems and decreased appetite, but no evidence that it increases the risk of serious adverse events.

### Amphetamine, past and present – a pharmacological and clinical perspective [^116Wkv7V]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

It is now just over a hundred years since amphetamine was first discovered. In that period amphetamine has transformed from a drug that was widely available without prescription for the treatment of a broad range of disorders to being highly restricted Controlled Drugs that, in Europe at least, have all but disappeared from the formularies in many countries. The very clear links between molecular structure and pharmacological mode of action and, in turn, efficacy and safety in humans, makes amphetamine a textbook example of translational validity. The primary pharmacology of these drugs is not only responsible for providing efficacy in disorders such as ADHD and narcolepsy, but also for their spectrum of adverse events and liability for recreational abuse, making the balance of benefit/risk the key challenge in their clinical use. Amphetamine ranks alongside methylphenidate as the most effective drugs available for the management of ADHD, and the advances that have been made in developing genuine once-daily medications have addressed some of the problems of therapeutic coverage, whilst at the same time reducing the risk of diversion and recreational abuse.

### Immediate-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^116vC4sb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by symptoms of inattention or impulsivity or both, and hyperactivity, which affect children, adolescents, and adults. In some countries, methylphenidate is the first option to treat adults with moderate or severe ADHD. However, evidence on the efficacy and adverse events of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate in the treatment of ADHD in adults is limited and controversial.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and harms (adverse events) of IR methylphenidate for treating ADHD in adults.

Search Methods

In January 2020, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight additional databases and three trial registers. We also searched internal reports on the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration websites. We checked citations of included trials to identify additional trials not captured by the electronic searches.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IR methylphenidate, at any dose, with placebo or other pharmacological interventions (including extended-release formulations of methylphenidate) for ADHD in adults. Primary outcomes comprised changes in the symptoms of ADHD (efficacy) and harms. Secondary outcomes included changes in the clinical impression of severity and improvement, level of functioning, depression, anxiety and quality of life. Outcomes could have been rated by investigators or participants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data independently on the characteristics of the trials, participants, interventions; outcomes and financial conflict of interests. We resolved disagreements by discussion or consulting a third review author. We obtained additional, unpublished information from the authors of one included trial that had reported efficacy data in a graph. We calculated mean differences (MDs) or standardized MDs (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous data reported on the same or different scales, respectively. We summarized dichotomous variables as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CI.

Main Results

We included 10 trials published between 2001 and 2016 involving 497 adults with ADHD. Three trials were conducted in Europe and one in Argentina; the remaining trials did not report their location. The RCTs compared IR methylphenidate with placebo, an osmotic-release oral system (OROS) of methylphenidate (an extended-release formulation), an extended-release formulation of bupropion, lithium, and Pycnogenol® (maritime pine bark extract). Participants comprised outpatients, inpatients in addiction treatment, and adults willing to attend an intensive outpatient program for cocaine dependence. The duration of the follow-up ranged from 6 to 18 weeks. IR methylphenidate versus placebo We found very low-certainty evidence that, compared with placebo, IR methylphenidate may reduce symptoms of ADHD when measured with investigator-rated scales (MD -20.70, 95% CI -23.97 to -17.43; 1 trial, 146 participants; end scores; Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Report Scale (AISRS), scored from 0 to 54), but the evidence is uncertain. The effect of IR methylphenidate on ADHD symptoms when measured with participant-rated scales was moderate, but the certainty of the evidence is very low (SMD -0.59, 95% CI -1.25 to 0.06; I² = 69%; 2 trials, 138 participants; end scores). There is very low-certainty evidence that, compared with placebo, IR methylphenidate may reduce the clinical impression of the severity of ADHD symptoms (MD -0.57, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.28; 2 trials, 139 participants; I² = 0%; change and end scores; Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity scale (scored from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse))). There is low-certainty evidence that, compared with placebo, IR methylphenidate may slightly impact the clinical impression of an improvement in symptoms of ADHD (MD -0.94, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.51; 1 trial, 49 participants; end scores; CGI-Improvement scale (scored from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse))). There is no clear evidence of an effect on anxiety (MD -0.20, 95% CI -4.84 to 4.44; 1 trial, 19 participants; change scores; Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A; scored from 0 to 56); very low-certainty evidence) or depression (MD 2.80, 95% CI -0.09 to 5.69; 1 trial, 19 participants; change scores; Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D; scored from 0 to 52); very low-certainty evidence) in analyses comparing IR methylphenidate with placebo. IR methylphenidate versus lithium Compared with lithium, it is uncertain whether IR methylphenidate increases or decreases symptoms of ADHD (MD 0.60, 95% CI -3.11 to 4.31; 1 trial, 46 participants; end scores; Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale (scored from 0 to 198); very low-certainty evidence); anxiety (MD -0.80, 95% CI -4.49 to 2.89; 1 trial, 46 participants; end scores; HAM-A; very low-certainty evidence); or depression (MD -1.20, 95% CI -3.81 to 1.41, 1 trial, 46 participants; end scores; HAM-D scale; very low-certainty evidence). None of the included trials assessed participant-rated changes in symptoms of ADHD, or clinical impression of severity or improvement in participants treated with IR methylphenidate compared with lithium. Adverse events were poorly assessed and reported. We rated all trials at high risk of bias due to selective outcome reporting of harms and masking of outcome assessors (failure to blind outcome assessor to measure adverse events). Overall, four trials with 203 participants who received IR methylphenidate and 141 participants who received placebo described the occurrence of harms. The use of IR methylphenidate in these trials increased the risk of gastrointestinal complications (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.95) and loss of appetite (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.96). Cardiovascular adverse events were reported inconsistently, preventing a comprehensive analysis. One trial comparing IR methylphenidate to lithium reported five and nine adverse events, respectively. We considered four trials to have notable concerns of vested interests influencing the evidence, and authors from two trials omitted information related to the sources of funding and conflicts of interest.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no certain evidence that IR methylphenidate compared with placebo or lithium can reduce symptoms of ADHD in adults (low- and very low-certainty evidence). Adults treated with IR methylphenidate are at increased risk of gastrointestinal and metabolic-related harms compared with placebo. Clinicians should consider whether it is appropriate to prescribe IR methylphenidate, given its limited efficacy and increased risk of harms. Future RCTs should explore the long-term efficacy and risks of IR methylphenidate, and the influence of conflicts of interest on reported effects.

Regarding medical management for stimulant use disorder, more specifically with respect to psychostimulants, methylphenidate, AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering a long-acting methylphenidate formulation to promote reduced use of amphetamine-type stimulants in patients with amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder.

Methylphenidate

Methylphenidate shares many of the actions of amphetamines, although it does not fully substitute for catecholamines at the level of the dopamine transporter. The compound became popular for use in narcolepsy in the 1950s. It is primarily a DAT reuptake inhibitor, but it has also been shown to increase dopamine release. As an amphetamine, methylphenidate is also not fully specific for dopaminergic transmission, also affecting more mildly other monoamines. Furthermore, D-isomers have different pharmacokinetics and are more specific for dopaminergic synapses than the L-isomer. D-isomers are also more potent.

Methylphenidate has a short half-life and is water-soluble. It is readily absorbed and enters the brain effectively, also producing rapidly increasing concentration in the brain and a sensation of rush. As for amphetamine, methylphenidate is addictive and can lead to drug-seeking behaviors and tolerance. Onset of effects after oral administration is 20 minutes and duration of action is only approximately three hours.

The addictive potential of methylphenidate is highly dependent on formulation, with extended-release formulations having less potential for addiction. Because it is soluble, prescribed methylphenidate can be reformulated differently and has a street value for stimulant abusers. The large number of formulations available for methylphenidate (D- (dextro), L- (levo), both, and various release formulations) as a treatment for ADHD has also increased choice for hypersomnia therapies.

Methylphenidate has a similar side effect profile to amphetamines (e.g. cardiovascular effects, psychosis), although as it is primarily a DAT inhibitor, it has not been shown to be as cytotoxic in animal studies. As for amphetamines, methylphenidate suppresses primarily non-REM sleep, promoting wakefulness, but also REM sleep. It is mostly effective on wakefulness and has minimal effects on cataplexy and other narcolepsy symptoms. Effective doses are listed in Table 1, keeping in mind that as for the amphetamines, there is great variation in effectiveness across preparations, and it is unusual to have to go beyond 60 mg/day, preferably using long-acting formulations.

### Driving performance and ocular activity following acute administration of 10 mg methylphenidate: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^112LfxdQ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

While the use of technology to monitor gaze behaviour offers considerable potential for identifying real-time impairment and thereby reducing the incidence of road trauma, the subtle changes observed in our study, particularly the isolated reduction in fixation duration, provide only limited support for enhancing the capabilities of DMS. The absence of adverse effects on driving performance that might indicate an increased risk of collision, coupled with the general lack of strong ocular evidence of impairment, emphasise the reliability and potential precision of such monitoring technologies. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how pharmacological distinctions between prescribed (e.g. methylphenidate) and illicit stimulants (e.g. methamphetamine) are reflected in discernible driving behaviours. This research builds on prior studies that have explored specific amphetamine-induced alterations in gaze behaviour while driving, suggesting that while some stimulants may enhance certain cognitive functions beneficial for driving, others may lead to detrimental effects. By further delineating these pharmacological impacts, we can better tailor DMS technologies to detect and respond to various degrees of drug-induced driving impairments, potentially integrating more nuanced behavioural markers beyond basic gaze metrics to improve road safety outcomes.

### Management of fatigue in adult survivors of cancer: ASCO-Society for Integrative Oncology guideline update [^111gs3kz]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Psychostimulants for CRF show limited support overall and conditional guidance against routine use. After treatment, one RCT, N = 154, follow-up 8 weeks, of d-Methylphenidate 5 mg twice daily increasing to a maximum of 50 mg per day (dosing frequency: twice or three times daily) was positive, yet the table notes Moderate certainty of evidence and states Strength of recommendation against routine use is conditional on the basis of a single trial and potential for adverse effects. In advanced cancer or EOL, five RCTs, N = 520, 4/5 trials screened for fatigue, follow-up 6–15 days, yielded 4/5 negative trials across methylphenidate 5–25 mg/day, d-Methylphenidate titrated to a maximum of 15 mg twice daily, or dexamphetamine 20 mg/day, with Moderate certainty of evidence and the acknowledgement that some clinicians may choose to try psychostimulants for symptom management.

Serious adverse events

We could only include nine parallel group trials (4.9%) reporting serious adverse events. For these trials methylphenidate was not associated with an overall increase in total number of serious adverse events (risk ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 2.22, 1532 participants, fig 3). All the trials had high risk of bias owing to vested interest, incomplete outcome data, lack of blinding, and selective outcome reporting. The GRADE assessment was very low quality as a result of high risk of bias and imprecision. Eight crossover trials reported serious adverse events at the end of the last period. These trials did not seem to differ between intervention groups (risk ratio 1.62, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 7.71, 1721 participants; I² = 0%, P = 0.65).

Fig 3 Serious adverse events in parallel group trials. Green = low risk of bias; yellow = uncertain risk of bias; red = high risk of bias. See Cochrane review for details of references

We conducted trial sequential analysis on the "total serious adverse events" outcome, involving nine parallel group trials. We had planned to use a relative risk reduction of 20% but owing to too large a distance between the accrued information and the required information the program rejected to calculate and draw an interpretable figure. We therefore increased the relative risk reduction to 25%. We included trials with zero serious adverse events by substituting a constant of 0.5 for zero. We calculated the diversity adjusted required information size (DARIS) on the basis of serious adverse events in the control group of 2%; a relative risk reduction or increase in the experimental group of 25%; type I error of 5%; type II error of 20% (80% power); and diversity (D 2) of 0%, the DARIS was 21 593 participants. The cumulative Z curve did not cross the conventional or trial sequential monitoring boundaries for benefit, harm, or futility (fig 4). As only less than 7% of the DARIS was accured, risks of random type II error cannot be excluded. The trial sequential analysis adjusted intervention effect is risk ratio 0.91% (95% confidence interval 0.02 to 33.2). Therefore, the total sample size in the meta-analysis of serious adverse events for 1532 participants was considerably under powered to identify a difference in serious adverse events.

Non-serious adverse events

We could only include 26 parallel group trials (14.0%) reporting non-serious adverse events. Methylphenidate was associated with an overall risk of total number of non-serious adverse events by 29% (risk ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.51, 21 trials, 3132 participants, fig 5). All trials had high risk of bias owing to lack of blinding of participants, lack of outcome assessor blinding, vested interest, selective outcome reporting, and incomplete outcome data. The GRADE assessment was very low quality as a result of high risk of bias and heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was substantial between trials (τ² = 0.08, χ² = 61.94, df = 12, P < 0.001); I² = 81%), which did not seem to be related to dose (test for subgroup difference between low dose and high dose methylphenidate, P = 0.57). The adverse events reported over all trials included neurological, digestive, urinary, circulatory, respiratory, reproductive, skeletal, muscular, and immunological adverse events as well as physical measures such as difference in height, weight, body mass index, and vital signs. The most common non-serious adverse events were decreased appetite (risk ratio 3.66, 95% confidence interval 2.56 to 5.23, 16 trials, 2962 participants; I² = 18%) and sleep problems (1.60, 1.15 to 2.23, 13 trials, 2416 participants; I² = 0%).

### Immediate-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^117KXWLc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), diagnosed mainly in children, often persist into adulthood. Adults in this group have a high rate of other psychiatric problems and functional difficulties in a number of key areas such as academic achievement, interpersonal relationships, and employment. Although the usefulness of immediate-release methylphenidate in children has been extensively studied, studies in adults, which are few, demonstrate varying results.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of immediate-release methylphenidate versus placebo in the treatment of adults with ADHD.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases in November 2013: CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), and two trials registers. Biosis was searched in December 2013. We inspected references of all relevant papers to identify more studies and contacted authors of recently published trials.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized trials comparing immediate-release methylphenidate versus placebo in participants aged 18 years or older with ADHD. We excluded trials conducted on subpopulations of adults with ADHD such as adults with both ADHD and substance dependence.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed trial risk of bias. We contacted authors of trials to ask for additional and missing data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs.

Main Results

Results from the 11 randomized controlled trials (474 participants, counting participants from cross-over studies as a single arm, and counting both arms from parallel studies) included in the review demonstrated improvement in core clinical ADHD symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattentiveness, and overall improvement. We were able to pool results from 10 studies, which included 466 participants. Most included studies were judged to have unclear risk of bias for most categories. However, as all studies were randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled and, in general, did not contain factors that significantly decreased the quality of the body of evidence, the quality of evidence was assessed as "high" for most outcomes according to the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. For one outcome-inattentiveness-most information came from studies at unclear risk of bias, and so the quality of evidence for this outcome was judged as "moderate". Results are given as SMD for each of the core clinical symptoms of ADHD. In all cases, participant numbers were calculated by counting participants in a single arm from cross-over studies and in both arms from parallel studies. The SMD for the outcome of hyperactivity was -0.60 (95% CI -1.11 to -0.09, 6 studies, number of participants (n) = 245, high-quality evidence) in favor of immediate-release methylphenidate; the SMD for impulsivity was -0.62 (95% CI -1.08 to -0.17, 5 studies, n = 207, high-quality evidence) in favor of immediate-release methylphenidate; and the SMD for inattentiveness was -0.66 (95% CI -1.02 to -0.30, 7 studies, n = 391, moderate-quality evidence) in favor of immediate-release methylphenidate. Moderate to extreme statistical heterogeneity was detected for all outcomes. Subgroup analysis comparing high versus low doses did not indicate that higher doses of immediate-release methylphenidate were associated with greater efficacy. For overall change, the SMD was -0.72 (95% CI -1.12 to -0.32, 9 studies, n = 455, high-quality evidence) in favor of immediate-release methylphenidate. The effects of immediate-release methylphenidate on anxiety and depression as parameters of general changes in mental state were equivocal. Some trials reported reduction in depression and anxiety, others detailed no change, and still others described an increase in depressive and anxious symptoms. The most common adverse effect was loss of appetite, in some cases with weight loss. Although no study reported either of these effects as problematic or severe, the included studies were of short duration; thus clinical significance could not be properly assessed. Five studies reported changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and three reported increases in heart rate. None of these results were judged to present cause for concern. No study reported clinically significant adverse effects-cardiovascular or other. Three studies did not mention adverse effects. We were unable to determine whether adverse effects were not discussed by study authors because none occurred, or because no data on adverse effects were collected.

Authors' Conclusions

Data from randomized controlled trials suggest that immediate-release methylphenidate is efficacious for treating adults with ADHD with symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattentiveness, and for improving their overall clinical condition. Trial data suggest that adverse effects from immediate-release methylphenidate for adults with ADHD are not of serious clinical significance, although this conclusion may be limited, certainly in the case of weight loss, by the short duration of published studies.

### Efficacy and safety of methylphenidate in 45 adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder. A randomized placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over trial [^115ZnZWZ]. Psychological Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Data on the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate in adults with attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are lacking in Europe. This study was undertaken to report on the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate in an adult out-patient population with ADHD, and to compare results with US data.

Method

A double-blind randomized cross-over trial comparing methylphenidate and placebo in 45 adults with ADHD with childhood onset was performed in a dose-titration design. Methylphenidate was titrated from 0.5 mg/kg per day in week 1 up to 1.0 mg/kg per day in week 3.

Results

Response rates using methylphenidate varied between 38 and 51%, and using placebo between 7 and 18% (p < 0.05), depending on outcome measure used. Although the overall percentage of subjects having any side effect on both methylphenidate and placebo was rather high, side effects on methylphenidate over and above those on placebo were few and mild.

Conclusions

Methylphenidate proves to be an effective and well tolerated treatment for symptoms of ADHD in adults in the short term. Future research should study the long-term response and clarify the impact of gender, co-morbidity, socio-economic status and IQ on response rates in adults with ADHD.

### Methylphenidate treatment [^112T18AL]. Pediatric Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Methylphenidate is the psychotropic drug most commonly used to treat individuals suffering from developmental attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Additional attention deficit is part of numerous neurologic diseases in childhood. Despite the vast extent of scientific research on methylphenidate, the use of this stimulant in the treatment of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction in children with epilepsy, brain tumor, leukemia, closed brain injury, encephalitis, meningitis, or mental retardation continues to be controversial. Only few data exist about the efficacy and side effects of methylphenidate treatment in children with this neurologic illness or history. The aim of the present study is to provide a review of this important clinical topic and perhaps to stimulate further controlled investigations.

5.1 Potential for Abuse and Dependence

CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA), other methylphenidate-containing products, and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy [see Boxed Warning, Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2, 9.3)].

5.2 Serious Cardiovascular Reactions

Sudden death, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults with CNS-stimulant treatment at recommended doses. Sudden death has been reported in pediatric patients with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious heart problems taking CNS stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, and other serious heart problems. Further evaluate patients who develop exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or arrhythmias during methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) treatment.

5.3 Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases

CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase approximately 2 to 4 mmHg) and heart rate (mean increase approximately 3 to 6 beats per minute). Individuals may have larger increases. Monitor all patients for hypertension and tachycardia.

5.4 Psychiatric Adverse Reactions

Exacerbation of Preexisting Psychosis

CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a preexisting psychotic disorder.

Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder

CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed mood episode in patients. Prior to initiating treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, or depression).

New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms

CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA). In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients, compared to 0 in placebo-treated patients.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Limited published literature, based on breast milk sampling from five mothers, reports that methylphenidate is present in human milk, which resulted in infant doses of 0.16% to 0.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 1.1 and 2.7. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. However, long-term neurodevelopmental effects on infants from stimulant exposure are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as agitation, anorexia, and reduced weight gain.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release in pediatric patients under 6 years have not been established.

Safety and efficacy of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release were evaluated in a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study in 119 children 4 to < 6 years of age with ADHD followed by a 12-month open-label extension in 44 of these children. In these studies, patients experienced high rates of adverse reactions, most notably weight loss. Comparing weights prior to initiation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release (in the safety and efficacy study) to weights after 12 months of treatment (in the open-label extension), 20 of 39 patients with data (50%) had lost enough weight to decrease 10 or more percentiles on a Centers for Disease Control growth chart for weight. In addition, systemic drug exposures in patients 4 to < 6 years of age were higher than those observed in older children and adolescents at the same dose (2 to 3 fold higher Cmaxand AUC). Therefore, the benefits of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release do not outweigh the risks in pediatric patients 4 to < 6 years of age.

The safety and effectiveness of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release have been established in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years in two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The long-term efficacy of methylphenidate in pediatric patients has not been established.

### Debate: are stimulant medications for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder effective in the long term? (for) [^117MmqwR]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Long-term effectiveness studies for ADHD medications are complicated to design well, and no single study design will capture the entire picture. Although randomized controlled trials are the highest level of evidence, most authorities agree that, when you have treatments as efficacious as the ADHD medications (methylphenidate and amphetamine derivatives and prodrugs, atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine), it is neither practical nor ethical to conduct long-term placebo-controlled RCTs. As a consequence, almost all of the RCT evidence for ADHD medications relates to short-term studies. Although these provide strong evidence for short-term efficacy, 1 they do not speak to long-term effectiveness. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recognized the need for additional evidence of long-term effects before granting licenses for medications that will usually be required to be taken for several years. They therefore introduced a requirement for companies to demonstrate longer-term efficacy. This has generally been done through the use of randomized withdrawal designs that are designed to demonstrate continued efficacy over a period of 6 to 12 months. Several of these have been completed and published, all of which, as expected, demonstrate continued efficacy. 2 The EMA also insisted that all new ADHD medications demonstrate continued effectiveness, and that adverse effects and safety be assessed up to 2 years. Again the studies completed so far support continued effectiveness, and, although highlighting the presence of common, expected adverse effects, have not identified any new safety signals or unexpected problems in targeted areas such as growth and cognition. 3.

### Methylphenidate and the risk of new-onset seizures [^1133q3V6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is usually treated with stimulant drugs such as methylphenidate (MPH). ADHD is associated with an increased risk of seizures and, in this context, concerns have been expressed that stimulant drugs, including MPH, may increase the seizure risk. However, 4 large observational studies have found that ADHD drugs in general and stimulant drugs in particular are not associated with increased seizure risk and may, in fact, be associated with a reduced risk of seizures; these studies were largely conducted in children and adolescents, including those with epilepsy, with or without other brain comorbidities. The findings were obtained in both between-subjects and within-subjects analyses; the latter controlled for time-invariant inadequately measured, unmeasured, and unknown confounds. These reassuring results support the results of many small, short-duration trials that found that MPH was not associated with increased seizure risk. One other observational study however found that MPH was indeed associated with an increased risk of seizures, but only during the first 30 days after drug initiation; there was no increase in risk in earlier or later time windows. There are many reasons why this single finding should be viewed with reservation; in any case, even if the finding is valid, the absolute risk of seizures with MPH appears to be very low. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that MPH may be safely used in children and adolescents, even those with a current or past history of epilepsy; however, prudence dictates that attention be paid to potential seizure triggers during the first month of treatment. This risk needs to be specifically reexamined in future research.

WARNING: ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION

Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules have a high potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

Before prescribing methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks, proper storage of the drug, and proper disposal of any unused drug. Throughout methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules treatment, reassess each patient's risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

### Methylphenidate poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^116KPHgp]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

A review of US poison center data for 2004 showed over 8,000 ingestions of methylphenidate. A guideline that determines the conditions for emergency department referral and prehospital care could potentially optimize patient outcome, avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce health care costs, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the lead author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial out-of-hospital management of patients with suspected ingestions of methylphenidate by 1) describing the process by which a specialist in poison information should evaluate an exposure to methylphenidate, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of methylphenidate ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This review focuses on the ingestion of more than a single therapeutic dose of methylphenidate and the effects of an overdose and is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) All patients with suicidal intent, intentional abuse, or in cases in which a malicious intent is suspected (e.g., child abuse or neglect) should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 2) In patients without evidence of self-harm, abuse, or malicious intent, poison center personnel should elicit additional information including the time of the ingestion, the precise dose ingested, and the presence of coingestants (Grade D). 3) Patients who are chronically taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and who have ingested any amount of methylphenidate require referral to an emergency department (Grade D). 4) Patients experiencing any changes in behavior other than mild stimulation or agitation should be referred to an emergency department. Examples of moderate to severe symptoms that warrant referral include moderate-to-severe agitation, hallucinations, abnormal muscle movements, headache, chest pain, loss of consciousness, or convulsions (Grade D). 5) For patients referred to an emergency department, transportation via ambulance should be considered based on several factors including the condition of the patient and the length of time it will take for the patient to arrive at the emergency department (Grade D). 6) If the patient has no symptoms, and more than 3 hours have elapsed between the time of ingestion and the call to the poison center, referral to an emergency department is not recommended (Grade D). 7) Patients with acute or acute-on-chronic ingestions of less than a toxic dose (see recommendations 8, 9, and 10) or chronic exposures to methylphenidate with no or mild symptoms can be observed at home with instructions to call the poison center back if symptoms develop or worsen. For acute-on-chronic ingestions, the caller should be instructed not to administer methylphenidate to the patient for the next 24 hours. The poison center should consider making a follow-up call at approximately 3 hours after ingestion (Grade D). 8) Patients who ingest more than 2 mg/kg or 60 mg, whichever is less, of an immediate-release formulation (or the equivalent amount of a modified-release formulation that has been chewed) should be referred to an emergency department (Grade C). 9) If a patch has been swallowed, consider the entire contents of the patch (not just the labeled dose of the patch) to have been ingested. Patients who ingest more than 2 mg/kg or 60 mg, whichever is less should be referred to an emergency department. If it is known that the patch has been chewed only briefly, and the patch remains intact, significant toxicity is unlikely and emergency department referral is not necessary (Grade D). 10) Patients who ingest more than 4 mg/kg or 120 mg, whichever is less, of an intact modified-release formulation should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 11) For oral exposures, do not induce emesis (Grade D). 12) Pre-hospital activated charcoal administration, if available, should only be carried out by health professionals and only if no contraindications are present. Do not delay transportation in order to administer activate charcoal (Grade D). 13) Benzodiazepines can be administered by EMS personnel if agitation, dystonia, or convulsions are present and if authorized by EMS medical direction expressed by written treatment protocol or policy or direct medical oversight (Grade C). 14) Standard advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) measures should be administered by EMS personnel if respiratory arrest, cardiac dysrhythmias, or cardiac arrest are present and if authorized by EMS medical direction expressed by written treatment protocol or policy or direct medical oversight (Grade C).

### Methylphenidate and the risk of psychotic disorders and hallucinations in children and adolescents in a large health system [^111awNvL]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by a persistent pattern of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that is pervasive across different settings. It is common among school-aged children and adolescents with a worldwide prevalence around 5%. ADHD has a diverse range of adverse outcomes in health, intellectual and psychosocial well-being. Children with ADHD frequently experience low academic attainment, rejection by peers and low self-esteem. In addition, ADHD is frequently comorbid with other mental health problems such as conduct disorders and substance misuse. Therefore, behavioural intervention and/or drug treatment is usually required to mitigate these symptoms and impairments. The guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom recommend the use of methylphenidate (MPH), dexamfetamine and atomoxetine when drug intervention is considered appropriate for the management of ADHD. In the past two decades, ADHD treatment prescribing trends have risen rapidly in the United States (US), Canada, the UK, Germanyand Hong Kong (HK). As suggested by a very recently published commentary and a meta-analysis, it is important to evaluate the risks (that is, adverse effects) as well as benefits of MPH treatment in clinical practice.

MPH is the most commonly prescribed medication treatment for ADHD. It acts primarily as a dopamine–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor by binding to and blocking dopamine transporters. As increased levels of synaptic dopamine are implicated in the generation of psychotic symptoms, the pharmacological mechanism of MPH also implies a potential to induce psychotic symptoms and disorders. Data from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Agency's Yellow Card schemeshowed that out of 1335 adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports for MPH received by the end of July 2015, 663 were associated with psychiatric disorders, making these the most frequently reported class of ADR. Among these reports, 105 cases (15.8%) reported hallucinations, psychosis or psychotic disorders, or schizoaffective disorders. Mosholder et al. reviewed and analysed data from the medication manufacturers on ADHD drugs from 49 randomised controlled clinical trials. They identified a total of 11 psychosis/mania adverse events during 743 person-years of follow-up in 5717 individuals (1.48 events per 100 person-years or one event in every 70 years of treatment) compared with none reported with placebo, giving a number needed to harm of 526.

### Methylphenidate and the risk of psychosis in adolescents and young adults: a population-based cohort study [^116T5iBy]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Longitudinal studies, have shown that attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood is a risk factor for a diagnosis of psychosis in adult life. Research indicates that these disorders share common geneticand environmental aetiologies. A potential mediator of the association between ADHD and psychosis is the prescription of central stimulants for ADHD, which causes considerable concern for clinicians. Clinical guidelinesrecommend stimulant medications, including methylphenidate and dexamphetamine, as first-line treatments for ADHD. Central stimulants act as indirect dopamine agonists and are presumed to amplify neuronal signalling by prompting a marked increase in the extracellular concentration of neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Increased concentrations of synaptic dopamine have also been implicated in the generation of psychotic symptoms. Hence, the pharmacological mechanism of central stimulant medication can be viewed by clinicians as having the potential to induce psychotic symptoms and disorders.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Clinical concerns have been raised that prescribing methylphenidate, the most common pharmacological treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), might increase the risk of treatment-emergent psychotic events, particularly in young people with a history of psychosis. This perceived risk can lead to clinicians withholding methylphenidate treatment or using less effective alternatives. We searched PubMed for studies published in English on or after Jan 1, 2000, that investigated the association between methylphenidate prescribing, ADHD, and psychosis. We screened abstracts for relevance by use of combinations of the search terms "methylphenidate OR stimulants", "ADHD", and "psychosis". We also reviewed clinical guidelines from national bodies, including the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence and relevant Cochrane systematic reviews. There is no clear consensus as to whether methylphenidate treatment, particularly in older adolescents and young adults and in individuals with a history of psychosis, increases the risk of psychotic events. Some observational studies that report an increased risk of psychotic events associated with methylphenidate might be affected by confounding by indication. Clinical trial data is also relatively unhelpful in answering this question because of the routine exclusion of participants with previous psychosis, short follow-up periods, and the low incidence of psychotic events in these studies.

### Evolution of the treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children: a review [^112Fk15S]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Efficacious and well-tolerated medications are available for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Stimulants such as methylphenidate (MPH) and amphetamines are the most widely used medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ADHDin children.

Objective

This article reviews the literature on the development and use of medications for the treatment of ADHD in children.

Methods

A search of MEDLINE was conducted toidentify relevant studies and critical reviews on the treatment of ADHD in children. The main criteria for inclusion of a study were that it have a controlled design, enroll > 100 subjects if a clinical trial and > 20 subjects if a classroom study, assess symptoms with the most widely used scales and tests, and be published from 2000 to 2008. A few older pivotal studies were also included.

Results

Many studies have reported the long-term efficacy and tolerability of immediate-release formulations of MPH. The disadvantages of such formulations include the need for multiple daily dosing and a potential for abuse. Various extended-release formulations of MPH have been found effective in controlled studies enrolling large numbers of children with ADHD. The efficacy and tolerability of dexmethylphenidate, the active D-isomer of MPH, in an extended-release formulation have also been reported. An extended-release formulation of mixed amphetamine salts (MMAS-XR) that is dosed once daily has been found to be efficacious and well tolerated. The non-stimulant atomoxetine has been reported to be well tolerated and efficacious, although it may not be as effective as stimulants; this formulation is, however, less likely than stimulants to be associated with abuse and diversion. A recently approved prodrug stimulant, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX), was developed to provide a long duration of effect that is consistent throughout the day, with a reduced potential for abuse. In a placebo-controlled study in children with ADHD, less intersubject variability in T(max), C(max), and AUC from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration was seen in the 8 subjects who received LDX (percent coefficient of variation, 15.3, 20.3, and 21.6, respectively) compared with the 9 subjects who received MAS-XR (52.8, 44.0, and 42.8). In 2 clinical trials, significantly greater improvements in teacher and parent ratings of ADHD symptoms were seen with LDX compared with placebo (P < 0.001). A study of the abuse potential of LDX evaluated subjective responses to the effects of oral LDX and immediate-release d-amphetamine in adults with a history of stimulant abuse. LDX was associated with a significantly lower abuse-related liking effect than d-aamphetamine (P = 0.039).

Conclusions

Currently available treatments for ADHD in children are efficacious and well tolerated, but many of them are limited by the requirement for multiple daily dosing and abuse potential. LDX, a long-acting prodrug of d-amphetamine, has been reported to be effective and appears to overcome some of these limitations.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Limited published literature, based on milk sampling from seven mothers reports that methylphenidate is present in human milk, which resulted in infant doses of 0.16% to 0.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 1.1 and 2.7. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. Long-term neurodevelopmental effects on infants from stimulant exposure are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Methylin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Methylin or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as agitation, insomnia, anorexia, and reduced weight gain.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of Methylin for the treatment of ADHD have been established in pediatric patients six years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of Methylin in pediatric patients under six years of age have not been established. The long-term efficacy of methylphenidate in pediatric patients has not been established.

Long-Term Suppression of Growth

Growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, including Methylin. Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data

In a study conducted in young rats, methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day for 9 weeks, starting early in the postnatal period (postnatal Day 7) and continuing through sexual maturity (postnatal Week 10). When these animals were tested as adults (postnatal Weeks 13–14), decreased spontaneous locomotor activity was observed in males and females previously treated with 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to children on a mg/m2basis) or greater, and a deficit in the acquisition of a specific learning task was seen in females exposed to the highest dose (8 times the MRHD given to children on a mg/m2basis). The no effect level for juvenile neurobehavioral development in rats (5 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD given to children on a mg/m2basis. The clinical significance of the long-term behavioral effects observed in rats is unknown.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Methylin has not been studied in the geriatric population.

### Psychosis with use of amphetamine drugs, methylphenidate and atomoxetine in adolescent and adults [^114GAGMe]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity–impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. International guidelinesconcerning the pharmacological treatment of ADHD suggest the use of psychostimulants (mostly methylphenidate, dexamfetamine, lisdexamfetamine) and non-psychostimulants (atomoxetine, guanfacine). No specification of preference between methylphenidate and lisdexamfetamine is made for pharmacological management of adults with ADHD. Dexamfetamine and atomoxetine are recommended respectively in second- and third-line treatment in these guidelines.

Psychostimulants, such as amphetamine and amphetamine-like (methylphenidate), are known to block the dopamine transporter, which inhibits the reuptake of dopamine in presynaptic terminals, and enhance the dopamine and norepinephrine releases, mainly (when they are used in normal condition of prescription) in the prefrontal cortex. According to some studies, the release of dopamine may be four times greater with amphetamine than with methylphenidate. Atomoxetine also increases dopamine and norepinephrine release in the prefrontal cortex.

Among the potential side effects of methylphenidate, amphetamines and atomoxetine, the risk of onset of psychosis episode was reported. The occurrence of psychotic symptoms and disorders with these drugs could be explained by increased concentrations of synaptic dopamine. In a review requested by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2008, data of 49 randomised controlled clinical trials were analysed and concluded that 'patients and physicians should be aware that psychosis or mania arising during drug treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may represent adverse drug reactions'. In 2018, a Cochrane systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (with 10 randomised trials (1103 participants), 17 non-randomised studies (76 237 participants) and 12 patient reports) could not confirm or refute whether methylphenidate increases the risk of psychotic symptoms. More recently, a large cohort study (221 846 adolescents and young adults), using data from two US administrative claims databases, found 343 episodes of psychosis, with 106 episodes in the methylphenidate group and 237 episodes in the amphetamine group. The study concluded that amphetamine use was associated with a greater risk of psychosis than methylphenidate use (with an HR across both databases of 1.65 (95% CI 1.35 to 2.09)).

### Pharmacotherapy of obesity: an update on the available medications and drugs under investigation [^1128jSRc]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methylphenidate

Methylphenidate is a stimulant approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). It is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor that is suggested to reduce energy intake. A prospective study on 78 adults with ADHD and severe obesity (mean BMI 42 kg/m 2) who received psychostimulants, including amphetamine, methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine, showed a total body weight loss of 12% in treated participants over a mean time of 466 days of observation. A cross-over placebo-controlled trial of 14 adults (mean BMI 25.0 (4.0) kg/m 2) with ADHD, compared methylphenidate to placebo, and showed a significant reduction in fat and energy intake 1 h after the ingestion of a buffet styled lunch. In a small trial, 9 adult men with obesity and without ADHD, were randomized to receive placebo, moderate (0.5 mg/kg) or high (1 mg/kg) dose methylphenidate. There was a significant reduction in energy intake by 23% in the intervention arms, compared to placebo (p < 0.02) as measured by pizza consumption in an acute laboratory setting 1 h after ingestion of the medication. The most common side effects associated with the use of methylphenidate are headache, insomnia, upper abdominal pain, tachycardia and anorexia.

A currently ongoing 2-month phase 3 trial compares the effect of methylphenidate at a dose of 0.50 mg/kg BID (n = 20) to placebo (n = 20) in adolescents and adults aged 16–40 years with obesity, on energy intake as a primary outcome, energy expenditure and body weight as secondary outcomes. The study completion date was December 2018, but no results are available online yet.

### Long-term safety of methylphenidate in children and adolescents with ADHD: 2-year outcomes of the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder drugs use chronic effects (ADDUCE) study [^116ajxaS]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Background

Methylphenidate is the most frequently prescribed medication for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents in many countries. Although many randomised controlled trials support short-term efficacy, tolerability, and safety, data on long-term safety and tolerability are scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety of methylphenidate over a 2-year period in relation to growth and development, psychiatric health, neurological health, and cardiovascular function in children and adolescents.

Methods

We conducted a naturalistic, longitudinal, controlled study as part of the ADDUCE research programme in 27 European child and adolescent mental health centres in the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and Hungary. Participants aged 6–17 years were recruited into three cohorts: medication-naive ADHD patients who intended to start methylphenidate treatment (methylphenidate group), medication-naive ADHD patients who did not intend to start any ADHD medication (no-methylphenidate group), and a control group without ADHD. Children with ADHD diagnosed by a qualified clinician according to the DSM-IV criteria and, in the control group, children who scored less than 1.5 on average on the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham IV rating scale for ADHD items, and whose hyperactivity score on the parent-rated Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was within the normal range (< 6) were eligible for inclusion. Participants were excluded if they had previously taken any ADHD medications but remained eligible if they had previously taken or were currently taking other psychotropic drugs. The primary outcome was height velocity (height velocity SD score; estimated from at least two consecutive height measurements, and normalised with reference to the mean and SD of a population of the same age and sex).

Findings

Between Feb 01, 2012, and Jan 31, 2016, 1410 participants were enrolled (756 in methylphenidate group, 391 in no-methylphenidate group, and 263 in control group). 1070 (76.3%) participants were male, 332 (23.7%) were female, and for eight gender was unknown. The average age for the cohort was 9.28 years (SD 2.78; IQR 7–11). 1312 (93.0%) of 1410 participants were White. The methylphenidate and no-methylphenidate groups differed in ADHD symptom severity and other characteristics. After controlling for the effects of these variables using propensity scores, there was little evidence of an effect on growth (24 months height velocity SD score difference -0.07 (95% CI -0.18 to 0.04; p = 0.20) or increased risk of psychiatric or neurological adverse events in the methylphenidate group compared with the no-methylphenidate group. Pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were higher in the methylphenidate group compared with the no-methylphenidate group after 24 months of treatment. No serious adverse events were reported during the study.

Interpretation

Our results suggest that long-term treatment with methylphenidate for 2 years is safe. There was no evidence to support the hypothesis that methylphenidate treatment leads to reductions in growth. Methylphenidate-related pulse and blood pressure changes, although relatively small, require regular monitoring.

### The cardiovascular safety of methylphenidate [^116ggLk8]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

At first glance, these new data seem at odds with results from cohort studies in US Medicaid and private health insurance databases. Large analyses of over 200 000 children with a diagnosis of ADHD found no difference in rates of adverse cardiovascular events in children who started taking methylphenidate compared with those who did not, regardless of whether children with pre-existing cardiovascular disease were included. While potential biases in either design could explain the discrepancy, it must also be noted that the case only study here and the earlier cohort studies ask different questions. The cohort studies ask about "cumulative effects", — that is, did cardiovascular events occur more often among those who started taking methylphenidate than among those who did not? In contrast, the case only study asks about "triggering effects", — that is, did patients experience an adverse cardiovascular event near the start of their drug treatment more often than during other periods, either before starting methylphenidate or after stopping it. As the authors say, their study asks "why now?" not "why me?"

Implicitly, the triggering effect reported by Shin and colleagues concerns children with a high risk of serious cardiovascular events. Indeed, their participants differed from those in the cohort studies. Among those with arrhythmia, there was about five times the prevalence of congenital heart disease (5% v 0.8%) and two and a half times the prevalence of use of antipsychotics (13% v 5%). Antipsychotic drugs can prolong the QTc interval, which, in rare circumstances, can lead to an unstable arrhythmia and sudden death.

It is difficult to characterize the absolute risk in a case only study design. But in a population based study of children surgically treated for a congenital heart defect, the annual rate of sudden cardiac death over 20 years ranged from one case per 454 children to one case per 7154 children, depending on the type of defect. The findings of Shin and colleagues suggest that, among this subgroup, the rate could be increased up to threefold during the first few days of methylphenidate use, as the drug is associated with a threefold increased risk of arrhythmia in children with congenital heart disease. In the average child, the risk of serious cardiovascular events is extremely small (3 per 100 000) and any absolute increase associated with methylphenidate is also likely to be small.

Purpose

Delayed-release/extended-release methylphenidate (DR/ER-MPH) (formerly HLD200) is an evening-dosed agent used for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Postmarketing surveillance data from approximately 74,000 patients exposed to DR/ER-MPH (up to June 17, 2022) were reported and compared with the open-label, treatment-optimization phase of a Phase III clinical trial to derive possible learnings on how to approach adverse events (AEs) that emerge during dose titration.

Methods

An analysis of AEs spontaneously reported to Ironshore in postmarketing surveillance included, where available, age, dose, timing, and discontinuations. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics.

Findings

A total of 395 children, adolescents, and adults reported 601 AEs in postmarketing surveillance. Five AEs were classified as serious. AEs preceded drug use discontinuation in 172 patients. Many AEs occurred early (52% were reported within 30 days) and at lower doses (54% were reported at 20 to 40 mg), similar to the trial data. Reported AEs included those similar in type but orders of magnitude lower in number than those from the clinical trial.

Implications

No new safety concerns were revealed in this real-world setting compared with the safety profile identified in DR/ER-MPH trial data. In real-world practices, clinicians tended to discontinue DR/ER-MPH treatment after AE onset, whereas trial investigators continued to optimize treatment and found that AEs were generally tolerable, suggesting that health care practitioners may consider developing strategies to manage tolerability issues with DR/ER-MPH treatment on AE emergence rather than immediately discontinuing use of the drug to provide optimal therapeutic benefit.

### Enhancing ADHD medication adherence: challenges and opportunities [^113aTNkZ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Medication Effects

The most important medication factors influencing adherence are effectiveness and tolerability. Ease of use, simplified dose regimen, and cost are also important. The range of formulations for psychostimulants has burgeoned over the last decade, especially in the United States compared with other jurisdictions. A recent review of ADHD treatment studies examined ADHD medication use greater than 12 months, and found studies of four psychostimulant preparations (methylphenidate immediate release, amphetamine, OROS methylphenidate, and mixed amphetamine salts) and a discontinuation trial evaluating atomoxetine. While best evidence suggests that psychostimulants preparations are all efficacious compared to placebo, very few head-to-head trials among stimulant preparations have been done. However, the once daily formulation of OROS methylphenidate is more likely to be taken consistently than immediate release methylphenidate which requires multiple doses daily for efficacy. While the psychostimulants and atomoxetine both reduce ADHD symptoms, and improve social and academic functioning in placebo controlled trials, not all children benefit equally well. Another comparison of two agents examined OROS methylphenidate and atomoxetine over several weeks, with the conclusion that OROS methylphenidate is more efficacious for core ADHD symptoms.

Overall a substantial proportion of treatment discontinuation in the first few months is due to adverse effects of medication. While families often may tolerate some adverse effects over months to years, such as decreased appetite or mild insomnia, other symptoms such as stomach aches, or headaches may be less tolerable. A long-term comparison of dextroamphetamine with methylphenidate formulations, suggests dextroamphetamine agents are less well tolerated by girls than boys. In particular, psychological side effect such as mood changes, irritability, depression and subdued personality are frequent reasons for discontinuation. Increased moodiness and irritability appears to be more common among preschool children than older ones. Other reasons for changing or discontinuing medications are slowing of the child's growth, development of tics, rashes and other concerns the young person or family attribute to the medication. Psychotic symptoms, are estimated to occur ADHD medications at a rate of 1.5 events / 100 person years and suicidal ideation is estimated to occur 5/1357 (0.37%) in pediatric patients taking atomoxetine.

Symptoms of ADHD

Data on symptoms of ADHD in our analyses were available from 25 parallel group trials and 74 crossover trials (53.0%) reporting on such symptoms. The results showed an effect of methylphenidate on teacher rated symptoms in the parallel group trials (standardised mean difference −0.77, 95% confidence interval −0.90 to −0.64, 19 trials, 1698 participants, fig 2). This corresponds to a mean difference of −9.6 points (95% confidence interval −13.75 to −6.38) on the ADHD rating scale, which was larger than the minimal clinical relevant difference of −6.6 points. No publication bias was detected (Egger's test P = 0.81). All the trials had high risk of bias, primarily as a result of vested interest, lack of blinding of participants, lack of outcome assessor blinding, selective outcome reporting, or selection bias. Some but not all bias risks were present in most studies. The result of the GRADE assessment was "very low quality" owing to high risks of bias and heterogeneity. The intervention effect was significantly influenced by choice of scale (test for subgroup differences, P = 0.006). Long term trials had a smaller effect (standardised mean difference −0.47, 95% confidence interval −0.72 to −0.22, one trial, 253 participants) compared to short term trials (−0.81, −0.94 to −0.68, 18 trials, 1445 participants; test for subgroup difference, P = 0.02). Trials including participants with previous use of drugs before randomisation resulted in a larger effect (−1.06, −1.33 to −0.79, two trials, 286 participants) compared to trials including participants naive to the drugs (−0.63, −0.94 to −0.31, four trials, 431 participants; test for subgroup difference, P = 0.04). However, no significant influences on the observed treatment effects were found according to dose, trial design, cohort selection bias (trials with optimal titration, exclusion of non-responders, placebo responders, or participants with methylphenidate adverse events before randomisation) and trials with initial titration or fixed doses. One trial included in the meta-analysis reported change from baselines scoresrather than endpoint data. Removing this trial did not change the estimate noticeably.

### Methylphenidate and the risk of psychosis in adolescents and young adults: a population-based cohort study [^112D5XXm]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Given these reports of treatment-emergent psychotic events with central stimulant medication, clinicians have been concerned that methylphenidate and other psychostimulants might provoke psychosis. Some clinicians even consider the use of stimulant ADHD medication to be contraindicated in patients with a history of psychosis. The clinical challenge of managing the potential risk of central stimulant treatment-emergent psychosis in patients with ADHD, and especially in those patients with history of a psychosis, has become more pressing with the increasing recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD in later adolescence and early adult life. Clinicians face a therapeutic dilemma without clear evidence to guide them when balancing the potential risk of psychotic events with the benefits of stimulants that are the first-line treatment for ADHD in adolescent and adult patients. Therapeutic uncertainty is greatest in patients with a history of psychosis who, theoretically, are assumed to be at greatest risk of stimulant treatment-emergent psychotic eventsbut who are also typically excluded from randomised clinical trials of ADHD medication.

Some observational studies, that report an increased risk of psychotic events associated with methylphenidate might be affected by confounding by indication; that is, patients who receive stimulant medication for ADHD are inherently different from those who do not and could have a greater risk of psychotic events independently of stimulant prescription. In a 2016 study that adjusted for confounding by indication, Man and colleaguesused a within-individual case series design in a population of children and adolescents in Hong Kong, and they found no increased risk of psychotic events during methylphenidate treatment.

However, a Cochrane systematic review, of ten randomised controlled trials (comprising 1103 participants) and 17 non-randomised studies (comprising 76 237 participants) was unable to confirm or refute whether methylphenidate increases the risk of psychotic symptoms in children and adolescents with ADHD.

The aim of our pharmacovigilance study was twofold: first, we aimed to examine the risk of psychotic events immediately after initiation of methylphenidate treatment in adolescents and young adults with and without a previously diagnosed psychotic disorder. Second, we aimed to examine the longer term outcomes of methylphenidate exposure 1 year after treatment initiation on the risk of psychosis.

### Use of stimulants to treat cocaine and methamphetamine abuse [^112E44YZ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

The concept of using stimulants to treat cocaine and methamphetamine dependence is largely based on the "replacement" therapy model that has shown efficacy for treating nicotine and opiate dependence. Although results have been mixed, some evidence supports using stimulant medication to reduce cocaine use. There are not enough data to date to determine the efficacy of stimulants for methamphetamine dependence. Drawbacks of stimulants as treatments include the potential for abuse of the treatment, which necessitates careful screening and monitoring of patients. Possible reasons for efficacy of stimulants include enhancement of monoamine function dysregulated by chronic cocaine or methamphetamine use. Newer medications that enhance dopamine function but lack the abuse potential of older stimulants are being studied. It is hoped that these medications will provide safe, effective treatment for cocaine and methamphetamine dependence, but more research on this topic is needed.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Dexmethylphenidate is the d-threo enantiomer of racemic methylphenidate. Limited published literature, based on milk sampling from seven mothers' reports that methylphenidate is present in human milk, which resulted in infant doses of 0.16% to 0.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 1.1 and 2.7. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. Long-term neurodevelopmental effects on infants from stimulant exposure are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as agitation, insomnia, anorexia, and reduced weight gain.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^1123B9K1]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Trial sequential analysis

A meta-analysis should include a calculation of a required information size at least as large as the sample size of an adequately powered single trial to reduce the risks of random errors, taking into consideration the heterogeneity of the meta-analysis. Trial sequential analysis is a program that calculates the required information size for a meta-analysis, providing adjusted statistical thresholds for benefits, harms, or futility before the required information size is reached. Trial sequential analysis can thereby control the risks of type I and type II errors due to sparse data and repetitive testing of accumulating data. Meta-analyses not reaching the required information size are analysed with trial sequential monitoring boundaries analogous to interim monitoring boundaries in a single trial, requiring more stringent Z values to declare benefits or harms. If a trial sequential analysis results in insignificant findings before the required information size has been reached (no Z curve crossing of the trial sequential monitoring boundaries), the conclusion should be that more trials are needed to either accept or reject the intervention effect used for calculating the required sample size. If the cumulated Z curve enters the futility area, the anticipated intervention effect can be rejected.

For the trial sequential analysis calculations of binary outcomes we included trials with zero events by substituting zero with 0.5.

For the outcomes of total number of serious adverse events and total number of non-serious adverse events, we calculated the a priori diversity adjusted required information size (that is, the number of participants required to detect or reject a specific intervention effect in the meta-analysis) on the following assumptions: the proportion of participants in the control group with adverse events, a relative risk reduction or increase of 20% (25% for serious adverse events), a type I error of 5%, a type II error of 20%, and the observed diversity of the meta-analysis.

Long-Term Suppression of Growth

Careful follow-up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated children over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development.

Published data are inadequate to determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause a similar suppression of growth, however, it is anticipated that they likely have this effect as well. Therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, and patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.

Visual Disturbance

Difficulties with accommodation and blurring of vision have been reported with stimulant treatment.

USE IN CHILDREN LESS THAN SIX YEARS OF AGE

Methylphenidate Hydrochloride should not be used in children under six years, since safety and efficacy in this age group have not been established.

### Differences in adverse event reporting rates of therapeutic failure between two once-daily extended-release methylphenidate medications in Canada: analysis of spontaneous adverse event reporting databases [^115dbP2o]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Our study evaluated adverse events of therapeutic failure (and specifically reduced duration of action) with the use of a branded product, Osmotic Release Oral System (OROS) methylphenidate, which is approved for the treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and a generic product (methylphenidate, methylphenidate ER-C), which was approved for marketing in Canada based on bioequivalence to OROS methylphenidate. This study was initiated following reports that some US-marketed generic methylphenidate ER products had substantially higher reporting rates of therapeutic failure than did the referenced brands.

Methods

Through methodology similar to that used by the US Food and Drug Administration to investigate the issue with the US-marketed generic, reporting rates were calculated from cases of therapeutic failure identified in the Canadian Vigilance Adverse Reaction Online database for a 1-year period beginning 8 months after each product launch. Corresponding population exposure was estimated from the number of tablets dispensed. An in-depth analysis of narratives of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) with the use of the generic product was conducted in duplicate by 2 physicians to assess causality and to characterize the potential safety risk and clinical pattern of therapeutic failure. Similar secondary analyses were conducted on the US-marketed products.

Findings

Reporting rates of therapeutic failure with the use of methylphenidate ER-C (generic) and OROS methylphenidate (brand name) were 411.5 and 37.5 cases per 100,000 patient-years, respectively (reporting rate ratio, 10.99; 95% CI, 5.93–22.21). In-depth analysis of narratives of 230 ICSRs of therapeutic failure with the Canadian-marketed generic determined that all ICSRs were either probably (60 [26%]) or possibly (170 [74%]) causally related to methylphenidate ER-C. Clinical symptoms suggestive of overdose were present in 31 reports of loss of efficacy (13.5%) and occurred primarily in the morning, and premature loss of efficacy (shorter duration of action) was described in 98 cases (42.6%) and occurred primarily in the afternoon. Impacts on social functioning, such as disruption in work or school performance or adverse social behaviors, were found in 51 cases (22.2%).

Implications

The ~10-fold higher reporting rate of therapeutic failure with the generic product relative to its reference product in the present Canadian study resembles findings with US-marketed generic products. While these results should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations of spontaneous adverse event reporting, which may confound comparisons across products, similar findings nonetheless led the US Food and Drug Administration to declare in 2014 that 2 methylphenidate ER generic products in the United States were neither bioequivalent nor interchangeable with OROS methylphenidate-their reference product. Our results indicate a potential safety issue with the Canadian-marketed generic and suggest a need for further investigation by Health Canada.

### Chronic fatigue in cancer survivorship: psychiatry versus oncology or psychiatry with oncology? [^116arxis]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Side effects of psychostimulants are indeed an important consideration. Within others, they can cause insomnia, jitteriness, anxiety, appetite loss, headache, or heart palpitations, among other effects. Typically, low doses are used (e.g. methylphenidate 5–10 mg in the morning, titrating up as needed) and patients are monitored closely. If no improvement in fatigue is seen after a trial period (say 4–6 weeks), the drug should be discontinued. Current practice guidelines reflect the reserved role of stimulants. Earlier oncology guidelines (e.g. National Comprehensive Cancer Network, NCCN) acknowledged that methylphenidate or modafinil may be considered in patients with persistent, severe fatigue after addressing other factors. For example, NCCN guidelines have noted that a psychostimulant can be offered, preferably for a time-limited trial, in refractory cases – particularly in advanced cancer or end-of-life settings where immediate fatigue relief is a priority. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), however, has been more cautious, not recommending routine use of stimulants due to insufficient evidence. Notably, the latest ASCO–SIO 2024 survivorship fatigue guideline explicitly states that clinicians should not prescribe psychostimulants, wakefulness agents (like modafinil), or antidepressants to manage CRF in post-treatment survivors, given the weak overall efficacy data. This represents a strong stance against routine stimulant use in this context. In practice, some oncologists and psycho-oncology specialists still employ stimulants on a case-by-case basis – especially if a patient is profoundly fatigued and other interventions have failed. In such cases, a careful informed discussion is needed. Clinicians typically rule out medical causes (e.g. recurrence, severe anaemia, etc.), then initiate a low-dose stimulant with close follow-up. If meaningful benefit is observed (e.g. improved daily functioning) and side effects are tolerable, the medication might be continued, but if not, it is discontinued. The overall takeaway is that psychostimulants can offer symptomatic relief for CRF in some patients, but expectations should be modest, and they are not universally effective. Non-pharmacologic therapies should remain the cornerstone, with drugs like methylphenidate or modafinil reserved for refractory fatigue after other measures.

### Highlights of prescribing information… [^1125uLka]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypersensitivity reactions, such as angioedema and anaphylactic reactions, have been observed in patients treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Therefore, methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to methylphenidate or other components of the product. Prolonged and painful erections, sometimes requiring surgical intervention, have been reported with methylphenidate products, including Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets, in both pediatric and adult patients. Priapism was not reported with drug initiation but developed after some time on the drug, often subsequent to an increase in dose. Priapism has also appeared during a period of drug withdrawal. Patients who develop abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections should seek immediate medical attention.

Stimulants, including Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. The most common adverse reactions associated with discontinuation from either pediatric or adult clinical trials were anxiety, irritability, insomnia, and blood pressure increased. The development program for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets included exposures in a total of 3, 906 participants in clinical trials.

Children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD were evaluated in 6 controlled clinical studies and 11 open-label clinical studies. Safety was assessed by collecting adverse events, vital signs, weights, and ECGs, and by performing physical examinations and laboratory analyses. The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency: Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Pancytopenia, Thrombocytopenia, Thrombocytopenic purpura.

New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms CNS stimulants, at the recommended dosage, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0. 1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients, compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets. The most common adverse reaction in double-blind clinical trials in pediatric patients was abdominal pain upper. The most common adverse reactions in double-blind clinical trials in adult patients were decreased appetite, headache, dry mouth, nausea, insomnia, anxiety, dizziness, weight decreased, irritability, and hyperhidrosis.
