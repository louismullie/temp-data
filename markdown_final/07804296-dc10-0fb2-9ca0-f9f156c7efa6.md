## Question

How many mL/hr do you give fluids

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine the appropriate IV fluid rate in mL/hr across different clinical scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context because fluid rates are scenario-specific. Then, I should verify the most authoritative guideline-based rates for sepsis, DKA, burns, pancreatitis, and perioperative care. Next, I will consider pediatric versus adult dosing, maintenance versus bolus strategies, and the role of dynamic assessment. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight key safety checks and exceptions, making sure I cite the highest-quality sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: there is no single "standard" mL/hr rate for IV fluids; rates must be individualized to the clinical scenario, patient size, comorbidities, and response to therapy, so I need to ensure I'm anchoring to guideline-based ranges and titration principles rather than a fixed number [^111fSKis] [^1145gRY3].

> For adult sepsis and septic shock, I should confirm the initial resuscitation target. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends at least 30 mL/kg of isotonic crystalloid within the first 3 hours, which practically translates to roughly 1,500–2,000 mL rapidly for a 60–70 kg adult, followed by reassessment and additional 500–1,000 mL boluses as needed; faster completion of the 30 mL/kg within about 2 hours has been associated with earlier shock reversal, though I need to be cautious about causality in observational data [^113ohx4k] [^112wpD9W] [^116L8yDz] [^112782bC].

> Wait, let me verify the pediatric sepsis guidance. For children with septic shock, the Surviving Sepsis pediatric guidelines suggest up to 40–60 mL/kg in 10–20 mL/kg boluses over the first hour, titrated to perfusion and stopped if signs of fluid overload emerge; in settings without ICU access, some guidance allows up to 40 mL/kg total in smaller boluses, and I should remember that FEAST raised concerns about harm from aggressive boluses in certain African contexts, so I must individualize and monitor closely [^1178Adns] [^117PnUUv] [^111aqPoP].

> For diabetic ketoacidosis, I need to check the adult rates. The ADA recommends isotonic saline at 500–1,000 mL/hour for the first 2–4 hours in patients without cardiac or renal compromise, then transition to 250–500 mL/hour for several hours, and finally adjust to a maintenance rate once volume repletion and glucose dynamics stabilize; in pregnancy, ACOG advises 1–2 L/hour initially, then 250–500 mL/hour, with dextrose-containing fluids added when glucose falls, so I should confirm glucose thresholds and comorbidity caveats before finalizing the rate [^112YtsdG] [^114FN4Tq].

> Hold on, I should verify burn resuscitation rates. The Parkland-derived approach uses 2–4 mL/kg/%TBSA over 24 hours, with half given in the first 8 hours from the time of burn, which yields very high early rates; for example, a 70 kg adult with 40% TBSA burn approximates 5,600 mL in 24 hours, or about 350 mL/hour in the first 8 hours, titrated to urine output of 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/hour in adults; prehospital and austere guidance often simplifies to 2 mL/kg/%TBSA initially, and I should remember that "fluid creep" is common, so strict urine output–guided titration is essential [^notfound] [^notfound] [^116L8Ms7] [^1157a38R].

> For acute pancreatitis, let me reconsider the balance between under- and over-resuscitation. Current ACG guidance favors moderate hydration rather than aggressive fluids; in patients without hypovolemia, an initial rate around 1.5 mL/kg/hour is reasonable, whereas in hypovolemia a 10 mL/kg bolus is appropriate, with frequent reassessment of BUN, hematocrit, and clinical perfusion to avoid fluid overload; meta-analytic data suggest aggressive hydration does not improve outcomes and may increase edema, so I should titrate carefully [^115eXLhn] [^114toRGR] [^112cXDWc].

> In the perioperative setting, I should confirm maintenance and bolus strategies. ERAS and contemporary practice commonly use about 2 mL/kg/hour of balanced crystalloid intraoperatively, with 250–500 mL boluses guided by dynamic measures such as stroke volume variation or passive leg raise; goal-directed fluid therapy aims for euvolemia while avoiding both hypovolemia and overload, and I need to ensure I'm not replacing a calculated NPO deficit with fixed rates, as evidence does not support routine NPO-deficit replacement driving higher volumes [^116U4cMN] [^111Aizf5] [^117NfpAb].

> For maintenance fluids in children, I should double-check the shift toward isotonic solutions. Modern pediatric guidance recommends isotonic fluids at roughly 4 mL/kg/hour for the first 10 kg, plus 2 mL/kg/hour for the next 10 kg, plus 1 mL/kg/hour for weight above 20 kg, with adjustments for ongoing losses and clinical status; importantly, hypotonic solutions are discouraged outside specific exceptions due to hyponatremia risk, so I need to ensure the fluid type matches current standards [^111eRAjz].

> Next, I should review the fluid challenge technique because it informs how to test responsiveness before committing to higher rates. A standard approach is 200–500 mL of crystalloid over about 10–30 minutes, assessing for a meaningful rise in stroke volume or cardiac output and watching for rising filling pressures; faster infusions under 15 minutes detect more responders than slower infusions, and I should set predefined stop criteria to avoid fluid overload [^111PnmbG] [^115DCjtC] [^117CLgCn].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population or context? In dengue, I should limit IV fluids to the minimum required to restore perfusion and maintain urine output, using isotonic solutions and avoiding over-resuscitation; in contrast-associated AKI prevention, isotonic saline at 1–1.5 mL/kg/hour before, during, and after contrast is recommended for high-risk patients; in prehospital trauma, 500 mL boluses of isotonic crystalloid are reasonable if blood is not immediately available, with reassessment and transition to blood products when possible [^112ASsss] [^114R2XPf] [^113fapjU].

> I will now examine the synthesis into a practical decision framework. First, identify the clinical scenario and whether this is initial resuscitation, maintenance, or a fluid challenge. Second, choose adult versus pediatric protocols. Third, select a guideline-concordant starting range or bolus strategy. Fourth, individualize by weight, comorbidities, and severity. Fifth, reassess frequently using clinical and, when available, dynamic measures. Sixth, de-escalate or stop fluids promptly if there is no response or if overload emerges, aligning with the SOSD phases of salvage, optimization, stabilization, and de-escalation [^111fSKis] [^1145gRY3].

> Key safety checks I should not overlook include reassessing for fluid responsiveness after each bolus, monitoring for pulmonary edema, extremity edema, and rising JVP, and adjusting for heart, kidney, or liver disease; in pediatrics, I must be particularly vigilant for hyponatremia with hypotonic fluids and for the potential harms of repeated large boluses in resource-limited settings, integrating FEAST insights into shared decision-making and close monitoring [^111aqPoP] [^1165csq7].

> In summary, I need to ensure my answer remains context-specific: for adult sepsis, think 30 mL/kg rapidly then 500–1,000 mL boluses; for DKA, 500–1,000 mL/hour initially then taper; for burns, 2–4 mL/kg/%TBSA with urine output–guided titration; for pancreatitis, moderate rates around 1.5 mL/kg/hour unless hypovolemic; for perioperative care, about 2 mL/kg/hour plus goal-directed boluses; for pediatric maintenance, isotonic fluids per weight-based formula; and everywhere, use fluid challenges and frequent reassessment to individualize and avoid overload, documenting the rationale and response at each step [^113ohx4k] [^112YtsdG] [^112BfSuh] [^115eXLhn] [^116U4cMN] [^1165csq7] [^111PnmbG].

---

The correct fluid rate depends on the clinical scenario: **30 mL/kg within 3 hours** for adult sepsis/septic shock [^113ohx4k] [^112wpD9W], **500–1,000 mL/hour for 2–4 hours** for adult DKA [^112YtsdG], and **2 mL/kg/%TBSA/hour (half in the first 8 hours)** for burns [^112BfSuh] [^112oJixU]. For maintenance, use **1–1.5 mL/kg/hour** in adults and the 4–2–1 rule in children (4 mL/kg/h for the first 10 kg, 2 mL/kg/h for the next 10 kg, and 1 mL/kg/h for > 20 kg). Always titrate to urine output (≥ 0.5 mL/kg/h in adults, 1–1.5 mL/kg/h in children), blood pressure, and clinical response, and adjust for comorbidities to avoid fluid overload [^112BfSuh] [^116L8Ms7] [^111fSKis].

---

## General principles of fluid administration

- **Assessment**: Evaluate volume status, comorbidities, and clinical context before prescribing fluids [^111fSKis].
- **Type of fluid**: Use isotonic crystalloids (e.g. normal saline, lactated Ringer's) for most resuscitations; avoid hypotonic solutions in children due to hyponatremia risk [^1165csq7].
- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor urine output, blood pressure, heart rate, and signs of fluid overload [^111fSKis].

## Adult fluid resuscitation rates

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended fluid rate** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Sepsis/septic shock | 30 mL/kg within 3 hours | - Titrate to clinical response <br/> - Avoid fluid overload [^113ohx4k] [^112wpD9W] |
| Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) | 500–1,000 mL/hour for 2–4 hours | Adjust based on volume status and comorbidities [^112YtsdG] |
| Burns (Parkland formula) | 2 mL/kg/%TBSA/hour (half in first 8 hours) | Titrate to urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/hour [^112BfSuh] [^112oJixU] |
| General maintenance | 1–1.5 mL/kg/hour | Adjust based on clinical status [^notfound] |

---

## Pediatric fluid resuscitation rates

- **Initial resuscitation**: 10–20 mL/kg boluses (up to 40–60 mL/kg in the first hour) for septic shock or severe dehydration [^113WhivW] [^1178Adns].
- **Maintenance fluids**: 4 mL/kg/hour for the first 10 kg, 2 mL/kg/hour for the next 10 kg, and 1 mL/kg/hour for weight > 20 kg.
- **Urine output target**: 1–1.5 mL/kg/hour in children [^116L8Ms7].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal/cardiac disease**: Use caution and adjust rates to avoid fluid overload [^112YtsdG].
- **Obesity**: Use ideal body weight to calculate fluid rates [^112ASsss].
- **Fluid challenge**: 200–500 mL boluses over 10–30 minutes, reassessing response each time [^111PnmbG] [^117CLgCn].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Continuously reassess **volume status**, **urine output**, and **clinical response**, and adjust the fluid rate to maintain euvolemia and avoid overload [^111fSKis]. Discontinue or reduce fluids if signs of overload develop (e.g. pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, rising JVP) [^111fSKis].

---

The correct fluid rate is **scenario-specific** and must be individualized and titrated to clinical response, with careful monitoring to avoid both under-resuscitation and fluid overload.

### Fluid bolus administration in children, who responds and how? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Hc3qX]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluid boluses are frequently utilized in children. Despite their frequency of use, there is little objective data regarding the utility of fluid boluses, who they benefit the most, and what the effects are.

Aims

This study aimed to conduct pooled analyses to identify those who may be more likely to respond to fluid boluses as well as characterize clinical changes associated with fluid boluses.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis was conducted to identify pediatric studies investigating the response to fluid boluses and clinical changes associated with fluid boluses.

Results

A total of 15 studies with 637 patients were included in the final analyses with a mean age of 650days ± 821.01 (95% CI 586 to 714) and a mean weight of 10.5 kg ± 7.19 (95% CI 9.94 to 11.1). The mean bolus volume was 12.14ml/kg ± 4.09 (95% CI 11.8 to 12.5) given over a mean of 19.55min ± 10.16 (95% CI 18.8 to 20.3). The following baseline characteristics were associated with increased likelihood of response [represented in mean difference (95% CI)]: greater age [207.2days (140.8 to 273.2)], lower cardiac index [-0.5 ml/min/m² (-0.9 to -0.3)], and lower stroke volume [-5.1 ml/m² (-7.9 to -2.3)]. The following clinical parameters significantly changed after a fluid bolus: decreased HR [-5.6 bpm (-9.8 to -1.3)], increased systolic blood pressure [7.7mmHg (1.0 to 14.4)], increased mean arterial blood pressure [5.5mmHg (3.1 to 7.8)], increased cardiac index [0.3 ml/min/m² (0.1 to 0.6)], increased stroke volume [4.3 ml/m² (3.5 to 5.2)], increased central venous pressure [2.2mmHg (1.1 to 3.3)], and increased systemic vascular resistance [2.1 woods units/m² (0.1 to 4.2)].

Conclusion

Fluid blouses increase arterial blood pressure or cardiac output by 10% in approximately 56% of pediatric patients. Fluid blouses lead to significant decrease in HR and significant increases in cardiac output, stroke volume, and systemic vascular resistance. Limited published data are available on the effects of fluid blouses on systemic oxygen delivery.

Regarding medical management for rhabdomyolysis, more specifically with respect to intravenous fluids, AAST 2022 guidelines recommend to administer either lactated Ringer's solution or saline (0.9% or 0.45%) for resuscitation in patients with rhabdomyolysis. Consider starting at a rate of 400 mL/hour, with goal-directed therapy of urine output of 1–3 mL/kg/hour, and up to 300 mL/hour.

### Hyperglycemic crises in adults with diabetes: a consensus report [^112YtsdG]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer isotonic saline or balanced crystalloid solutions at an initial rate of 500–1,000 mL/h during the first 2–4 hours in adult patients with DKA or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state without renal or cardiac compromise. Decide on the subsequent choice for fluid replacement after restoration of intravascular volume based on the state of hydration assessed by BP, HR, fluid input-output balance, and sodium concentration, correcting estimated fluid deficits within the first 24–48 hours. Use caution when rapidly replacing fluids in patients at high risk of fluid overload, including older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with heart or kidney disease or other serious comorbidities.

Trauma — burns fluid resuscitation advises to initiate fluid resuscitation using lactated Ringer's or normal saline, with a shock branch that includes considering other cause such as trauma or cyanide toxicity and administering IV fluid per the Shock Guideline; if not in shock, begin fluids based on estimated TBSA with pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg using length-based tape for weight estimate; and for persons over 40 kg apply the "Rule of 10": calculate the TBSA (round to nearest 10%), then multiply TBSA × 10 = initial fluid rate (mL/hr) for persons between 40–80 kg, and add 100 mL/hr for every 10 kg of body weight over 80 kg.

### The fluid challenge [^111PnmbG]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The initial description proposed strict rules for stopping a fluid challenge, but we feel the need to continue or to stop should be individualized with a clearly defined objective and limit for each patient, so that the best balance of benefit vs. potential harm can be determined (Fig. 1). For a fluid challenge to be considered positive, a sufficient increase in cardiac output will be necessary, with a 10% increase generally considered as a minimum using our current measurement techniques. At the same time, we should carefully monitor a cardiac filling pressure (usually the CVP) to make sure it does not increase dangerously. In all cases, if there is no increase in cardiac output and cardiac filling pressures increase, the fluid challenge should be promptly discontinued.

The fluid challenge may have to be repeated to assess ongoing fluid requirements. But how often should this be done? Too often carries the risks associated with giving too much fluid, and not often enough may prevent the patient receiving sufficient fluid. In a French multicenter trial, Roger et al. observed that the positive effects of a fluid challenge were transient in 40% of patients. Whether or not the fluid challenge should then be repeated should be carefully evaluated by the clinician. Importantly, any fluid challenge should be considered a physiological experiment and its effects carefully evaluated. Unfortunately, in too many cases, further fluid is administered independent of the response to a fluid challenge; this is not good practice.

In conclusion, one should remember that use of a fluid challenge technique will result in not more but less fluid being given in total, because fluid administration will be quickly discontinued if there is no clinical benefit. The fluid challenge technique should be adapted to the individual patient, with each component defined in advance according to the TROL mnemonic: Type of fluid (usually a crystalloid), Rate of infusion (typically 200 mL over about 10 min), Objective (usually an increase in cardiac output by at least 10%) and Limits (excessive increase in CVP).

### What is the impact of the fluid challenge technique on diagnosis of fluid responsiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111yhhdZ]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The proportion of patients who respond to a fluid challenge is dependent on the particularities of the technique used. A rapid infusion of fluid volume increases the proportion of patients with a positive response. However, the type and volume of fluid or the time of assessment does not appear to have any effect on the detection of fluid responders. This study highlights that standardisation of the fluid challenge technique is needed for contextualisation of clinical trial data and patient management.

### What is the impact of the fluid challenge technique on diagnosis of fluid responsiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1162QQi8]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

As with all retrospective observational studies, the data presented must be interpreted in the context of its limitations. There is likely to be significant heterogeneity in the patient case mix, illness severity and overall management. Different permutations of the rate of fluid administered, the type and volume of fluid, method of haemodynamic assessment, threshold for definition of responsiveness, and the time of assessment of fluid challenge does not allow any strong conclusions to be made. Furthermore, we have not accounted for the different methods of haemodynamic monitoring used. However, we highlight the heterogeneity in practice of this commonly applied technique and the need for further investigation to elucidate the clinical effect of the different aspects of a fluid challenge.

### Guidelines for burn care under austere conditions: introduction to burn disaster, airway and ventilator management, and fluid resuscitation [^112BfSuh]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Fluid resuscitation for burn shock under austere conditions — "Major burn wounds, defined as > 20% TBSA, will require significant fluid administration, particularly in the first 24 hours post injury". The introduction notes that "Before the initiation of resuscitation regimens, the LD50 burn size (burn size in which half the people died) was ~30% TBSA" and that resuscitation plans "need to consider the prolonged need for fluids, both IV and oral, for weeks to months after the initial event". For initial intravenous resuscitation, "Initial fluid requirements can be estimated by the Parkland formula: 2 to 4 ml/kg/% burn of lactated ringers solution over 24 hours, half in the first 8 hours and the remainder in the next 16 hours". Ongoing management specifies that "Ideally, fluids should be adjusted to maintain a urine output of approximately 0.5 ml/kg/hr in adults and 1 ml/kg/hr in children < 12 years", and that "Typically, fluids are increased or decreased by 10 to 20% to maintain urine output in that range".

### Fluid challenge revisited [^112mYD2U]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss the rationale, technique, and clinical application of the fluid challenge.

Data Source

Relevant literature from MEDLINE and authors' personal databases.

Study Selection

Studies on fluid challenge in the acutely ill.

Data Extraction

Based largely on clinical experience and assessment of the relevant published literature, we propose that the protocol should include four variables, namely 1) the type of fluid administered, 2) the rate of fluid administration, 3) the critical end points, and 4) the safety limits.

Conclusions

A protocol for routine fluid challenge is proposed with defined rules and based on the patient's response to the volumes infused. The technique allows for prompt correction of fluid deficits yet minimizes the risks of fluid overload.

Learning Objectives

On completion of this article, the reader should be able to: 1. Explain the signs of hypovolemia. 2. Describe how to administer a fluid challenge. 3. Use this information in a clinical setting.

### What is the impact of the fluid challenge technique on diagnosis of fluid responsiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112uBAur]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The fluid challenge is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of fluid responsiveness. The objective of this study was to describe the fluid challenge techniques reported in fluid responsiveness studies and to assess the difference in the proportion of 'responders', (PR) depending on the type of fluid, volume, duration of infusion and timing of assessment.

Methods

Searches of MEDLINE and Embase were performed for studies using the fluid challenge as a test of cardiac preload with a description of the technique, a reported definition of fluid responsiveness and PR. The primary outcome was the mean PR, depending on volume of fluid, type of fluids, rate of infusion and time of assessment.

Results

A total of 85 studies (3601 patients) were included in the analysis. The PR were 54.4% (95% CI 46.9–62.7) where < 500 mL was administered, 57.2% (95% CI 52.9–61.0) where 500 mL was administered and 60.5% (95% CI 35.9–79.2) where > 500 mL was administered (p = 0.71). The PR was not affected by type of fluid. The PR was similar among patients administered a fluid challenge for < 15 minutes (59.2%, 95% CI 54.2–64.1) and for 15–30 minutes (57.7%, 95% CI 52.4–62.4, p = 1). Where the infusion time was ≥ 30 minutes, there was a lower PR of 49.9% (95% CI 45.6–54, p = 0.04). Response was assessed at the end of fluid challenge, between 1 and 10 minutes, and > 10 minutes after the fluid challenge. The proportions of responders were 53.9%, 57.7% and 52.3%, respectively (p = 0.47).

Conclusions

The PR decreases with a long infusion time. A standard technique for fluid challenge is desirable.

### WHO guidelines on fluid resuscitation in children: missing the FEAST data [^111aqPoP]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

2013 WHO guidelines in practice

WHO had begun revising its Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children when the FEAST trial results were released. We were aware of this process and provided additional unpublished data to the guideline developers when requested. We assumed that our data would be taken into account in the revision. However, the 2013 edition continues to recommend a 20 ml/kg bolus of isotonic crystalloid as fast as possible to any child fulfilling the WHO definition of shock, with up to two more boluses (that is, a total of 60 ml/kg) if shock fails to correct. This is much more aggressive treatment than in the FEAST trial, where most children received a single bolus of 20 ml/kg over one hour.

For children with suspected malaria or anaemia with shock, the new WHO guidelines state that "fluid be administered cautiously, and/or blood transfusion should be given for severe anaemia", leaving clinicians unclear about the rate and volume of fluids to give in these two conditions. The guidelines committee did not consider the speed of resuscitation, only the choice of fluid.

We are concerned that, given results of FEAST and their consistency across subgroups, including in those meeting the strict WHO definition of shock, these recommendations might expose substantial numbers of children to harm.

How many children do these guidelines apply to in Africa? There are no reliable data on the number of child admissions to hospital with shock each year in sub-Saharan Africa. We have previously reported that about 10% of children admitted to hospital in the coast of Kenya present with shock, indicating that the number would likely run into millions. For every million hospital admissions with shock, around 20 000 (2%) would be expected to meet the WHO definition of shock. Our subgroup analysis of the FEAST results suggested bolus was associated with a relative risk of death of 240% in these children. Treatment with rapid fluid resuscitation may therefore result in hundreds or thousands of excess deaths.

### Oral rehydration solutions for the treatment of acute… [^114Et1y9]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What are the most appropriate oral rehydration solutions for the treatment of acute watery diarrhea. Evidence-Based Answer Oral rehydration solutions are distinguished by high or low osmolarity and by whether they are made with complex or simple carbohydrates. When oral rehydration solutions with high osmolarity are compared, polymer-based solutions may result in lower stool output in the first 24 hours and shorter duration of diarrhea than glucose-based solutions. Practice Pointers Oral rehydration solutions are essential in the management of acute watery diarrhea. The original oral rehydration solution formulation, introduced by the World Health Organization in 1979, consisted of glucose and other electrolytes with an osmolarity of 310 mOsm per L.

It improved signs of dehydration but did not reduce stool volume loss or diarrhea duration, and the high osmotic load potentiated fluid losses and electrolyte imbalances. Since 2004, the WHO has recommended low-osmolarity glucose-based oral rehydration solutions. One trial measured total stool output and demonstrated a decrease of 25 mL per kg with polymer-based solutions in the first 24 hours of treatment; aside from small sample size, this study also was not blinded. In studies of high-osmolarity oral rehydration solutions, patients receiving polymer-based solutions had lower stool output and a mean duration of diarrhea that was 8. 5 hours shorter than those receiving glucose-based solutions. Both results were statistically significant but limited by heterogeneity.

The need for unscheduled intravenous fluids was low in most trials comparing high-osmolarity oral rehydration solutions. However, in a subgroup analysis of patients with noncholera mixed-pathogen diarrhea, results slightly favored high-osmolarity polymer-based solution for a decrease in unscheduled administration of intravenous fluids.

### Letter to the editor: stroke volume is the key measure of fluid responsiveness [^1132xJTG]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor

The authorities in the domain of shock physiology, Vincent and colleagues, have recently offered a concise perspective on intravenous fluid administration. They discuss the concept of the fluid challenge and offer a practical clinical algorithm, but miss an opportunity to underscore that cardiac output (CO) is a complex measure when interpreting the full effect of fluid provision.

Historically, fluid responsiveness (FR) has been defined by change in cardiac output (CO = heart rate × stroke volume) as CO is a key determinant of oxygen delivery. Ignoring issues around measurement precision and defining a true gold standard, we note that relying solely on CO belies the fundamental physiology that stroke volume is the closest clinically-available approximation of the cardiac length-tension relationship. This point is highlighted by a hypothetical example.

A patient in early septic shock has a heart rate (HR) of 120 beats per minute (BPM), stroke volume (SV) of 51 mL and, therefore, a CO of 6.1 L per minute (L/min). The patient is given 30 mL/kg of balanced crystalloid; subsequently HR falls to 90 BPM and SV rises to 65 mL resulting in a CO of 5.9 L/min. Was this patient harmed by intravenous fluids? Is this patient 'fluid unresponsive' despite SV rising by over 25%?

An implicit, mathematical assumption of CO is that its augmentation is beneficial independent of the relationship between SV and HR; this may not be universally true. For example, the coronary circulation is perfused preferentially during diastole. Therefore, diminishing HR augments diastolic time and subendocardial perfusion. Accordingly, despite a calculated fall in cardiac output, the patient above may have significantly increased ventricular oxygen delivery with intravenous fluids, especially if there is co-morbid coronary artery disease and/or ventricular hypertrophy. These principles could partly explain recent data associating diminished diastolic shock index (i.e. HR divided by diastolic blood pressure) with improved outcome. In other words, low HR and high diastolic pressure is a good prognosticator in septic shock.

Thus, because CO comprises two variables that may diverge as a normal, adaptive response or following beneficial therapy, relying on it as a lumped index of 'fluid responsiveness' may mislead. Accordingly, clinicians and researchers should rely not merely on CO as it may conceal the effect of fluids on the cardiac length-tension, i.e. Frank-Starling, relationship.

Resuscitation options with ORT and rectal infusion in austere settings: Although insufficiently tested in prospective, randomized clinical trials, expert opinion is that ORT can be used successfully to resuscitate patients from burn shock, provided that the burn size does not exceed 40% of the BSA and that there are no other injuries or illnesses that would preclude safe oral intake. Up to 20% TBSA can be resuscitated with ORT, some patients with burns up to 40% TBSA can also be resuscitated successfully with ORT, and in the hospital up to 15% of the total resuscitation fluids can be given orally; if urine output is satisfactory, IV fluid can be diminished as long as ORT can be continued. An additional approach that may be of value in remote or rural settings is rectal infusion therapy (proctoclysis), with rectal infusions of either tap water or saline tolerated at rates up to 400 ml/hr.

3.4. Statistical analysis & outcomes

Primarily we sought to determine whether PM patients required different fluid delivery when compared to AM patients when a GDFT protocol recommended care. Our statistical approach therefore assessed this question from many possible perspectives to determine whether any evidence exists to support different fluid delivery requirements in AM compared to during PM surgery. We calculated and analyzed fluid administration totals with both a 1:1 crystalloid to colloid ratio as well as with a 3:1 crystalloid to colloid ratio.

First, direct group-wise testing was performed on total administered volume (crystalloid + colloid) calculated as total ml, total ml/hr. and total ml/kg/hr. between the AM and PM groups. These three different calculations allowed us to check raw total, raw total corrected for duration of case, and raw total corrected for duration of case and size of patient. Second, a linear regression model was run that included all of the baseline covariates that differed between groups as well as the plausible confounding factors for differing fluid needs (ASA class, use of epidural anesthesia, laparoscopic vs. open case). Our model used a 1:1 crystalloid to colloid ratio or a 3:1 crystalloid to colloid ratio, which allowed us to evaluate the marginal influence of group (AM or PM) in light of all of the other covariates. Finally, we combined all patients from both groups and scatterplots of NPO time to total fluid (as ml, ml/hr. and ml/kg/hr) assessed the effect of patient-reported NPO time on fluid administration.

### Fluids in the ICU: which is the right one? [^115V7Vr8]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS

Fluid administration has to be considered a pharmacologic intervention. The effects and adverse effects depend on the amount as well as the type of fluid administered. Though fluid overload has consistently been associated with increased mortality, the effects of fluid restriction vary depending on the clinical setting.

There is a sizeable body of observational, interventional and prospective clinical trial data that suggests that there is a clinically important effect of choice of crystalloid fluid on outcomes in adult ICU patients. With the exception of those with a traumatic brain injury or pronounced hypochloremia (who should receive 0.9% saline), ICU patients should receive a buffered crystalloid fluid for initial and subsequent IV fluid therapy (Fig. 4). Whether there are differences between the buffered fluid types themselves remains unknown, and the differences are likely to be so small that they will be almost impossible to detect with any degree of certainty.

Main considerations for fluid resuscitation in hypovolemic critically ill patients.

If exceptional amounts of fluid are required, additional administration of 20% albumin may be considered and should be preferred to semi-synthetic colloids, especially in sepsis and septic shock patients.

Intravenous fluid therapy is the most commonly prescribed inpatient medication in hospitals around the world. Intravenous fluids are drugs and have an indication, a dose, and expected and unintended effects. The type and amount of fluid given to patients are both important, and can either hasten or slow recovery depending on how they are administered. This narrative review provides a brief summary of the effect of intravenous fluid administration on kidney function and on renal outcome measures of relevance to both patients and clinicians. Several large clinical trials of fluid therapy are currently underway, the results of which are likely to change clinical practice.

### Azithromycin monohydrate [^112tZux1]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.3 Preparation of the Solution for Intravenous Administration

The infusate concentration and rate of infusion for azithromycin for injection should be either 1 mg/mL over 3 hr or 2 mg/mL over 1 hr. Azithromycin for injection should not be given as a bolus or as an intramuscular injection.

Reconstitution

Prepare the initial solution of azithromycin for injection by adding 4.8 mL of Sterile Water for Injection to the 500 mg vial, and shaking the vial until all of the drug is dissolved. Since azithromycin for injection is supplied under vacuum, it is recommended that a standard 5 mL (non-automated) syringe be used to ensure that the exact amount of 4.8 mL of Sterile Water is dispensed. Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 100 mg azithromycin. Reconstituted solution is stable for 24 hr when stored below 30°C (86°F).

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration. If particulate matter is evident in reconstituted fluids, the drug solution should be discarded.

Dilute this solution further prior to administration as instructed below.

Dilution

To provide azithromycin over a concentration range of 1 to 2 mg/mL, transfer 5 mL of the 100 mg/mL azithromycin solution into the appropriate amount of any of the diluents listed below:

Normal Saline (0.9% sodium chloride)

1/2 Normal Saline (0.45% sodium chloride)

5% Dextrose in Water

Lactated Ringer's Solution

5% Dextrose in 1/2 Normal Saline (0.45% sodium chloride) with 20 mEq KCl

5% Dextrose in Lactated Ringer's Solution

5% Dextrose in 1/3 Normal Saline (0.3% sodium chloride)

5% Dextrose in 1/2 Normal Saline (0.45% sodium chloride)

Normosol®-M in 5% Dextrose

Normosol®-R in 5% Dextrose

Other intravenous substances, additives, or medications should not be added to azithromycin for injection, or infused simultaneously through the same intravenous line.

Storage

When diluted according to the instructions (1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL), azithromycin for injection is stable for 24 hr at or below room temperature 30°C (86°F), or for 7 days if stored under refrigeration 5°C (41°F).

### Early goal-directed therapy: what do we do now? [^1135dmnv]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The meta-analysis of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) by Gu and colleagues in the previous issue of Critical Care adds to the ongoing controversy about the value of EGDT for resuscitating patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. The results of the ProCESS (protocolized care for early septic shock) and ARISE (Australasian resuscitation in sepsis evaluation) trials failed to demonstrate any benefit of EGDT or protocolized resuscitation when compared with 'usual care'. The questions are the following: What is 'usual' care? What is 'real world' care? Do the results of a robust and well-conducted randomized controlled trial — in which many patients may be excluded for a variety of reasons — reflect the care given to patients on a daily basis in our emergency departments and intensive care units? Of course, there are no obvious answers to these questions, and many clinicians look forward to managing these patients without protocols. For now, the data do seem to support the management of patients with septic shock without mandated central lines or protocols. Does this mean we should go back to the era of 'do whatever you want'? No consensus exists among clinicians regarding optimal hemodynamic monitoring, and to date no method has been proven to be superior. Given the amount of fluids given prior to randomization in the ProCESS and ARISE trials, 'usual care' appears to now include aggressive, early fluid resuscitation with at least 20 mL/kg of crystalloid and rapid administration of appropriate antibiotics. Certainly, this reflects the impact of the original trial by Rivers and colleagues and the broad-based implementation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines and bundles. If this continues to define 'usual care', then perhaps it is no longer necessary to mandate specific protocols for resuscitation, as it appears that standard sepsis management has evolved to be consistent with published protocols.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guideline on care of burns in the wilderness [^116L8Ms7]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Burn fluid resuscitation — prehospital titration, routes, and thresholds: Fluid resuscitation should be titrated to maintain a urine output of 0.5 to 1.0 mL·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹ in adults and 1 to 1.5 mL·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹ in children. For prehospital providers without pumps, drip rates of 20 drops/min for infants (60 mL·h⁻¹), 40 drops/min for pediatric patients (~125 mL·h⁻¹), and 80 drops/min for adults are reasonable. Oral fluid resuscitation has been used for burns up to 40% TBSA in low-resource settings. Under extreme circumstances, when fluids may not be administered via other routes, fluids may be instilled into the subcutaneous tissues or delivered by rectal infusion, known as proctoclysis, and if it is not possible to formally measure urine output and evacuation is delayed, rescuers should titrate fluids so that the victim produces copious pale-yellow urine. We recommend oral rehydration for resuscitation of burn injuries of < 20% TBSA. Grade: Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. We recommend that intravenous fluid resuscitation be started, if available, for burns of > 20% TBSA. Grade: Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. We suggest that starting with a rate of 2 mL·kg⁻¹·% TBSA is reasonable given the constraints of field care. Grade: Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. We suggest that oral rehydration may be sufficient for burns of up to 40% TBSA. Grade: Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. We suggest that fluid resuscitation may proceed by alternate routes in extreme circumstances, including nasogastric tube, subcutaneous infiltration, and proctoclysis. Grade: Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. We recommend that the patient's volume status should be monitored with titration of fluids as needed. Grade: Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^113KL2Am]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Burn shock resuscitation formula (2 ml/kg/%TBSA vs 4 ml/kg/%TBSA) — For this PICO question, 2 studies with moderate-strength evidence met criteria for inclusion and review. The first was a retrospective analysis of the military's experience in 152 cases initiating crystalloids based on 2ml/ kg/%TBSA (Modified Brooke formula) compared to starting with 4 ml/kg/%TBSA burn (Parkland formula); albumin was recommended if at 12 hours, the total fluids were projected to exceed 6 ml/kg/%TBSA by 24 hours, and limitations included insufficient data for 58 of 105 patients with burns > 20% TBSA. The second was a multicenter RCT of 39 adult burn patients directly comparing these starting rates; the study precluded the use of albumin during the first 6 hours, but both groups received albumin and/or FFP during the first 48 hours with a slight tendency to have it administered more often to the Modified Brooke group in the first 24 hours. In both groups, fluids were titrated to achieve a UOP of 0.5 mL./kg./hour, with the Baxter group adjusting every 2 hours per facility policy and the Modified Brooke group by a protocol of incremental one-third increases or decreases. Limitations included early termination before the planned N of 50, more FFP given in the 2 ml/kg/%TBSA group, and ACS criteria that included events as late as 28 days. Mortality was not specified as an outcome for this question, and neither of the 2 included studies found any difference in mortality.

### Fluid resuscitation in acute medicine: what is the current situation? [^11538Y59]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The administration of intravenous fluids for resuscitation is the most common intervention in acute medicine. There is increasing evidence that the type of fluid may directly affect patient-centred outcomes. There is a lack of evidence that colloids confer clinical benefit over crystalloids and they may be associated with harm. Hydroxyethyl starch preparations are associated with increased mortality and use of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis; albumin is associated with increased mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Crystalloids, such as saline or balanced salt solutions, are increasingly recommended as first-line resuscitation fluids for the majority of patients with hypovolaemia. There is emerging evidence that saline may be associated with adverse outcomes due to the development of hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis, although the safety of balanced salt solutions has not been established. Fluid requirements vary over the course of critical illness. The excessive use of fluids during the resuscitative period is associated with increased cumulative fluid balance and adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. The selection of fluid depends on the clinical context in which it is administered and requires careful consideration of the dose and potential for toxicity. There is an urgent need to conduct further high-quality randomized controlled trials of currently available fluid therapy in patients with critical illness.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^115eXLhn]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis intravenous hydration monitoring and dosing — monitor clinical parameters and target early reassessment with moderate strategies. Monitoring depends on heart rate, blood pressure, and urine output, and hydration leading to a decrease in the HCT (hemoconcentration) and/or decreased BUN (blood urea nitrogen) has been associated with decreased morbidity and mortality; the latest evaluation should be 6–8 hours after admission. A randomized study showed that moderate intravenous hydration for the first 24–48 hours may be equally effective as aggressive hydration and was less likely to cause volume overload. In patients with no evidence of hypovolemia, an initial resuscitation rate of no more than 1.5 mL/kg of body weight per hour should be administered, whereas in patients with hypovolemia, clinicians should administer a bolus of 10 mL/kg.

### A clinical and physiological prospective observational study on the management of pediatric shock in the post-fluid expansion as supportive therapy trial era [^111wEZmD]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Volume Administered During Initial 24 Hours

At admission, all patients received initial fluid management with IV maintenance-only fluid (4 mL/kg/hr) except those with WHO shock who received fluid bolus therapy; 11 children with severe anemia (hemoglobin < 5 g/dL) at presentation and seven children with persistent shock received blood transfusion (10 mL/kg packed cells or 20 mL/kg whole blood). Overall, median IV volume given was 14 mL/kg/d (IQR, 10–35 mL/kg/d) since many were able to take oral fluids early in admission. The median volume of fluids administered to nonsurvivors was 30 mL/kg (IQR, 28–61 mL/kg) compared with median volume received by survivors 13 mL/kg (IQR, 9–32 mL/kg) (p = 0.23). Mean red cell transfusion volume in 11 children with hemoglobin less than 5 g/dL was 9 mL/kg (IQR, 7–11 mL/kg); seven of 11 patients (64%) required greater than or equal to two transfusions. Over 24 hours, the median volume of blood transfused in nonsurvivors was 16 mL/kg (IQR, 8–21 mL/kg) compared with medium volume received by survivors 8 mL/kg (IQR, 6–12 mL/kg) (p = 0.24).

Outcome

By 48 hours, there were nine of 30 fatalities (30%), all occurring less than 40 hours post admission with the majority of seven of nine (78%) occurring by 24 hours (Fig. S2, Supplementary Digital Content, shows Kaplan-Meier survival at 48 hr and day 28). Six of the fatalities (67%), five of whom died within 6 hours, had WHO shock translating to a case fatality of 6/6 versus 3/24 in children with less than two shock criteria (χ² = 7.27; p = 0.007).

Toxins and Environmental — Hyperthermia/Heat Exposure cooling and supportive care recommendations include continually misting the exposed skin with tepid water while fanning the victim; truncal ice packs may be used, but are less effective than evaporation; and DO NOT apply wet cloths or wet clothing, as they may trap heat and prevent evaporative cooling. Cooling efforts should continue until the patient's temperature is less than 102.2°F (39°C) or, if continuous temperature monitoring is not available, until the patient demonstrates improvement in mental status. Establish IV access for patients suffering from heat stroke — give cool fluids at 20 mL/kg boluses and reduce to 10 mL/kg/hr boluses when vitals are stable, monitor for arrhythmia and cardiovascular collapse, treat seizures per the Seizures Guideline, and all patients suffering from life threatening heat illness (including heat stroke) should be transported to the hospital. Patient safety considerations state: Consider use of physical securing devices to protect vascular access sites.

Altitude illness — educational pearls for field management include descent effects, ventilation, hydration, lethality, alternate etiologies, and pediatric risk thresholds: Descent of 500–1000 feet is often enough to see improvements in patient conditions. Patients with high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) are suffering from non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and may benefit from positive pressure ventilation via either bag assisted ventilation, CPAP, or other means of positive pressure ventilation. Patients suffering from altitude illness are commonly dehydrated and require IV fluids — once resuscitation is complete and the patient requires no further fluid boluses, maintain IV fluids at 125 mL/hr. HAPE is the most lethal of all altitude illnesses. Consider alternate causes of symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) — the symptoms of AMS may be caused by alternate etiologies such as carbon monoxide poisoning, dehydration, exhaustion, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia. Children at greater risk include full term infants less than 6 weeks of age, or preterm infants less than 46 weeks post conceptual age, and premature infants beyond 46-weeks with a history of oxygen requirement, PBD or pulmonary hypertension.

### Fluid management in the critically ill [^111fSKis]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

Fluid therapy, which is provided to restore and maintain tissue perfusion, is part of routine management for almost all critically ill patients. However, because either too much or too little fluid can have a negative impact on patient outcomes, fluid administration must be titrated carefully for each patient. The "salvage, optimization, stabilization, de-escalation" (SOSD) mnemonic should be used as a general guide to fluid resuscitation, and fluid administration should be adapted according to the course of the disease. In the initial salvage phase, lifesaving fluid should be administered generously. Once hemodynamic monitoring is available, fluid administration should be optimized by determining the patient's fluid status and the need for further fluid. This determination can be difficult, however; clinical indicators of hypovolemia, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and urine output, may not detect early hypovolemia, and edema is a late sign of fluid overload. Dynamic tests of fluid responsiveness such as pulse pressure or stroke volume variation can be used in only a small percentage of critically ill patients, and thus a fluid challenge technique is most frequently used to assess ongoing fluid requirements. Once a patient has been stabilized, efforts should start to concentrate on removing excess fluid. Which fluid should be used remains a matter of some debate. Crystalloid solutions are cheaper than colloid solutions, but colloid solutions remain in the intravascular space for a longer period, making edema less likely. Thus crystalloids and colloids should be used together, especially in patients likely to require large fluid volumes. Human albumin is a natural colloid and may have beneficial effects in patients with sepsis in addition to its volume effects. Fluids should be prescribed as are other medications, taking into account individual patient factors, disease processes, and other treatments.

### What are the fluid requirements in toxic epidermal necrolysis? [^115wcgAQ]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

Acute fluid requirements in toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have neither been quantified nor reported. The purpose of this study was to examine acute fluid administration in TEN patients. A consecutive series of criteria and biopsy-confirmed cases of TEN admitted to our burn centre were selected for retrospective analysis. Charts were reviewed for demographic and resuscitation variables for the first (D0), second (D1), and third (D2) 24-hour periods after burn center admission. Twenty-one TEN cases were available for study, with a mean epidermal detachment of 53 ± 24% TBSA. Mortality was 29%, with all deaths occurring after the study period. Average crystalloid volumes decreased from D0 (2.2 ± 1.5 ml/kg/%TBSA) through D1 (1.6 ± 1.1 ml/kg/%TBSA) and D2 (1.4 ± 1.0 ml/kg/%TBSA), whereas urine output increased from D0 (1.3 ± 0.9 ml/kg/hr) through D1 (1.4 ± 0.9 ml/kg/hr) and D2 (1.8 ± 1.1 ml/kg/hr). Worst base deficit (BD) corrected significantly from D0 to D1 (P = 0.01) and from D1 to D2 (P = 0.002). There was no correlation between daily crystalloid volumes and %TBSA detachment. Nonsurvivors had significantly higher severity-of-illness score for TEN and 24-hour mean and worst BDs than survivors, but did not require significantly more crystalloid or display lower urine outputs. Initial provision of approximately 2 ml/kg/%TBSA epidermal detachment to patients with TEN resulted in more than adequate urine output and significant correction of the BD. We emphasize that these data do not represent a resuscitation formula but rather a guideline for initial fluid administration, which should then be titrated to the patient's response.

Fluid therapy — no intensive care with hypotension — In healthcare systems with no availability of intensive care, if hypotension is present, we suggest administering up to 40 mL/kg in bolus fluid (10–20 mL/kg per bolus) over the first hour with titration to clinical markers of cardiac output and discontinued if signs of fluid overload develop (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). Clinical markers of cardiac output may include heart rate, blood pressure, capillary refill time, level of consciousness, and urine output, the need for fluid administration should be guided by frequent reassessment with serial blood lactate measurement and advanced monitoring, when available, and signs of fluid overload that should limit further fluid bolus therapy may include clinical signs of pulmonary edema or new or worsening hepatomegaly.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^112TVe9w]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.9.6

We recommend all clinicians are aware of the increased risk of pulmonary oedema in women with CKD and pre-eclampsia (1D).

Rationale

It is the experience of the guideline committee that fluid management for women with CKD is often complex and needs to be tailored to the individual. Women at risk of either volume depletion or fluid overload should be highlighted in advance of delivery to ensure that clinical review of fluid state is undertaken prior to being prescribed intravenous fluids, or the institution of a fluid restriction. On-going fluid balance review should then be performed during labour and in the immediate post-partum period with the aim of euvolaemia and the avoidance of both pulmonary oedema and superimposed kidney injury. Fluid balance assessment should be undertaken by a competent clinician with an understanding of the haemodynamic changes in pregnancy and the puerperium. This may include nephrologists, anaesthetists, obstetric physicians, and maternal medicine specialists.

The guideline committee endorses the NICE guideline on hypertension in pregnancy for the management of pre-eclampsia in pregnancy. The risk of pre-eclampsia is higher in all stages of CKD compared to women without CKD. Pre-eclampsia is complicated by capillary leak, reduced plasma oncotic pressure, and either reduced or increased cardiac output. The complexity and dynamic nature of pre-eclampsia mean that there should be a plan in place for regular fluid balance review by a competent clinician with expertise in CKD and pre-eclampsia. The aim of fluid balance in pre-eclamspia is euvolaemia. Insensible losses should then be replaced (30 ml/hr) along with anticipated urinary losses (0.5–1 ml/kg/hr), whilst limiting overall fluid intake to 80–100 ml/hr. to avoid the risk of pulmonary oedema.

### Fluid volumes infused during burn resuscitation 1980–2015: a quantitative review [^1157a38R]. Burns (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

'Fluid creep' or excessive fluid delivered to burn patients during early resuscitation has been suggested by several studies from individual burn centers.

Methods

We performed a Medline search from 1980 to 2015 in order to identify studies of burn patients predominantly resuscitated with lactated Ringers with infusion adjusted per urinary output. Data was abstracted for 48 publications (3196 patients) that met entry criteria.

Results

Higher resuscitation volumes compared to Parkland estimates were reported, but the trend of increasing resuscitation volumes over the last 30 years is not supported by regression of total fluid infused versus year of study. Mean 24h fluid infused for all studies was 5.2 ± 1.1mL/kg per %TBSA. The mean 24h urinary output reported in 30 studies was 1.2 ± 0.5mL/kg per hr. Burns with inhalation injuries (5 studies) received significantly more fluid than non-inhalation injured burn patients (5.0 ± 1.3 versus 3.9 ± 0.9mL/kg per %TBSA). Fluid infused and urinary outputs were similar for adults and pediatric patients. The most striking finding of our analyses was the great ranges of the means and high standard deviations of volumes infused compared to the original Baxter publication that introduced the Parkland formula CONCLUSIONS: These analyses suggest that burn units currently administer volumes larger than Parkland formula with great patient variability. Individual patient hourly data is needed to better understand the record of burn resuscitation and Fluid Creep.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^115KUzaA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Ongoing fluid administration — assessment‑driven resuscitation for suspected sepsis specifies that fluid administration after an initial bolus should be based on serial assessments of the patient and response to therapy. No singular assessment approach is superior, and we recommend using multiple assessments at multiple time intervals; if using a quantitative resuscitation approach, we recommend dynamic measures over static measures. Up to 50% of patients with septic shock fail to increase cardiac output in response to fluid administration and, when fluid loading does increase cardiac output, the response is often transient; all patients with ongoing hypotension or elevated lactate levels after initial fluid resuscitation need repeated hemodynamic assessment. Because no specific method of hemodynamic assessment is clearly superior in altering survival, we present 2 approaches — a clinical evaluation with basic techniques widely available in emergency care settings and a quantitative evaluation using more advanced assessment methods — and both are reasonable for monitoring and serial assessment; using either method, sepsis assessment should iteratively use multiple parameters to guide therapy. Patients who improve with the initial bolus of fluid are candidates for subsequent fluid boluses using aliquots such as 500 to 1,000 mL, followed by repeat serial clinical examinations to evaluate response and volume overload.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^114R2XPf]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD CKD CPG — prophylactic IV isotonic crystalloid around contrast exposure — reports that the Work Group suggests that IV isotonic crystalloid be administered to reduce the risk of CA-AKI in high-risk patients unless IV fluid administration is contraindicated or would delay emergency imaging or procedures; the strength of evidence supporting the use of isotonic crystalloid to mitigate the risk for development of CA-AKI in high-risk patients is strong based on studies demonstrating greater risk reduction associated with higher volumes of administered isotonic fluids; for more urgent studies, patients can be given at least 3 mL/kg of isotonic saline one hour pre-procedure continued at a rate of 1–1.5 mL/kg/hour during the procedure, and at least an additional 6 mL/kg of isotonic saline over 2–6 hours at a rate of 1–3 mL/kg/hour post-procedure; for routine studies in hospitalized patients, the Work Group suggests the administration of isotonic saline at 1 mL/kg/hour for at least 6–12 hours pre-procedure, intra-procedure, and for at least 6–12 hours post-procedure, and these suggestions assume that an assessment of volume status has been done and that patients are reasonably able to tolerate this amount of fluid.

Whether summarized by total administered volume or net fluid volume, and whether the sum was expressed as ml, ml/hr. or ml/kg/hr. the AM group received more fluid on average than the PM group in all cases. In half of the approaches to calculating fluid totals the higher AM case total was statistically significant; in the other half the difference showed was not. However, no approach to calculating fluid delivery revealed a recommendation by the GDFT algorithm to administer more total fluid volume in PM cases than any AM cases.

The general linear models, seen in Tables 4 and 5, with start time groups (AM vs PM) including all unmatched baseline variables, in the first columns, and other plausible drivers of fluid administration, whether fluid was totaled as 1:1 or 3:1 crystalloid to colloid, showed significant independent variables to be ASA classification, placement of an epidural catheter, urine output, estimated blood loss, patient weight, patient age, and surgical duration. AM vs. PM case start time did not significantly differ in either group at p = 0.64 and p = 0.19, respectively. When raw reported NPO is used as the duration of NPO for each patient group instead of AM vs. PM groupings in the models, NPO time is also non-significant as an independent variable at p = 0.38 and p = 0.97 in the 1:1 and 3:1 fluid total models, respectively.

### Use of the fluid challenge in critically ill adult patients: a systematic review [^117CLgCn]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

The fluid challenge (FC) aims at identifying patients in whom fluid administration improves hemodynamics. Although the FC has been extensively studied, the implementation and definition of improvement are not standardized. This systematic review of studies published between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 2014 characterizes these key components of the FC for critically ill adult patients, as described in the medical literature in the last 20 years. A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane. For each study, data were collected on study design, study size, study setting, patient population, and how the FC was administered. Eligibility criteria for FC were (1) the infusion of a definite quantity of fluid, (2) of a specific type, (3) in a fixed time period (expressed as either span or infusion rate), (4) with a defined hemodynamic variable as the target, and (5) for a predetermined threshold. One hundred fifty-seven full-text manuscripts were extracted from 870 potentially relevant studies. The inclusion criteria were met by 71 studies including 3617 patients. Sixty-six studies were from a single center and 45 were prospective observational in format. The most common amount infused was 500 cc, used by 55 (77.5%) studies. The most commonly infused fluids were colloids (62.0%). In 43 (60.5%) studies, the FC was administered between 20 and 30 minutes. A positive response to fluid administration was defined as an increase ≥ 15% of cardiac index or cardiac output in 44 (62.6%) studies. Static or dynamic physiologic indices were utilized in a minority of studies (16.9%) and safety limits for interrupting the FC are adopted in 4 (5.6%) studies only. This systematic review indicates that the FC most commonly consists in infusing 500 mL of crystalloids or colloids in 20–30 minutes, and considered an increase in cardiac index ≥ 15% as a positive response. However, definite standards for FC administration and evaluation remain undefined.

### Evaluation of a novel closed-loop fluid-administration system based on dynamic predictors of fluid responsiveness: an in silico simulation study [^1154odgq]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Phase 1: Basic evaluation of the controller in hemorrhage scenarios

The first phase evaluated the basic efficacy of the controller and its ability to manage fluids during hemorrhage scenarios. The simulator was run on one PC with vital signs (HR, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, CO, and PPV) being recorded over the network by a separate PC running the LIR algorithm. Interventions (in the form of fluid boluses) were communicated back to the simulator over the network. Three simulation scenarios were run during this phase: (a) mild hemorrhage of 500 mL over a 1.5-hour period; (b) moderate hemorrhage of 1,500 mL over a 1.5-hour period, and (c) massive hemorrhage of 2,000 mL over a 20-minute period. Patient height, weight, baseline HR, and baseline SBP/DBP were randomized within preset ranges (Table 2) In each scenario, bleeding began 30 minutes after the start of the simulation, and the scenario ran for 2.5 hours before finishing. For each scenario, two management groups were tested; 20 trials were performed with no hemodynamic management (to demonstrate the effects of the simulated hemorrhage scenarios on hemodynamic parameters), and 20 additional trials received crystalloid infusions managed by the LIR algorithm. Both groups received a steady infusion rate of 200 ml/hr of crystalloid.

### What is the impact of the fluid challenge technique on diagnosis of fluid responsiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Nxweq]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Volume of fluid challenge

The volumes of fluid administered for the fluid challenge varied from < 500 mL (n = 8 [12.7%]) to 500 mL (n = 50 [79.4%]) and > 500 mL (n = 5 [7.9%]). Twenty-four studies were excluded from this analysis because the volume was described as milligrams per kilogram and the participants' body weight was not reported. The estimated mean PR values were 54.4% (95% CI 46.9–62.7) among patients receiving < 500 ml, 57.2% (95% CI 52.9–61.0) among patients receiving 500 mL and 60.5% (95% CI 35.9–79.2) among patients receiving > 500 ml. There was no difference in the PR values between groups of patients receiving different volumes of fluid challenges [F (2,57) = 0.35, p = 0.71] (Additional file 1: Figure S3). The PR observed in studies where the fluid was prescribed as a fixed volume (n = 63 [72.4%]) and where fluid volume was adjusted for body weight (n = 24 [27.6%]) was similar [F (1,83) = 0.02, p = 0.88].

Type of fluid

Twenty-six (35%) studies used crystalloids, and 50 (65%) used colloids. Nine studies were excluded from the analysis because they used both types of fluids. Among patients receiving crystalloids, 53.5% (95% CI 45.4–58.5) were responders, as compared with 59.0% (95% CI 55.5–62.9) in the group receiving colloids (Additional file 1: Figure S4). The type of fluid used did not affect the proportion of patients responding to a fluid challenge [F (1,76) = 2.19, p = 0.14].

### Intravenous fluids: issues warranting concern [^111exUwJ]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The scientific evidence guiding fluid choice and dosing is limited. Indeed, the current guidelines are based on physiological experiments performed in the laboratory rather than comparative clinical trials. Although this lack of reliable clinical data was first recognised by researchers in Europe in the early 2000s, little progress has been made since then. In 2018, Boer et al. emphasised this shortcoming in their review article in the British Journal of Anaesthesia. The current interest and wide international reach of the controversy related to intravenous fluid choice is evident from discussion in three articles from Europe and the United States – published in 2020, and 2021.

The rationale for new guidelines governing the use of an intravenous fluid should be based on its ability to maintain or restore the body's internal environment, the so-called 'milieu interieur'. Normally this condition is maintained by intrinsic physiological mechanisms and is exemplified by a remarkable constancy for osmotic activity and buffer base concentration in blood plasma within and between individuals. A review of values – demonstrates that osmolality varies by only 1.5%, (288 mosmol kg⁻¹ H₂O⁻¹, weighted mean value n = 263) and buffer bases (48 mmol l⁻¹), expressed as base excess, vary by only 2.2%, (BE ± 0 mmol l⁻¹, weighted mean value n = 90).

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^111zz2s4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

General medical hyperglycemia — prehospital management directs providers to provide volume expansion with normal saline bolus; adult dosing is normal saline 20 mL/kg at rate of 1000 mL/hr, and pediatric dosing is normal saline 10 mL/kg bolus IV, reassess, and repeat up to 40 mL/kg total; if symptoms of hypovolemic shock, follow Shock Guideline. If findings of hyperkalemia are present, administer IV fluids and consider administration of calcium chloride 1 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes (do not exceed 1 mL per minute) OR calcium gluconate 2 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes with constant cardiac monitoring. If findings of hyperkalemia, consider administration of sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg (max dose of 50 mEq) IV bolus over 5 minutes and consider albuterol 5 mg via nebulizer (can be repeated if no response is seen). Reassess patient status, including vital signs, mental status, and signs of dehydration, and if mental status changes, reassess blood glucose level and provide appropriate treatment if hypoglycemia has developed. Disposition guidance is to transport to closest appropriate receiving facility. Patient safety notes state that overly aggressive administration of fluid in hyperglycemic patients may cause cerebral edema or dangerous hyponatremia, and that cerebral edema is a leading cause of death in children with DKA but is very rare in adults; closely monitor for signs of altered mental status and increased intracranial pressure, immediately discontinue IV fluids and elevate head of bed if signs of increased ICP develop; asymptomatic hyperglycemia poses no risk to the patient while inappropriately aggressive interventions to manage blood sugar may harm patients.

### Rational or rationalized choices in fluid resuscitation? [^115muyvY]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

The war between colloids and crystalloids wages on. In a large multinational survey of fluid prescribing practices in critically ill patients, we have a new and intriguing snapshot of global fluid resuscitation practices. Colloids are more often used for impaired perfusion or low cardiac output, and the choice of colloid or crystalloid varies enormously between countries. Why are some ICUs prescribing colloids more often than crystalloids when there is little convincing evidence that colloids are superior for fluid resuscitation? Are colloids advantageous in certain diseases, or in specific regional patient populations that have not yet been elucidated? Perhaps we should look inwards: the answer may not be more randomized clinical trials, but better adherence to current guidelines and treatment recommendations.

### Colloid administration normalizes resuscitation ratio and ameliorates "fluid creep" [^111uzd2s]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

Although colloid was a component of the original Parkland formula, it has been omitted from standard Parkland resuscitation for over 30 years. However, some burn centers use colloid as "rescue" therapy for patients who exhibit progressively increasing crystalloid requirements, a phenomenon termed "fluid creep". We reviewed our experience with this procedure. With Institutional Review Board approval, we reviewed all adult patients with ≥ 20%TBSA burns admitted from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2007, who completed formal resuscitation. Patients were resuscitated using the Parkland formula, adjusted to maintain urine output of 30 to 50 ml/hr. Patients who required greater amounts of fluid than expected were given a combination of 5% albumin and lactated Ringer's until fluid requirements normalized. Results were expressed as an hourly ratio (I/O ratio) of fluid infusion (ml/kg/%TBSA/hr) to urine output (ml/kg/hr). Predicted values for this ratio vary for individual patients but are usually less than 0.5 to 1.0. Fifty-two patients were reviewed, of whom 26 completed resuscitation using crystalloid alone, and the remaining 26 required albumin supplementation (AR). The groups were comparable in age, gender, weight, mortality, and time between injury and admission. AR patients had larger total and full-thickness burns and more inhalation injuries. Patients managed with crystalloid alone maintained mean resuscitation ratios from 0.13 to 0.40, whereas AR patients demonstrated progressively increasing ratios to a maximum mean of 1.97, until albumin was started. Administration of albumin produced a dramatic and precipitous return of ratios to within predicted ranges throughout the remainder of resuscitation. No patient developed abdominal compartment syndrome. Measuring hourly I/O ratios is an effective means of expressing and tracking fluid requirements. The addition of colloid to Parkland resuscitation rapidly reduces hourly fluid requirements, restores normal resuscitation ratios, and ameliorates fluid creep. This practice can be applied selectively as needed using predetermined algorithms.

### Haemodynamic optimisation improves tissue microvascular flow and oxygenation after major surgery: a randomised controlled trial [^111Aizf5]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

SV group

Intravenous lactated Ringer's solution was administered at 1 ml/kg/hr. Patients received additional 250 mL fluid challenges with intravenous colloid solution to achieve an optimal value of stroke volume. Colloid solution was administered in one or more rapid boluses to identify whether the patient was fluid responsive. A stroke volume response to fluid was defined as a sustained rise in stroke volume of at least 10% for 20 minutes or more. When a patient was identified as stroke volume responsive to fluid, further 250 mL boluses of fluid were administered until a plateau value was achieved. If stroke volume decreased, fluid challenges were repeated to establish whether the patient was fluid responsive.

SV & DPX group

Intravenous lactated Ringer's solution was administered at 1 ml/kg/hr. Patients received additional fluid challenges with colloid solution to achieve an optimal value of stroke volume in an identical fashion to patients in the SV group. In addition, a continuous intravenous infusion of dopexamine was administered at 0.5 μg/kg/min (Cephalon, Welwyn Garden City, UK). This infusion rate was not adjusted to achieve a specific value for cardiac output or DO₂ index (DO₂I) but was decreased or discontinued in patients with evidence of myocardial ischaemia or tachycardia (> 100 bpm or increase > 20% from baseline value, whichever was greater).

Only the member of the research team who delivered the intervention was aware of the study group allocation. Cardiac output data were made available to clinical staff only on specific request. The reasons for this and any subsequent changes in treatment were documented by research staff. Dummy infusions were used in patients not allocated to receive dopexamine. All other management decisions were taken by clinical staff.

### Lack of impact of nil-per-os (NPO) time on goal-directed fluid delivery in first case versus afternoon case starts: a retrospective cohort study [^117NfpAb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Goal Directed Fluid Therapy (GDFT) represents an objective fluid replacement algorithm. The effect of provider variability remains a confounder. Overhydration worsens perioperative morbidity and mortality; therefore, the impact of the calculated NPO deficit prior to the operating room may reach harm.

Methods

A retrospective single-institution study analyzed patients at UC Irvine Medical Center main operating rooms from September 1, 2013 through September 1, 2015 receiving GDFT. The primary study question asked if GDFT suggested different fluid delivery after different NPO periods, while reducing inter-provider variability. We created two patient groups distinguished by 0715 surgical start time or start time after 1200. We analyzed fluid administration totals with either a 1:1 crystalloid to colloid ratio or a 3:1 ratio. We performed direct group-wise testing on total administered volume expressed as total ml, total ml/hr. and total ml/kg/hr. between the first case start (AM) and afternoon case (PM) groups. A linear regression model included all baseline covariates that differed between groups as well as plausible confounding factors for differing fluid needs. Finally, we combined all patients from both groups, and created NPO time to total administered fluid scatterplots to assess the effect of patient-reported NPO time on fluid administration.

Results

Whether reported by total administered volume or net fluid volume, and whether we expressed the sum as ml, ml/hr. or ml/kg/hr. the AM group received more fluid on average than the PM group in all cases. In the general linear models, for all significant independent variables evaluated, AM vs PM case start did not reach significance in both cases at p = 0.64 and p = 0.19, respectively. In scatterplots of NPO time to fluid volumes, absolute adjusted and unadjusted R2 values are < 0.01 for each plot, indicating virtually non-existent correlations between uncorrected NPO time and fluid volumes measured.

Conclusions

This study showed NPO periods do not influence a patient's volume status just prior to presentation to the operating room for surgical intervention. We hope this data will influence the practice of providers routinely replacing calculated NPO period volume deficit; particularly with those presenting with later surgical case start times.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113SSmep]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding inpatient care for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to management of hyperglycemic crises, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to determine hydration status and administer IV fluids according to the severity of hypovolemia:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mild hypovolemia|- 0.9% saline or another crystalloid at a clinically appropriate rate aiming to replace 50% of the estimated fluid deficit in the first 8–12 hours < br > - Add 5% or 10% dextrose to the 0.9% saline/crystalloid when glucose reaches < 250 mg/dL < br > - Start 5% or 10% dextrose alongside 0.9% saline/crystalloid at the start of the insulin treatment in euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (glucose < 200 mg/dL and positive β-hydroxybutyrate)|
|Severe hypovolemia|- 0.9% saline or another crystalloid (1.0 L/hr)|
|Cardiac compromise|- Hemodynamic monitoring/pressors.|

### Mortality risk over time after early fluid resuscitation in African children [^111pWA3a]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

There were 3141 children randomised between albumin bolus, saline bolus, and control in FEAST (2097 and 1041 to the combined bolus and control groups, respectively). Median age was 24 months; 1795 (57%) had malaria (Table 1). By 28 days, there were 345 deaths (11%), and 87 (3%) children were lost to follow-up: 254/2097 deaths (12%) and 65/2097 lost (3%) in the bolus group and 91/1044 deaths (9%) and 22/1044 lost (2%) in the control group. Adherence to fluid administration was high with 2086/2097 (99%) children randomised to the bolus groups receiving a bolus. Median (IQR) bolus fluid in the bolus groups received by 4 h was 20 (20, 40) ml/kg and was the same at 8 h; total fluids received in bolus groups at 4 h and 8 h were 38 (28, 43) ml/kg and 40 (30, 50) ml/kg, respectively. Total fluids received in the control group by 4 h and 8 h were median (IQR) 10 (6, 15) ml/kg and 10 (10, 26) ml/kg, respectively. In the control group, 7 (< 1%) children received a 20-ml/kg saline bolus within 4 h (Table 1) with all children receiving maintenance fluids at 4 ml/kg/hr.

### Perioperative fluid management: current consensus and controversies [^113SKVF8]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

The scientific knowledge base that supports clinical decisions about perioperative fluid management continues to evolve. However, despite these advancements in the understanding of the physiology of fluid replacement, the definition of "optimal" perioperative fluid management remains a matter of clinical judgment. With an appreciation of the many factors, both sensible and insensible, that contribute to changes in blood and extracellular fluid volume during surgery, clinicians have tried to create reproducible and generally applicable formulas for replacement of fluid during surgery. These formulas have been challenged recently by the introduction of new tools for monitoring cardiopulmonary function, by the implementation of monitor-guided protocols for fluid management, and, more recently, by clinical data suggesting that fluid restriction may improve surgical outcomes in some clinical settings. The relative ease of pre-identified fluid replacement protocols is being slowly replaced by data-guided interventions that take into account a variety of factors. Clinicians are therefore required to tailor their fluid replacement strategies based on preoperative patient characteristics, the type of surgery and even the type of anesthetic that is utilized. Some of the benefits of this new approach range from relatively "minor" outcomes such as diminished nausea after surgery to preventing postoperative complications such as wound breakdown and cardiopulmonary failure.

### Intravenous fluid therapy in critically ill adults [^116DR42o]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2018). Medium credibility.

Intravenous fluid therapy is one of the most common interventions in acutely ill patients. Each day, over 20% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) receive intravenous fluid resuscitation, and more than 30% receive fluid resuscitation during their first day in the ICU. Virtually all hospitalized patients receive intravenous fluid to maintain hydration and as diluents for drug administration. Until recently, the amount and type of fluids administered were based on a theory described over 100 years ago, much of which is inconsistent with current physiological data and emerging knowledge. Despite their widespread use, various fluids for intravenous administration have entered clinical practice without a robust evaluation of their safety and efficacy. High-quality, investigator-initiated studies have revealed that some of these fluids have unacceptable toxicity; as a result, several have been withdrawn from the market (while others, controversially, are still in use). The belief that dehydration and hypovolaemia can cause or worsen kidney and other vital organ injury has resulted in liberal approaches to fluid therapy and the view that fluid overload and tissue oedema are 'normal' during critical illness; this is quite possibly harming patients. Increasing evidence indicates that restrictive fluid strategies might improve outcomes.

We recommend delivering a Kt/V of 3.9 per week when using intermittent or extended RRT in AKI (1A). We recommend delivering an effluent volume of 20–25 ml/kg/h for CRRT in AKI (1A), and this will usually require a higher prescription of effluent volume (Not Graded).

### Pediatric advanced life support. pediatric shock care [^113WhivW]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric septic shock care — fluid therapy specifies that up to 40 to 60 milliliters per kilogram (mL/kg) in bolus fluid (in 10 to 20 mL/kg aliquots) should be administered over the first hour for the initial resuscitation of children and infants with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, titrated to clinical markers of cardiac output and discontinued if signs of fluid overload develop. In the absence of intensive care availability, a decreased fluid bolus of up to 40 mL/kg (in 10 to 20 mL/kg aliquots) over the first hour should be considered, and in the absence of both hypotension and intensive care availability, maintenance fluids should be administered instead of bolus fluids. For the initial resuscitation of children and infants with septic shock or another sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, balanced/buffered crystalloids, rather than 0.9% saline, should be used; albumin should not be used, and starches should not be used in the acute resuscitation of children and infants with septic shock or other sepsis associated organ dysfunction. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign review included three randomized controlled trials of different volume resuscitation strategies for 316 children in advanced care settings and found no difference in mortality between the restrictive and liberal fluid resuscitation groups; the suggestion of "up to 40 milliliters per kilogram (mL/kg)" was included for low-resource settings based on FEAST, and the World Health Organization recommends isotonic crystalloid over 30 to 60 minutes, followed by an additional 10 mL/kg over 30 minutes.

### Clinical practice guideline: maintenance intravenous fluids in children [^111eRAjz]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Phases of fluid therapy — definitions and dosing principles for pediatric IVFs: Four distinct physiology-driven time periods exist for children requiring IVFs, comprising a resuscitative phase that is the acute presentation window when IVFs are needed to restore adequate tissue perfusion and prevent or mitigate end-organ injury, a titration phase when IVFs are transitioned from boluses to maintenance and when a critical determination of intravascular repletion and the trajectory of fluid gains versus losses is made, a maintenance phase that accounts for fluids administered during the previous 2 stabilization phases and supplies fluids to achieve a precise homeostatic balance between needs and losses, and a convalescent phase when exogenous fluid administration is stopped and the patient returns to intrinsic fluid regulation; the dose of fluid during these 4 phases needs to be adjusted based on the unique physiologic needs of each patient, and a specific protocol dose is not able to be applied to all patients.

### Effect of initial infusion rates of fluid resuscitation on outcomes in patients with septic shock: a historical cohort study [^1139DgbN]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Septic shock refers to sepsis with cardiovascular dysfunction. It is prevalent and is associated with a high rate of mortality. It is characterized by systemic vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. These changes result in impaired microcirculatory blood flow and reduced tissue perfusion. The fluid resuscitation for septic shock can restore perfusion before the onset of irreversible tissue damage and prevent cardiovascular collapse and death, and, hence, lower mortality. Therefore, appropriate fluid resuscitation within the first 3 h of shock state is strongly recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines as the cornerstone of septic shock treatment.

The challenge remains to identify the optimal fluid resuscitation strategy. While the standard of practice is the use of boluses of intravascular (IV) fluid for resuscitation, a few trials have shown increased mortality with fluid resuscitation. Also, three recent multi-center randomized controlled trials and a follow-up meta-analysis showed that early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) bundles in comparison with usual care were not associated with improved outcomes in septic shock. Additionally, fluid boluses could lead to a positive fluid balance and excess fluid in the interstitial space, resulting in tissue edema, decreased oxygen delivery, and increased mortality.

These controversies surrounding the optimal strategies of initial bolus-fluid administration during septic shock resuscitation make searching for the optimal dose, type, and rate of fluid resuscitation in septic shock a research priority. The current guidelines recommend at least 30 ml/kg of intravenous crystalloid fluid to be given within the first 3 h of resuscitation, but the influence may be different based on the time to attainment of this target in fluid resuscitation. So the goal of this study is to examine the relationship between initial fluid resuscitation rate and septic shock resolution in septic shock patients.

### Recommendations for fluid management of adults with sepsis in sub-saharan Africa: a systematic review of guidelines [^111SLCJq]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Fluid type, volume and rate

Preference for crystalloids for initial resuscitation was prevalent and only one early guideline promoted colloid as equally or more effective. In one of the guidelines tailored to management of sepsis in resource-limited settings, no specific recommendations were made regarding the relative efficacy of crystalloids or colloids; however, the authors acknowledged that "considering high costs, the risk of allergies and potential renal and coagulopathic side effects of colloids, crystalloid solutions appear more suitable". Three guidelines suggest consideration of human albumin solution as a second-line fluid choice in those patients with refractory shock or requiring large volumes of crystalloid solutions. Five guidelines specifically recommend administering fluids using a fluid challenge technique during initial resuscitation, using boluses of between 250 and 1000 ml.

Specific recommendations on total initial volume of fluid for resuscitation included 30 ml/kg, "at least 20ml/kg" and a note to aggressively treat with estimated 24-h requirement of up to 4 l. Hollenberg et al. suggest 6–10 l in the first day would be typical, titrated by fluid bolus. WHO guidelines were more liberal: 1 l as a bolus and up to 60/ml/kg in the first 2 h. More conservative were NICE who recommended 2× 500 mL boluses rapidly, followed by senior review if no clinical improvement. Two guidelines made no relevant volume recommendations, although titration to fluid challenges was promoted in one.

Assessing response/targets of resuscitation

Two guidelines made no specific recommendations on targets or response assessment. Lactate was promoted for assessment of adequate response in three documents, either alone or in combination with clinical signs. Specific thresholds included a 20% reduction in serum lactate over the first hour and either absolute values of ≤ 1.5 mmol/L or a decrease in non-specified time period.

Sequential evaluation of dynamic variables was promoted, including passive leg raise and cardiac ultrasound in ventilated patients. Clinical measures of adequate tissue perfusion (capillary refill, skin temperature and degree of mottling, pulse, blood pressure and conscious level) were advocated in two guidelines specifically tailored to LIC. Earlier guidelines implied additional invasive monitoring (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, titration to CVP and cardiac output) following a treat-reassess cycle with quarter-hourly boluses of 250–500 ml. SvO₂ monitoring was advocated in two guidelines. The most recent guidelines noted the lack of evidence of improved outcomes related to CVP and SvO₂ monitoring.

### What is the impact of the fluid challenge technique on diagnosis of fluid responsiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115DCjtC]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Duration of infusion

The time of infusion was < 15 minutes in 24 studies (27.3%), between 15 and 29 minutes in 26 studies (29.5%), and ≥ 30 minutes in 29 studies (33%). Nine studies (10.2%) did not report duration of infusion. Where the fluid challenge was administered for < 15 minutes, between 15 and 29 minutes, and > 30 minutes, the proportions of patients deemed to be fluid responders were 59.2% (95% CI 54.2–64.1), 57.7% (95% CI 52.4–62.4), and 49.9% (95% CI 45.6–54) respectively. The duration of the fluid infusion affects the proportion of fluid responders [F (2,73) = 3.63, p = 0.03] (Fig. 2). The PR to a fluid challenge given in ≥ 30 minutes was lower than the PR when the fluid challenge was given in < 15 minutes (p = 0.045). The proportion of patients responding to a fluid challenge that was administered in < 15 minutes and between 15 and 30 minutes was similar (p = 1.0).

Fig. 2
Comparison of the proportion of responders (%) by duration of the infusion used for the fluid challenge. Planned contrast analysis revealed a significant difference between the third group (≥ 30 minutes) and the other two groups

Timing of assessment

The assessment of response to a fluid challenge was at the point of administration (n = 50 [58.1%]), between 1 and 10 minutes (n = 31 [36.8%]), or > 10 minutes (n = 5 [5.8%]) after completion of the fluid challenge. Where fluid responsiveness was assessed at the point of administration, between 1 and 10 minutes, and > 10 minutes after completion of the fluid challenge, 53.9% (95% CI 49.8–57.7), 57.7% (95% CI 52.9–62.7), and 52.3% (95% CI 32–90.5) of patients had a positive response, respectively. The time of assessment of fluid response did not affect the PR [F (2,80) = 0.76, p = 0.47] (Fig. 3).

Key messages

- Close to 40% of patients in intensive care units receive resuscitation fluids each day.

- In this large international survey colloid resuscitation fluids were used more often than crystalloids.

- The fluid used varies substantially between ICUs and local practice rather than patient characteristics appears to be the main factor in fluid choice.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^111r3pTv]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Fluid balance after initial resuscitation in sepsis and septic shock — recommendation and context: 45. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of restrictive versus liberal fluid strategies in the first 24 hours of resuscitation in patients with sepsis and septic shock who still have signs of hypoperfusion and volume depletion after initial resuscitation. Remark: Fluid resuscitation should be given only if patients present with signs of hypoperfusion. The four largest clinical trials in sepsis resuscitation used moderate to large amounts of fluids in the first 72 hours, with Rivers administering over 13 L and ProCESS, ARISE and ProMISe administering approximately 7 to 8 L in usual care groups; observational and African data have shown an association of higher-volume fluid resuscitation with increased mortality, though generalizability is limited by setting and patient factors.

### Effect of initial infusion rates of fluid resuscitation on outcomes in patients with septic shock: a historical cohort study [^116L8yDz]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluid resuscitation has become the cornerstone of early septic shock management, but the optimal fluid rate is still not well studied. The goal of this investigation is to examine the relationship between fluid resuscitation rate and septic shock resolution.

Method

We retrospectively studied adult (≥ 18 years) patients with septic shock, defined based on sepsis III definition, from January 1, 2006, through May 31, 2018, in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) of Mayo Clinic Rochester. The fluid resuscitation time was defined as the time required to infuse the initial fluid bolus of 30 ml/kg, based on the recommendations of the 2016 surviving sepsis campaign. The cohort was divided into four groups based on the average fluid rate (group 1 ≥ 0.5, group 2 0.25–0.49, group 3 0.17–0.24, and group 4 < 0.17 ml/kg/min). The primary outcome was the time to shock reversal. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to account for potential confounders.

Result

A total of 1052 patients met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. The time-to-shock reversal was significantly different among the groups (P < .001). Patients in group 1 who received fluid resuscitation at a faster rate had a shorter time to shock reversal (HR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.66–0.91; P = 0.01) when compared with group 4 with a median (IQR) time-to-shock reversal of 1.7 (1.5, 2.0) vs. 2.8 (2.6, 3.3) days, respectively. Using 0.25 ml/kg/min as cutoff, the higher fluid infusion rate was associated with a shorter time to shock reversal (HR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.06–1.41; P = 0.004) and with decreased odds of 28-day mortality (HR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.60–0.85; P < .001).

Conclusion

In septic shock patients, initial fluid resuscitation rate of 0.25–0.50 ml/kg/min (i.e. completion of the initial 30 ml/kg IV fluid resuscitation within the first 2 h), may be associated with early shock reversal and lower 28-day mortality compared with slower rates of infusion.

### Intravenous maintenance fluid therapy in acutely and critically ill children: state of the evidence [^1165csq7]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2024). High credibility.

Intravenous maintenance fluid therapy (IV-MFT) is one of the most prescribed, yet one of the least studied, interventions in paediatric acute and critical care settings. IV-MFT is not typically treated in the same way as drugs with specific indications, contraindications, compositions, and associated adverse effects. In the last decade, societies in both paediatric and adult medicine have issued evidence-based practice guidelines for the use of intravenous fluids in clinical practice. The main objective of this Viewpoint is to summarise and compare the rationales on which these international expert guidelines were based and how these recommendations affect IV-MFT practices in paediatric acute and critical care. Although these guidelines recommend the use of isotonic fluids as a standard in IV-MFT, some discrepancies and uncertainties remain regarding the systematic use of balanced fluids, glucose and electrolyte requirements, and appropriate fluid volume. IV-MFT should be considered in the same way as any other prescription drug and none of the components of IV-MFT prescription should be overlooked (ie, choice of drug, dosing rate, duration of treatment, and de-escalation). Furthermore, most evidence that was used to inform the guidelines comes from high-income countries. Although some principles of IV-MFT are universal, the direct relevance to and feasibility of implementing the guidelines in low-income and middle-income countries is uncertain.

Finally, the vast majority of included studies administered cumulative volumes of IV fluids as low as only 1 to 2 l to patients. Therefore, high-risk patients and more severely ill or septic patients that are more likely to receive moderate to high cumulative fluid volumes may not have been represented adequately. This is relevant given the subgroup analysis from the SMART study showed more pronounced differences in mortality and renal outcomes in septic patients and in those patients that required larger amount of fluids.

Inclusion criteria

After removing duplicate records from the different databases, two independent reviewers (XWL and CHW) selected the included studies based on the following PICOS criteria: (1) Participants: Adults with AP. The diagnosis of AP should be based on two of the following criteria developed by the Atlanta international symposium and revised Atlanta classification: a.) Abdominal pain consistent with AP (e.g. acute onset of persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back); b.) Serum lipase or amylase activity at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal; or c.) Classic image findings from computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or abdominal ultrasonography. We defined the severity of AP based on the Atlanta international symposium and revised Atlanta classification. For example, mild AP is defined by the absence of organ failure and local or systemic complications, and moderately severe AP is defined by the presence of transient organ failure or local or systemic complications. We classified mild and moderately severe AP into the non-severe AP group, because severe AP, characterized by persistent organ failure, may pose a higher mortality risk; (2) Interventions: aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, defined as a.) Fluid administration (predominantly normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution) at a rate greater than 10 ml/kg/hour as the initial management; b.) Fluid bolus 20 ml/kg for 2 h, then 2–3 ml/kg/hour in the first 24 h; c.) Isotonic crystalloid > 500 ml/hour for the first 12–24 h. If the RCTs did not report the fluid infusion rate in the study protocols, the crystalloid fluid administration should be greater than 4000 mL in the first 24 h; (3) Comparisons: non-aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, defined as a.) Fluid administration at a rate lower than 10 ml/kg/hour; b.) Fluid bolus 10 ml/kg for 2 h; then, 1.5 ml/kg/hour in the first 24 h or c.) Isotonic crystalloid < 500 ml/hour for the first 12–24 h. If the RCTs did not report the fluid infusion rate in the study protocols, the crystalloid fluid administration should be less than 4000 mL in the first 24 h; (4) Primary outcome: all-cause mortality. Other secondary outcomes, such as the rate of clinical improvement (based on the objective parameters, including systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) subsides and time period therefore, decrease in hematocrit (Hct), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine from baseline, and subjective measurements, including decrease in epigastric pain degree, assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) and tolerance of oral nutrition within 48 h) in non-severe AP and the changes of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and Multiple Organ Dysfunction (MOD) scores for severe AP, fluid-related complications, such as abdominal compartment syndrome, pulmonary/peripheral edema and any sign of volume overload (e.g. rapid weight gain, incident ascites or jugular vein engorgement), as defined by previous guidelines, sepsis, acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, pancreatic necrosis, SIRS subsiding within 48 h, SIRS persisting > 48 h, persistent organ failure (any organ failure > 48 h), defined by the revised Atlanta classification and total hospitalization days were also evaluated if they were reported in the included studies. Specifically, decrease in epigastric pain may be related to better prognosis of AP and better subjective perception of quality of life for patients. In addition, we included APACHE II score changes as the clinical prognosis parameter, based on the suggestions of the ACG guidelines, and the prediction performance of poor outcome in severe AP has been validated. We also evaluated the Hct and BUN changes within 48 h, because these parameters have been considered as surrogate markers for successful hydration for AP; (5) Designs: RCTs. In cases of disagreement over study selection, the senior author (SCS) made the final decision.

### Treatment of burns in the first 24 hours: simple and practical guide by answering 10 questions in a step-by-step form [^11615fmD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

50% of this volume is infused in the first 8 hours, starting from the time of injury, and the other 50% is infused during the last 16 hours of the first day.

The type of fluid administration is a debatable question. Lactated Ringer has been commonly used and is even used up to date. On the other hand, many centres suggest balanced electrolyte solutions like Ringer-acetate to prevent the high dose administration of lactate. According to our experience and to the best of our knowledge, we believe that balanced electrolyte solutions are a safe option and therefore they are recommended in our centre. Furthermore, specific burn populations usually require higher resuscitation volumes sometimes as much as 30–40% higher (close to 5.7 mL/kg/%TBSA) than predicted by the Parkland formula. Klein et al have suggested that patients today are receiving more fluid than in the past. Their purpose was to find significant predictors of negative outcomes after resuscitation. They concluded that higher volumes equalled a higher risk for complications, i.e. lung-complications. These results support that fluid overload in the critical hours of early burn management may lead to unnecessary oedema.

Overall, the use of Parkland formula is just a process of estimation. Clinically, fluid needs of an individual, after the use of any suggested formula, should be at least monitored by several important factors such urine output, blood pressure and central venous pressure. An important point and considered to be the goal in fluid resuscitation is to maintain a urine output of approximately 0.5 ml/kg/h in adults and between 0.5 and 1.0 ml/kg/h in patients weighing less than 30 kg. Failure to meet these goals should be addressed with gentle upward corrections in the rate of fluid administration by approximately 25%.

Due to the capillary leak, most burn centres advise not to use colloids and other blood products within the first 24 hours. If used in the early phase (up to 12 h), it can lead to a prolonged tissue oedema and consecutive lung complications. Furthermore colloids are not associated with an improvement in survival, and are therefore more expensive than crystalloids. Liberati et al advocated that there is no evidence that blood products (including human albumin) reduce mortality when compared with cheaper alternatives such as saline.
