## Question

What are some common medication mistakes new psychiatrists often make?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about common medication mistakes made by new psychiatrists. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about framing a taxonomy of error types to organize the analysis. Then, I should extract specific, cited examples that fit each category. Next, I will examine why early-career psychiatrists are particularly vulnerable to these mistakes. After that, I should synthesize prevention strategies linked to the cited guidance. Finally, I need to self-verify each claim against the references and explicitly correct any missteps as I go, maintaining a careful clinical tone throughout.

> Let me first confirm the categorization framework so the reasoning is systematic rather than a loose list; I will organize errors into nomenclature/formulation, pharmacokinetic interactions, titration/dosing, withdrawal/dependence, population-specific pitfalls, monitoring/surveillance, and conceptual/systems issues, while keeping in mind that transitions of care amplify many of these risks and that adverse drug event reporting spans both adverse reactions and medication errors across settings.

> Now, I will examine name and formulation confusion because look‑alike/sound‑alike and formulation mix‑ups are classic early‑career traps; wait, let me verify the lamotrigine examples — yes, the FDA repeatedly warns that Lamictal/lamotrigine names are confused and that different formulations are mixed up, so counseling patients to visually verify tablets at each fill is a practical double-check, and similarly, administration-device incompatibilities can cause errors such as with glatiramer acetate and incompatible autoinjectors, so I need to ensure device–drug compatibility is explicitly verified in orders and teaching [^111jn3e2] [^112Fv2YG] [^116AbVWt] [^117GiG9d].

> Next, I should review pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction pitfalls; hold on, I need to check the bidirectional lamotrigine–estrogen oral contraceptive interaction — estrogens lower lamotrigine levels overall but levels can rebound and even double during the pill‑free week, necessitating planned dose adjustments and adverse effect surveillance, while concomitant benzodiazepines with opioids carry black box warnings for profound sedation and respiratory depression and should be reserved only when alternatives are inadequate, and clobazam can reduce hormonal contraceptive efficacy requiring backup contraception for 28 days after discontinuation; I should also remember that gabapentin formulations like Gralise can add CNS depression with opioids such as morphine, requiring dose adjustment if somnolence emerges [^111jn3e2] [^113xEcDe] [^1143595M].

> I will now examine titration and dosing errors; iloperidone is a good example where a slow titration from 1 mg twice daily with daily increases not exceeding 2 mg twice daily is mandated to reduce orthostasis, and rushing titration in the first 1–2 weeks is a setup for syncope and treatment discontinuation, whereas in pediatric OCD the common error is the opposite — stopping at subtherapeutic SSRI doses or too brief trials despite guidance that many patients need high doses such as sertraline up to 200 mg daily with 10–12 week trials at the highest tolerated dose, although, wait, I should confirm pediatric approvals because not all antidepressants are FDA‑approved in youth, which reinforces the need to document rationale and informed consent when using off‑label doses or agents [^115ff72k] [^114LCFU9] [^112qhqHR].

> Hold on, I should verify withdrawal and dependence issues because these can lead to severe iatrogenic harm; initiating naltrexone without a reliable opioid‑free interval risks precipitated withdrawal and even a negative urine screen or naloxone challenge is not perfectly protective, so close monitoring and readiness to manage withdrawal with non‑opioid medications is essential, and starting with 25 mg then increasing to 50 mg daily after confirming no withdrawal remains prudent, while abrupt benzodiazepine discontinuation can precipitate life‑threatening withdrawal and thus requires a gradual taper, with guidelines also advising consideration of tapering in PTSD when risks exceed benefits [^1143Uras] [^111h9ukH] [^113xEcDe] [^114qCBPa].

> Let me think about population‑specific errors next; in pediatrics, beyond the approval nuances, not planning an exit strategy for antipsychotics used for disruptive behaviors leads to unnecessarily prolonged exposure, and in geriatrics, failing to apply structured medication review to avoid polypharmacy and fall‑risk–increasing drugs is common — using STOPP/START and deprescribing principles helps mitigate harm, and I should also remember tardive dyskinesia risk is higher in older adults, particularly women, so ongoing risk–benefit review and dose minimization are crucial [^112XdJDs] [^112Awzkj] [^114o9RuK].

> Next, I should review monitoring and surveillance pitfalls; isotretinoin products such as Amnesteem and Zenatane require pre‑treatment and ongoing assessment for depression, suicidality, and psychosis at every visit, and failure to screen can miss emergent psychiatric adverse effects, while naltrexone carries hepatotoxicity risk necessitating liver function monitoring, and even for legacy antidepressants like nortriptyline, providing and reviewing the Medication Guide and counseling families on risks, interactions, and warning signs are essential safeguards; I need to check CNS depressant messaging as well — gabapentin formulations such as Gralise require counseling on sedation, machinery operation, and interaction with opioids [^115Vt2Te] [^111AJFLK] [^1143Uras] [^114XYKD9] [^1143595M].

> But wait, conceptual and systems-level errors often drive prescribing missteps; I initially thought antipsychotics might have a role in preventing delirium in high‑risk inpatients, but hold on, I should verify guideline recommendations — the APA explicitly recommends not using antipsychotics for prevention of delirium, and likewise advises against melatonin or ramelteon for prophylaxis, so proactive non‑pharmacologic prevention strategies are preferred, and for problems like geriatric social isolation, leaning on social prescribing rather than reflexive medication can align care with evidence and reduce overuse [^116Bt2jY] [^115x1UWf] [^113Z3nxD] [^1128mfdV].

> I should double‑check the link between diagnostic error and medication error because missing the diagnosis can cascade into harmful prescriptions; delayed or wrong diagnoses, such as unrecognized bipolar disorder treated with antidepressant monotherapy, increase relapse and hospitalization, and although evidence comes from mixed‑fidelity studies, simple cognitive supports like checklists and debiasing education have reduced false positives and improved diagnostic accuracy in simulations, reminding me to slow down, gather collateral, and structure assessments to minimize premature closure [^114MRzta] [^116UQ4HV].

> Let me reconsider why new psychiatrists are especially vulnerable; inexperience with transitions of care magnifies omission, duplication, and wrong‑dose errors when prescriptions move across settings, and limited risk literacy can bias real‑world decisions toward overuse of potentially hazardous drugs, while a systems framing reminds us not to conflate harm with individual "error" and instead to strengthen resilience, workflows, and decision support that help early‑career clinicians catch and recover from slips before they reach patients [^113X7tTj] [^111BZeTg] [^113NW6cW] [^113BANG6].

> Next, I should review prevention strategies mapped to each pitfall; for LASA and formulation errors, counsel patients to visually verify Lamictal or Lamictal XR tablets at each fill and ensure compatible devices for products like glatiramer, for interactions, use a structured checklist whenever starting or stopping estrogen‑containing contraceptives with lamotrigine and avoid or tightly control benzodiazepine–opioid combinations, for titration, follow iloperidone's maximum daily increment rules and set expectations about delayed onset, for withdrawal, consider naloxone challenge when appropriate and taper benzodiazepines carefully, for pediatrics, plan and document antipsychotic exit strategies, for surveillance, build routine isotretinoin mental health checks and naltrexone liver monitoring into visits, and across the board, promote ADE reporting and integrate deprescribing recommendations into routine guideline use to normalize stopping or reducing medicines when risks outweigh benefits [^111jn3e2] [^116AbVWt] [^117GiG9d] [^113xEcDe] [^115ff72k] [^111h9ukH] [^112XdJDs] [^115Vt2Te] [^1143Uras] [^115T7QAh] [^117CW1vD] [^113cKG5T].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical takeaways are explicit and verified; maintain a high‑reliability med‑rec at transitions, run an interaction/titration checklist for each new start or stop with special attention to contraceptives, opioids, and CNS depressants, anticipate withdrawal syndromes by designing tapers, tailor choices to age‑specific risks and approvals, and default to non‑pharmacologic or guideline‑concordant approaches when tempted to "do something", correcting earlier assumptions as I did regarding delirium prophylaxis and always reassessing combinations like benzodiazepines plus opioids for necessity and duration to minimize respiratory risk [^113X7tTj] [^116Bt2jY] [^115x1UWf] [^113xEcDe].

New psychiatrists commonly make medication mistakes such as **inadequate medication reconciliation** at transitions of care [^113X7tTj], leading to omissions, duplications, or dosing errors. They also **fail to monitor for adverse effects** [^notfound] like metabolic syndrome with antipsychotics or serotonin syndrome with antidepressants, and may overlook drug interactions (e.g. lamotrigine [^111jn3e2] with oral contraceptives) [^112BtKye]. Other frequent errors include **prescribing without clear indications**, using antipsychotics for delirium prevention [^116Bt2jY] or inappropriate benzodiazepine use [^113xEcDe]; **incorrect dosing or titration**, such as rapid titration of iloperidone [^115ff72k] or not adjusting for renal/hepatic impairment; and **poor patient education** [^114XYKD9], including not counseling on adherence, side effects, or when to seek help. These errors can be reduced by thorough reconciliation, guideline adherence, careful monitoring, and clear patient communication [^113cKG5T].

---

## Inadequate medication reconciliation

With inadequate medication reconciliation, **omissions and duplications** may occur during transitions of care [^113X7tTj], leading to dosing errors. Incorrect dosing can also arise from confusion between **different formulations or concentrations** [^112Fv2YG], potentially causing overdose or therapeutic failure [^113X7tTj].

---

## Failure to monitor for adverse effects and drug interactions

- **Metabolic syndrome**: Inadequate monitoring for metabolic side effects (weight gain, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia) with antipsychotics is common.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Failure to recognize and monitor for serotonin syndrome when combining serotonergic medications.

- **Drug interactions**: Overlooking significant drug interactions, such as lamotrigine [^111jn3e2] with oral contraceptives [^112BtKye], leading to reduced efficacy or increased toxicity.

---

## Prescribing without clear indications or guidelines

Prescribing without clear indications or guideline support persists — for example, using **antipsychotics for delirium prevention** despite recommendations against their use [^116Bt2jY] [^115x1UWf] — and **benzodiazepines** may be used inappropriately, increasing risks of dependence and withdrawal [^114qCBPa].

---

## Incorrect dosing and titration

Incorrect dosing and titration include **rapid titration** of medications like iloperidone [^115ff72k] without adhering to recommended schedules, which can increase adverse effects, and failure to adjust doses for **renal or hepatic impairment**, leading to toxicity or subtherapeutic effects.

---

## Poor patient education and communication

Poor patient education and communication include **inadequate counseling** on medication adherence, side effects, and when to seek medical attention [^114XYKD9], and **failure to provide or review medication guides**, which can cause misunderstandings and non-adherence [^1143595M].

---

## Strategies to prevent medication errors

- **Thorough medication reconciliation**: Conduct comprehensive medication reconciliation at every transition of care [^113X7tTj].

- **Adherence to guidelines**: Follow evidence-based guidelines and dosing recommendations [^115x1UWf].

- **Regular monitoring**: Monitor for adverse effects and drug interactions regularly [^115T7QAh].

- **Clear patient communication**: Provide clear patient education and counseling [^112qhqHR] [^114XYKD9].

- **Use of checklists**: Utilize checklists and structured clinical interviews to reduce diagnostic and prescribing errors [^116UQ4HV].

---

New psychiatrists often make medication mistakes such as inadequate reconciliation, failure to monitor adverse effects, prescribing without clear indications, incorrect dosing, and poor patient education. These errors can be mitigated by **thorough reconciliation**, adherence to guidelines, regular monitoring, clear communication, and **use of checklists**.

## References

### Lamictal [^111jn3e2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Potential medication errors involving Lamictal have occurred; the names "Lamictal" or "lamotrigine" can be confused with the names of other commonly used medications. Additionally, medication errors may arise from the different formulations of Lamictal. To reduce the potential of such errors, it is crucial to write and say "Lamictal" clearly. Depictions of Lamictal tablets, tablets for oral suspension, and orally disintegrating tablets are available in the Medication Guide accompanying the product. These depictions highlight the distinctive markings, colors, and shapes that identify the different presentations of the drug, thereby potentially reducing the risk of medication errors. To avoid using the wrong drug or formulation, patients should be strongly advised to visually inspect their tablets to verify they have received Lamictal in the correct formulation each time they fill their prescription.

- **Concomitant use with estrogen-containing products, including oral contraceptives**: Some estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to decrease serum concentrations of lamotrigine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosage adjustments will be necessary for most patients who start or stop estrogen-containing oral contraceptives while taking Lamictal [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. During the week of inactive hormone preparation (pill-free week) of oral contraceptive therapy, plasma lamotrigine levels are expected to rise, potentially doubling by the end of the week. Adverse reactions consistent with elevated levels of lamotrigine may occur.

### Iloperidone [^115ff72k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Iloperidone tablets must be titrated slowly from a low starting dose to avoid orthostatic hypotension due to their alpha-adrenergic blocking properties. The recommended starting dose for iloperidone tablets is 1 mg orally twice daily. Dose increases to reach the target range of 6 mg to 12 mg twice daily (12 mg/day to 24 mg/day) may be made with daily dosage adjustments not to exceed 2 mg twice daily (4 mg/day). The maximum recommended dose is 12 mg twice daily (24 mg/day). Iloperidone doses above 24 mg/day have not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials. Efficacy was demonstrated with iloperidone tablets in a dose range of 6 mg to 12 mg twice daily. Prescribers should be mindful that patients need to be titrated to an effective dose of iloperidone tablets; thus, control of symptoms may be delayed during the first 1 to 2 weeks of treatment compared to some other antipsychotic drugs that do not require similar titration. Prescribers should also be aware that some adverse effects associated with iloperidone tablet use are dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Iloperidone tablets can be administered without regard to meals.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline for the prevention and treatment of delirium [^116Bt2jY]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for ICU delirium, specifically concerning pharmacological prophylaxis, the APA 2025 guidelines recommend not using antipsychotic agents for the prevention of delirium.

### Sympazan [^113xEcDe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warning: Risks from concomitant use with opioids; abuse, misuse, and addiction; and dependence and withdrawal reactions**: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Abuse, misuse, and addiction**: The use of benzodiazepines, including Sympazan, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing Sympazan and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Dependence and withdrawal reactions**: The continued use of benzodiazepines, including Sympazan, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of Sympazan after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue Sympazan or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions].

### Estimating the impact on patient safety of enabling the digital transfer of patients' prescription information in the English NHS [^113X7tTj]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). High credibility.

A medication error may be defined as any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the healthcare professional, patient, or consumer. The outcomes used in this study are medication errors occurring at transitions of care that involve the transfer of prescription information, referred to as transition medication errors. This excludes intentional medication changes during the medication reconciliation process. Types of transition medication errors include omissions, extra medicines, duplicated medicines, wrong dose, wrong frequency, wrong timing, wrong formulation, and acute medicines prescribed for chronic use.

There are multiple transitions that can involve information transfer. In this study, we focus on four information transfer settings: primary care to secondary care (hospital admission); secondary care to primary care (hospital discharge); intrahospital transition (where there is transfer of information from one electronic prescribing system to another, including both inpatient and outpatient care); and interhospital transition. Transitions excluded were ambulance/paramedic care; when patients change primary care practice; mental health and other specialist services such as sexual health; private hospitals (separate governance structures); devolved nations (Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland); hospital prescribing to dispensing; and outpatient/emergency care to community pharmacy.

Harm caused by medication is referred to as an adverse drug event (ADE).

### Pamelor [^114XYKD9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with nortriptyline hydrochloride and counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and Other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for nortriptyline hydrochloride. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking nortriptyline hydrochloride.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^1143Uras]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If a more rapid transition from agonist to antagonist therapy is deemed necessary and appropriate by the healthcare provider, monitor the patient closely in an appropriate medical setting where precipitated withdrawal can be managed.

In every case, healthcare providers should always be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications because there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful; however, a few case reports have indicated that patients may experience precipitated withdrawal despite having a negative urine toxicology screen or tolerating a naloxone challenge test (usually in the setting of transitioning from buprenorphine treatment). Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use.

Patients treated for alcohol dependence with naltrexone hydrochloride should also be assessed for underlying opioid dependence and for any recent use of opioids prior to initiation of treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or co-dependence on opioids.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction were observed in association with naltrexone hydrochloride exposure during the clinical development program and in the postmarketing period.

### Inequalities in health system coverage and quality: A cross-sectional survey of four Latin American countries [^117AePxd]. The Lancet Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

At least half of respondents reported having preventive checks in the past 12 months, with up to three-quarters in Colombia and Uruguay having preventive checks (figure 1C). However, complete checks for cardiovascular disease among older adults (men aged ≥ 40 years and women aged ≥ 50 years) were less than 50% in all countries and even lower in Peru. Continuity of care was notably higher in Uruguay (64%) compared with the other countries. Medical mistakes were least commonly reported in Mexico, with 94% reporting no mistakes, and most commonly reported in Peru, where 84% reported no mistakes.

Reported confidence in care quality, affordability, and responsiveness exceeded half of respondents only in Mexico, where confidence in care quality and government responsiveness was nearly double the prevalence elsewhere (figure 1D). Government management of the COVID-19 pandemic was rated worst in Peru (13% favorable), poorly in Mexico and Colombia (24–26% favorable), and well in Uruguay (55% favorable).

### Diagnostic error in mental health: a review [^116UQ4HV]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). Low credibility.

Although existing studies of diagnostic error have highlighted potential intervention targets, few have tested specific strategies to improve diagnostic decision-making and reduce error in psychiatric diagnosis. Only two publications have evaluated individual-level interventions aimed at facilitating clinician cognition in real-time. In a randomized study of 475 clinicians who assigned diagnoses based on vignettes, the use of checklists to facilitate assessment (versus no checklists) resulted in fewer false-positive diagnoses of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disorder. However, checklist use also led to the underdetection of MDD.

Another study randomized 137 mental health professionals to receive brief education about pediatric bipolar disorder versus education on cognitive biases and corrective strategies before evaluating four vignettes. Participants in the "de-biasing" condition gave more accurate diagnostic impressions and made fewer errors. Although both studies were conducted within low-fidelity simulations, they contribute to a larger body of work suggesting that cognitive interventions may improve clinicians' diagnostic performance.

Distributing the work of diagnosis among team members is another potential avenue for intervention emerging from the literature. In a randomized trial, 296 new psychiatric outpatients were assigned to receive usual care versus the addition of a structured clinical interview (SCID) conducted by a psychiatric nurse within two weeks of the initial assessment.

### Dovato [^112x8G3m]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Adverse reactions (all grades) observed in at least 2% of subjects in either treatment arm of the Week 144 pooled analysis from GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 trials are detailed below. The adverse reactions observed for Tivicay plus Epivir in the Week 144 analysis of the pooled data from GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 were generally consistent with the adverse reaction profiles and severities for the individual components when administered with other antiretroviral agents.

Adverse reactions of at least Grade 2 occurring in ≥ 1% of subjects treated with Tivicay plus Epivir included headache, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and insomnia (all at 1%).

- **Less common adverse reactions**: The following adverse reactions (all grades) occurred in < 2% of subjects receiving dolutegravir plus lamivudine or are from studies described in the prescribing information of the individual components, Tivicay (dolutegravir) and Epivir (lamivudine). Some events have been included because of their seriousness and the assessment of potential causal relationship.

	- **Blood and lymphatic system disorders**: Anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia.

	- **Gastrointestinal disorders**: Abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, flatulence, upper abdominal pain, vomiting.

	- **General disorders**: Fever.

	- **Hepatobiliary disorders**: Hepatitis.

	- **Immune system disorders**: Hypersensitivity, immune reconstitution syndrome.

	- **Musculoskeletal disorders**: Myositis.

	- **Nervous system disorders**: Somnolence.

	- **Psychiatric disorders**: Abnormal dreams, depression. Suicidal ideation, attempt, behavior, or completion; these events were observed primarily in subjects with a pre-existing condition.

### General practitioners' risk literacy and real-world prescribing of potentially hazardous drugs: A cross-sectional study [^111BZeTg]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). Low credibility.

The provision of too much medicine — which is likely to cause more harm than good — is a pervasive problem in high-income countries. Directly measuring medicine overuse is challenging due to the difficulty of defining appropriate care for patients with individual preferences and needs. Indirect approaches via examinations of variations in prevalence of procedures, prescriptions, and intensity of care, however, suggest that high-income countries face high rates of overuse across a wide range of services and prescriptions. Overuse can detrimentally impact patients' health, both physically and psychologically, and strain the healthcare system by squandering resources and funds that could be more effectively allocated elsewhere.

Past research indicates that physicians' level of medical risk literacy, and as a variant of risk literacy, their numeracy, can considerably influence their recommendations and decisions. Medical risk literacy refers to the cognitive ability to understand and interpret numerical statistical information (e.g. relative vs. absolute risk) related to medical interventions. While these studies provide important insights into the role of these cognitive abilities in physicians' judgments and decisions, their significance is limited due to the fact that they usually employ hypothetical scenarios and do not investigate real-world behavior. Little is known about how risk literacy impacts physicians' real-world prescribing practices, especially in the context of potentially hazardous drugs like antibiotics, opioids, gabapentin, and benzodiazepines.

### Observational studies: Practical tips for avoiding common statistical pitfalls [^116NU4Wj]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2024). Low credibility.

This personal view is intended for early-career researchers who are not yet experts in statistics. It focuses on common but usually avoidable flaws in the context of observational studies. The discussion highlights how study design, data collection, and statistical methods impact statistical results and research conclusions, with particular attention to study planning, sample selection, biases, lack of transparency, and results misinterpretations.

### Amnesteem [^115Vt2Te]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Amnesteem may cause depression, psychosis, and, in rare cases, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors. No mechanism of action has been established for these events. Prescribers should read the brochure, "Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin".

Prescribers should be vigilant for warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients in receiving necessary help. Therefore, prior to initiating Amnesteem therapy, it is important to ask patients and family members about any history of psychiatric disorders. During each therapy visit, patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation is needed.

Signs and symptoms of depression, as described in the brochure, include:

- **Emotional symptoms**: Sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities
- **Mental symptoms**: Difficulty concentrating, suicidal thoughts or attempts
- **Physical symptoms**: Fatigue, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, restlessness
- **Behavioral symptoms**: Irritability, acting on dangerous impulses
- **Persistent symptoms**: Persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment

If the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression, they should stop Amnesteem, and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber without waiting for the next visit.

### Ropinirole [^116rD4xu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Approximately 24% of patients treated with ropinirole tablets in the double-blind, placebo-controlled early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared to 13% of patients who received a placebo. The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with ropinirole tablets — incidence at least 2% greater than placebo — of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation were nausea and dizziness.

- **Treatment-emergent adverse reactions**: Table 3 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients with early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) treated with ropinirole tablets. These reactions were numerically more frequent compared to those in placebo-treated patients. In these trials, either ropinirole tablets or placebo was used as early therapy (i.e. without L-dopa).

	- **Note**: Patients may have reported multiple adverse reactions during the trial or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than one category.
	- **Asthenic condition**: Defined as asthenia, fatigue, and/or malaise.

### Attruby [^111MMkdC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

There is no clinical experience with overdose. In case of suspected overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.

### Zetia [^111JQXTU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In the event of an overdose, consider contacting the Poison Help line at 1–800–222–1222 or consult a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.

### Falls in older adults: Approach and prevention [^112Awzkj]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventive measures for falls in the elderly, more specifically with respect to medication review, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend avoiding the prescription of polypharmacy, drugs that increase the risk of falls, and drugs that meet the criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults as defined by the American Geriatrics Society. Use validated tools such as the STOPP/START criteria to guide deprescribing.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^114LCFU9]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Dose and duration**: NICE guidelines encourage the adoption of the maximum tolerated dosing schedule for SSRI medication in the treatment of OCD, as high-dose treatment (i.e. 200 mg/day for sertraline) is likely to be needed to achieve good clinical outcomes in the majority of patients with OCD. One of the most common pitfalls is using too low a dose of SSRI, for too short a duration, and not carefully supporting young people and their families to increase to a high dose of SSRI medication. This pitfall can be mitigated with careful explanation, including sharing good quality psychoeducational materials about SSRI and other medications. This is extremely important in building a therapeutic alliance to then attempt the necessary increase toward high-dose SSRI treatment regimens.

- **Early discontinuation of medication**: Another common pitfall is for patients and their families to seek early discontinuation of medication when experiencing early side effects. Instead, the approach should be toward a maximum tolerated dosing approach. This pitfall of early discontinuation can be avoided by, again, carefully counseling young people and their families. If any treatment-emergent side effects do occur, the practitioner will have proactively advised that these can commonly settle in a short period. Most importantly, the approach incorporates each treatment trial of SSRI medication for a minimum of 10–12 weeks at the highest tolerated dose. Clear communication about this approach can help avoid abrupt treatment discontinuations.

### Why inflammatory reductionism is a threat to psychiatry (and the rest of medicine) [^113tD4vk]. Brain (2025). Low credibility.

One might want to ask, "So what?" Is it really so bad for the culture to self-diagnose with implausible inflammatory disorders? This is just a fad, right? A cry for help from a civilization struggling under the weight of its own modernity? We'll work it out. After all, are the diagnostic categories of psychiatry really any better? Or are they basically arbitrary anyway — a series of tick boxes agreed upon by men in meeting rooms, with no real ontological status or plausible mechanism?

Inappropriately prescribing potentially harmful immunosuppressive drugs as a result of misdiagnosed CNS autoimmunity is a real danger, and one that may become more common, particularly in less regulated health systems. But there is another side to this coin — one that is potentially far more harmful. This has to do with stigma. While the "inflammatory turn" in psychiatry is a welcome shift in principle — in that it expands the repertoire of explanatory models — in practice, it increasingly entails an unwillingness to consider more biopsychosocial explanations or treatments, which are increasingly dismissed as "medical gaslighting". Whereas antipsychiatry once came from critics who argued that psychiatrists are complicit in the inappropriate medicalization of everyday suffering, today some of the most hostile criticisms come from voices arguing that psychiatrists do not medicalize enough. It is argued that psychiatrists are so ideologically committed to "psychologizing" everything that they fail to recognize the biological (inflammatory) realities staring us in the face.

### Buphenyl [^112kUyht]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **How medications interact with buphenyl**: Probenecid, a medication used to treat gout, may affect the way the kidneys excrete buphenyl. It is advisable to consult a doctor for more details.

- **Common side effects of buphenyl**: The most common side effect reported in premenopausal women taking buphenyl was absent or irregular menstrual periods. Decreased appetite was reported in 4% of all people treated. Body odor and bad taste were each reported in 3% of all patients treated. A breakdown product of buphenyl has been associated mainly with sleepiness and light-headedness. Because these symptoms may also be due to the urea cycle going out of control, a doctor should see the patient immediately if these symptoms occur, so the cause can be determined. Blood tests should be performed periodically to check for adverse effects and for levels of medication and its breakdown products.

- **Storage instructions for buphenyl**: Buphenyl should be stored in a tightly closed bottle at room temperature.

This leaflet provides a brief summary of the information available on buphenyl. The information here is incomplete and is not designed to take the place of your doctor's instructions. For more complete information, consult your physician or contact Horizon at 1–866–479–6742.

### Compro [^114o9RuK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia is a syndrome characterized by potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, which may develop in patients treated with neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs. The prevalence of this syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, particularly elderly women. However, it is impossible to rely on prevalence estimates to predict which patients are likely to develop the syndrome at the inception of neuroleptic treatment. The potential for different neuroleptic drug products to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the likelihood of its irreversibility are believed to increase with longer treatment durations and higher total cumulative doses of neuroleptic drugs. Nonetheless, the syndrome can also develop, albeit less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods and at low doses.

There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia. The syndrome may remit partially or completely if neuroleptic treatment is withdrawn. However, neuroleptic treatment itself may suppress the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and may mask the underlying disease process.

The effect of symptomatic suppression on the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, neuroleptics should be prescribed in a manner most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic neuroleptic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic condition.

### Onfi [^112BtKye]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients or caregivers to check with their healthcare provider before taking Onfi with other CNS depressants such as other benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, sedating antihistamines, or alcohol [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.5)]. If applicable, caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that Onfi does not affect them adversely (e.g. impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills).

- **Hypersensitivity**: Inform patients or caregivers that Onfi is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- **Interactions with hormonal contraceptives**: Counsel women to also use non-hormonal methods of contraception when Onfi is used with hormonal contraceptives and to continue these alternative methods for 28 days after discontinuing Onfi to ensure contraceptive reliability [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Serious dermatological reactions**: Advise patients or caregivers that serious skin reactions have been reported in patients taking Onfi. Serious skin reactions, including SJS/TEN, may need to be treated in a hospital and may be life-threatening. If a skin reaction occurs while taking Onfi, patients or caregivers should consult with healthcare providers immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part II [^114gHQkz]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

As faculty of the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) course on child and adolescent psychopharmacology, we previously published a paper reporting the most common questions we have been asked in recent editions of the course, alongside evidence-based and/or expert-informed answers. Here, based on our experience during the course, we have selected what we deem are the most common pitfalls and how to avoid them in child and adolescent psychopharmacology, focusing on autism and intellectual disability, eating disorders, neuropsychiatric correlates of epilepsy, and psychosis.

- **Pitfalls grouped by disorder**: We have organized the pitfalls by the disorders to which they refer, in alphabetical order. Pitfalls in relation to the treatment of other disorders — such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and related disorders, and tic disorder — are addressed in a separate paper (Part I).

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part II [^115HqrYc]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Dosing**: When using antipsychotics in young people, particularly in children, it is important to consider efficacy and tolerability when adjusting doses. Adjusting dosages based solely on body weight has not been found adequate. Although a general recommendation for antipsychotic therapy is to start slow and go slow, one common pitfall is not using full dosages due to concerns about adverse events. In the event of a lack of efficacy, clinicians should raise dosages to the maximum recommended while monitoring for adverse events. However, increasing antipsychotic dosages above the maximum recommended dose should be avoided, as it is associated with greater differences in side effects than in efficacy. It is important to note that abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medications can also cause withdrawal dyskinesia and a syndrome of deteriorating behavior in children and adolescents.

- **Management of treatment-resistant psychosis**: Management of treatment resistance is also challenging in children and adolescents with psychosis. There is high variability across practitioners in the waiting time before switching to another antipsychotic in case of treatment non-response. Although recommendations from guidelines may differ, waiting more than 6 weeks in case of no improvement in psychotic symptoms or functioning is not supported by evidence and should be avoided. A common practice in case of non-response, besides the increase in dosages above the maximum recommended dose, is to use an antipsychotic combination.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^111h9ukH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Treatment should be initiated with an initial dose of 25 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride. If no withdrawal signs occur, the patient may be started on 50 mg a day thereafter. A dose of 50 mg once a day will produce adequate clinical blockade of the actions of parenterally administered opioids. As with many non-agonist treatments for addiction, naltrexone hydrochloride is of proven value only when given as part of a comprehensive plan of management that includes some measure to ensure the patient takes the medication.

- **Naloxone challenge test**: Clinicians are reminded that there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful if there is any question of occult opioid dependence. If signs of opioid withdrawal are still observed following the naloxone challenge, treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride should not be attempted. The naloxone challenge can be repeated in 24 hours. The naloxone challenge test should not be performed in a patient showing clinical signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal, or in a patient whose urine contains opioids. The naloxone challenge test may be administered by either the intravenous or subcutaneous routes.

- **Intravenous administration**: Inject 0.2 mg naloxone. Observe for 30 seconds for signs or symptoms of withdrawal. If no evidence of withdrawal, inject 0.6 mg of naloxone. Observe for an additional 20 minutes.

### The ASAM/AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^112AJ8cV]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for stimulant use disorder, specifically for psychostimulants, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend limiting the prescription of psychostimulant medications for stimulant use disorder to physician specialists certified in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry. Physicians should possess equivalent training, competencies, and the ability for intensive patient monitoring.

### Zenatane [^111AJFLK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Zenatane may cause depression, psychosis, and in rare cases, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors. No mechanism of action has been established for these events. Prescribers should read the brochure "Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin".

Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients in receiving the help they need. Therefore, prior to the initiation of Zenatane therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder. At each visit during therapy, patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary.

Signs and symptoms of depression, as described in the brochure, include:

- **Emotional symptoms**: sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities
- **Physical symptoms**: fatigue, persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment
- **Cognitive symptoms**: difficulty concentrating
- **Sleep and appetite changes**: changes in sleep patterns, changes in weight or appetite
- **Behavioral symptoms**: suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses

Patients should stop Zenatane, and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression, without waiting until the next visit.

### Improving adverse drug event reporting by healthcare professionals [^115T7QAh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Adverse drug events, encompassing both adverse drug reactions and medication errors, pose a significant threat to health, leading to illness and, in severe cases, death. Timely and voluntary reporting of adverse drug events by healthcare professionals plays a crucial role in mitigating the morbidity and mortality linked to unexpected reactions and improper medication usage.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of different interventions aimed at healthcare professionals to improve the reporting of adverse drug events.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, and several other electronic databases and trials registers, including ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP, from inception until 14 October 2022. We also screened reference lists in the included studies and relevant systematic reviews.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized trials, non-randomized controlled studies, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series studies (ITS), and repeated measures studies, assessing the effect of any intervention aimed at healthcare professionals and designed to increase adverse drug event reporting. Eligible comparators were healthcare professionals' usual reporting practice or a different intervention or interventions designed to improve adverse drug event reporting rates. We excluded studies of interventions targeted at adverse event reporting following immunization. Our primary outcome measures were the total number of adverse drug event reports (including both adverse drug reaction reports and medication error reports) and the number of false reports.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^114soCyi]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

To achieve optimal outcomes for patients living with BP‐I, it is critical to involve all stakeholders who are part of the patient journey, such as HCPs, patients, and their supporters, in an early shared decision‐making process (Figure 2). As described previously, early disease represents an excellent opportunity to begin this process and pivot away from traditional clinical practices. Consistent accessibility to psychiatrists varies greatly worldwide, as emphasized by the COVID‐19 pandemic, highlighting the need for treatments that decrease dependence on healthcare systems and the need for the stability that a longer‐acting antipsychotic may provide.

- **Relationships between stakeholders**: HCP, healthcare provider; NGO, non‐governmental organization.

More data are required to assess the potential impact of LAIs on BP‐I and to facilitate widespread acceptance of LAIs. Clinical and database studies could aid in bridging the existing knowledge gaps and, subsequently, provide HCPs and clinics with first‐hand experience from clinicians who prescribed LAIs for BP‐I earlier in the course of illness. Although naturalistic randomized clinical trials (RCTs) can be complex to organize and complete, they are invaluable because they do not require blinding and better reflect real clinical practice while still being more controlled than real‐world studies. For instance, trials to compare LAIs with lithium (the "gold standard"), especially in relation to the dangers of lithium discontinuation, are highly desirable if clinical practice is to be altered effectively.

### General practitioners' risk literacy and real-world prescribing of potentially hazardous drugs: A cross-sectional study [^113NW6cW]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). Low credibility.

Physicians worldwide provide low-value care for numerous reasons. Our study suggests a new and previously unexplored dimension to the problem of overuse and low-value care: physicians' ability to correctly understand and deal with medical statistics. Given the devastating effects that unnecessary prescriptions of potentially hazardous drugs can have on patients' health and safety, further studies are needed to investigate the generalisability of our findings in other healthcare settings. Additionally, it is important to delve deeper into associations with other contributing factors, such as barriers to timely healthcare access, to better understand what undermines the practice of evidence-based prescribing.

### The problem with how we view medical (and diagnostic) error in emergency medicine [^113BANG6]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Confusing harm with "error" is, at best, misleading, often obfuscating, and can be highly destructive, especially for clinicians striving to perform optimally in challenging conditions. This misinterpretation leads harm to be seen as a professional problem and overlooks the real hazards faced by both patients and clinicians. Furthermore, it discourages a deeper exploration of how clinicians effectively adapt and respond daily to avoid hazards that contribute to harm. It ignores the complexity of the system and the intricacies of clinical expertise, where trade-offs must be made to deliver care in an imperfect, complex, hazardous, and uncertain world.

Emergency department providers operate in varied environments, utilizing different tools to perform competing tasks with limited resources and uncertain information, often in crowded settings with production pressure expectations. Consequently, every decision carries an inherent degree of risk. Instead of equating harm with "error", harm should be viewed as a result of process failures and interactions within a sociotechnical system (STS). Clinical expertise involves routine harm-reducing behaviors. Adopting this perspective shifts the focus away from "blame and retrain" toward supporting clinicians in enhancing expertise and building system resilience.

- **Case vignette**: The case vignette illustrates successful error recovery in the diagnostic process, which prevented harm. Multiple individuals, including the emergency physician, radiologist, and patient, played a role in this error recovery through their actions. A key factor in such recovery is…

Unfortunately, errors and mistakes are part of life. They can harm patients and incur unplanned costs. Errors may arise from various sources, which may be classified as systematic, latent, or active. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors also contribute to incorrect decisions. In addition to cognitive biases, our personality, socialization, personal chronobiology, and way of thinking (heuristic versus analytical) are influencing factors. Factors such as overload from private situations, long commuting times, and the complex environment of information technology must also be considered. The objective of this paper is to define and classify errors and mistakes in radiology, to discuss the influencing factors, and to present strategies for prevention. Hierarchical responsibilities and team "well-being" are also discussed.

### Zonegran [^113wepJm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

- **How to take Zonegran**: Take Zonegran exactly as prescribed. Your healthcare provider may adjust your dose and will instruct you on the appropriate amount to take. Zonegran can be taken with or without food. Swallow the capsules whole. If you take too much Zonegran, immediately contact your local Poison Control Center or visit the nearest emergency room. Do not stop taking Zonegran without consulting your healthcare provider, as abruptly discontinuing it may lead to serious issues, including seizures that can become status epilepticus.

- **Things to avoid while taking Zonegran**: Avoid consuming alcohol or other substances that make you sleepy or dizzy until you have consulted with your healthcare provider. The combination of Zonegran with alcohol or such substances may increase sleepiness or dizziness. Refrain from driving, operating heavy machinery, or engaging in other dangerous activities until you are aware of how Zonegran affects you. Zonegran may impair your thinking and motor skills.

- **Possible side effects of Zonegran**: Zonegran can cause serious side effects. Refer to "What is the most important information I should know about Zonegran?" for more details.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part II [^112XdJDs]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

The importance of an "exit strategy" when prescribing antipsychotics for challenging behaviours cannot be overstated. Evidence on the use of low doses of antipsychotics for disruptive behaviours in children is limited to short-term studies. Notably, pharmacological treatments, especially in individuals with disabilities, are often unnecessarily prolonged without discontinuation, even after persisting clinical improvement. An "exit strategy" (i.e. discussing the need to consider stopping a medication once the disruptive behaviour is stabilised) should always be planned with patients and their caregivers.

### Living with technological challenges: Does socioeconomic status affect people's health [^112CDpHM]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

- **Moderating variable: Rural–urban**: The literature shows that rural residents experience more serious technological challenges than urban residents, partly due to the distribution of medical care resources in rural and urban areas. This disparity has been a critical area of research, highlighting significant differences in access to and use of medical resources between rural and urban residents in China. For example, urban residents have greater access to high-quality medical care resources because most high-ranking hospitals are in urban areas. Compared with urban residents, rural residents must spend relatively more time and money to access similar medical resources and benefit from modern information technology, such as making appointments or obtaining medical test results online. Rural older adults benefit the least from these changes. Moreover, compared with rural residents, urban residents have more support in using modern information technology related to medical resources, like volunteer assistance, free community-organized information technology training, and home-help services. We thus propose the second hypothesis regarding the moderating role of the rural–urban variable. The moderating effect suggests that the magnitude and/or direction of the impact of technological challenges on health conditions is affected by whether residents live in urban or rural areas.

- **Hypothesis 2**: The rural–urban factor plays a moderating role in the association between technological challenges and health conditions. Contrastingly, the association between technological challenges and health conditions is influenced by the residents' environment.

### Living with technological challenges: Does socioeconomic status affect people's health [^1169DRJZ]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). High credibility.

In recent years, the implementation of modern technology in medical care services, such as online appointment booking and digital access to medical test results, has become popular, improving service delivery efficiency and accelerating medical service utilization. For example, patients can now access services, book appointments, or check test results more conveniently and quickly, instead of waiting long hours in medical care institutions. However, scholars have argued that innovations may introduce access-related challenges for older adults or those with low educational levels, potentially excluding those who struggle with technology from effectively using medical care services.

Consequently, people's health conditions may worsen because of their inability to access medical care services, and they may feel isolated due to these challenges — especially those with a low socioeconomic status (SES). SES is among the most important indicators for analyzing residents' social policy utilization, studied extensively in fields like sociology and management. Therefore, it is essential to explore whether individuals with different SES levels perceive technological challenges differently when accessing medical care services.

Moreover, we are interested in how differences in urban–rural residency impact perceptions of technological challenges when accessing medical care resources across different SES levels. Scientific evidence highlights disparities in urban–rural medical resources within China, with residents experiencing varying degrees of access.

### Gralise [^1143595M]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients of the availability of a Medication Guide and instruct them to read it prior to taking Gralise.

- **Medication instructions**: Advise patients that Gralise is not interchangeable with other formulations of gabapentin. They should take Gralise only as prescribed. Gralise may cause dizziness, somnolence, and other signs and symptoms of CNS depression.

- **Driving and machinery**: Advise patients not to drive or operate complex machinery until they have gained sufficient experience with Gralise to determine whether it adversely affects their mental or motor performance.

- **Concomitant treatment with morphine**: Advise patients requiring concomitant treatment with morphine to inform their prescriber if they develop signs of CNS depression such as somnolence. If these signs occur, the dose of Gralise or morphine should be reduced accordingly.

- **Missed doses**: Advise patients that if they miss a dose of Gralise, they should take it with food as soon as they remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, they should skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time. They should not take two doses at the same time.

- **Overdose**: Advise patients that if they take too much Gralise, they should call their healthcare provider or poison control center or go to the nearest emergency room right away.

### Aridol bronchial challenge test kit [^112dNwDc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Severe bronchospasm: ARIDOL may cause severe bronchospasm in susceptible patients. Administer by trained professionals under the supervision of a physician. Medications and equipment to treat severe bronchospasm must be present in the testing area. Subjects with co-morbid conditions: Use with caution in patients with conditions that may increase sensitivity to the bronchoconstricting or other potential effects of ARIDOL, such as severe cough, ventilatory impairment, unstable angina, or active upper or lower respiratory tract infection that may worsen with use of a bronchial irritant.

- **Severe bronchospasm**: Mannitol, the active ingredient in ARIDOL, acts as a bronchoconstrictor and may cause severe bronchospasm in susceptible patients. The test should only be conducted by trained professionals under the supervision of a physician familiar with all aspects of the bronchial challenge test and the management of acute bronchospasm. Patients should not be left unattended during the bronchial challenge test. Medications and equipment to treat severe bronchospasm must be present in the testing area.

	- If a patient has a ≥ 10% reduction in FEV1 (from pre-challenge FEV1) on administration of the 0 mg capsule, the ARIDOL Bronchial Challenge Test should be discontinued, and the patient should be given a dose of a short-acting inhaled beta-agonist and monitored accordingly.

	- Patients with either a positive response to bronchial challenge testing with ARIDOL or significant respiratory symptoms should receive a short-acting inhaled beta-agonist.

### Buphenyl [^116VWwbS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Buphenyl (sodium phenylbutyrate) is available in both tablet and powder form. It is prescribed along with dietary changes for the long-term treatment of urea cycle disorders and can only be obtained with a prescription from your doctor. It is crucial to take Buphenyl exactly as prescribed without altering the dose without the doctor's approval.

- **Urea cycle disorders**: These include a group of diseases, each characterized by a specific liver enzyme deficiency. As these conditions are inherited, other family members may also be affected. The severity of these disorders can vary, and they may be detected at different ages, ranging from infants to adults. They lead to elevated ammonia levels in the blood, which can cause disturbed brain function and severe brain damage. Symptoms include decreased mental awareness, vomiting, combativeness, slurred speech, unstable gait, and unconsciousness.

Diagnosing urea cycle disorders requires special laboratory tests. After diagnosis, symptoms may recur if the condition is not well-controlled. In such cases, notify the doctor immediately as this constitutes a medical emergency. Infections can exacerbate the condition, so it is important to seek medical attention promptly if a fever develops.

### Percocet [^116P4zse]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Percocet should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Since the risk of overdose increases with higher opioid doses, reserve titration to higher doses of Percocet for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and where the expected benefits clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions, such as pain following certain surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries, require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to manage pain due to both the cause of pain and individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, considering the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment, response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Percocet. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

Patient access to naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose is essential.

### Canadian clinical guidelines on social isolation and loneliness in older adults [^1128mfdV]. Canadian geriatrics journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding non-pharmacologic interventions for social isolation in the elderly, particularly in relation to social prescribing, the CCSMH 2024 guidelines recommend considering offering social prescribing. This involves connecting patients with suitable organizations, programs, or community resources that provide opportunities for social interaction and/or self-care. The aim is to manage or alleviate social isolation and loneliness and address the social determinants of health.

### Glatiramer acetate [^117GiG9d]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Glatiramer acetate products and administration errors**: Medication errors have occurred when glatiramer acetate products are administered with incompatible autoinjectors. Some glatiramer acetate products can be administered by an optional compatible autoinjector, should one be available; however, not all glatiramer acetate products have a marketed optional compatible autoinjector for administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].

Using an optional autoinjector that is not compatible for use with Mylan's glatiramer acetate injection may increase the risk for medication errors, such as dose omission or administration of a partial dose. If using an optional autoinjector for administration, ensure the device is compatible for use with the specific glatiramer acetate product by referring to the autoinjector labeling. The availability of compatible autoinjectors for each glatiramer acetate product may change with time.

### Diagnostic error in mental health: a review [^114MRzta]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). Low credibility.

Timely and appropriate diagnosis in mental health is an essential first step towards effective treatment. Missed, delayed, or wrong diagnosis of mental disorders can lead to poorer patient outcomes and can waste time and resources. For example, delayed diagnosis of bipolar disorder has been linked to more frequent relapse and hospitalizations. In a large registry study of over 1000 patients with narcolepsy, over one-quarter of the sample reported having consulted five or more clinicians before receiving the diagnosis. Missed and delayed diagnosis can also result in a lack of functional improvement, delayed remission, and delayed or unnecessary treatments.

Mental disorders are largely clinical diagnoses that seldom have specific objective findings that can be detected through laboratory testing, physical examination, or imaging. As such, history taking, behavioral observation, and data gathering from collateral sources (e.g. family members, teachers) are essential to the diagnosis. Despite the importance of effective data gathering and synthesis, time pressures, competing priorities, and various cognitive biases can interfere with this process. Validated psychological tests and symptom reporting scales can help with the data gathering process, but these can lead to inaccurate diagnostic impressions if they are interpreted without sufficient context or not followed with an appropriate diagnostic interview. Finally, evolving (and in some cases, expanding) diagnostic criteria for mental disorders have prompted concerns that clinicians could inadvertently pathologize normal variations.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^113Lx4nn]. APA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for posttraumatic stress disorder, specifically with respect to other medications, the APA 2025 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of certain medications. These include hypnotics such as eszopiclone, MAOIs such as brofaromine and phenelzine, norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors such as bupropion, serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors such as nefazodone. Additionally, there is insufficient evidence regarding the use of ganaxolone, nepicastat, orvepitant, or augmentation with D-cycloserine or eszopiclone in patients with PTSD.

### Pamelor [^112qhqHR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Antidepressant medicines are crucial for treating depression and other illnesses. It is vital to never stop an antidepressant medication without first consulting with a healthcare provider, as sudden cessation may cause other symptoms. Discussing all the risks of treating depression, as well as the risks of not treating it, with a healthcare provider is essential. Patients, along with their families or caregivers, should explore all treatment options, not just the use of antidepressants.

Antidepressant medications come with side effects. It is important to talk to the healthcare provider about the side effects of the specific medicine prescribed for you or your family member. Additionally, these medicines can interact with other medications. It's crucial to be aware of all medicines you or a family member is taking and maintain a comprehensive list to share with the healthcare provider. Starting new medications should always be cleared with your healthcare provider.

Not all antidepressants prescribed for children are FDA-approved for pediatric use. Engage with your child's healthcare provider to gather more information.

For medical advice concerning side effects, contact your doctor. Side effects may also be reported to the FDA at 1–800-FDA-1088.

### Improving adverse drug event reporting by healthcare professionals [^117CW1vD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Adverse drug events, encompassing both adverse drug reactions and medication errors, pose a significant threat to health, leading to illness and, in severe cases, death. Timely and voluntary reporting of adverse drug events by healthcare professionals plays a crucial role in mitigating the morbidity and mortality linked to unexpected reactions and improper medication usage.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of different interventions aimed at healthcare professionals to improve the reporting of adverse drug events.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, and several other electronic databases and trials registers, including ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP, from inception until 14 October 2022. We also screened reference lists in the included studies and relevant systematic reviews.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised trials, non-randomised controlled studies, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series studies (ITS), and repeated measures studies assessing the effect of any intervention aimed at healthcare professionals and designed to increase adverse drug event reporting. Eligible comparators were healthcare professionals' usual reporting practice or a different intervention or interventions designed to improve adverse drug event reporting rate. We excluded studies of interventions targeted at adverse event reporting following immunisation. Our primary outcome measures were the total number of adverse drug event reports (including both adverse drug reaction reports and medication error reports).

### What do clinical practice guidelines say about deprescribing? A scoping review [^113cKG5T]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). High credibility.

Integration of deprescribing recommendations into clinical practice guidelines has been proposed as a mechanism to minimize potentially inappropriate medicine use and reduce medicine-related harm. The large number of deprescribing recommendations identified in this review (n = 316), as well as the upward trend in guidelines containing deprescribing recommendations over time, may reflect a growing awareness of the need to consider deprescribing. However, less than one-third of potentially eligible guidelines identified in the registries search contained a deprescribing recommendation, and only 7% of evidence-based recommendations from the 80 included guidelines pertained to deprescribing. Additionally, less than half of these guidelines had a deprescribing recommendation for all medications with a prescribing recommendation. Such findings indicate a paucity of adequate deprescribing guidance and a need for developers to consider including deprescribing when defining the scope of guidelines and when formulating recommendations.

### Living with technological challenges: Does socioeconomic status affect people's health [^113uGoqE]? BMC Geriatrics (2025). High credibility.

Given the widespread implementation of information technology in medical care services in China, which has transformed the delivery and utilization of medical services, we argue that socioeconomic status (SES) affects health conditions through the mediating role of technological challenges. We proposed that technological challenges mediate the effect of SES on Chinese urban and rural residents' health conditions.

By examining this hypothesis, this study provides novel insights into the effect of SES on health and contributes new evidence on how technological challenges differently affect rural and urban residents. In contrast to prior studies that emphasized the importance of further examining how much SES impacts people's health conditions through technological challenges, our findings clarify this understanding by demonstrating that individuals with lower (vs. higher) SES face greater technological challenges, resulting in poorer health conditions. Moreover, the rural–urban factor moderates the mediated effect of SES on health conditions, with a stronger effect among rural residents. Rural individuals with low SES have poorer health conditions because of technological challenges.

First, our results reveal a new mechanism: technological challenges influence the extent to which residents with low SES experience changes in health conditions when accessing and using medical services and resources. While the extensive use of advanced information technologies in medical care services enhances delivery efficiency, it appears to widen the gap between urban and rural residents, as rural residents face greater difficulties.

### Barcode medication administration system use and safety implications: A data-driven longitudinal study supported by clinical observation [^112s9kr6]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2025). Low credibility.

Medication administration errors are the most common adverse events in healthcare. An estimated 237 million medication errors occur every year in the National Health Service (NHS) in England, of which 66 million are clinically significant, with an increased risk of patient harm, including adverse drug-related hospital admissions, approximately 700 deaths per year due to avoidable medication errors, and an estimated annual financial cost of £98.5 million.

Digital maturity within the healthcare setting is seen as essential for increased quality and safety as it supports the efficient and reliable flow of data between systems and makes data readily available for tracking patient outcomes, including those related to safety. Digital maturity is commonly taken to mean the implementation and use of sophisticated digital systems, typically including the integration of barcode medication administration (BCMA) systems, normally in conjunction with computerized physician order entry, electronic medication administration records, decision support systems, and all patient records managed digitally. While many NHS trusts aspire to a high level of digital maturity, in practice, it is difficult to achieve because, alongside technology implementation, it also requires changes in working practices and upskilling staff to realize the benefits of greater digitization.

### Lamictal XR [^116AbVWt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

**Potential medication errors**: Medication errors involving Lamictal XR have occurred. In particular, the names Lamictal or lamotrigine can be confused with the names of other commonly used medications. Medication errors may also occur between the different formulations of Lamictal. To reduce the potential of medication errors, write and say Lamictal XR clearly. Depictions of the Lamictal XR extended-release tablets can be found in the Medication Guide. Each Lamictal XR tablet has a distinct color and white center and is printed with "Lamictal XR" and the tablet strength. These distinctive features serve to identify the different presentations of the drug, thus potentially reducing the risk of medication errors. Lamictal XR is supplied in round, unit-of-use bottles with orange caps containing 30 tablets. The label on the bottle includes a depiction of the tablets that further communicates to patients and pharmacists that the medication is Lamictal XR and specifies the tablet strength included in the bottle. The use of the unit-of-use bottle with a distinctive orange cap and distinctive bottle label features helps to identify different presentations of the drug, thereby reducing the risk of medication errors. To avoid medication errors related to using the wrong drug or formulation, patients should be strongly advised to visually inspect their tablets to verify that they are Lamictal XR each time they fill their prescription.

### Look-alike, sound-alike (LASA) drugs in India [^112DkQiU]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2024). Low credibility.

The government should insist that generic medicines are not approved without conducting bioavailability and bioequivalence (BA-BE) studies. Completion of BA-BE studies is a requirement for exported drugs and could be implemented for the generic medicines currently being sold in India. Such a move would make the doctors more confident in prescribing generic medicines.

The first step to changing the currently prevalent practice is by ensuring that information related to prescription practices — guidelines, regulations, and the harm of poor prescription practices on the public — reaches every practicing physician in the country. The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission maintains a healthcare professional registry. The registry includes practitioners from both modern and traditional systems of medicine. Healthcare providers (HCPs), especially from remote areas, could be encouraged to register on this platform. The government could then use the platform to convey relevant information, notify alerts, and organize periodic online or offline training to keep HCPs updated.

National professional bodies could support their members by updating them frequently through newsletters or bulletins. Frequent training of healthcare professionals and pharmacists in prescription writing and updating them on common LASA drugs in their practice could also help in reducing medication errors. At the same time, regulatory bodies and hospital administration could set guidelines for regular audits of charts to detect and record the prevalence of medication errors due to LASA drugs.

### Amnesteem [^113Jk67q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Read the Medication Guide that accompanies Amnesteem (isotretinoin capsules, USP) before beginning treatment and each time you receive a prescription, as there may be new information. This guide supplements, but does not replace, discussions with your doctor regarding your medical condition or treatment.

- **Important information about Amnesteem**: Amnesteem is used to treat severe nodular acne unresponsive to other treatments, including antibiotics. Due to the risk of birth defects, Amnesteem is prescribed only to patients who are able to understand and commit to following all instructions in the iPLEDGE REMS program. Amnesteem may also cause serious mental health issues.

- **Birth defects and pregnancy risks**: Amnesteem can cause birth defects, miscarriage, fetal death, and premature birth. Patients must not take Amnesteem if they are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. It is crucial not to become pregnant:
	- For one month before starting Amnesteem
	- While taking Amnesteem
	- For one month after stopping Amnesteem

	- If pregnancy occurs while taking Amnesteem, stop immediately and contact your doctor. All pregnancy cases should be reported to:
	- FDA MedWatch at 1–800-FDA-1088
	- The iPLEDGE Pregnancy Registry at 1–866–495–0654

- **Serious mental health problems**: Amnesteem may lead to depression, psychosis (experiencing hallucinations), and suicidal thoughts. Some patients on Amnesteem have contemplated self-harm or suicide.

Please consult your doctor for further guidance and report any adverse effects promptly.

### Difficult to treat depression: Focus on approach, algorithms, and access [^113yRHCs]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

The pandemic refocused interest on the burden of depression across the lifespan; the increased efforts to prevent and treat depression are now a priority of health care systems, insurers, patient advocates, digital therapeutic engineers, telemedicine platforms, and community health agencies. However, the challenges of treating depression to remission in adult patients who do not respond to first, second, or third levels of oral pharmacotherapy remain. The increased prevalence of these conditions is at odds with the shrinking psychiatric workforce. Since addressing difficult-to-treat depression is situated in a rapidly evolving treatment landscape, the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Tucson Department of Psychiatry organized and hosted the Southwest Forum on Difficult to Treat Depression: Focus on Approach, Algorithms, and Access in July 2024. The forum convened 11 internationally renowned experts in the science and treatment of depression, particularly difficult-to-treat depression, for a day of teaching and discussion. Based on their expertise, participants were asked to address one of the following three themes:

- **Novel mechanism approaches for difficult to treat depression**: Experts discussed innovative treatments that target unexplored pathways in neurobiology.
- **What do I do next? Evidence-informed algorithms to get patients better faster**: The focus was on practical strategies and decision-making based on recent studies.
- **Access: Providing comprehensive depression care across the spectrum of clinical severity**: This theme explored methods to improve availability and accessibility of treatments to patients regardless of their condition's severity.
