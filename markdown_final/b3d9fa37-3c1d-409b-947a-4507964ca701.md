## Question

stat 3 mutation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about STAT3 mutations — what they are, how to interpret their biology and phenotypes, relevant diagnostics, oncologic implications, and treatment considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core STAT3 biology and signaling architecture to ground the clinical interpretation. Then, I should classify germline STAT3 variants into loss-of-function versus gain-of-function and map their phenotypes. Next, I will verify immunologic mechanisms and diagnostic frameworks. After that, I will examine oncologic implications of somatic STAT3 mutations. Finally, I need to evaluate treatment strategies tailored to mutation class and note pitfalls like mixed or confusing functional effects, while continuously checking each claim against the cited evidence.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental biology so that later clinical inferences are anchored correctly. STAT3 is a transcription factor downstream of many cytokines, classically IL-6 family signaling via JAK phosphorylation of STAT3 Y705, dimerization, nuclear translocation, and target gene transcription; this JAK–STAT module is pleiotropic and tightly regulated by positive and negative feedback, which is crucial to understand how mutations derail homeostasis.

> Hold on, I should verify the mutation taxonomy before assigning phenotypes. Germline dominant-negative STAT3 loss-of-function (LOF) variants cause autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES), whereas germline STAT3 gain-of-function (GOF) variants drive early-onset lymphoproliferation and multiorgan autoimmunity; mechanistically, LOF is usually dominant-negative against wild-type STAT3, while GOF increases transcriptional output through enhanced dimer stability, DNA binding, or nuclear trafficking [^116cEQYg] [^117WLbyB] [^116hDHX9].

> I will now examine the LOF clinical phenotype to ensure I capture the high-yield features. STAT3 LOF (AD-HIES) presents with recurrent staphylococcal skin and pulmonary infections, pneumatoceles or bronchiectasis, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, eczema, markedly elevated IgE, and characteristic connective tissue and skeletal findings such as retained primary teeth, scoliosis, hyperextensibility, and pathologic fractures, along with an increased risk of certain lymphomas in case series [^116cEQYg] [^113vbtca] [^113VS1dJ].

> Wait, let me verify the key immunologic defects in LOF because they explain the infections and atopy paradox. AD-HIES features profound TH17 deficiency that impairs antibacterial and antifungal mucosal defense, diminished T follicular helper cell generation that compromises germinal center help, and defects in CD8+ memory formation with impaired lytic programming; interestingly, despite very high IgE, immediate hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis are relatively diminished, aligning with altered mast cell degranulation signaling in STAT3 deficiency [^114zJHSL] [^114aDHeq] [^112gnMFx] [^112qnDe2].

> Next, I should review diagnostic approaches so I do not miss the practical steps. A modified NIH-HIES score greater than 30 supports suspicion for STAT3-LOF, but I need to remember this can underestimate risk in younger children; definitive diagnosis relies on STAT3 sequencing with functional validation when variants are uncertain, and rapid molecular assays can expedite targeted management and counseling [^116cEQYg] [^111N1W2i] [^115zgcvi].

> Now I will assess the GOF syndrome natural history with cohort-level data. STAT3 GOF classically manifests in early childhood with polyclonal lymphoproliferation, autoimmune cytopenias, multiorgan autoimmunity involving gut, endocrine, liver, skin, lung, and joints, growth failure, and frequent infections reflecting combined immunodeficiency components; in the largest cohort to date, median age at onset was 2.3 years with diagnosis often delayed to adolescence and overall survival about 88 percent [^117WLbyB]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially recalled a population prevalence of about 1 in 100,000 for GOF, but I should confirm because robust epidemiologic estimates are limited; some summaries suggest rarity on that order, yet precise prevalence remains uncertain, so I will qualify this as rare rather than definitive [^113vbtca] [^113mrds4].

> I need to check the GOF immunophenotype more granularly. Many patients demonstrate increased double-negative CD4−CD8− T cells, paradoxical features of combined cellular and humoral immune defects, and impaired Treg function despite normal counts; mechanistically, GOF drives oligoclonal accumulation of NKG2D+ effector CD8+ T cells with cytotoxic programs that contribute to autoimmune tissue injury in both human and murine models [^117WLbyB] [^116Xk1t8].

> Let me now connect genotype to function so therapeutic levers are clearer. Mutations in the SH2 domain often stabilize homodimers and enhance recruitment to phosphotyrosine sites, DNA-binding domain mutations can increase DNA affinity by altering charge, and coiled-coil domain changes affect nuclear import; recent biophysical work shows that GOF in the SH2 domain increases homodimer stability and DNA binding, while distinct GOF classes exhibit delayed dephosphorylation or heightened basal transcriptional activity [^116hDHX9] [^116hTBTw].

> Next, I should review somatic STAT3 mutations in malignancy because they intersect with autoimmunity. Somatic activating STAT3 mutations, frequently Y640F in the SH2 domain, occur in roughly one-third to one-half of T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia and in a subset of chronic NK lymphoproliferative disease; they correlate with cytopenias, splenomegaly, autoimmunity, and clonal complexity with multiple STAT3-mutant subclones that can evolve under therapy, and rare but biologically informative STAT3 mutations are also seen in myeloid neoplasms with adverse features [^1137Kdx2] [^114EgBmk] [^112rtJUG] [^112tkGtF].

> But wait, what if STAT3 activity is sometimes protective in cancer; I should verify that nuance. In KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma, loss of STAT3 can worsen tumorigenesis by unleashing NF-κB–IL-8–driven myeloid infiltration and angiogenesis, highlighting a tumor-suppressive axis in certain contexts and reminding me that generalized STAT3 inhibition in oncology is not universally favorable [^116L1Gxm] [^115YTbaq] [^114H3YbJ].

> I will now examine treatment strategies for STAT3 GOF and ensure the evidence aligns. JAK inhibitors such as ruxolitinib or tofacitinib produce dramatic clinical improvement across inflammatory, lymphoproliferative, and autoimmune features in the largest cohort, IL-6 receptor blockade with tocilizumab has case-level efficacy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been pursued in selected severe cases though with nontrivial risk and variable disease modification [^117WLbyB] [^1143p3YV].

> For STAT3 LOF (AD-HIES), I need to ensure management focuses on infection prevention and complication mitigation. Long-term anti-staphylococcal and anti-fungal prophylaxis, aggressive management of pulmonary infections to prevent structural lung damage, skin care for eczema, dental and orthopedic surveillance, and vaccination planning are cornerstones; transplantation has historically offered limited correction of extra-immune features, though emerging reports suggest selected benefits, so decisions must be individualized and expectation-managed [^113vbtca] [^117DCvEw].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic workflow for variants of uncertain significance because this is a frequent clinical bottleneck. Functional assays to confirm GOF or LOF behavior, ideally correlating phosphorylation kinetics, transcriptional reporter activity, and target gene induction, are essential for adjudicating VUS, and related pathway disorders such as dominant-negative IL6ST or biallelic ZNF341 deficiency should be considered when STAT3 sequencing is uninformative but the phenotype is suggestive [^111N1W2i] [^111a5eWS] [^112TGjAj] [^1139skz6].

> I should double-check for pitfalls where the tidy LOF-versus-GOF dichotomy breaks down. The R335W DNA-binding domain variant, initially reported in AD-HIES, can exhibit mixed behavior with predominantly GOF features in vitro and overlapping clinical phenotypes, and penetrance and expressivity among GOF families are variable, reinforcing the need for careful phenotyping and functional testing before committing to a mechanistic label [^113zMtW7] [^114NFcPB].

STAT3 mutations cause distinct clinical syndromes: **loss-of-function (LOF) mutations** drive autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) [^113mrds4] with recurrent staphylococcal and candidal infections, eczema, elevated IgE, and connective tissue abnormalities, while **gain-of-function (GOF) mutations** cause early-onset multiorgan autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, and cytopenias [^114TNdwi] [^1143p3YV]. LOF mutations impair **Th17 and Tfh differentiation**, reducing IL-17 and IL-21 and compromising mucosal and humoral immunity [^114zJHSL] [^114aDHeq] [^116cEQYg]. GOF mutations enhance STAT3 activity, promoting effector CD8+ T-cell expansion [^116Xk1t8] and autoimmunity. Diagnosis relies on **genetic testing and functional assays**; management includes antimicrobial prophylaxis and immunoglobulin for LOF, and JAK inhibitors or IL-6 blockade for GOF, with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation considered in severe cases [^116cEQYg] [^111N1W2i] [^113mrds4] [^117WLbyB].

## Molecular mechanisms of STAT3 mutations

STAT3 is a **transcription factor** activated by cytokines and growth factors via the JAK/STAT pathway; Y705 phosphorylation enables dimerization, nuclear translocation, and target gene transcription [^112rHLmg]. Mutations that disrupt this signaling cause disease [^115qeNDe].

---

### Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations

LOF mutations reduce **STAT3 activity**, impairing cytokine signaling and immune responses. Variants most often affect the DNA-binding (DBD) and SH2 domains, diminishing DNA binding, dimerization, and nuclear localization [^116hTBTw]. Functionally, they impair Th17 and Tfh differentiation, leading to reduced IL-17 and IL-21 and compromised mucosal and humoral immunity [^114zJHSL] [^114aDHeq] [^116cEQYg].

---

### Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations

GOF mutations increase **STAT3 activity**, enhancing transcription of genes governing proliferation, survival, and immune activation. Affected regions include the SH2, coiled-coil, and transactivation domains; these variants increase dimerization, nuclear import, and transcriptional activity [^112rHLmg] [^116hDHX9]. Consequences include expansion of effector CD8+ T cells and autoimmunity [^116Xk1t8].

---

## Clinical manifestations of STAT3 mutations

STAT3 mutations cause **distinct clinical syndromes**, depending on whether they are LOF or GOF [^113vbtca].

---

### Loss-of-function mutations: hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES)

- **Infections**: Recurrent staphylococcal and candidal infections [^116cEQYg], pneumonia, bronchiectasis [^113mrds4], and pneumatoceles [^116KDQ8z].
- **Dermatologic**: Eczema, eczema herpeticum, and skin abscesses [^113mrds4] [^117DCvEw] [^112qnDe2].
- **Immunologic**: Elevated IgE, eosinophilia [^113mrds4], impaired Th17 responses [^114zJHSL], and reduced memory T cells [^114JTFpV].
- **Connective tissue**: Hyperextensible joints, scoliosis, retained primary teeth, and osteoporosis [^113mrds4] [^113vbtca].

---

### Gain-of-function mutations: autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome

- **Autoimmunity**: Early-onset multiorgan autoimmunity (cytopenias, enteropathy, endocrinopathies, interstitial lung disease) [^117WLbyB] [^1143p3YV].
- **Lymphoproliferation**: Lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and increased double-negative T cells [^117WLbyB] [^1143p3YV].
- **Infections**: Susceptibility to bacterial, viral, and fungal infections [^117WLbyB] [^1143p3YV].
- **Growth**: Growth failure and short stature [^117WLbyB] [^1143p3YV].

---

## Diagnostic approaches

Diagnosis of STAT3 mutations combines **clinical evaluation, genetic testing, and functional assays**.

- **Clinical evaluation**: Identify characteristic features of HIES or autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome [^111N1W2i].
- **Genetic testing**: Sequence STAT3 to identify pathogenic variants [^116cEQYg] [^115zgcvi].
- **Functional assays**: Assess STAT3 phosphorylation, dimerization, nuclear localization, and transcriptional activity [^116hTBTw].

---

## Therapeutic strategies

Treatment depends on the **type of STAT3 mutation** and the clinical manifestations.

---

### Loss-of-function mutations (HIES)

Management includes **antimicrobial prophylaxis** to prevent recurrent infections and immunoglobulin replacement to support humoral immunity; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is considered in severe cases [^117DCvEw].

---

### Gain-of-function mutations (autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome)

Treatment combines immunosuppressive therapy to control autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation with targeted **JAK inhibitors** (ruxolitinib, tofacitinib) and IL-6 blockade (tocilizumab) [^117WLbyB]. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is reserved for severe, refractory cases.

---

STAT3 mutations cause distinct syndromes: LOF mutations lead to HIES with recurrent infections and connective tissue abnormalities, whereas GOF mutations cause autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndromes. Diagnosis relies on **genetic testing and functional assays**, and treatment includes antimicrobial prophylaxis, immunoglobulin replacement, immunosuppressive therapy, targeted therapies, and HSCT [^114TNdwi].

### Monogenic early-onset lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity: Natural history of STAT3 gain-of-function syndrome [^117WLbyB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

In 2014, germline signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 gain-of-function (GOF) mutations were first described to cause a novel multisystem disease of early-onset lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity.

- **Objective**: This pivotal cohort study defines the scope, natural history, treatment, and overall survival of a large global cohort of patients with pathogenic STAT3 GOF variants.

- **Methods**: We identified 191 patients from 33 countries with 72 unique mutations. Inclusion criteria included symptoms of immune dysregulation and a biochemically confirmed germline heterozygous GOF variant in STAT3.

- **Results**: Overall survival was 88%, with the median age at onset of symptoms being 2.3 years and median age at diagnosis being 12 years. Immune dysregulatory features were present in all patients: lymphoproliferation was the most common manifestation (73%); increased frequencies of double-negative (CD4-CD8-) T cells were found in 83% of patients tested. Autoimmune cytopenias were the second most common clinical manifestation (67%), followed by growth delay, enteropathy, skin disease, pulmonary disease, endocrinopathy, arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, neurologic disease, vasculopathy, renal disease, and malignancy. Infections were reported in 72% of the cohort. A cellular and humoral immunodeficiency was observed in 37% and 51% of patients, respectively. Clinical symptoms dramatically improved in patients treated with JAK inhibitors, while a variety of other immunomodulatory treatment modalities were less efficacious. Thus far, 23 patients have undergone bone marrow trans.

### Early-onset lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity caused by germline STAT3 gain-of-function mutations [^1143p3YV]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Germline loss-of-function mutations in the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) cause immunodeficiency, whereas somatic gain-of-function mutations in STAT3 are associated with large granular lymphocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and aplastic anemia. Recently, germline mutations in STAT3 have also been associated with autoimmune disease. Here, we report on 13 individuals from 10 families with lymphoproliferation and early-onset solid-organ autoimmunity associated with 9 different germline heterozygous mutations in STAT3.

Patients exhibited a variety of clinical features, with most having lymphadenopathy, autoimmune cytopenias, multiorgan autoimmunity (lung, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and/or endocrine dysfunction), infections, and short stature. Functional analyses demonstrate that these mutations confer a gain-of-function in STAT3, leading to secondary defects in STAT5 and STAT1 phosphorylation and the regulatory T-cell compartment.

Treatment targeting a cytokine pathway that signals through STAT3 led to clinical improvement in 1 patient, suggesting a potential therapeutic option for such patients. These results suggest that there is a broad range of autoimmunity caused by germline STAT3 gain-of-function mutations and that hematologic autoimmunity is a major component of this newly described disorder. Some patients for this study were enrolled in a trial registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00001350.

### Stat3 gain-of-function mutations connect leukemia with autoimmune disease by pathological NKG2D CD8 T cell dysregulation and accumulation [^116Xk1t8]. Immunity (2022). High credibility.

The association between cancer and autoimmune disease is unexplained, exemplified by T cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGL) where gain-of-function (GOF) somatic STAT3 mutations correlate with co-existing autoimmunity. To investigate whether these mutations are the cause or consequence of CD8+ T cell clonal expansions and autoimmunity, we analyzed patients and mice with germline STAT3 GOF mutations. STAT3 GOF mutations drove the accumulation of effector CD8+ T cell clones highly expressing NKG2D, the receptor for stress-induced MHC-class-I-related molecules. This subset also expressed genes for granzymes, perforin, interferon-γ, and Ccl5/Rantes and required NKG2D and the IL-15/IL-2 receptor IL2RB for maximal accumulation. Leukocyte-restricted STAT3 GOF was sufficient and CD8+ T cells were essential for lethal pathology in mice. These results demonstrate that STAT3 GOF mutations cause effector CD8+ T cell oligoclonal accumulation and that these rogue cells contribute to autoimmune pathology, supporting the hypothesis that somatic mutations in leukemia/lymphoma driver genes contribute to autoimmune disease.

### Evaluation of the role of antibody and T17-mediated responses to pneumococcal immunization and infection by use of a mouse model of autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome [^114zJHSL]. Infection and Immunity (2018). Low credibility.

Loss-of-function mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 gene (STAT3) result in autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES), a condition in which patients have debilitating infections, including frequent pneumococcal and staphylococcal pneumonias. STAT3 mutations cause defective adaptive TH17 cellular responses, an immune mechanism believed to be critical for clearance of pneumococcal colonization and diminished antibody responses.

Here we wished to evaluate the role of STAT3 in the clearance of pneumococcal carriage and immunity using mice with a STAT3 mutation recapitulating AD-HIES. We show here that naive AD-HIES mice have prolonged nasal carriage of pneumococcus compared to WT mice.

- **Immune response evaluation**: Mutant and wild-type mice were then immunized with a pneumococcal whole-cell vaccine (WCV) that provides TH17-mediated protection against pneumococcal colonization and antibody-mediated protection against pneumonia and sepsis. WCV-immunized AD-HIES mice made significantly less pneumococcus-specific interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and antibody than WT mice.

- **Protection assessment**: The WCV-elicited protection against colonization was abrogated in AD-HIES mice, but immunization with WCV still protected AD-HIES mice against aspiration pneumonia/sepsis.

Taken together, our results suggest that impaired clearance of nasopharyngeal carriage due to poor adaptive IL-17A responses may contribute to the increased rates of pneumococcal respiratory infection in AD-HIES patients.

### Functional STAT3 deficiency compromises the generation of human T follicular helper cells [^114aDHeq]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are critical for providing the necessary signals to induce differentiation of B cells into memory and antibody-secreting cells. Accordingly, it is important to identify the molecular requirements for Tfh cell development and function. We previously found that IL-12 mediates the differentiation of human CD4(+) T cells to the Tfh lineage because IL-12 induces naive human CD4(+) T cells to acquire expression of IL-21, BCL6, ICOS, and CXCR5, which typify Tfh cells.

We have now examined CD4(+) T cells from patients deficient in IL-12Rβ1, TYK2, STAT1, and STAT3 to further explore the pathways involved in human Tfh cell differentiation. Although STAT1 was dispensable, mutations in IL12RB1, TYK2, or STAT3 compromised IL-12-induced expression of IL-21 by human CD4(+) T cells. Defective expression of IL-21 by STAT3-deficient CD4(+) T cells resulted in diminished B-cell helper activity in vitro. Importantly, mutations in STAT3, but not IL12RB1 or TYK2, also reduced Tfh cell generation in vivo, evidenced by decreased circulating CD4(+)CXCR5(+) T cells. These results highlight the nonredundant role of STAT3 in human Tfh cell differentiation and suggest that defective Tfh cell development and/or function contributes to the humoral defects observed in STAT3-deficient patients.

### Functional validation of a novel STAT3 'variant of unknown significance' identifies a new case of STAT3 GOF syndrome and reveals broad immune cell defects [^113mrds4]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

The non-redundant role of STAT3 in cytokine-mediated development, differentiation, and function of human lymphocytes has been unequivocally demonstrated through the identification of rare patients carrying STAT3 germline heterozygous loss-of-function/dominant negative (LOF/DN) or gain-of-function (GOF) variants, which cause multisystem, life-threatening diseases. STAT3 LOF/DN variants are the most common genetic etiology of hyper-IgE syndrome, presenting early in life with respiratory infections such as those caused by Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species, resulting in pneumatoceles and/or bronchiectasis, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (Candida albicans), extremely high levels of serum IgE, atopic dermatitis, and eosinophilia. Affected individuals can also develop a spectrum of non-immunological manifestations such as bone fractures, craniosynostosis, hyper-extensibility, facial asymmetry, and retention of primary teeth.

Conversely, variants encoding a STAT3 GOF allele cause an early-onset and heterogeneous multisystemic disease — STAT3 GOF Syndrome — most commonly characterized by polyclonal lymphoproliferation, autoimmunity (cytopenias, enteropathy, endocrinopathies such as type 1 diabetes mellitus), infectious disease susceptibility (bacterial, viral, and fungal), skin disease (atopic dermatitis), interstitial lung disease, and growth failure. Thus, these rare inborn errors of immunity, affecting approximately 1 in 100,000 live births, highlight the critical importance of balanced STAT3 signaling in human immunity to maintain homeostasis and prevent infectious disease, autoimmunity, and exaggerated inflammation.

### Stat3 isoforms: Alternative fates in cancer [^114H3YbJ]. Cytokine (2019). Low credibility.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 is the main mediator of IL-6-type cytokine signaling and an important transcriptional regulator of cell proliferation, maturation, and survival. It has been described as a key player in cancer development and progression. However, under certain circumstances, STAT3 is also considered a potent tumor suppressor. This heterogeneity partially depends on its expression as different isoforms. Alternative splicing gives rise to two STAT3 isoforms, STAT3α and its truncated version STAT3β. Both isoforms are transcriptionally active and display distinct functions under physiological and pathological conditions. In fact, while STAT3α is widely described as an oncogene, STAT3β has gained attention as a potential tumor suppressor. This review provides a concise overview of the knowledge on STAT3 during tumorigenesis, with special emphasis on the unique and complex roles of its alternatively spliced isoforms.

### Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) mutations underlying autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome impair human CD8(+) T-cell memory formation and function [^112gnMFx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

The capacity of CD8(+) T cells to control infections and mediate antitumor immunity requires the development and survival of effector and memory cells. IL-21 has emerged as a potent inducer of CD8(+) T-cell effector function and memory development in mouse models of infectious disease. However, the role of IL-21 and associated signaling pathways in protective CD8(+) T-cell immunity in human subjects is unknown.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine which signaling pathways mediate the effects of IL-21 on human CD8(+) T cells and whether defects in these pathways contribute to disease pathogenesis in patients with primary immunodeficiencies caused by mutations in components of the IL-21 signaling cascade.

- **Methods**: Human primary immunodeficiencies resulting from monogenic mutations provide a unique opportunity to assess the requirement for particular molecules in regulating human lymphocyte function. Lymphocytes from patients with loss-of-function mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), STAT3, or IL-21 receptor (IL21R) were used to assess the respective roles of these genes in human CD8(+) T-cell differentiation in vivo and in vitro.

- **Results**: Mutations in STAT3 and IL21R, but not STAT1, led to a decrease in multiple memory CD8(+) T-cell subsets in vivo, indicating that STAT3 signaling, possibly downstream of IL-21R, regulates the memory cell pool. Furthermore, STAT3 was important for inducing the lytic machinery in IL-21-stimulated naive CD8(+) T cells. However, this defect was overcome by T-cell receptor engagement.

- **Conclusion**: The study underscores the significance of STAT3 and IL-21 pathways in regulating CD8(+) T-cell memory formation, with implications for understanding primary immunodeficiencies.

### Jaks and STATs from a clinical perspective: Loss-of-function mutations, gain-of-function mutations, and their multidimensional consequences [^1137Kdx2]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Since the connection between inflammation and tumor development, such as through inflammation-induced initiation of oncogenic transformation by recruiting immune cells, has become known, attention in tumor research has also focused on STAT3. STAT3 plays a major role in biological processes such as cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and angiogenesis. It has been shown that STAT3 overactivation in tumors (e.g. through a loss of negative regulatory mechanisms, excessive cytokine stimulation, or activation of positive feedback loops, and rarely STAT3 gain-of-function (GOF) mutations) is often associated with a worse prognosis and accelerated disease progression.

Somatic STAT3 GOF mutations can be detected in 30–40% of T-cell large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia and chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of natural killer cells (CLPD-NK). Both are phenotypically similar yet morphologically different subtypes that may cause a clonal expansion of the respective cell type (e.g. CD3+ large granular lymphocytes in T-LGL). The clinical phenotype of patients is defined by recurrent infections, anemia, neutropenia, splenomegaly, and autoimmune diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis. The mutation was consistently found in the SH2 domain, resulting in increased dimerization, activation of the STAT3 protein, and transcriptional activation. However, STAT3 has also been attributed tumor suppressor properties, as seen in studies with STAT3-deficient mouse models, suggesting that it may act as a negative regulator in certain tumor entities, such as prostate cancer.

### The constitutive activation of STAT3 gene and its mutations are at the crossroad between LGL leukemia and autoimmune disorders [^112L1EUE]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Low credibility.

A constitutive activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway has long been demonstrated in T-LGLL, and the discovery of STAT3 mutations has been instrumental in expanding our understanding of LGL leukemogenesis, as well as improving the classification of these disorders. Although not pathognomonic for T-LGLL and detectable in various hematological and non-hematological malignancies, STAT3 mutations serve as a useful molecular marker for T-LGLL management in an appropriate clinical context. These mutations are mostly located within the SRC homology (SH2) domain, as well as other regions of the protein, albeit more rarely, and they have been detected in approximately 50% of T-LGLL cases. They are recognized as the most common gain-of-function (GOF) genetic lesions identified at the time of writing in these patients. These mutations enhance STAT3 activation through the stabilization of protein dimerization and are now regarded as the biological hallmark of the disease, providing valuable information for the management of LGLL patients.

The assessment of the mutational landscape is now recommended for accurate characterization of LGLL patients. A strong correlation has been established between the presence of STAT3 mutations and neutropenia, the clinical hallmark of the disease. Among a series of 101 patients tested, 89% of those with STAT3 mutations were neutropenic, with a highly statistically significant p-value. Based on this observation, the impact of mutations has been evaluated on the overall survival and the presence of S.

### Inherited human ZNF341 deficiency [^115cz2Se]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2023). Low credibility.

At least 95% of the 150 pathogenic variants of STAT3 tested act through negative dominance, and there is no strong evidence that haploinsufficiency at the STAT3 locus causes Hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES). Furthermore, ZNF341 deficiency had only a modest impact on SOCS3 induction in the primary cell types tested. The 50% decrease in STAT3 protein levels in ZNF341-deficient cells is therefore not sufficient to explain the HIES phenotype. We sought a complementary mechanism that might explain the pathogenesis of ZNF341 deficiency.

Studies in mice have shown that, following stimulation with IL-6, STAT3 can bind to its own promoter, inducing the production of its own mRNA and protein in a tissue- and cell-specific manner, including in T cells. A study of a knock-in mouse model with a homozygous mutation of the Stat3-binding element (SBE) within the Stat3 promoter demonstrated that Stat3 autoinduction was required for the optimal induction of selected IL-6-dependent genes in specific organs, tissues, or cells. Kwon et al. showed that Stat3 protein induction upon IL-6 and T-cell receptor (TCR) costimulation was dependent on protein kinase C (PKC)-θ, and that stimulation with phorbol-myristate acetate (PMA), an agonist of PKC-θ, increased Stat3 protein levels. This PKC-θ-mediated Stat3 transcription relied on the activator protein 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways, through the binding of at least c-fos and p65 to the STAT3 promoter.

### Mutations in STAT3 and diagnostic guidelines for hyper-IgE syndrome [^116cEQYg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

The hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by infections of the lung and skin, elevated serum IgE, and involvement of the soft and bony tissues. Recently, HIES has been associated with heterozygous dominant-negative mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and severe reductions of T(H)17 cells.

- **Objective**: To determine whether there is a correlation between the genotype and the phenotype of patients with HIES, and to establish diagnostic criteria to distinguish between STAT3 mutated and STAT3 wild-type patients.

- **Methods**: We collected clinical data, determined T(H)17 cell numbers, and sequenced STAT3 in 100 patients with a strong clinical suspicion of HIES and serum IgE > 1000 IU/mL. We explored diagnostic criteria by using a machine-learning approach to identify which features best predict a STAT3 mutation.

- **Results**: In 64 patients, we identified 31 different STAT3 mutations, 18 of which were novel. These included mutations at splice sites and outside the previously implicated DNA-binding and Src homology 2 domains. A combination of 5 clinical features predicted STAT3 mutations with 85% accuracy. T(H)17 cells were profoundly reduced in patients harboring STAT3 mutations, whereas 10 of 13 patients without mutations had low serum IgE (> 1000 IU/mL), plus a weighted score of clinical features exceeding 30, based on a diagnostic algorithm.

### Distinct clinical phenotypes associated with JAK2V617F reflect differential STAT1 signaling [^115ER73h]. Cancer Cell (2010). Low credibility.

The JAK2V617F mutation is associated with distinct myeloproliferative neoplasms, including polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET), but it remains unclear how it generates disparate disorders. By comparing clonally-derived mutant and wild-type cells from individual patients, we demonstrate that the transcriptional consequences of JAK2V617F are subtle and that JAK2V617F-heterozygous erythroid cells from ET and PV patients exhibit differential interferon signaling and STAT1 phosphorylation. Increased STAT1 activity in normal CD34-positive progenitors produces an ET-like phenotype, whereas downregulation of STAT1 activity in JAK2V617F-heterozygous ET progenitors produces a PV-like phenotype. Our results illustrate the power of clonal analysis, indicate that the consequences of JAK2V617F reflect a balance between STAT5 and STAT1 activation, and are relevant for other neoplasms associated with signaling pathway mutations.

### Diffuse large B cell lymphoma in hyper-IgE syndrome due to STAT3 mutation [^113VS1dJ]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

The Job or hyper-immunoglobulinemia E syndrome is a primary immunodeficiency that is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. With the discovery of mutations in the STAT3 gene in the majority of autosomal dominant cases, it is now possible to make a molecular diagnosis of hyper-IgE syndrome. Both primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, including hyper-IgE syndrome, may predispose individuals to malignancies, especially lymphomas, mainly mature B cell lymphomas and classical Hodgkin lymphoma.

Here, we report a 48-year-old male with hyper-IgE syndrome who developed a primary parotid gland diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Analysis for STAT3 mutations demonstrated that the causal mutation of hyper-IgE syndrome, R382Q, arose de novo in the patient and was transmitted to three of his five children, all of whom are clinically affected. We review the literature regarding lymphoma in hyper-IgE syndrome and the possible etiologic relationship with STAT3 mutations.

### JAKs and STATs from a clinical perspective: Loss-of-function mutations, gain-of-function mutations, and their multidimensional consequences [^116hDHX9]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

The molecular and cellular phenotype of STAT3 mutations reveals that amino acid substitution in the DNA binding domain increases DNA binding affinity and enhances transactivation due to changes in the electrical charge of the STAT3 molecule. Mutations in the SH2 domain lead to increased sensitivity to cytokines and enhanced dimerization. Mutations in the coiled-coil domain affect subcellular localization of the STAT3 dimer and increase nuclear import. Increased phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) levels are occasionally detected in unstimulated cells, such as in STAT1 GOF mutations, though STAT3 expression levels are typically normal except for one case. The overactivity of STAT3 can be attributed to an increased intrinsic transcriptional activity of the STAT3 dimer rather than enhanced expression or phosphorylation, although delayed dephosphorylation has been observed.

In 2020, Jägle et al. examined 17 different STAT3 GOF variants concerning their molecular behavior and established correlations between the molecular response pattern and the clinical phenotype. They identified three distinct GOF groups. Group 1 is characterized by significantly increased basal transcriptional activity, increased DNA binding affinity, delayed dephosphorylation, and increased STAT3 phosphorylation after IL-6 stimulation. In this group, mutations were only located in the coiled-coil domain, which may lead to delayed dephosphorylation via more efficient receptor binding.

### Stat3 hyper-IgE syndrome-an update and unanswered questions [^111N1W2i]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

The NIH-HIES score is a critical tool in predicting the presence of a STAT3 mutation in patients with a serum IgE level greater than 1000 IU/ml. A modified NIH-HIES score greater than 30 indicates a high likelihood of this mutation. However, this score may underestimate the risk of STAT3-HIES in young children due to the progressive accumulation of complications with age. Genetic testing to identify variants in STAT3 remains the optimal diagnostic approach. It is important that any newly described variants have their deleterious effects validated functionally prior to attributing pathogenicity.

### Disruption of STAT3 signalling promotes KRAS-induced lung tumorigenesis [^116L1Gxm]. Nature Communications (2015). Low credibility.

STAT3 is considered to play an oncogenic role in several malignancies, including lung cancer; consequently, targeting STAT3 is currently proposed as a therapeutic intervention. Here, we demonstrate that STAT3 plays an unexpected tumor-suppressive role in KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma (AC). Indeed, lung tissue-specific inactivation of Stat3 in mice results in increased Kras G12D-driven AC initiation and malignant progression, leading to markedly reduced survival. Knockdown of STAT3 in xenografted human AC cells increases tumor growth. Clinically, low STAT3 expression levels correlate with poor survival and advanced malignancy in human lung AC patients with a smoking history, who are prone to KRAS mutations. Consistently, KRAS mutant lung tumors exhibit reduced STAT3 levels.

Mechanistically, we demonstrate that STAT3 controls NF-κB-induced IL-8 expression by sequestering NF-κB within the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting IL-8-mediated myeloid tumor infiltration and tumor vascularization, and hence tumor progression. These results elucidate a novel STAT3–NF-κB–IL-8 axis in KRAS mutant AC with therapeutic and prognostic relevance.

### A critical role for STAT3 transcription factor signaling in the development and maintenance of human T cell memory [^114JTFpV]. Immunity (2011). Low credibility.

STAT3 transcription factor signaling in specific T helper cell differentiation has been well described, although the broader roles for STAT3 in lymphocyte memory are less clear. Patients with autosomal-dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) carry dominant-negative STAT3 mutations and are susceptible to a variety of bacterial and fungal infections. We found that AD-HIES patients have a cell-intrinsic defect in the number of central memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells compared to healthy controls. Naive T cells from AD-HIES patients had lower expression of memory-related transcription factors BCL6 and SOCS3, a primary proliferation defect, and they failed to acquire central memory-like surface phenotypes in vitro. AD-HIES patients showed a decreased ability to control varicella zoster virus (VZV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency, and T cell memory to both of these viruses was compromised. These data point to a specific role for STAT3 in human central memory T cell formation and in control of certain chronic viruses.

### A challenging differential diagnosis in a patient with autosomal dominant STAT3 deficiency [^113MUKCX]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Low credibility.

Autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) is a primary immunodeficiency caused by loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) gene. In these patients, performing a correct differential diagnosis of pulmonary infections is difficult and challenging, as they usually have atypical presentations. However, establishing a correct diagnostic and therapeutic approach is essential, as pulmonary complications are responsible for high morbidity and mortality rates in these patients. We report the case of a teenage girl with AD-HIES and respiratory symptoms and fever in whom performing a correct differential diagnosis was challenging.

### Inborn errors of human JAKs and STATs [^114zd6da]. Immunity (2012). Low credibility.

Inborn errors of the genes encoding two of the four human JAKs (JAK3 and TYK2) and three of the six human STATs (STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5B) have been described. This review highlights the disorders arising from mutations in these five genes, emphasizing how the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of these conditions has been clarified by the discovery of inborn errors of cytokines, hormones, and their receptors, including those interacting with JAKs and STATs.

The phenotypic similarities between mice and humans lacking individual JAK-STAT components suggest that the functions of JAKs and STATs are largely conserved in mammals. However, a wide array of phenotypic differences has emerged between mice and humans carrying biallelic null alleles of JAK3, TYK2, STAT1, or STAT5B. Furthermore, the high degree of allelic heterogeneity at the human JAK3, TYK2, STAT1, and STAT3 loci has revealed highly diverse immunological and clinical phenotypes that had not been anticipated.

The transcription factor STAT3 drives the expression of genes promoting cellular proliferation, survival, and pluripotency. The description of STAT3 mutations and their clinical correlates in myeloid neoplasms, such as acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, raises new insights into both the pathogenesis and the targeted therapy of these diseases.

### STAT3-confusion-of-function: Beyond the loss and gain dualism [^113zMtW7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Germline mutations of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) are responsible for two distinct human diseases: autosomal-dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) caused by STAT3 loss-of-function mutations and STAT3 gain-of-function disease. So far, these entities have been regarded as antithetic, with AD-HIES mainly associated with characteristic infections and a connective tissue phenotype, while STAT3 gain-of-function is characterized by lymphoproliferation and poly-autoimmunity. The R335W substitution in the DNA-binding domain of STAT3 was initially described in two patients with typical AD-HIES, but paradoxically, recent functional analysis demonstrated a gain-of-function effect of this variant.

- **Objectives**: A patient with Sjögren syndrome and features of AD-HIES with this mutation is described and the molecular consequences are further characterized.

- **Methods**: This study provides a clinical and immunological description of the patient. STAT phosphorylation in primary patient cells was studied, and A4 cells transfected with the patient allele were used to study phosphorylation kinetics, transcriptional activity, and target-gene induction.

- **Results**: The hybrid clinical features of the patient were associated with normal TH17 cells. Enhanced and prolonged STAT3 phosphorylation, an increased STAT3-driven luciferase reporter activity upon IL-6 stimulation, but reduced IL-6-induced SOCS3 production were all observed.

- **Conclusions**: The germline R335W-STAT3 variant displays a mixed behavior in vitro that mainly shows gain-of-function, but also some loss-of-function characteristics.

### The S52F FOXF1 mutation inhibits STAT3 signaling and causes alveolar capillary dysplasia [^114UeYjb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACDMPV) is a lethal congenital disorder causing respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension shortly after birth. There are no effective treatments for ACDMPV other than lung transplant, and new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Although ACDMPV is linked to mutations in the FOXF1 gene, the molecular mechanisms through which FOXF1 mutations cause ACDMPV are unknown.

- **Objectives**: To identify molecular mechanisms by which S52F FOXF1 mutations cause ACDMPV.
- **Methods**: We generated a clinically relevant mouse model of ACDMPV by introducing the S52F FOXF1 mutation into the mouse Foxf1 gene locus using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Immunohistochemistry, whole-lung imaging, and biochemical methods were used to examine the vasculature in Foxf1 WT/S52F lungs and identify molecular mechanisms regulated by FOXF1.
- **Measurements and main results**: FOXF1 mutations were identified in 28 subjects with ACDMPV. Foxf1 WT/S52F knock-in mice recapitulated histopathologic findings in ACDMPV infants. The S52F FOXF1 mutation disrupted STAT3-FOXF1 protein-protein interactions and inhibited the transcription of Stat3, a critical transcriptional regulator of angiogenesis. STAT3 signaling and endothelial proliferation were reduced in Foxf1 WT/S52F mice and human ACDMPV lungs. The S52F FOXF1 mutant protein did not bind chromatin and was transcriptionally inactive. Furthermore, we have developed a novel formulation of highly efficient nanoparticles and demonstrated that nanoparticle delivery of STAT3 cDNA into the neonatal circulation restores…

### The analysis of clonal diversity and therapy responses using STAT3 mutations as a molecular marker in large granular lymphocytic leukemia [^114EgBmk]. Haematologica (2015). Low credibility.

T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia and chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of natural killer cells are intriguing entities between benign and malignant lymphoproliferation. The molecular pathogenesis has partly been uncovered by the recent discovery of somatic activating STAT3 and STAT5b mutations. Here, we show that 43% (75/174) of patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia and 18% (7/39) with chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of natural killer cells harbor STAT3 mutations when analyzed by quantitative deep amplicon sequencing. Surprisingly, 17% of the STAT3-mutated patients carried multiple STAT3 mutations, which were located in different lymphocyte clones.

The size of the mutated clone correlated well with the degree of clonal expansion of the T-cell repertoire analyzed by T-cell receptor beta chain deep sequencing. The analysis of sequential samples suggests that immunosuppressive therapy is not able to reduce the level of the mutated clone in most cases, thus warranting the search for novel targeted therapies. Our findings imply that the clonal landscape of large granular lymphocytic leukemia is more complex than considered before, and a substantial number of patients have multiple lymphocyte subclones harboring different STAT3 mutations, thus mimicking the situation in acute leukemia.

### Human disease phenotypes associated with loss and gain of function mutations in STAT2: Viral susceptibility and type I interferonopathy [^111aZeTr]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

STAT2 structure and interactions: In common with other members of the STAT family, STAT2 has six functional domains — the N-terminal domain (NTD), coiled-coil domain (CCD), DNA-binding domain (DBD), linker domain (LD), Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and the C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD; Fig. 2).

- **Model of STAT2✱**: Demonstrating domains, disease-causing variants in STAT2 (in red), and known post-translational modifications (green = negative regulation of transcriptional activity, orange = positive regulation of transcriptional activity).

The activity of STAT2 is regulated by post-translational modification. The most well-known is the phosphorylation of Y690, which enhances its transcriptional activity. Mutagenesis studies have identified that phosphorylation of additional residues (S287, T387, S734) on STAT2 negatively regulates its transcriptional activity. STAT2 T387 is constitutively phosphorylated, negatively regulating ISGF3 binding to DNA; constitutive phosphorylation at T403 maintains STAT2 dimerization with STAT1. By contrast, IFN-mediated acetylation of STAT2 K390 promotes transcription.

Unphosphorylated STAT2 shuttles continuously between the cytosol and the nucleus, but owing to a strong nuclear export signal (NES), it is predominantly cytosolic. Here, STAT2 associates with various proteins including IRF9, STAT1, and IFNAR2. The interactions with STAT1 and IRF9 are mediated by the NTD and CCD of STAT2 respectively. Interestingly, although STAT2:IRF9 or STAT1:STAT2 complexes can be readily identified, there is limited evidence that STAT1 and IRF9.

### STAT3 in cancer: A double edged sword [^111xomjt]. Cytokine (2017). Low credibility.

The transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 is activated downstream of cytokines, growth factors, and oncogenes to mediate their functions under both physiological and pathological conditions. Aberrant or unrestrained STAT3 activity is detected in a wide variety of tumors, driving multiple pro-oncogenic functions. Therefore, STAT3 is widely considered an oncogene and is the object of intense translational studies. A distinctive feature of this factor is its ability to elicit different and sometimes contrasting effects under various conditions.

STAT3 activities have been shown to be either pro-oncogenic or tumor-suppressive according to the tumor etiology and mutational landscape, suggesting that the molecular bases underlying its functions are still incompletely understood. We discuss some properties that may explain STAT3's heterogeneous functions, particularly how post-translational modifications contribute to shaping its sub-cellular localization and activities. Additionally, we examine the cross talk between these activities and cell metabolic conditions, and finally, how its functions can control the behavior of both tumor and tumor microenvironment cell populations.

### Novel germline STAT3 gain-of-function mutation causes autoimmune diseases and severe growth failure [^117K83zV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2024). Low credibility.

Proline is an amino acid that confers unique conformational constraints on the peptide chain because the side chain is cyclized back onto the backbone amide position. Replacing Pro715 with another amino acid may significantly impact the structure of the transactivation domain (TAD). STAT3 TAD contributes not only to homodimerization but also to transactivation, similar to other TADs that interact with components of the preinitiation complex to enhance recruitment and stabilization of the general factors at target promoters. Therefore, STAT3 variants with TAD mutations may have alterations in the transactivation of the target gene.

We speculate that p.P715L and probably p.P715Q may be more efficient in recruiting the transcriptional machinery. In contrast, four new variants of STAT3 (p.P715R, p.P715S, p.P715T, and p.P715A) that showed enhanced nuclear accumulation and DNA-binding activities may have decreased efficiency in transcriptional machinery recruitment, resulting in enhanced or unaltered transcriptional activities, respectively, in the reporter assay. Thus, mutations of Pro715 in STAT3 may have various effects on the function of TAD, possibly resulting in altered dimerization, nuclear accumulation, and/or transcription. We presume that the final transcriptional activities of STAT3 variants are determined by the sum of the efficiencies of these multiple processes. Further investigation is needed to determine the mechanism of altered functions due to mutations at Pro715 in STAT3.

In our case, whole-exome sequencing revealed a STAT3 gain-of-function (GOF) mutation, opening up new treatment options. Early diagnosis based on this information can potentially lead to more effective management strategies for affected individuals.

### Disruption of STAT3 signalling promotes KRAS-induced lung tumorigenesis [^115xNtL6]. Nature Communications (2015). Low credibility.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. In lung adenocarcinomas (ACs), the most frequent genetic alterations are missense mutations and amplifications of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), found in about 30% and 20% of all Caucasian cases, respectively. Although several targeted anti-EGFR therapies are effective in patients with EGFR mutations, oncogenic KRAS is still considered an undruggable target. To devise additional treatment strategies, research has shifted towards KRAS-cooperating and downstream signalling pathways.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a crucial transcription factor believed to cooperate with rat sarcoma viral oncogene (RAS) mutations during tumorigenesis. STAT3 is activated by several cytokines and growth factors, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), oncostatin-M (OSM), and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Upon ligand binding to its cognate receptor, STAT3 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated, forming homodimers or heterodimers, which then translocate into the nucleus to induce transcription of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, tumour invasion, and metastasis.

- **Diverse roles of STAT3**: Depending on the oncogenic driver mutation or cell type, STAT3 has been reported to exhibit either pro-oncogenic or tumour-suppressive roles in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, STAT3 activation was observed in 54% of lung AC patient samples and human lung cancer cell lines.

### Type 1 diabetes in STAT protein family mutations: Regulating the Th17/Treg equilibrium and beyond [^116XpmEn]. Diabetes (2019). Low credibility.

Improvements in immunological, molecular, and genetic technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, have led to an exponential increase in diagnosed monogenic immune dysregulatory syndromes, where type 1 diabetes (T1D) forms part of the autoimmune manifestations. Here, we reviewed mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein family — specifically, gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in STAT1 and STAT3, as well as STAT5b deficiency — that show a strong association with T1D susceptibility.

The equilibrium of T-helper 17 (Th17) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) is often altered in patients affected by STAT GOF mutations.

- **Th17 and Tregs**: The increased number of Th17 cells and the concomitant decrease in Treg cells may explain T1D in STAT3 GOF patients, while the reduced number of Th17 cells found in those with STAT1 GOF mutations adds a new level of complexity to the understanding of Th17's role in the pathogenesis of T1D.

We describe the possible mechanisms through which STAT3 and STAT1 GOF mutations may perturb the fate and function of Th17 and Tregs, and explore how this may lead to the development of T1D. We propose that studying monogenic diseases, particularly STAT mutations, may not only improve our understanding of the human immune system's function but also shed light on the pathogenic mechanisms of T1D and the genetic variants that confer predisposition to the disease.

### Rapid molecular analysis of the STAT3 gene in Job syndrome of hyper-IgE and recurrent infectious diseases [^115zgcvi]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2010). Low credibility.

With the recent discovery of mutations in the STAT3 gene in the majority of patients with classic Hyper-IgE syndrome, it is now possible to make a molecular diagnosis in most of these cases. We have developed a PCR-based high-resolution DNA-melting assay to scan selected exons of the STAT3 gene for mutations responsible for Hyper-IgE syndrome, which is then followed by targeted sequencing. We scanned for mutations in 10 unrelated pedigrees, which include 16 patients with classic Hyper-IgE syndrome. These pedigrees include both sporadic and familial cases and their relatives, and we have found STAT3 mutations in all affected individuals. High-resolution melting analysis allows a single-day turnaround time for mutation scanning and targeted sequencing of the STAT3 gene, which will greatly facilitate the rapid diagnosis of Hyper-IgE syndrome, allowing prompt and appropriate therapy, prophylaxis, improved clinical outcome, and accurate genetic counseling.

### The ups and downs of STAT3 function: Too much, too little and human immune dysregulation [^113vbtca]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2023). High credibility.

The STAT3 story has almost 30 years of evolving history. First identified in 1994 as a pro-inflammatory transcription factor, Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) has continued to be revealed as a quintessential pleiotropic signalling module spanning fields including infectious diseases, autoimmunity, vaccine responses, metabolism, and malignancy. In 2007, germline heterozygous dominant-negative loss-of-function variants in STAT3 were discovered as the most common cause for a triad of eczematoid dermatitis with reSkin and pulmonary infections, first described in 1966. This finding established that STAT3 plays a critical non-redundant role in immunity against some pathogens, as well as in the connective tissue, dental, and musculoskeletal systems. Several years later, in 2014, heterozygous activating gain-of-function germline STAT3 variants were found to be causal for cases of early-onset multiorgan autoimmunity, thereby underpinning the notion that STAT3 function needed to be regulated to maintain immune homeostasis.

As we and others continue to interrogate biochemical and cellular perturbations due to inborn errors in STAT3, we will review our understanding of STAT3 function, mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, and future directions in this dynamic field.

### Dystrophy-associated caveolin-3 mutations reveal that caveolae couple IL6/STAT3 signaling with mechanosensing in human muscle cells [^113ocXr8]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

Caveolae are cup-shaped plasma membrane invaginations that were first observed in the 1950s by Palade and Yamada on electron micrographs from vascular and gallbladder tissues. Caveolae present a specific protein signature involving two main families of proteins: caveolins (caveolin-1, -2, and -3) and cavins (cavin-1, -2, -3, and -4). Caveolins and cavins are expressed in almost every cell type, except for caveolin-3 (Cav3) and cavin-4, whose expression is restricted to smooth and striated muscle cells. Cav3, like Cav1 in non-muscle cells, is necessary for the formation of caveolae at the plasma membrane of muscle cells.

Caveolae have long been associated with several important cellular functions, including endocytosis, lipid metabolism, and cell signaling, albeit with several persistent controversies. More recently, a new function of caveolae was established as mechanosensors that play an essential role in cell mechanoprotection both in vitro and in vivo. Mutations or abnormal expression of caveolae components have been associated with lipodystrophy, vascular dysfunction, cancer, and muscle disorders. The molecular mechanisms underlying caveolin-associated diseases are still poorly understood.

In this study, we explored the mechanical role of caveolae in human muscle cells and their possible deregulation in caveolinopathies, a family of muscle genetic disorders involving mutations in the CAV3 gene. These diseases affect both cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues and share common characteristics, including mild muscle weakness and high levels of serum creatine kinase.

### Inherited human ZNF341 deficiency [^1139skz6]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Typical hyper-IgE syndromes (HIES) are caused by autosomal-dominant-negative (DN) variants of STAT3 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3) or IL6ST (Interleukin 6 Cytokine Family Signal Transducer), biallelic partial loss-of-function (LOF) variants of IL6ST, or biallelic complete LOF variants of ZNF341 (Zinc Finger Protein 341). Including the two new cases described in this review, only 20 patients with autosomal-recessive (AR) ZNF341 deficiency have ever been reported.

Patients with AR ZNF341 deficiency have clinical and immunological phenotypes resembling those of patients with autosomal-dominant STAT3 deficiency, but with a usually milder clinical presentation and lower NK (Natural Killer) cell counts. ZNF341-deficient cells have 50% the normal level of STAT3 in the resting state. However, as there is no clear evidence that STAT3 haploinsufficiency causes HIES, this decrease alone is probably insufficient to explain the HIES phenotype observed in the ZNF341-deficient patients. The combination of decreased basal expression level and impaired autoinduction of STAT3 observed in ZNF341-deficient lymphocytes is considered a more likely pathophysiological mechanism.

We review here what is currently known about the ZNF341 gene and ZNF341 deficiency, and briefly discuss possible roles for this protein in addition to its control of STAT3 activity.

### Clinical and immunological heterogeneity in Japanese patients with gain-of-function variants in STAT3 [^114NFcPB]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate germline loss-of-function variants in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene, which are known to result in autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome. In contrast, somatic gain-of-function (GOF) variants in STAT3 are associated with certain malignancies. Additionally, germline GOF variants in STAT3 are linked to disorders involving autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation. This study describes five Japanese families with germline GOF variants in STAT3, including three novel variants, and presents the clinical and immunological characteristics of these patients.

Eight patients from five families were enrolled. We performed genetic and immunological analyses and collected the associated clinical information. Through whole-exome sequencing and target gene sequencing, we identified five heterozygous variants in STAT3. Two of these variants (E286G and T716M) were previously reported, while three variants (K348E, E415G, and G618A) were novel. A STAT3 reporter assay indicated that all of the variants were GOF. Despite this, the immunological and clinical characteristics among the patients varied highly.

In conclusion, patients with STAT3 GOF variants exhibited clinical and immunological heterogeneity with incomplete penetrance.

### Diminished allergic disease in patients with STAT3 mutations reveals a role for STAT3 signaling in mast cell degranulation [^112qnDe2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Severe atopic conditions associated with elevated serum IgE are heterogeneous with few known causes. Nearly every patient with autosomal-dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) due to signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) mutations has a history of eczematous dermatitis and elevated IgE; however, clinical atopy has never been systematically studied.

- **Objective**: Understanding of genetic determinants of allergic disease may lead to novel therapies in controlling allergic disease.

- **Methods**: We conducted clinical evaluation of the rates of food allergies and anaphylaxis in patients with AD-HIES, a cohort of patients with no STAT3 mutation but with similar histories of elevated IgE and atopic dermatitis, and healthy volunteers with no history of atopy. Morphine skin prick testing, ImmunoCAP assays for allergen-specific IgE, and basophil activation were measured. A model of systemic anaphylaxis was studied in transgenic mice carrying an AD-HIES mutation. STAT3 was silenced in LAD2 and primary human mast cells to study the role of STAT3 in signaling and degranulation after IgE cross-linking.

- **Results**: Food allergies and anaphylaxis were markedly diminished in patients with AD-HIES compared with a cohort of patients with no STAT3 mutation but with similar histories of elevated IgE and atopic dermatitis. Morphine skin prick testing and basophil activation were diminished in patients with AD-HIES, whereas mice carrying an AD-HIES mutation were hyporesponsive to systemic anaphylaxis models. Rapid mast cell STAT3 serine727 phosphorylation was noted after.

### Integrated clinical genotype-phenotype characteristics of STAT3-mutated myeloid neoplasms [^112tkGtF]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Low credibility.

STAT3 is a key transcription factor that mediates cancer progression through phosphorylation or gain-of-function mutations. STAT3 activation in myeloid neoplasms (MN) is primarily mediated through phosphorylation, and STAT3 mutation has only rarely been reported in MNs.

- **Experimental design**: We assessed the clinicopathologic and molecular genetic features of 32 STAT3-mutated MNs.

- **Results**: The frequency of STAT3 mutation in MNs was less than 0.5%. Twenty (62.5%) cases were classified as acute myeloid leukemia, 7 (21.9%) as myelodysplastic syndrome, and 5 (15.6%) as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, but none as myeloproliferative neoplasms. STAT3 mutations occurred at initial diagnosis in 22 (88%) cases or at relapse or upon leukemic transformation. Clonal hierarchy analysis revealed that STAT3 mutations represented the dominant clone in 30% of acute myeloid leukemia cases but were subclonal in myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Most were missense mutations located at the SH2 domain, with Y640F being the most common. STAT3 mutation was accompanied by coexisting mutations in all cases, most frequently SRSF2, TET2, ASXL1, and SETBP1. STAT3 mutations were usually associated with morphologic dysplasia, increased blasts, and monosomy 7/del7q. With a median follow-up of 24.5 months, 21 patients died, 6 had persistent disease, and 5 achieved complete remission after stem cell transplantation.

- **Conclusions**: STAT3 mutation is present in various MNs but not in myeloproliferative neoplasms. It is often an early event or occurs upon leukemic transformation.

### Transcriptomic landscape of CD8+ and CD4+ T-LGL leukemia revealed the distinct impact of STAT3 and STAT5B activating mutations [^116L3ATv]. Leukemia (2025). High credibility.

The biological basis of the high clinical heterogeneity of T-LGL leukemia (T-LGLL) is not completely understood, and effective therapies for this disease are lacking. Through RNA sequencing of purified T-LGLs, we reveal gene expression profiles and pathway dysregulations in the major patient subgroups. These are defined by CD8+ or CD4+ phenotype and STAT3/STAT5B mutational status. Overall, T-LGLL patients exhibited a marked transcriptome dysregulation compared to controls. This was more pronounced in the most symptomatic CD8+STAT3-mutated patients, who emerged as a distinct biological entity, separate from the other disease subgroups.

Particularly, CD8+STAT3-mutated cases displayed extensive down-regulation of genes, ultimately resulting in the de-repression of proliferation and cell cycle pathways. Among genes up-regulated in CD8+STAT3-mutated cases, we found VCAM1, the transcriptional repressor EZH2, and the p53-regulator MDM2 proto-oncogene, as well as the leukemogenesis-associated PVT1 up-regulation. This represents the first report of long non-coding RNA alterations in leukemic T-LGLs. The impact of STAT5B mutations on T-LGLs transcriptome was more limited, and the overexpression of the PIM1 serine/threonine kinase proto-oncogene was identified as one of the most relevant features of STAT5B-mutated CD4+ T-LGLL.

This study significantly advances our understanding of T-LGLL pathogenesis, uncovering new oncogenic mechanisms within the distinct molecular subtypes of the disease.

### Stat3 hyper-IgE syndrome-an update and unanswered questions [^117DCvEw]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES) due to dominant-negative (DN) mutations in signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3-HIES), previously Job's syndrome, affects fewer than 1 per million population. The JAK/STAT family of signal transducers comprises four Janus kinases (JAKs) and seven STATs, collectively transducing signals from over 50 cytokines through transmembrane receptor binding and sequential phosphorylation of a JAK, then a STAT, allowing dimerization and nuclear translocation. The numerous signals transduced through these pathways mean that deleterious mutations cause diverse pathology, including severe combined immunodeficiency, malignancy, autoimmunity, and myeloproliferation.

Ligands transducing through STAT3 include IL-6, IL-10, IL-11, IL-21, IL-22, and IL-23; aberrant transduction of these pathways, coupled with STAT3's ubiquitous expression, explains the multisystem manifestations of this syndrome, including dermatitis, pulmonary disease, vasculopathy, and skeletal and connective tissue abnormalities. Management currently centers on the prevention and treatment of infections arising from the immune deficit, which classically result from Staphylococcus aureus and Candida. Results from correcting the molecular defect in hematopoietic cells were initially discouraging; recent data, while limited, suggest that stem cell transplantation may ameliorate aspects of the syndrome.

In this review, we present an update on recent advances in the understanding of STAT3 biology and summarize the immune and extra-immune phenotypes of STAT3-HIES.

### Functional validation of a novel STAT3 'variant of unknown significance' identifies a new case of STAT3 GOF syndrome and reveals broad immune cell defects [^111a5eWS]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Our study validated a novel STAT3 VUS in a patient with a lengthy clinical history, using appropriate in silico, in vitro, and ex vivo experimental tools in line with ACMG guidelines. We performed deep immunophenotyping of five STAT3 GOF patients to investigate the cellular mechanisms of lymphocyte dysregulation responsible for disease pathogenesis. These observations serve to improve clinical management and assist validation of novel STAT3 VUS in the future.

### Disruption of STAT3 signalling promotes KRAS-induced lung tumorigenesis [^115YTbaq]. Nature Communications (2015). Low credibility.

STAT3 is considered to play an oncogenic role in several malignancies, including lung cancer; consequently, targeting STAT3 is currently proposed as a therapeutic intervention. Here, we demonstrate that STAT3 plays an unexpected tumour-suppressive role in KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma (AC). Indeed, lung tissue-specific inactivation of Stat3 in mice results in increased Kras(G12D)-driven AC initiation and malignant progression, leading to markedly reduced survival. Knockdown of STAT3 in xenografted human AC cells increases tumour growth. Clinically, low STAT3 expression levels correlate with poor survival and advanced malignancy in human lung AC patients with a smoking history, who are prone to KRAS mutations. Consistently, KRAS mutant lung tumours exhibit reduced STAT3 levels.

Mechanistically, we demonstrate that STAT3 controls NF-κB-induced IL-8 expression by sequestering NF-κB within the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting IL-8-mediated myeloid tumour infiltration and tumour vascularization, and hence tumour progression. These results elucidate a novel STAT3-NF-κB-IL-8 axis in KRAS mutant AC with therapeutic and prognostic relevance.

### Sbno2 is a critical mediator of STAT3-driven hematological malignancies [^114Z9xNc]. Blood (2023).

Different STAT3 mutations deregulate hundreds of genes in patient-derived T-LGLL cells and in STAT3 Y640F murine hematopoietic progenitor cells. The overlap between these data sets is small but identifies a hardwired set of commonly deregulated genes. It is conceivable that some features of STAT3-mutated disease are not recapitulated in murine cells in vitro. Differences between the human disease and the murine model may be attributed to the lack of microenvironment in the murine system and/or individual mutations in cells from human patients. In addition, it is worth noting that we covered a range of different SH2 domain mutations in our human T-LGLL data set, whereas we restricted our analysis to STAT3 Y640F in our murine models. The confirmation of our findings in samples from patients with NK-leukemia or T-NHL that bear different STAT3 mutations verifies the importance of the STAT3-SBNO2 axis for a broad range of patients with mutated STAT3. In addition, we currently cannot exclude that the different STAT3 mutations in combination with individual patient–dependent gene alterations lead to distinct target gene patterns.

The stringent approach used enabled us to identify a core of 9 direct transcriptional targets: Jak3, Notch1, Bcl6, Tnfaip2, Uap1l1, Sbno2, Bcl3, Cic, and Socs3, which are preferentially occupied by mutant STAT3 and overexpressed in murine cell lines. The high STAT3 activity in STAT3 Y640F-transformed cells resembles an IL-6–induced activation that boosts the expression of STAT3 targets including Socs3, Notch1, or Bcl3. These genes have been associated with STAT3 mutations and the development of hematological malignancies.

### JAKs and STATs from a clinical perspective: Loss-of-function mutations, gain-of-function mutations, and their multidimensional consequences [^114TNdwi]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Among all seven STAT molecules, STAT3 is a key transcription factor for the immune system. For example, STAT3 is crucial for the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into TH17 helper cells. These TH17 cells contribute significantly to the recruitment of effector cells to sites of inflammation caused by bacterial and fungal pathogens. By activating neutrophil granulocytes, this cell group enables effective control of bacteria and fungi in healthy individuals.

Heterozygous germline mutations may occur in STAT3, impairing the function of the gene product in different biochemical ways. The resulting molecules cause loss-of-function of the JAK/STAT3 pathway, almost always by exerting a dominant-negative effect on functional STAT3 monomers and sequestering them into defective STAT WT:STAT mut dimers.

STAT3 mediates cytokine signaling responses in development and the immune system. For example:

- **Interleukins**: IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-17, IL-19, IL-20, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23
- **Others**: leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM)
- **Interferons**: interferon-α (IFN-α), IFN-β, IFN-γ

In many ways, the transcription factor thereby maintains an immunological balance between inflammation and immunodeficiency.

### STAT3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and STAT3 mutations associated with hyper-IgE syndrome are not responsible for increased serum IgE serum levels in asthma families [^111eh7QA]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Mutations in STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) have recently been found to cause hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES), a rare immunodeficiency syndrome with complex somatic features. We investigated whether STAT3 mutations or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within STAT3 may be responsible for increased IgE levels in asthmatic children. DNA samples from 918 individuals across 217 core families were genotyped through MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. SNPs were selected based on previous reports, functional relevance, and haplotype-tagging capacity.

In 24 assays, including the recently described HIES mutations, no variant was detected. In an additional 27 SNP assays, no association was found between any STAT3 variant and asthma, allergic rhinitis, or eczema. Furthermore, neither total and specific IgE nor eosinophil count, as well as lung function parameters, showed any significant association. Upon combining high eosinophil counts and elevated total IgE levels to resemble an HIES-like trait, four SNPs in the 5'-UTR of STAT3 were slightly overtransmitted. A minor fraction of asthmatic children may have an alternate STAT3 promoter architecture influencing the upregulation of IgE and eosinophils. However, an overall effect of STAT3 mutations on serum IgE in asthmatic children is unlikely.

### A step toward treating a lethal neonatal lung disease. STAT3 and alveolar capillary dysplasia [^114j4aa7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Although ACDMPV is a rare disease, with the recognition of the causative role of FOXF1 mutations and deletions, clinical genetic testing is now routinely available, allowing for noninvasive diagnosis. As a result, the number of identified cases has increased dramatically in recent years, as exemplified by the additional 28 cases included in the report. Could delivery of STAT3 complementary DNA using nanoparticles, which are being used in clinical trials for human malignancies, be used to treat human infants with ACDMPV? There are several important potential limitations and barriers to this approach.

- **Potential limitations**: It is not clear how many other FOXF1 mutations disrupt interactions with STAT3 and are associated with decreased STAT3 signaling, as the authors' data with respect to several other mutations indicated that they did not interfere with FOXF1–STAT3 interactions. Interestingly, decreased phosphorylated STAT3 was observed in human lung tissue from an infant with an unrelated FOXF1 frameshift mutation downstream of the first STAT3 consensus binding sequence.

- **Barriers to treatment**: Augmenting STAT3 signaling might thus be an effective approach for some FOXF1 mutations, as well as an approach that could be applied to augment other downstream signaling critical for angiogenesis. A more practical barrier is that ACDMPV usually arises as a sporadic disorder due to de novo mutations. Although familial cases are recognized and prenatal diagnosis has been performed, these cases are the exceptions. Most infants present after birth with respiratory failure and persistent pulmonary hypertension, which may result.

### Novel germline STAT3 gain-of-function mutation causes autoimmune diseases and severe growth failure [^115dTfrF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). Low credibility.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 is a transcription factor that functions downstream of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Activated STAT3 is phosphorylated by the Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT pathway, forms a dimer, translocates into the nucleus, and promotes gene expression. STAT3-knockout mice are embryonically lethal, indicating that the protein is essential for survival. Its function has been analyzed using conditional knockout mice with tissue-specific STAT3 deficiency.

STAT3 is involved in the expression of acute-phase proteins during inflammation. When IL-6 acts on hepatocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP) is produced via the JAK-STAT pathway, serving as a widely used inflammation marker. IL-6, a major stimulator of STAT3, has become a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases. Tocilizumab (TCZ) is an antibody preparation that blocks the IL-6 receptor and is used to treat diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

A loss of function (LOF) of STAT3 is known as hyper-IgE syndrome, which causes immunodeficiency. Recently, owing to the prevalence of next-generation sequencing, germline gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of STAT3 have been identified as causing early-onset multiorgan autoimmunity and growth failure. Some studies have reported that targeted therapies, such as TCZ and JAK inhibitors, were effective for the disease management of patients with STAT3 GOF.

We detected a novel STAT3 mutation using whole-exome sequencing, concluded it to be a GOF mutation using a dual-luciferase reporter assay, and administered TCZ therapy.

### Subclonal STAT3 mutations solidify clonal dominance [^112rtJUG]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

T large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGLL) is a clonal lymphoproliferative disorder that can arise in the context of pathologic or physiologic cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses. STAT3 mutations are often absent in typical T-LGLL, suggesting that in a significant fraction of patients, antigen-driven expansion alone can maintain LGL clone persistence. We set out to determine the relationship between activating STAT3 hits and CTL clonal selection at presentation and in response to therapy. Thus, a group of patients with T-LGLL were serially subjected to deep next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the T-cell receptor (TCR) Vβ complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) and STAT3 to recapitulate clonal hierarchy and dynamics.

The results of this complex analysis demonstrate that STAT3 mutations produce either a sweeping or linear subclone within a monoclonal CTL population either early or during the course of disease. Therapy can extinguish an LGL clone, silence it, or adapt mechanisms to escape elimination. LGL clones can persist on the elimination of STAT3 subclones, and alternate STAT3-negative CTL clones can replace therapy-sensitive CTL clones. LGL clones can evolve and are fueled by a nonextinguished antigenic drive. STAT3 mutations can accelerate this process or render CTL clones semiautonomous and not reliant on physiologic stimulation.

### JAKs and STATs from a clinical perspective: Loss-of-function mutations, gain-of-function mutations, and their multidimensional consequences [^115qeNDe]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

The JAK/STAT signaling pathway plays a key role in cytokine signaling and is involved in development, immunity, and tumorigenesis for nearly any cell. At first glance, the JAK/STAT signaling pathway appears to be straightforward. However, on closer examination, the factors influencing the JAK/STAT signaling activity, such as cytokine diversity, receptor profile, overlapping JAK and STAT specificity among non-redundant functions of the JAK/STAT complexes, positive regulators (e.g. cooperating transcription factors), and negative regulators (e.g. SOCS, PIAS, PTP), demonstrate the complexity of the pathway's architecture, which can be quickly disturbed by mutations.

The JAK/STAT signaling pathway has been, and still is, a subject of basic research and offers enormous potential for the development of new methods of personalized medicine, thus translating basic molecular research into clinical practice beyond the use of JAK inhibitors. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in the three immunologically relevant signal transducers STAT1, STAT3, and STAT6, as well as JAK1 and JAK3, present themselves through individual phenotypic clinical pictures. The established, traditional paradigm of loss-of-function mutations leading to immunodeficiency and gain-of-function mutations leading to autoimmunity breaks down, and a more differentiated picture of disease patterns evolves.

This review is intended to provide an overview of these specific syndromes from a clinical perspective and to summarize findings on pathomechanism, symptoms, and immunological features.

### New dominant-negative IL6ST variants expand the immunological and clinical spectrum of GP130-dependent hyper-IgE syndrome [^112TGjAj]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Based on the severity of the clinical presentation in P8 and the functional characterization of the p.(Arg768*) mutant, it is tempting to conclude that the first STAT3 binding residue Tyr767 does not play a crucial role in maintaining physiological levels of STAT3 signaling and, thus, in protecting against the development of a HIES phenotype. However, the p.(Arg768*) truncation would probably affect the stability of STAT3 binding to residue Tyr767, thereby countering the activation of some residual STAT3-mediated signaling.

This hypothesis appears more likely according to population genetics. Relative to p.(Arg768*), the p.(Ser789*) variant identified in controls from the gnomAD V2.1 database conserves only the first STAT3 binding residue (Tyr767) but retains the recycling motif. Despite the predicted retention of one STAT3 binding site by both the p.(Arg768*) and p.(Ser789*) variants, only the p.(Ser789*) variant conserves some ability to activate STAT3 signaling in vitro.

It is unknown whether individuals carrying the p.(Ser789*) variant, or more generally, variants truncated between the recycling motif and the second STAT3 binding motif, can develop mild clinical and biological presentations of HIES (e.g. allergies, high IgE levels). It is tempting to speculate that the severe HIES phenotype develops only in individuals with variants N-terminal to the recycling motif, promoting the accumulation of the DN protein at the cell surface. However, the discovery of HIES patients carrying the p.(Ser731Val fs *8) variant challenges this hypothesis.

### Human T9 differentiation is dependent on signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 to restrain STAT1-mediated inhibition [^113MjtGM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with loss-of-function (LOF) signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) mutations have dermatitis, enhanced IgE production despite a relative lack of immediate hypersensitivity, reinfection, and an increased rate of lymphoma in addition to a number of skeletal and connective tissue abnormalities. Patients with STAT1 gain-of-function (GOF) mutations also have susceptibility to candidiasis and sinopulmonary infection, as well as autoimmunity and squamous cell carcinoma, in addition to even more broad phenotypes.

- **Objective**: Because of the link between T H 9 cells and allergic inflammation, autoimmunity, and antitumor surveillance, and because evidence shows a role for either STAT3 or STAT1 in T H 9 differentiation conflicts, we sought to determine the status on this lineage of STAT1 GOF and STAT3 LOF mutations in human subjects.

- **Methods**: We detected IL-9 levels and T H 9 differentiation in patients with STAT3 LOF and STAT1 GOF mutations, together with T H 9 transcript factors, and partially rescued their deficiency in vitro by adding cytokines they lacked or transfecting key molecules.

- **Results**: We found that PBMCs or sorted naive CD4 + T cells from patients with STAT3 LOF and STAT1 GOF mutations had impaired T H 9 generation/differentiation. STAT3 inhibition in normal T H 9 cultures diminished early IL-21 induction and late IL-9 production, whereas exogenous IL-21 enhanced T H 9 differentiation, even with STAT3 inhibition, by restoring suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 expression and thus inhibiting excessive phosphorylated signal.

### Non-cell-autonomous activation of IL-6/STAT3 signaling mediates FGF19-driven hepatocarcinogenesis [^112gV2H9]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with HCC have experienced little improvement in overall survival in the past decades. Amplification of FGF19 is a recurring theme in human HCC; however, the signaling pathways leading to FGF19-induced hepatocellular carcinogenesis remain to be elucidated. Using genetic and pharmacological tools, we have uncovered a previously unsuspected role for cytokine IL-6 and its downstream effector STAT3 in FGF19-associated tumorigenesis, as well as providing evidence that the liver microenvironment can be modified to limit tumorigenesis in response to FGF19.

Our results showed that hepatocellular STAT3 is a critical effector in FGF19-induced HCC formation. STAT3 has a complex but well-established role in coordinating pro-tumorigenic gene expression and immunomodulatory functions, and aberrant activation of STAT3 has been reported in a wide variety of hematologic and epithelial tumors. Although mutations in the STAT3 gene are rarely identified, persistent activation of the STAT3 pathway is a common phenotype in human HCC. In defining a central role for STAT3 in FGF19-driven hepatocarcinogenesis, the data presented in this report extend previous findings on the causal role played by STAT3 in hepatocellular tumorigenesis and suggest that STAT3 may serve as a common signaling node in the development of HCC associated with diverse etiologies, including viral infection, and metabolic and hormonal dysregulation.

### Identification of a Stat3-dependent transcription regulatory network involved in metastatic progression [^1128VCyr]. Cancer Research (2009). Low credibility.

High levels of activated Stat3 are often found in human breast cancers and can correlate with poor patient outcomes. We employed an activated ErbB2 mouse model of breast cancer to investigate the in vivo role of Stat3 in mammary tumor progression and found that Stat3 does not alter mammary tumor initiation but dramatically affects metastatic progression. Four-fold fewer animals exhibited lung metastases in the absence of Stat3, and a 12-fold reduction in the number of lung lesions was observed in animals bearing Stat3-null tumors compared with the wild-type cohort. The decreased malignancy in Stat3-deficient tumors is attributed to a reduction in both angiogenic and inflammatory responses associated with a Stat3-dependent transcriptional cascade involving CCAAT/enhancer binding protein delta.

### STAT3 mutation-associated airway epithelial defects in Job syndrome [^116KDQ8z]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Job syndrome is a disease of autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES). Patients harboring STAT3 mutation are particularly prone to airway remodeling and airway infections.

- **Objectives**: Airway epithelial cells play a central role as the first line of defense against pathogenic infection and express high levels of STAT3. This study thus interrogates how AD-HIES STAT3 mutations impact the physiological functions of airway epithelial cells.

- **Methods**: This study created human airway basal cells expressing four common AD-HIES STAT3 mutants (R382W, V463del, V637M, and Y657S). In addition, primary airway epithelial cells were isolated from a patient with Job syndrome who was harboring a STAT3-S560del mutation and from mice harboring a STAT3-V463del mutation. Cell proliferation, differentiation, barrier function, bacterial elimination, and innate immune responses to pathogenic infection were quantitatively analyzed.

- **Results**: STAT3 mutations reduce STAT3 protein phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, transcription activity, and protein stability in airway basal cells. As a consequence, STAT3-mutated airway basal cells give rise to airway epithelial cells with abnormal cellular composition and loss of coordinated mucociliary clearance. Notably, AD-HIES STAT3 airway epithelial cells are defective in bacterial killing and fail to initiate vigorous proinflammatory responses and neutrophil transepithelial migration in response to an experimental model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.

- **Conclusions**: AD-HIES STAT3 mutations confer numerous abnormalities to airway epithelium.

### Jaks and STATs from a clinical perspective: Loss-of-function mutations, gain-of-function mutations, and their multidimensional consequences [^112rHLmg]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Low credibility.

The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is a prime example of the transmission of signals from extracellular ligands to the nucleus. It can explain how messenger substances such as cytokines and growth factors can mediate their functions into the cell in a diverse but specific manner. At the time of writing, more than 50 cytokines, growth factors, and hormones are known to trigger cell responses, using the signaling module of Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) molecules.

In general, the binding of an extracellular ligand to a cytokine receptor results in the activation of receptor-associated JAKs. These tyrosine kinases then phosphorylate themselves (autophosphorylation) and their associated receptors (transphosphorylation) to allow the recruitment of inactive STAT monomers via the SH2 domains of STATs. STATs are normally present as inactive monomers or unphosphorylated dimers in the cytoplasm before being recruited into the JAK/receptor complex. Immediately after STAT monomers have bound to the JAK/receptor complex, they themselves become phosphorylated (pSTAT) and dimerize due to spatial proximity. STAT dimers can then translocate into the nucleus where they bind to specific DNA sequences in the promoters of STAT pathway target genes to activate gene transcription.

### Aberrant function of pathogenic STAT3 mutant proteins is linked to altered stability of monomers and homodimers [^116hTBTw]. Blood (2023). High credibility.

STAT3 mutations, predominantly in the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and Src-homology 2 domain (SH2D), cause rare cases of immunodeficiency, malignancy, and autoimmunity. The exact mechanisms by which these mutations abrogate or enhance STAT3 function are not completely understood. Here, we examined how loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) STAT3 mutations within the DBD and SH2D affect monomer and homodimer protein stability as well as their effect on key STAT3 activation events, including recruitment to phosphotyrosine (pY) sites within peptide hormone receptors, tyrosine phosphorylation at Y705, dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding.

The DBD LOF mutants showed reduced DNA binding when homodimerized, whereas the DBD GOF mutants showed increased DNA binding. DBD LOF and GOF mutants showed minimal changes in other STAT3 functions or in monomer or homodimer protein stability. However, SH2D LOF mutants demonstrated reduced conformational stability as either monomers or homodimers, leading to decreased pY-peptide recruitment, tyrosine phosphorylation, dimerization, nuclear localization, and DNA binding. In contrast, cancer-causing SH2D GOF mutants showed increased STAT3 homodimer stability, which increased their DNA binding. Of note, a small-molecule inhibitor of STAT3 that targets the tyrosine phosphopeptide-binding pocket within the STAT3 SH2D potently inhibited cell proliferation driven by STAT3 SH2D GOF mutants. These findings indicate that the stability of STAT3 protein monomer and homodimer is critical for the pathogenesis of diseases caused by SH2D.
