## Question

lumbar stenosis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing and managing lumbar spinal stenosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical syndrome and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including history, examination, and imaging. Next, I will review the natural history to frame expectations. After that, I need to examine non-surgical management options and their evidence. Then, I will evaluate surgical indications and compare surgical techniques. Finally, I should integrate prognostic factors and synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm with shared decision-making considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and pathophysiology. Lumbar spinal stenosis is best understood as a clinical syndrome of neurogenic claudication — burning or cramping buttock and leg pain worsened by standing or walking and relieved by sitting or forward flexion — due to narrowing of the central canal, lateral recess, or foramina, compressing neural and vascular elements; prevalence rises with age, and many older adults have incidental imaging stenosis without symptoms, so correlation is essential [^115sLCjW] [^116Pckyd].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping to imaging. The history is paramount: symptoms provoked by lumbar extension and relieved by flexion, with preserved peripheral pulses to distinguish from vascular claudication; physical examination may be normal or show limited lumbar extension, with straight-leg raise typically not reproducing neurogenic claudication; I should double-check that imaging is used to confirm rather than screen, because asymptomatic stenosis is common and imaging alone cannot establish causality of symptoms [^115vPstn] [^115sLCjW] [^115QUyMG].

> I need to check the imaging hierarchy. MRI is the first-line modality to confirm anatomic stenosis and nerve root involvement. If MRI is contraindicated or nondiagnostic, CT myelography is a reasonable alternative. I should confirm that dynamic flexion–extension radiographs are reserved for suspected instability or spondylolisthesis rather than routine use, to avoid over-calling instability [^116qTvTr] [^112eoX8r] [^112VJcum].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prognosis. The natural history is heterogeneous: about one-third of patients improve over time, about half remain stable, and roughly 10–20% worsen. Importantly, rapid neurologic deterioration is rare in mild-to-moderate cases, so most decisions are elective and should be individualized. I should confirm that these ranges derive from longitudinal cohorts and guideline syntheses [^115vPstn] [^1156trag] [^114sg2nY].

> Next, I should review non-surgical management and its evidentiary footing. Guidelines consistently recommend nonoperative care first-line for most patients, including education, activity modification, NSAIDs, and a limited course of active physical therapy; however, I need to acknowledge that high-quality randomized evidence is limited, and guideline grades are often low, reflecting heterogeneity and lack of untreated controls [^113aKgF7] [^115S6J2T] [^116tYUy6].

> Let me consider exercise-based interventions more closely. A three-arm randomized trial in older adults found that manual therapy combined with individualized exercise produced greater short-term improvements in symptoms and walking capacity than medical care or group exercise, though between-group differences attenuated by 6 months. This suggests a time-limited, structured program may yield meaningful gains, but I should confirm that replication is needed and that adherence and supervision likely matter [^112LByAE].

> I should double-check the role of epidural steroid injections. Evidence is mixed: some guidelines and reviews suggest short-term benefit for neurogenic claudication, whereas others, including the NEJM SPORT subgroup, found no added benefit of steroids over local anesthetic alone; long-term functional benefit has not been demonstrated, so injections may be considered for short-term relief or as a bridge, but expectations should be tempered and repeated injections should be cautious [^115vPstn] [^114T2iZM] [^115sLCjW].

> Now, I will examine surgical indications. Surgery is reasonable for persistent, function-limiting neurogenic claudication despite a trial of conservative therapy, with absolute indications including progressive motor deficit or cauda equina syndrome. I should confirm that most decisions are elective and that shared decision-making is essential given modest average benefits and potential harms [^115vPstn] [^111yJXC1] [^111zCB6f].

> Let me compare surgical options carefully. Decompressive laminectomy is the standard procedure. Adding fusion is generally reserved for concomitant instability or degenerative spondylolisthesis, and high-quality comparative evidence has not shown fusion to be superior to decompression alone for most outcomes, while fusion increases complications and cost. Interspinous process spacers may help selected patients with flexion-dependent symptoms but have higher reoperation rates in some trials, so patient selection is critical [^114Feoye] [^115vPstn] [^117TwwDW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the randomized trial comparing surgery to physical therapy showed no difference at 2 years. Let me verify that. The Annals RCT reported no significant intention-to-treat difference at 24 months due to high crossover, but as-treated analyses favored surgery by about 3 months and sustained advantages at 2 years; the NEJM SPORT similarly showed greater improvements with surgery in as-treated analyses, reinforcing that carefully selected surgical candidates often experience faster and larger gains, albeit with procedural risks [^notfound].

> I should confirm prognostic factors that influence outcomes. Positive predictors of surgical benefit include younger age, male sex, better baseline walking capacity, less comorbidity, and leg-predominant symptoms; negative predictors include depression, cardiovascular disease, scoliosis, and smoking; these factors should inform counseling and selection, recognizing that evidence quality varies [^115vdUJ2] [^115vPstn].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and sanity-check each step. Start with clinical confirmation of neurogenic claudication and exclusion of vascular claudication. Obtain MRI if symptoms are moderate to severe or if red flags are present. Initiate multimodal conservative care for 6–12 weeks, including education, activity modification, NSAIDs, and supervised exercise or manual therapy. Consider a single epidural injection for short-term relief if needed. Reassess at 3 months and refer for surgical evaluation if symptoms persist and limit function. Choose decompression alone for leg-predominant symptoms without instability, and add fusion only when instability or spondylolisthesis is present. Throughout, use shared decision-making to align treatment with patient goals and risk tolerance [^113aKgF7] [^115S6J2T] [^111yJXC1] [^117TwwDW].

> But wait, what if symptoms are mild and the patient prefers to avoid procedures? Given the favorable natural history in a substantial subset, observation with periodic reassessment is reasonable; I should ensure that patients understand the waxing–waning course and the low likelihood of rapid deterioration, and that they have clear return precautions for new motor deficits or bowel/bladder changes [^115vPstn] [^1156trag] [^114sg2nY].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and follow-up reflect best practices. Use validated patient-reported measures such as the Oswestry Disability Index and Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire to track function and symptoms. Reassess at defined intervals during conservative care and after any intervention. And maintain a low threshold to re-image if new neurologic signs emerge or symptoms change substantially, adjusting the plan accordingly [^116pMcAv] [^115vPstn].

Lumbar stenosis is a **narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal** or neural foramina, most often from degenerative changes, causing neurogenic claudication — leg pain, numbness, or weakness that worsens with walking or standing and improves with flexion or sitting [^115vPstn]. Diagnosis is **clinical plus MRI** [^116qTvTr], which confirms stenosis and excludes other causes [^116qTvTr]. First-line management is **conservative care** (activity modification, NSAIDs, and physical therapy) [^113aKgF7]; epidural steroid injections may provide short-term relief [^114T2iZM]. Surgery (decompressive laminectomy, with or without fusion) is reserved for persistent, disabling symptoms despite conservative therapy, with most patients improving postoperatively but facing risks of complications and reoperation [^116bUen6] [^114Feoye]. Prognosis is variable: about one-third improve, one-half remain stable, and 10–20% worsen without surgery; surgical outcomes are generally favorable but can deteriorate over time [^115vPstn] [^1119Bw6f].

---

## Pathophysiology and anatomical changes

Lumbar stenosis arises from **degenerative changes** that reduce canal or foraminal diameter and compress neural elements [^1117xJn7]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Disc degeneration**: loss of height and bulging reduce canal volume [^116QRJbr].
- **Facet joint hypertrophy**: arthritic enlargement and osteophytes narrow the canal [^116QRJbr].
- **Ligamentum flavum hypertrophy**: thickening buckles into the canal [^116QRJbr].
- **Spondylolisthesis**: vertebral slip further narrows the canal [^116QRJbr].

These changes cause **neural ischemia and mechanical compression**, producing neurogenic claudication [^116QRJbr].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptoms

Patients typically present with **neurogenic claudication** — characterized by:

- **Leg pain**: bilateral, radiating, burning or cramping, worsened by walking or standing and relieved by sitting or flexion [^116Pckyd].
- **Numbness or tingling**: in the legs or feet [^1151MNB1].
- **Weakness**: lower extremity weakness or gait instability [^1151MNB1].
- **Back pain**: may coexist but is often less prominent than leg symptoms [^115sLCjW].

Symptoms are typically **progressive** and can significantly impair mobility and quality of life [^115vPstn].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis relies on **clinical history and examination**, with imaging to confirm and guide management [^1166dfGh]:

- **Clinical history**: symptoms provoked by extension and relieved by flexion strongly suggest stenosis [^115vPstn].
- **Physical examination**: often limited; neurologic deficits may be subtle or absent [^notfound].
- **MRI**: gold standard to confirm canal/foraminal narrowing and exclude other causes [^116qTvTr].
- **CT myelography**: alternative when MRI is contraindicated or inconclusive [^112eoX8r].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative care is **first-line** for mild-to-moderate symptoms [^116tYUy6]:

- **Activity modification**: avoid prolonged standing/walking; use flexion-based exercises [^115vPstn].
- **Medications**: NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and short-term muscle relaxants [^notfound].
- **Physical therapy**: flexion-based programs and core strengthening [^notfound].
- **Epidural steroid injections**: short-term relief in selected patients [^114T2iZM].

Long-term benefits of conservative care are **limited**, with about 20–40% eventually requiring surgery [^114qCGC6].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **persistent, disabling symptoms despite conservative therapy** [^111yJXC1]. Options include:

| **Surgical procedure** | **Indications** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| Decompressive laminectomy | - Central canal stenosis <br/> - Without instability | - Good relief of leg pain <br/> - Improved function [^111XuMZs] |
| Laminectomy with fusion | - Stenosis with instability <br/> - Or spondylolisthesis | - Improved stability <br/> - But higher complication rates [^115vPstn] |
| Minimally invasive decompression | - Mild-to-moderate stenosis <br/> - Without instability | - Shorter recovery <br/> - But limited long-term data [^notfound] |

---

Surgical outcomes are **generally favorable**, but complications and reoperation can occur [^114Feoye].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis is **variable**: about one-third improve, one-half remain stable, and 10–20% worsen without surgery [^115vPstn]. Surgical patients often experience significant improvement, but benefits may diminish over time, with 50–67% reporting sustained improvement at 8–10 years [^114kJbop].

---

## Complications and risks

Conservative care has minimal risks, whereas **surgery carries potential complications**, including:

- **Infection**: wound or deep infection [^115vPstn].
- **Neurologic injury**: nerve root or cauda equina injury [^notfound].
- **Instability**: may require fusion [^114cDxTV].
- **Reoperation**: 10–20% at 5–10 years [^notfound].

---

## Emerging treatments and research

Emerging options include **minimally invasive decompression**, interspinous spacers, and regenerative therapies; however, evidence remains limited and long-term outcomes are under study [^115C1n3i] [^114Feoye].

---

Lumbar stenosis is a **degenerative narrowing of the lumbar canal** causing neurogenic claudication; management is stepwise, beginning with conservative care and escalating to surgery for refractory cases, with outcomes generally favorable but variable over time [^115vPstn].

Introduction

The condition, known as lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), is primarily acquired degenerative stenosis, characterized by reduced space in the neural foramen or lumbar spinal canal, resulting in compression of the nerves or blood vessels. More than 100 million patients are affected. Neurogenic claudication (NC) and other neurological symptoms in the lower back and lower limbs, with or without pain, may be brought on by degenerative LSS. Walking makes LSS symptoms worse while lying down makes them go away. When treating LSS, non-surgical procedures are often advised as first-line therapy, with surgical procedures being reserved for individuals who do not improve with conservative care (CC).

Improved pain management, increased walking distance, and relief of neurological symptoms are the three main treatment objectives of the non-surgical CC of LSS. Physiotherapy, including massage, acupuncture, thermotherapy, and kinesiotherapy, are presently regarded as the most effective therapies in rehabilitation. Other therapies, such as steroid epidural injection (ESI) and pharmaceutical treatments, often center on pharmacology. Non-surgical CC is advised for the clinical improvement of LSS, but no particular therapy or combined therapy has been established as a superior intervention.

Introduction

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a degenerative condition of the spine prevalent in 30% of older adults. Lumbar spinal stenosis is associated with substantial functional limitation of walking, disability, and increased risk of falling. Lumbar spinal stenosis accounts for the fastest growth in lumbar surgery in older adults in the United States. The rate of complex fusion procedures for this condition has increased by 137% between 1998 and 2008. These surgical procedures lead to significant costs, risks, complications, and rehospitalizations. However, evidence is lacking for the effectiveness of nonsurgical interventions and treatment options for patients with LSS.

The North American Spine Society has published a clinical guideline for the treatment of LSS. The only 2 interventions recommended as evidence based and effective were epidural steroid injection and surgical decompression. This guideline concluded that there was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of nonsurgical treatments, including pharmacologic treatments, physical therapy, exercise, and spinal manipulation. Yet, the only nonsurgical intervention favorably recommended by the North American Spine Society has been contradicted by recent reviews that concluded that the evidence for the effectiveness of epidural injections is of low quality.

Since publication of the North American Spine Society guideline, several systematic reviews have corroborated the evidence gap about nonsurgical treatments for LSS. To help bridge this gap, we performed a randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of 3 nonsurgical interventions on symptoms and physical function (primary aims) as well as physical activity (secondary aim) in patients with LSS. Exploratory aims included analyses of the number of adverse events, attrition/adherence rates, fall rates, and number of cointerventions.

Unlabelled

Lumbar spinal stenosis is being diagnosed increasingly in older people as advanced imaging studies become more widely available and clinicians become more familiar with the presentation of this common condition. For symptomatic patients, the goal of treatment is pain relief and improved function, but there is little empiric evidence to support many of the common interventions used. The relative risks and benefits of various surgical and nonsurgical treatments are poorly understood, and the result has been wide variations in the evaluation and treatment of spinal stenosis across geographic regions. Current practice recommendations are based on expert opinion that incorporates available evidence into existing clinical and biologic paradigms. For most individuals, initial treatment should focus on patient education, medications to control pain, and exercise and physical treatments to regain or maintain activities of daily living. Surgical treatment most commonly is considered in patients not improving with nonsurgical care. Decompressive laminectomy is the standard surgical procedure for patients with spinal stenosis. The addition of fusion with or without instrumentation is considered when spinal stenosis is accompanied by degenerative spondylolisthesis or related to concerns about instability. We review the available evidence for nonsurgical and surgical interventions, and highlight comparative results wherever applicable.

### Contemporary management of symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis [^112Wujsq]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common cause of impaired quality of life and diminished functional capacity in the elderly. Due to the advance of noninvasive imaging modalities, spinal stenosis is becoming more frequently identified, and has become the most frequent cause for spinal surgery in patients older than 65 years. Despite the ubiquitous nature of this condition, considerable controversy exists regarding the preferred treatment. Level I evidence that compares the effectiveness of surgical and nonsurgical treatment is lacking. The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial, a study that evaluates the common surgical treatments for the lumbar spine, has addressed this deficiency and is discussed in this article.

Surgical Treatment

Surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis is typically performed when nonsurgical treatment, such as those listed previously, does not sufficiently relieve a patient's symptoms. It is the most common reason for spinal surgery among patients aged 65 years or older. The objective of the surgery is to increase the cross-sectional area of the spinal canal at the level of the stenosis, in an effort to decrease the pressure on the affected nerves. In most cases, the surgery is considered elective, as its purpose is to alleviate symptoms and improve function, rather than prevent neurologic impairment. Exceptions include patients who are myelopathic or have symptoms of cauda equina and therefore require surgery to prevent neurologic decline.

In a study of patients with lumber spinal stenosis who originally opted for nonsurgical treatment, approximately 30% subsequently requested surgery. However, a recent systematic review of 26 published studies, including five randomized controlled trials, was unable to conclude whether lumbar spinal stenosis is best treated using a surgical or a more conservative approach, primarily due to a lack of well-designed research.

Patient characteristics predictive of a good clinical outcome following surgery for spinal stenosis vary significantly between studies. However, a systematic review of 21 studies reported that negative predictors included depression, a concomitant disorder influencing walking capacity, cardiovascular comorbidity, and scoliosis. Smoking also seems to be associated with negative surgical outcomes. In contrast, positive predictors were male gender, younger age, better walking ability, better self-rated health, less comorbidity, and more pronounced canal stenosis.

### Surgical or nonoperative treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis? A randomized controlled trial [^111XuMZs]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

A randomized controlled trial.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of decompressive surgery as compared with nonoperative measures in the treatment of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.

Summary Of Background Data

No previous randomized trial has assessed the effectiveness of surgery in comparison with conservative treatment for spinal stenosis.

Methods

Four university hospitals agreed on the classification of the disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, radiographic routines, surgical principles, nonoperative treatment options, and follow-up protocols. A total of 94 patients were randomized into a surgical or nonoperative treatment group: 50 and 44 patients, respectively. Surgery comprised undercutting laminectomy of the stenotic segments in 10 patients augmented with transpedicular fusion. The primary outcome was based on assessment of functional disability using the Oswestry Disability Index (scale, 0–100). Data on the intensity of leg and back pain (scales, 0–10), as well as self-reported and measured walking ability were compiled at randomization and at follow-up examinations at 6, 12, and 24 months.

Results

Both treatment groups showed improvement during follow-up. At 1 year, the mean difference in favor of surgery was 11.3 in disability (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.3–18.4), 1.7 in leg pain (95% CI, 0.4–3.0), and 2.3(95% CI, 1.1–3.6) in back pain. At the 2-year follow-up, the mean differences were slightly less: 7.8 in disability (95% CI, 0.8–14.9) 1.5 in leg pain (95% CI, 0.3–2.8), and 2.1 in back pain (95% CI, 1.0–3.3). Walking ability, either reported or measured, did not differ between the two treatment groups.

Conclusions

Although patients improved over the 2-year follow-up regardless of initial treatment, those undergoing decompressive surgery reported greater improvement regarding leg pain, back pain, and overall disability. The relative benefit of initial surgical treatment diminished over time, but outcomes of surgery remained favorable at 2 years. Longer follow-up is needed to determine if these differences persist.

### Comparative clinical effectiveness of nonsurgical treatment methods in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis: a randomized clinical trial [^112LByAE]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is the most common reason for spine surgery in older US adults. There is an evidence gap about nonsurgical LSS treatment options.

Objective

To explore the comparative clinical effectiveness of 3 nonsurgical interventions for patients with LSS.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Three-arm randomized clinical trial of 3 years' duration (November 2013 to June 2016). Analysis began in August 2016. All interventions were delivered during 6 weeks with follow-up at 2 months and 6 months at an outpatient research clinic. Patients older than 60 years with LSS were recruited from the general public. Eligibility required anatomical evidence of central canal and/or lateral recess stenosis (magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography) and clinical symptoms associated with LSS (neurogenic claudication; less symptoms with flexion). Analysis was intention to treat.

Interventions

Medical care, group exercise, and manual therapy/individualized exercise. Medical care consisted of medications and/or epidural injections provided by a physiatrist. Group exercise classes were supervised by fitness instructors in senior community centers. Manual therapy/individualized exercise consisted of spinal mobilization, stretches, and strength training provided by chiropractors and physical therapists.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were between-group differences at 2 months in self-reported symptoms and physical function measured by the Swiss Spinal Stenosis questionnaire (score range, 12–55) and a measure of walking capacity using the self-paced walking test (meters walked for 0 to 30 minutes).

Results

A total of 259 participants (mean [SD] age, 72.4 [7.8] years; 137 women [52.9%]) were allocated to medical care (88 [34.0%]), group exercise (84 [32.4%]), or manual therapy/individualized exercise (87 [33.6%]). Adjusted between-group analyses at 2 months showed manual therapy/individualized exercise had greater improvement of symptoms and physical function compared with medical care (-2.0; 95% CI, -3.6 to -0.4) or group exercise (-2.4; 95% CI, -4.1 to -0.8). Manual therapy/individualized exercise had a greater proportion of responders (≥ 30% improvement) in symptoms and physical function (20%) and walking capacity (65.3%) at 2 months compared with medical care (7.6% and 48.7%, respectively) or group exercise (3.0% and 46.2%, respectively). At 6 months, there were no between-group differences in mean outcome scores or responder rates.

Conclusions and Relevance

A combination of manual therapy/individualized exercise provides greater short-term improvement in symptoms and physical function and walking capacity than medical care or group exercises, although all 3 interventions were associated with improvements in long-term walking capacity.

Natural history of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis — evidence review scope and findings: For inclusion, studies required symptomatic patients with characteristic clinical features and confirmatory imaging demonstrating diminished space in the lumbar spinal canal. The group reviewed the 2007 version of the guideline which included 38 references from 1966–2006 and an additional 21 articles from database searches for studies published between January 2006 and February 2010, but all identified studies failed to meet inclusion criteria because they did not adequately pre-sent data about natural history and did not report results of untreated control patients; works frequently cited as natural history studies were actually reports of one or more medical/interventional treat-ment measures. The 2007 guideline had considered patients with minimal medical/interventional treat-ment representative of the natural course, but the 2010 work group determined that any treatment may affect natural history and such studies would be more appropriately in-cluded in the medical/interventional treatment section. Because of these limitations, the work group was unable to definitively an-swer the question related to natural history and instead noted that consensus statements would follow.

Background

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a debilitating condition associated with degeneration of the spine with aging.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of different types of surgery compared with different types of non-surgical interventions in adults with symptomatic LSS. Primary outcomes included quality of life, disability, function and pain. Also, to consider complication rates and side effects, and to evaluate short-, intermediate- and long-term outcomes (six months, six months to two years, five years or longer).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, five other databases and two trials registries up to February 2015. We also screened reference lists and conference proceedings related to treatment of the spine.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing surgical versus non-operative treatments in participants with lumbar spinal stenosis confirmed by clinical and imaging findings.

Data Collection and Analysis

For data collection and analysis, we followed methods guidelines of the Cochrane Back and Neck Review Group (Furlan 2009) and those provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).

Main Results

From the 12,966 citations screened, we assessed 26 full-text articles and included five RCTs (643 participants). Low-quality evidence from the meta-analysis performed on two trials using the Oswestry Disability Index (pain-related disability) to compare direct decompression with or without fusion versus multi-modal non-operative care showed no significant differences at six months (mean difference (MD) -3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) -10.12 to 2.80) and at one year (MD -6.18, 95% CI -15.03 to 2.66). At 24 months, significant differences favoured decompression (MD -4.43, 95% CI -7.91 to -0.96). Low-quality evidence from one small study revealed no difference in pain outcomes between decompression and usual conservative care (bracing and exercise) at three months (risk ratio (RR) 1.38, 95% CI 0.22 to 8.59), four years (RR 7.50, 95% CI 1.00 to 56.48) and 10 years (RR 4.09, 95% CI 0.95 to 17.58). Low-quality evidence from one small study suggested no differences at six weeks in the Oswestry Disability Index for patients treated with minimally invasive mild decompression versus those treated with epidural steroid injections (MD 5.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 10.83; 38 participants). Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) results were better for epidural injection at six weeks (MD -0.60, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.28), and visual analogue scale (VAS) improvements were better in the mild decompression group (MD 2.40, 95% CI 1.92 to 2.88). At 12 weeks, many cross-overs prevented further analysis. Low-quality evidence from a single study including 191 participants favoured the interspinous spacer versus usual conservative treatment at six weeks, six months and one year for symptom severity and physical function. All remaining studies reported complications associated with surgery and conservative side effects of treatment: Two studies reported no major complications in the surgical group, and the other study reported complications in 10% and 24% of participants, including spinous process fracture, coronary ischaemia, respiratory distress, haematoma, stroke, risk of reoperation and death due to pulmonary oedema.

Authors' Conclusions

We have very little confidence to conclude whether surgical treatment or a conservative approach is better for lumbar spinal stenosis, and we can provide no new recommendations to guide clinical practice. However, it should be noted that the rate of side effects ranged from 10% to 24% in surgical cases, and no side effects were reported for any conservative treatment. No clear benefits were observed with surgery versus non-surgical treatment. These findings suggest that clinicians should be very careful in informing patients about possible treatment options, especially given that conservative treatment options have resulted in no reported side effects. High-quality research is needed to compare surgical versus conservative care for individuals with lumbar spinal stenosis.

### Surgical options for lumbar spinal stenosis [^114Feoye]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hospital charges for lumbar spinal stenosis have increased significantly worldwide in recent times, with great variation in the costs and rates of different surgical procedures. There have also been significant increases in the rate of complex fusion and the use of spinal spacer implants compared to that of traditional decompression surgery, even though the former is known to incur costs up to three times higher. Moreover, the superiority of these new surgical procedures over traditional decompression surgery is still unclear.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of surgery in the management of patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis and the comparative effectiveness between commonly performed surgical techniques to treat this condition on patient-related outcomes. We also aimed to investigate the safety of these surgical interventions by including perioperative surgical data and reoperation rates.

Search Methods

Review authors performed electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, Web of Science, LILACS and three trials registries from their inception to 16 June 2016. Authors also conducted citation tracking on the reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

This review included only randomised controlled trials that investigated the efficacy and safety of surgery compared with no treatment, placebo or sham surgery, or with another surgical technique in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed the studies for inclusion and performed the 'Risk of bias' assessment, using the Cochrane Back and Neck Review Group criteria. Reviewers also extracted demographics, surgery details, and types of outcomes to describe the characteristics of included studies. Primary outcomes were pain intensity, physical function or disability status, quality of life, and recovery. The secondary outcomes included measurements related to surgery, such as perioperative blood loss, operation time, length of hospital stay, reoperation rates, and costs. We grouped trials according to the types of surgical interventions being compared and categorised follow-up times as short-term when less than 12 months and long-term when 12 months or more. Pain and disability scores were converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. We calculated mean differences for continuous outcomes and relative risks for dichotomous outcomes. We pooled data using the random-effects model in Review Manager 5.3, and used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included a total of 24 randomised controlled trials (reported in 39 published research articles or abstracts) in this review. The trials included 2352 participants with lumbar spinal stenosis with symptoms of neurogenic claudication. None of the included trials compared surgery with no treatment, placebo or sham surgery. Therefore, all included studies compared two or more surgical techniques. We judged all trials to be at high risk of bias for the blinding of care provider domain, and most of the trials failed to adequately conceal the randomisation process, blind the participants or use intention-to-treat analysis. Five trials compared the effects of fusion in addition to decompression surgery. Our results showed no significant differences in pain relief at long-term (mean difference (MD) -0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.32 to 6.74). Similarly, we found no between-group differences in disability reduction in the long-term (MD 3.26, 95% CI -6.12 to 12.63). Participants who received decompression alone had significantly less perioperative blood loss (MD -0.52 L, 95% CI -0.70 L to -0.34 L) and required shorter operations (MD -107.94 minutes, 95% CI -161.65 minutes to -54.23 minutes) compared with those treated with decompression plus fusion, though we found no difference in the number of reoperations (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.92). Another three trials investigated the effects of interspinous process spacer devices compared with conventional bony decompression. These spacer devices resulted in similar reductions in pain (MD -0.55, 95% CI -8.08 to 6.99) and disability (MD 1.25, 95% CI -4.48 to 6.98). The spacer devices required longer operation time (MD 39.11 minutes, 95% CI 19.43 minutes to 58.78 minutes) and were associated with higher risk of reoperation (RR 3.95, 95% CI 2.12 to 7.37), but we found no difference in perioperative blood loss (MD 144.00 mL, 95% CI -209.74 mL to 497.74 mL). Two trials compared interspinous spacer devices with decompression plus fusion. Although we found no difference in pain relief (MD 5.35, 95% CI -1.18 to 11.88), the spacer devices revealed a small but significant effect in disability reduction (MD 5.72, 95% CI 1.28 to 10.15). They were also superior to decompression plus fusion in terms of operation time (MD 78.91 minutes, 95% CI 30.16 minutes to 127.65 minutes) and perioperative blood loss (MD 238.90 mL, 95% CI 182.66 mL to 295.14 mL), however, there was no difference in rate of reoperation (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.51). Overall there were no differences for the primary or secondary outcomes when different types of surgical decompression techniques were compared among each other. The quality of evidence varied from 'very low quality' to 'high quality'.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this Cochrane review show a paucity of evidence on the efficacy of surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis, as to date no trials have compared surgery with no treatment, placebo or sham surgery. Placebo-controlled trials in surgery are feasible and needed in the field of lumbar spinal stenosis. Our results demonstrate that at present, decompression plus fusion and interspinous process spacers have not been shown to be superior to conventional decompression alone. More methodologically rigorous studies are needed in this field to confirm our results.

Introduction

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) represents a narrowing of the spinal canal to the point that the neurovascular structures of the spine are compressed. In addition to congenital causes, LSS may stem from degenerative diseases or conditions such as spondylolisthesis and disc herniation. While patients with LSS can be asymptomatic, for many patients, LSS imposes a significant decrement on health-related quality of life, commonly due to neurogenic intermittent claudication (NIC) that manifests as pain, discomfort, and/or weakness in the back and legs, as well as difficulty walking.LSS is estimated to affect 11% of the general population and 39% of those in primary and secondary care, with prevalence increasing with age. As a result, global prevalence will invariably rise as the duration of global life expectancy grows.

First-line treatment for LSS typically begins with non-operative "conservative care" (CC), which typically consists of pain medications, physical therapy, and epidural spinal injections. When CC fails to relieve symptoms, surgical options are often considered, including the placement of interspinous spacers and direct or indirect decompression of the spinal canal with or without fusion, as well as traditional spinal surgery to decompress the spinal canal and retain stability. Minimally invasive treatments, such as interspinous spacers, can be an appropriate treatment for those with mild-to-moderate LSS, while surgical options are "indicated in patients whose symptoms persist despite conservative measures and demonstrate surgically correctable pathologies" (page 20). Surgical interventions such as decompression and fusion can be costly, and patients face a higher risk of surgical complications compared to minimally invasive procedures including a placement of an interspinous spacer. Algorithms and recommendations exist for consideration of these procedures, but there are limited data elucidating how many (and when) patients receive an initial surgical intervention in routine clinical practice.

Given the variety of available treatment options, a description of the real-world care pathways of LSS patients provides a better understanding of how often these treatments are used in clinical practice. This study examines the patient care journey from initial LSS diagnosis to first surgical intervention using healthcare claims to assess longitudinal healthcare resource utilization associated with LSS.

### Lumbar spinal stenosis: how is It classified? [^117VcXVH]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

The prevalence of lumbar spinal stenosis is approximately 9.3%, with people most commonly affected in the sixth or seventh decade of life. Patients often have pain, cramping, and weakness in their legs that is worsened with standing and walking. Although the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial clearly demonstrated that surgery improves health-related quality of life, treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis varies widely from the type of decompression performed to the need for fusion. This variability can be attributed largely to the lack of an accepted classification system. A good classification system serves as a common language to define the severity of a condition, guide treatment, and facilitate clinical research.

### Diagnosis and management of lumbar spinal stenosis: a review [^115vPstn]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a prevalent and disabling cause of low back and leg pain in older persons, affecting an estimated 103 million persons worldwide. Most are treated nonoperatively. Approximately 600 000 surgical procedures are performed in the US each year for lumbar spinal stenosis.

Observations

The prevalence of the clinical syndrome of lumbar spinal stenosis in US adults is approximately 11% and increases with age. The diagnosis can generally be made based on a clinical history of back and lower extremity pain that is provoked by lumbar extension, relieved by lumbar flexion, and confirmed with cross-sectional imaging, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nonoperative treatment includes activity modification such as reducing periods of standing or walking, oral medications to diminish pain such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physical therapy. In a series of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis followed up for up to 3 years without operative intervention, approximately one-third of patients reported improvement, approximately 50% reported no change in symptoms, and approximately 10% to 20% of patients reported that their back pain, leg pain, and walking were worse. Long-term benefits of epidural steroid injections for lumbar spinal stenosis have not been demonstrated. Surgery appears effective in carefully selected patients with back, buttock, and lower extremity pain who do not improve with conservative management. For example, in a randomized trial of 94 participants with symptomatic and radiographic degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, decompressive laminectomy improved symptoms more than nonoperative therapy (difference, 7.8 points; 95% CI, 0.8–14.9; minimum clinically important difference, 10–12.8) on the Oswestry Disability Index (score range, 0–100). Among persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and concomitant spondylolisthesis, lumbar fusion increased symptom resolution in 1 trial (difference, 5.7 points; 95% CI, 0.1 to 11.3) on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical dimension score (range, 0–100), but 2 other trials showed either no important differences between the 2 therapies or noninferiority of lumbar decompression alone compared with lumbar decompression plus spinal fusion (MCID, 2–4.9 points). In a noninferiority trial, 71.4% treated with lumbar decompression alone vs 72.9% of those receiving decompression plus fusion achieved a 30% or more reduction in Oswestry Disability Index score, consistent with the prespecified noninferiority hypothesis. Fusion is associated with greater risk of complications such as blood loss, infection, longer hospital stays, and higher costs. Thus, the precise indications for concomitant lumbar fusion in persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis remain unclear.

Conclusions and Relevance

Lumbar spinal stenosis affects approximately 103 million people worldwide and 11% of older adults in the US. First-line therapy is activity modification, analgesia, and physical therapy. Long-term benefits from epidural steroid injections have not been established. Selected patients with continued pain and activity limitation may be candidates for decompressive surgery.

### Longitudinal analysis of the care pathway of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis in the US [^111b7zG2]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Approximately three-quarters of patients received no surgical or minimally invasive interventions approximately 6 years after being diagnosed with LSS. While CC may have been effective for some of these patients, it is likely that for many, a surgical or minimally invasive intervention could have eased symptom burden and improved quality of life. In order to ensure all patients have access to appropriate therapy, a strategy to increase the likelihood that LSS patients will see physician specialties such as interventional pain specialists or orthopedic spine surgeons who are familiar with the variety of treatments, including surgical options, can help patients determine and access the best intervention to treat their LSS. Future studies should aim to examine how severity of LSS impacts the pharmacologic, minimally invasive or open surgical treatment recommendations, or referral pathways to appropriate physician specialties by primary care providers.

Methods

The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (2019 CRD42019137266). A systematic search was conducted to synthesise data from randomised controlled trials published between 1996 and May 2023. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2020 checklistto report the findings.

The eligibility criteria for inclusion of trials are presented in Table 1. Our protocol stipulated an age range of 65 years or older, which we amended after noting several relevant studies involving participants with lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms aged 50 upwards from a preliminary review of the literature.

Table 1.
Eligibility criteria for inclusion of studies.

Based on previous systematic reviews, – a robust search strategy was developed by an information specialist in health sciences. Electronic searches for eligible studies were conducted within the databases, including the ClinicalTrials.gov and ISRCTN trial registry websites. For all included studies, we also undertook backward and forward reference searching by hand.

After the screening of titles and abstracts by pairs of authors (CC, EW, or CC, SM) and the exclusion of duplicates, full texts were retrieved and were independently assessed by two authors (as above). Any discrepancies in selecting the studies were resolved through discussion.

For each included trial, we used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2to assess the potential for bias across five domains (randomisation, intervention assignment, missing data, outcome measurement, and reporting). We used signalling questions from the Cochrane template to assess the domain-level judgements about the risk of bias and then reached an overall judgement about the risk of bias for each trial. The risk of bias was judged as 'low', with 'some concerns' and 'high'. We also assessed the quality of the reporting of exercise interventions using the TIDieR checklist (0–24 score, higher scores mean higher quality reporting). Scoring was completed by one author (CC) and checked by a second author (EW/SM). Any discrepancies in scoring were resolved through discussion.

### Treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis [^115gcXMC]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the vertebral canal that compresses spinal nerves and may cause leg pain and difficulty walking. The symptoms of degenerative lumbar stenosis commonly occur in elderly adults and can be treated conservatively with pain-relieving agents or aggressively with decompressive surgery. Most studies of the effectiveness of treatments are poor in quality; however, there appear to be potential relationships between treatments, patient characteristics, and treatment outcomes. Studies indicate the following: (1) local anesthetic block can reduce symptoms on a short-term basis, while epidural steroids offer no additional benefit; (2) patients with moderate or severe symptoms benefit more from surgery than from conservative therapy; and (3) patients with leg pain and severely restricted walking ability regain mobility after surgery. Definitive evidence-based conclusions about the efficacy of conservative or surgical treatments await the results of well-designed clinical trials.

### Management of lumbar spinal stenosis [^115sLCjW]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) affects more than 200,000 adults in the United States, resulting in substantial pain and disability. It is the most common reason for spinal surgery in patients over 65 years. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a clinical syndrome of pain in the buttocks or lower extremities, with or without back pain. It is associated with reduced space available for the neural and vascular elements of the lumbar spine. The condition is often exacerbated by standing, walking, or lumbar extension and relieved by forward flexion, sitting, or recumbency. Clinical care and research into lumbar spinal stenosis is complicated by the heterogeneity of the condition, the lack of standard criteria for diagnosis and inclusion in studies, and high rates of anatomic stenosis on imaging studies in older people who are completely asymptomatic. The options for non-surgical management include drugs, physiotherapy, spinal injections, lifestyle modification, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation. However, few high quality randomized trials have looked at conservative management. A systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific type of non-surgical treatment. Several different surgical procedures are used to treat patients who do not improve with non-operative therapies. Given that rapid deterioration is rare and that symptoms often wax and wane or gradually improve, surgery is almost always elective and considered only if sufficiently bothersome symptoms persist despite trials of less invasive interventions. Outcomes (leg pain and disability) seem to be better for surgery than for non-operative treatment, but the evidence is heterogeneous and often of limited quality.

### Abstract… [^1117xJn7]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Up to 90% of the U. S. population will experience significant low back pain in their lifetime. 1–3 Low back pain becomes chronic in up to 23% of patients and recurs within one year in up to 80%. 2, 4 Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common cause of chronic low back pain, particularly in people older than 50 years, and is a progressive degenerative condition of the intervertebral disk, ligamentum flavum, and facet joints secondary to aging. It causes a narrowing in the spaces encompassing the neurovascular structures of the spine, leading to the characteristic clinical syndrome of buttock and bilateral lower extremity pain that may include the lower back. 3 The pain typically worsens with walking or standing and improves with sitting or leaning forward. 5–8 Figure 1 shows normal spinal anatomy.

### Non-surgical interventions for lumbar spinal stenosis leading to neurogenic claudication: a clinical practice guideline [^115S6J2T]. The Journal of Pain (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for lumbar spinal stenosis, more specifically with respect to general principles, BJC/CCGI 2021 guidelines recommend to consider offering initial multimodal care nonpharmacological therapies with education, advice and lifestyle changes, behavioral change techniques in conjunction with home exercise and/or rehabilitation,
and postoperative rehabilitation - a supervised program of exercises and/or educational materials encouraging activity - with CBT 12 weeks post-surgery in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis causing neurogenic claudication.

### Lumbar spinal stenosis: syndrome, diagnostics and treatment [^113S6CLD]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) comprises narrowing of the spinal canal with subsequent neural compression, and is frequently associated with symptoms of neurogenic claudication. To establish a diagnosis of LSS, clinical history, physical examination results and radiological changes all need to be considered. Patients who exhibit mild to moderate symptoms of LSS should undergo multimodal conservative treatment, such as patient education, pain medication, delordosing physiotherapy and epidural injections. In patients with severe symptoms, surgery is indicated if conservative treatment proves ineffective after 3–6 months. Clinically relevant motor deficits or symptoms of cauda equina syndrome remain absolute indications for surgery. The first randomized, prospective studies have provided class I-II evidence that supports a more rapid and profound decline of LSS symptoms after decompressive surgery than with conservative therapy. In the absence of a valid paraclinical diagnostic marker, however, more evidence-based data are needed to identify those patients for whom the benefit of surgery would outweigh the risk of developing complications. In this Review, we briefly survey the underlying pathophysiology and clinical appearance of LSS, and explore the available diagnostic and therapeutic options, with particular emphasis on neuroradiological findings and outcome predictors.

### Lumbar spinal stenosis: diagnosis and management [^116Pckyd]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a clinical syndrome that affects more than 200,000 people in the United States annually. It is a common cause of chronic insidious low back pain, especially in older patient populations (mean age = 64 years). Lumbar spinal stenosis is a degenerative condition of the spine leading to narrowing in the spaces around the neurovascular bundles and the classic symptom of low back pain that radiates to the buttocks and lower extremities bilaterally. It is typically a progressive waxing and waning process that may deteriorate over years. The pain is typically burning or cramping, which worsens with standing and walking and improves with bending forward or sitting. Magnetic resonance imaging is the recommended diagnostic test because it allows cross-sectional measurement of the spinal canal. Options for nonsurgical management include physical therapy, exercise programs, spinal injections with and without corticosteroids, chiropractic treatment, osteopathic manipulation, acupuncture, and lifestyle modifications; however, few of these treatments have high-quality randomized trials demonstrating effectiveness. Surgery may be considered if nonsurgical management is ineffective.

### A review of lumbar spinal stenosis with intermittent neurogenic claudication: disease and diagnosis [^112gEYah]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a degenerative spinal condition affecting nearly 50% of patients presenting with lower back pain. The goal of this review is to present and summarize the current data on how LSS presents in various populations, how it is diagnosed, and current therapeutic strategies. Properly understanding the prevalence, presentation, and treatment options for individuals suffering from LSS is critical to providing patients the best possible care.

Results

The occurrence of LSS is associated with advanced age. In elderly patients, LSS can be challenging to identify due to the wide variety of presentation subtleties and common comorbidities such as degenerative disc disease. Recent developments in imaging techniques can be useful in accurately identifying the precise location of the spinal compression. Treatment options can range from conservative to surgical, with the latter being reserved for when patients have neurological compromise or conservative measures have failed. Once warranted, there are several surgical techniques at the physician's disposal to best treat each individual case.

### Therapeutic exercise in the treatment of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis [^111XoFNV]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a condition that may cause significant pain and associated disability, especially in older patients. It is being recognized with increasing frequency as the population continues to age, and is the most common diagnosis associated with lumbar spine surgery in patients older than 65 years of age. The natural history of lumbar spinal stenosis is not necessarily one of progressive deterioration. Conservative treatment is advocated in patients with mild to moderate symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis, and may include therapeutic exercise. The therapeutic exercise program must be prescribed with a thorough understanding of the contributing pathoanatomic and pathophysiologic factors, and should be tailored to each patient based on his or her history and physical examination. Components of the program are described in detail and include specific stretching and strengthening exercises, general conditioning exercises, and education in proper posture and body mechanics. Randomized controlled studies are needed to help clarify the indications for conservative versus surgical treatment, to determine which components of the therapeutic exercise program are the most beneficial, and to compare outcomes after conservative or surgical measures.

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a prevalent condition with varied presentation. Most common in older populations, symptoms typically include back, buttock, and posterior thigh pain. Diagnosis is typically based on physical examination and clinical history, but confirmed on imaging studies. Nonsurgical management includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, physical therapy, and epidural injections. If nonoperative management fails or patient presentation involves worsening symptoms, surgical intervention, most commonly in the form of a laminectomy, may be indicated. Recent literature has demonstrated improved pain and functional outcomes with surgery compared with conservative treatment in the middle to long term.

### An algorithmic approach to treating lumbar spinal stenosis: an evidenced-based approach [^112VJcum]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Algorithm for Spinal Stenosis Treatment

The traditional treatment algorithm for LSS consists of conservative management (physical therapy, medication, education, exercise), followed by ESI, and finally open surgical decompression. As shown in this paper, recently several minimally invasive procedures have been developed, thereby expanding the treatment options. The MIST guideline provides guidance on the treatment choice of different minimally invasive procedures depending on the patient's disease characteristics. The algorithm proposed here (Figure 1) serves as a guide to help clinicians improve treatment selection for patients diagnosed with LSS or who have a suspicion of LSS. The following points are considered of special interest:

Figure 1
Lumbar Spinal Stenosis management algorithm.

Following suspicion of LSS, and based on physical examination and ZCQ score, conservative treatment may be initiated. The presence of so-called red flags should always lead to (additional) imaging studies and consultation with neurological specialists.
When physical therapy and medication have failed, other treatments such as diagnostic medial branch block (MBB), intra-articular facet injections, and medial branch RFA of the lumbar facet joint nerve may be considered.
Assessment of instability is of utmost importance to assess if minimally invasive surgical options are suitable for a patient. When instability is suspected, this may be confirmed by examination of flexion and extension films, as well as the presence of significant spondylolisthesis. Other factors that may point to instability are facet joint hypertrophy with fluid collection or facet cyst formation. If patients are deemed unstable with grade > 2 spondylolisthesis, they are not suitable candidates for minimally invasive indirect decompression with an interspinous spacer.
Invasive decompression surgery should be considered in a stepwise manner: from limited open decompression with one to three segments to limited level fusion and finally extensive decompression and fusion.

### Lumbar spine stenosis: a common cause of back and… [^112g2yHS]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

A ubiquitous and potentially disabling cause of osteoarthritic pain of the lower back and legs is stenosis of the lumbar spinal canal. This treatable condition is often a major cause of inactivity, loss of productivity and, potentially, loss of independence in many persons, particularly older persons. Because of the slow progression of the disease, the diagnosis may be significantly delayed. Given the potentially devastating effects of this condition, rapid diagnosis and treatment are essential if patients are to be returned to their previous levels of activity. Some investigators have postulated that the pathologic changes that result in lumbar canal stenosis are the result of so-called micro-instability at the articular surfaces surrounding the canal. 7 Micro-instability refers to minute, abnormal repetitive motion of the joints that link adjacent vertebra.

These movements are clinically silent yet may result in progressive loss of strength in the joint capsules and lead to reactive bony and cartilaginous hypertrophy, thickening or calcification of the ligamentum flavum, or subluxation of one vertebra on another, all of which may contribute to narrowing of the lumbar canal. Compression of the microvasculature of the lumbar nerve roots, resulting in ischemia, is believed to be a major contributing factor in the development of neurogenic claudication. Wilson. Classically, the symptoms of lumbar canal stenosis begin or worsen with the onset of ambulation or by standing, and are promptly relieved by sitting or lying down. Thigh or leg pain typically precedes the onset of numbness and motor weakness. Along with numbness and weakness, these symptoms and signs constitute the syndrome of neurogenic intermittent claudication.

Degenerative subluxation of lumbar vertebrae is another cause of acquired stenosis of the lumbar spinal canal, particularly at the L4 and L5 levels, and may manifest clinically with neurogenic intermittent claudication as well. 5 Lumbar stenosis sometimes occurs following posterior lumbar fusions, possibly as a result of reactive bony hypertrophy at or adjacent to the fused segments. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to lateral recess stenosis syndrome as a cause of back pain and claudication. The lateral recess is the space within the spinal canal adjacent to the exit zone of the nerve roots. Some authors believe that, in select circumstances, medial facetectomies, foraminotomies and decompression of the lateral recesses are sufficient to relieve the symptoms of neurogenic claudication.

### Neurogenic vs. vascular… [^116QRJbr]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

A ubiquitous and potentially disabling cause of osteoarthritic pain of the lower back and legs is stenosis of the lumbar spinal canal. This treatable condition is often a major cause of inactivity, loss of productivity and, potentially, loss of independence in many persons, particularly older persons. Because of the slow progression of the disease, the diagnosis may be significantly delayed. Given the potentially devastating effects of this condition, rapid diagnosis and treatment are essential if patients are to be returned to their previous levels of activity. In most cases, stenosis of the lumbar canal may be attributed to acquired degenerative or arthritic changes of the intervertebral discs, ligaments and facet joints surrounding the lumbar canal. These changes include cartilaginous hypertrophy of the articulations surrounding the canal, intervertebral disc herniations or bulges, hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum and osteophyte formation.

Some investigators have postulated that the pathologic changes that result in lumbar canal stenosis are the result of so-called micro-instability at the articular surfaces surrounding the canal. 7 Micro-instability refers to minute, abnormal repetitive motion of the joints that link adjacent vertebra. These movements are clinically silent yet may result in progressive loss of strength in the joint capsules and lead to reactive bony and cartilaginous hypertrophy, thickening or calcification of the ligamentum flavum, or subluxation of one vertebra on another, all of which may contribute to narrowing of the lumbar canal. In the ischemic form, it is theorized that transient ischemia occurs in compressed lumbosacral roots when increased oxygen demand occurs during walking. The most commonly involved levels are L3 through L5, although clinically significant stenosis can exist at any or all lumbar levels in a given patient.

In the past, lumbar myelography was the usual method for establishing a diagnosis, but it is usually not necessary today. Modern neuroimaging techniques such as computed tomographic scanning and magnetic resonance imaging have facilitated the diagnosis in recent years. Degenerative subluxation of lumbar vertebrae is another cause of acquired stenosis of the lumbar spinal canal, particularly at the L4 and L5 levels, and may manifest clinically with neurogenic intermittent claudication as well. 5 Lumbar stenosis sometimes occurs following posterior lumbar fusions, possibly as a result of reactive bony hypertrophy at or adjacent to the fused segments.

### An algorithmic approach to treating lumbar spinal stenosis: an evidenced-based approach [^116GseAR]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) can lead to compression of the neural and vascular elements and is becoming more common due to degenerative changes that occur because of aging processes. Symptoms may manifest as pain and discomfort that radiates to the lower leg, thigh, and/or buttocks. The traditional treatment algorithm for LSS consists of conservative management (physical therapy, medication, education, exercise), often followed by epidural steroid injections (ESIs), and when nonsurgical treatment has failed, open decompression surgery with or without fusion is considered. In this review, the variables that should be considered during the management of patients with LSS are discussed, and the role of each treatment option to provide optimal care is evaluated.

Results

This review leads to the creation of an evidence-based practical algorithm to aid clinicians in the management of patients with LSS. Special emphasis is directed at minimally invasive surgery, which should be taken into consideration when conservative management and ESI have failed.

### Surgery versus nonsurgical treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis: a randomized trial [^114GRQq5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Primary care management decisions for patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) are challenging, and nonsurgical guidance is limited by lack of evidence.

Objective

To compare surgical decompression with physical therapy (PT) for LSS and evaluate sex differences.

Design

Multisite randomized, controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00022776).

Setting

Neurologic and orthopedic surgery departments and PT clinics.

Participants

Surgical candidates with LSS aged 50 years or older who consented to surgery.

Intervention

Surgical decompression or PT.

Measurements

Primary outcome was physical function score on the Short Form-36 Health Survey at 2 years assessed by masked testers.

Results

The study took place from November 2000 to September 2007. A total of 169 participants were randomly assigned and stratified by surgeon and sex (87 to surgery and 82 to PT), with 24-month follow-up completed by 74 and 73 participants in the surgery and PT groups, respectively. Mean improvement in physical function for the surgery and PT groups was 22.4 (95% CI, 16.9 to 27.9) and 19.2 (CI, 13.6 to 24.8), respectively. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed no difference between groups (24-month difference, 0.9 [CI, -7.9 to 9.6]). Sensitivity analyses using causal-effects methods to account for the high proportion of crossovers from PT to surgery (57%) showed no significant differences in physical function between groups.

Limitation

Without a control group, it is not possible to judge success attributable to either intervention.

Conclusion

Surgical decompression yielded similar effects to a PT regimen among patients with LSS who were surgical candidates. Patients and health care providers should engage in shared decision-making conversations that include full disclosure of evidence involving surgical and nonsurgical treatments for LSS.

Treatment Options

Lifestyle Modification

Improvements and alterations in lifestyle such as regular exercise, core strengthening, balanced diet, and maintaining ideal body weight have been often recommended for overall spinal health. There have not yet been any clinical trials that support this, however. The natural progression of LSS begins slowly with minimal symptoms, followed by a steep increase as critical stenosis is reached. Once LSS symptoms are noticed, it is often too late for lifestyle modifications to be significantly effective.

Epidural Injections (with/Without Steroids)

Targeted injection of local anesthetic with or without corticosteroids has been widely utilized in the treatment of neurogenic claudication due to LSS. When conservative treatments have been exhausted, patients are given the option of interventional pain management, often in the form of spinal epidural injections before surgery. Injected local anesthetics are often combined with corticosteroids to provide pain relief by reduction of local inflammation and ischemia, which are caused by the stenosis. This practice has been accepted as an alternative to more invasive surgical decompression or to help delay surgery by providing short- to medium-term pain relief. The North American Spine Society (NASS) has developed a set of evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis from their Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis Work Group. There is a Grade B recommendation (with suggestion of a Level I study and additional Level II or III studies) for the application of interlaminar epidural steroid injections to provide short-term (two weeks to six months) relief of neurogenic claudication. The long-term efficacy of interlaminar epidural steroid injections was considered controversial. Transforaminal and caudal approaches obtained a Grade C recommendation in providing medium-term (three to 36 months) pain relief. Additional evidence for spinal epidural injections to treat LSS came from two randomized controlled trials by Manchikanti et al. showing statistically significant pain relief and improvement of disability in patients with LSS undergoing both interlaminar and caudal epidural injections. Conflicting data were later published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggesting minimal benefit of epidural steroids compared with local anesthetics alone. This article was highlighted for its controversial results and was criticized for study design, inclusion criteria, data analysis, and conclusions, which led to confusion among patients and providers regarding epidural injections for spinal stenosis. Additional systematic reviews of the literature have shown modest benefits in both short- and long-term pain relief for epidural injections in treating LSS. A comprehensive review of 10 studies that included 1,010 subjects indicated a minimal difference between the use of injected epidural steroids vs local anesthetic only.

### Data sources… [^1151MNB1]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the vertebral canal. Approximately 1. 2 million people in the United States have back and leg pain that is related to spinal stenosis. 1 The narrowing of the vertebral canal may lead to compression of the spinal nerves or nerve roots, especially in the area of the lumbar vertebrae. 2, 3. Degenerative lumbar stenosis is common in elderly adults; bony overgrowth and ligament enlargement into the spinal canal, intervertebral disc herniation, or vertebral slippage may be responsible for nerve compression. This compression results in low back pain, leg fatigue and pain, and reduced capacity for physical activity. Neurogenic claudication describes a combination of low back pain, leg pain, numbness, and motor weakness that starts or intensifies on standing or walking and is eased by sitting or lying down.

Although symptomatic stenosis involves some degree of neurogenic claudication, not all patients with lumbar spinal stenosis are symptomatic or exhibit neurogenic claudication. Symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis may be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe, based on the extent of leg pain and pain-related disability. 4, 5 Patients with severe symptoms have exercise intolerance and greatly restricted walking capacity, and may have bladder dysfunction. 3, 6 Conservative treatment with pain-relieving agents seems to be the natural choice when symptoms are mild. 3, 5 Decompressive surgery to remove the bone and ligaments around the stenosis usually is recommended for patients with severe symptoms when conservative therapy has not provided adequate pain relief. 3, 5 Patients with moderate symptoms fall into a gray zone in which the most appropriate treatment is not obvious.

This article reviews the evidence for conservative and surgical treatments for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. A detailed discussion of the anatomy, pathophysiology, clinical history, physical examination, and differential diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis has appeared in American Family Physician. 3 Our systematic review of the evidence revealed problems with study design and quality. These problems complicated the literature assessment for conservative and surgical interventions. However, some important findings from the better studies were identified and are summarized in. Table 1. 4–12 Our findings should be viewed as showing potential relationships between treatments, patient characteristics, and treatment outcomes. Definitive evidence-based conclusions about the efficacy of conservative or surgical treatments for lumbar spinal stenosis await the results of well-designed clinical trials.

### Perspective: a proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for management of lumbar spinal stenosis: an integrated team approach [^116Z5Qbt]. Pain Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Newly-introduced minimally invasive interventions have filled a gap between conservative care and open surgical procedures in the treatment and management of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), allowing expanded access to patient care. This spectrum of care involves an important interplay between advanced practice providers, interventional pain physicians, and spine surgeons.

Objectives

Using an integrated team approach starting with history taking; static and dynamic imaging; and conservative care, we developed a simple, understandable clinical algorithm that serves as a foundation for physicians to confidently make objective decisions regarding diagnosing and treating LSS throughout the entire clinical course of the condition. We believe this could potentially lead to more efficient and effective care for patients suffering from LSS with neurogenic claudication.

Methods

A decision tree approach was utilized with "either/or" choices at each branch or node in the algorithm. Activities are divided into examination procedures and corresponding treatment interventions. Symptom and radiographic severity grading as well as assessing clinical status employed published validated standards. Commensurate treatment choices were selected based on published LSS-specific clinical practice guidelines and/or meta-analyses.

Results

This algorithm recommends a systematic rule set for LSS diagnostic and treatment options. Initially, LSS symptom severity is graded based on the patient's pain relief with spinal flexion. This is correlated with radiographic severity assessment graded as mild, moderate, or severe. Radiographic severity combined with dynamic imaging prescribes a choice of treatment options and a risk/benefit discussion with the patient. These options include conservative management, minimally invasive methods such as interspinous process decompression, and more invasive surgical procedures such as laminectomy for increasing grades of radiographic severity.

Limitations

Understanding that each patient with LSS is managed on a case-by-case basis, the treatment options recommended by this algorithm should be considered "soft guidance". As such, integrated team/patient consultation is recommended to ensure maximum clinical benefit. A risk/benefit assessment and discussion should be performed with each individual patient.

Conclusions

Our proposed algorithm offers an easy-to-use clinical tool and general foundation for identifying, evaluating, and treating patients with intermittent neurogenic claudication associated with LSS.

### Lumbar spinal stenosis in older adults [^1115th1Y]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a frequent cause of low back pain among adults, caused by a narrowing impinging on the spinal cord or nerve roots. Several conditions cause LSS, including disc herniation, spondylolisthesis, tumor, fractures, and other degenerative changes. Back pain is frequently experienced. MRI is the radiologic modality of choice. Radiographic evidence of LSS may not correlate well with symptoms. An increase in utilization of surgery has been noted. However, surgery has no significant benefit over more conservative options. An appropriate risk/benefit discussion between the patient and an interdisciplinary medical team is optimal.

### Surgical versus nonsurgical therapy for lumbar spinal stenosis [^116bUen6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Surgery for spinal stenosis is widely performed, but its effectiveness as compared with nonsurgical treatment has not been shown in controlled trials.

Methods

Surgical candidates with a history of at least 12 weeks of symptoms and spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis (as confirmed on imaging) were enrolled in either a randomized cohort or an observational cohort at 13 U.S. spine clinics. Treatment was decompressive surgery or usual nonsurgical care. The primary outcomes were measures of bodily pain and physical function on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) and the modified Oswestry Disability Index at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 and 2 years.

Results

A total of 289 patients were enrolled in the randomized cohort, and 365 patients were enrolled in the observational cohort. At 2 years, 67% of patients who were randomly assigned to surgery had undergone surgery, whereas 43% of those who were randomly assigned to receive nonsurgical care had also undergone surgery. Despite the high level of nonadherence, the intention-to-treat analysis of the randomized cohort showed a significant treatment effect favoring surgery on the SF-36 scale for bodily pain, with a mean difference in change from baseline of 7.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 14.1); however, there was no significant difference in scores on physical function or on the Oswestry Disability Index. The as-treated analysis, which combined both cohorts and was adjusted for potential confounders, showed a significant advantage for surgery by 3 months for all primary outcomes; these changes remained significant at 2 years.

Conclusions

In the combined as-treated analysis, patients who underwent surgery showed significantly more improvement in all primary outcomes than did patients who were treated nonsurgically. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00000411 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — this North American Spine Society (NASS) clinical guideline's objective is to "provide evidence-based recommendations to address key clinical questions surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis" and it was developed "as an educational tool to assist practitioners who treat patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis". The document emphasizes that "THIS GUIDELINE DOES NOT REPRESENT A 'STANDARD OF CARE', nor is it intended as a fixed treatment protocol" and that "Treatment should be based on the individual patient's need and doctor's professional judgment". The target population "encompasses adults (18 years or older) with a chief complaint of low back pain and/or lower extremity symptoms related to spinal stenosis and degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis", and the guideline "outlines conservative treatment options for adult patients with this diagnosis".

### Clinical assessment and management of lumbar spinal stenosis: clinical dilemmas and considerations for surgical referral [^111zCB6f]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis is the leading indication for spine surgery in older adults. Surgery is recommended in clinical guidelines if non-surgical treatments have been provided with insufficient benefit. The difficulty for clinicians is that the current number of randomised controlled trials is low, which creates uncertainty about which treatments to provide. For non-surgical clinicians this paucity of data leads to a clinical dilemma of whether to continue managing the patient or refer to a spine surgeon. This Viewpoint aims to provide an update on the assessment of lumbar spinal stenosis, treatment recommendations, indications for referral to a spine surgeon, and current clinical dilemmas facing non-surgical clinicians and spinal surgeons.
