## Question

A 5-year-old girl brought to the emergency department by her mother with seizures. The blood glucose is 94 mg/dl and the serum calcium is 5.3 mg/dl; however, the PTH levels are low. The medical history includes a delay in achieving developmental milestones. Her mother also says she needs frequent hospital visits due to recurrent bouts with the flu. The cardiovascular examination is within normal limits. What is the most likely cause underlying this presentation?
A. B cell development failure
B. Lysosomal trafficking regulator gene defect
C. Deletion of the chromosome 22q11
D. Mutation in the WAS gene

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which genetic cause best explains a 5-year-old girl presenting with seizures, hypocalcemia, low PTH, developmental delay, and recurrent infections, and to choose among B-cell failure, lysosomal trafficking defect, 22q11.2 deletion, and WAS mutation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biochemical pattern and whether it fits hypoparathyroidism. Then, I should verify which syndromic causes of hypoparathyroidism also explain developmental delay and immune dysfunction. Next, I will examine each option against the clinical phenotype. Finally, I will confirm the most likely diagnosis and briefly consider immediate management implications.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical signature. Seizures with low total calcium and inappropriately low PTH strongly suggest hypoparathyroidism, where PTH deficiency impairs renal calcium reabsorption, intestinal calcium absorption via 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and bone calcium release, yielding hypocalcemia and often hyperphosphatemia; I should double-check that the PTH is truly inappropriately low for the degree of hypocalcemia, which would exclude pseudohypoparathyroidism where PTH is high or normal-high despite hypocalcemia [^114tFU9o] [^1178NX1e] [^116TNHqW].

> Wait, let me verify the syndromic context. Developmental delay plus recurrent infections in a child with hypoparathyroidism points toward a disorder with both parathyroid and thymic involvement affecting adaptive immunity. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge/velocardiofacial) classically features thymic hypoplasia with T-cell defects, hypoparathyroidism, and neurodevelopmental issues, and hypocalcemia can present at various ages, including later childhood, so this pattern fits well here [^113btkYz] [^1121n6WR] [^111ubRgi].

> I will now examine Option A, B-cell development failure. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: isolated B-cell failure would not explain low PTH and hypocalcemia, and although antibody-mediated immunity would be impaired, the parathyroid glands are not B-cell–dependent. Thus, this option does not account for the endocrine abnormality and is less likely than a T-cell–centric immunodeficiency with parathyroid aplasia/hypoplasia such as 22q11.2 deletion [^1121n6WR].

> Next, I should review Option B, a lysosomal trafficking regulator gene defect. Let me think about this: while lysosomal storage diseases can cause developmental delay, they do not classically produce isolated hypoparathyroidism with low PTH. Moreover, the vignette lacks storage features or organomegaly, and there is no strong link between lysosomal trafficking defects and parathyroid dysfunction, making this a poor mechanistic fit for the biochemical pattern [^notfound].

> Now, Option C, deletion of chromosome 22q11. I should confirm the triad here: thymic hypoplasia causing T-cell dysfunction and recurrent infections, parathyroid aplasia/hypoplasia causing hypocalcemia with low or inappropriately normal PTH, and neurodevelopmental delay. Multiple series document variable parathyroid reserve and a high lifetime prevalence of hypocalcemia in 22q11.2 deletion, with seizures as a recognized presentation, so this aligns tightly with the case phenotype [^1121n6WR] [^111ubRgi] [^113btkYz] [^1151dRAf].

> But wait, what if Option D, a WAS mutation, is the culprit? I need to check this carefully. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome features eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections due to combined immunodeficiency, but it does not cause hypoparathyroidism or low PTH; thus, the biochemical signature here would be incompatible with WAS, even though the infection history might otherwise sound superficially consistent [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. The triad of hypocalcemia with low PTH, developmental delay, and recurrent infections is most parsimoniously explained by 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which uniquely combines thymic T-cell defects and parathyroid dysfunction. The other options either miss the endocrine abnormality or do not match the immunologic pattern, so the most likely answer is C, deletion of chromosome 22q11 [^1121n6WR] [^111ubRgi] [^113btkYz].

> I should double-check immediate management implications briefly. In a child with symptomatic hypocalcemia and seizures, urgent intravenous calcium is indicated while confirming the diagnosis. Oral calcium and active vitamin D are used chronically for hypoparathyroidism, and genetic confirmation of 22q11.2 deletion guides immunology and developmental follow-up. This aligns with pediatric endocrine guidance for hypocalcemia and hypoparathyroidism management [^1143TALd] [^1175DUnU] [^114bvFbt].

---

The most likely cause of this presentation is **22q11.2 deletion syndrome** (DiGeorge syndrome) [^113btkYz], which explains the seizures, hypocalcemia with low PTH, developmental delay, and recurrent infections due to thymic hypoplasia and hypoparathyroidism [^1121n6WR]. This diagnosis is supported by the classic triad of **hypocalcemia, low PTH, and recurrent infections** [^notfound], and is the only option that coherently accounts for all features.

---

## Clinical features and laboratory findings

- **Seizures**: Commonly associated with hypocalcemia, a hallmark of hypoparathyroidism [^114tFU9o].

- **Hypocalcemia with low PTH**: Indicates hypoparathyroidism, a characteristic feature of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^1179anYh].

- **Developmental delay**: Frequently observed in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome due to genetic abnormalities affecting neurodevelopment [^notfound].

- **Recurrent infections**: Thymic hypoplasia in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome leads to T-cell deficiency and increased susceptibility to infections [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Option** | **Description** | **Relevance to presentation** |
|-|-|-|
| A | B cell development failure | - Does not explain hypocalcemia or low PTH <br/> - Not consistent with recurrent infections without T-cell involvement |
| B | Lysosomal trafficking regulator gene defect | - Does not explain hypocalcemia or low PTH <br/> - Not associated with recurrent infections or developmental delay |
| C | Deletion of chromosome 22q11 | - Explains **hypocalcemia** <br/> - Low **PTH** <br/> - Developmental delay <br/> - And recurrent infections due to **thymic hypoplasia** [^notfound] |
| D | Mutation in the WAS gene | - Associated with immunodeficiency <br/> - But does not explain hypocalcemia or low PTH |

---

## Conclusion

The most likely cause of this child's presentation is **22q11.2 deletion syndrome** (DiGeorge syndrome), which comprehensively explains the seizures, hypocalcemia with low PTH, developmental delay, and recurrent infections [^1121n6WR].

### Neonatal seizures and familial hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia [^114QTA7E]. Pediatric Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

This report describes two female siblings suffering from hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia, diagnosed at the third and fifth week of age. They both presented with recurrent generalized convulsions. Because their serum calcium levels were low at the early stage, the diagnosis of late-onset neonatal hypocalcemia was mistakenly made. Their seizures did not respond to parenteral calcium initially, but were completely terminated after the administration of magnesium. The possible cause of hypomagnesemia in these two patients was the selective defect of magnesium absorption in the small intestine. Both patients continued to receive daily supplement of magnesium orally to the last follow-up appointment at the ages of 23 and 12 years, respectively. Despite having several generalized seizures before the correct diagnosis and proper treatment, normal physical and mental development was achieved in both patients.

Discussion

Here, we present 10 genetically confirmed KCS2 cases from 7 families. Our patient cohort further extends the spectrum of KCS2-associated features, showing the presence of CKD (60%) and intellectual disability (30%) in a subset of patients. Moreover, we performed a systematic review of the literature on KCS1 and KCS2, describing 205 KCS patients. Our systematic approach demonstrates that the phenotypes of KCS1 and KCS2 substantially overlap.

Overlapping symptoms in KCS1 and KCS2 include postnatal growth retardation, cerebral calcifications, seizures or muscle spasms, eye abnormalities such as pseudopapilledema and cataracts, and dental abnormalities including delayed dentition and early tooth decay. In addition, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, low PTH, and hyperphosphatemia occur in both KCS types. This is a unique combination of electrolyte disturbances, otherwise only described in autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, caused by pathogenic variants in the calcium sensing receptor or G protein subunit alpha 11, and in 1 rare case of Gitelman syndrome caused by a pathogenic variant in the Na/Cl cotransporter. The fact that KCS1 patients show the electrolyte disturbances more consistently than KCS2 patients may indicate that serum electrolyte levels in KCS2 patients are more variable over time. This is supported by the fact that the range of PTH levels was significantly greater in KCS2 patients. Indeed, while a previous report described the absence of parathyroid glands in a KCS2 patient suggesting this to be the primary defect, patients with normal PTH have also been described. Three of these 4 patients with normal PTH levels also had normal calcium levels, of whom 1 did have low serum magnesium. Interestingly, hypercalciuria occurred much more frequently in KCS1 than in KCS2 (85% vs 9%), which may point toward a different cause of hypocalcemia in KCS2. We did find urinary magnesium loss in several KCS2 patients (F1-II-2, F3-II-2) with hypomagnesemia. In another previously reported KCS2 patient, magnesium supplementation corrected serum calcium and PTH levels, suggesting that hypocalcemia and low PTH levels were secondary to magnesium loss in this patient. We were also able to identify some features that are useful in discriminating between KCS1 and KCS2. Delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle, as well as cortical thickening and medullary stenosis of the long bones, are much more common in KCS2 than KCS1. Hypoparathyroidism typically leads to reduced bone turnover. However, as the specific bone phenotype of KCS2 is unique compared with other hypoparathyroidism-related disorders, the KCS2 bone phenotype appears to be caused by something else. Potentially, imbalance of other hormones such as calcitriol, GH, thyroid hormones, or sex hormones could contribute, but values for these hormones have not been reported frequently in KCS. Hypothyroidism has been reported in several KCS patients (12/24 in KCS1, 3/4 in KCS2), occurring both overtly and subclinically. In KCS1, both primary and secondary hypothyroidism have been reported. In KCS2, TSH values in hypothyroidism were low, suggestive of secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism. Tertiary hypothyroidism was confirmed in 1 KCS2 patient. Other discriminatory features include intellectual disability and intrauterine growth retardation, which are more common in KCS1. In addition, sleep apnea, hypoglycemia, and reduced spleen function sometimes occur in KCS1 and have rarely been reported in KCS2.

### First seizure as late presentation of velo-cardio-facial syndrome [^1151dRAf]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Congenital hypoparathyroidism caused by velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS) typically presents with hypocalcemia in the neonatal period associated with other characteristic findings. We report the case of an 8-year-old boy presenting a hypocalcemic seizure (ionized calcium, 0.65 mM); he had a history of velopharyngeal insufficiency and late development with language impairment; at presentation, minor dysmorphic features were noticed. Laboratory evaluation revealed a parathormone level of < 1.0 pg/mL. VCFS was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization study revealing the 22q11.2 deletion. High levels of calcium administration were needed to normalize serum calcium. In this case, signs of hypoparathyroidism only developed in late childhood, and the patient, despite the minor clinical signs of VCFS, remained symptom-free. He presented no cardiac malformations, immunologic abnormalities, or renal dysfunction often associated with this diagnosis. In a child with hypocalcemia, considering the hypothesis of VCFS, even if there are no other manifestations, is important both for clinical diagnosis and management and for genetic counseling.

Pediatric vitamin D status by season and latitude — winter vulnerability and prevalence are reported: Children of all ages are more susceptible to low vitamin D levels during the winter compared with the summer months. In Iowa (41° north), during winter, 78% of unsupplemented breastfed infants had 25(OH)-D levels of < 27.5 nmol/L (11 ng/mL), versus only 1% during summer. In Edmonton, Alberta (52° north), the prevalence of 25(OH)-D levels of < 40 nmol/L (16 ng/mL) at the end of winter was 22% and 20% in boys and girls 2 to 8 years old and 69% and 35% in boys and girls 9 to 16 years old, respectively; infants with florid rickets often first present in late winter or early spring at 6 to 12 months of age with hypocalcemia and convulsions or tetany.

### Hypovitaminosis D and severe hypocalcaemia: the rebirth of an old disease [^116Hx6Q5]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency, once thought to be eradicated, is becoming a frequent occurence in children, caused mainly by dietary insufficiency. The classical manifestation is rickets, but in infants severe hypocalcaemia may present as stridor, tetany, seizures or, rarely, heart disease. Here, we describe four infants who presented with complications of severe hypocalcaemia secondary to nutritional vitamin D deficiency. (1) Female, 4 months old, several spasms. (2) Male, 8 days old, generalised tonic-clonic seizure. (3) Male, 9 months old, tetany. (4) Male, 4 months old, cardiogenic shock. The cases highlight the importance of child vitamin D supplementation from birth and throughout childhood. We also note that the vitamin D state should be evaluated by the 25(OH)-D value and not the 1,25(OH)2-D.

### The many etiologies of neonatal hypocalcemic seizures [^115pUhJy]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Seizures during the neonatal period have a broad differential diagnosis. Unlike in developing countries where hypovitaminosis D and hypocalcemia constitutes a major cause of infantile seizures, the number of neonatal seizures attributed to hypocalcemia in developed countries has decreased dramatically due to the improvement of infant formulas and vitamin D supplementation. In these countries, most infants that present with hypocalcemic seizures have underlying endocrinological etiologies rather than dietary insufficiencies. Here, we describe 3 cases of neonatal seizures due to hypocalcemia. Although the symptoms and calcium concentrations at presentation were similar in all 3 cases, the course of the disease and the final diagnosis for each were distinct. The cases are presented along with a brief review of the pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and treatment of neonatal hypocalcemia.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^113dopje]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency–associated hypocalcemia — calcium and calcitriol dosing guidance includes that hypocalcemia should be treated with calcium supplements, with parenteral calcium as calcium gluconate (10–20 mg of elemental calcium per kg intravenously slowly over 5–10 minutes, usually given as 1–2 mL/kg of 10% calcium gluconate) in cases of manifest tetany or convulsions. Recommended doses of elemental calcium are 30 to 75 mg/kg per day in 3 divided doses, and calcitriol may be necessary in doses of 20 to 100 ng/kg per day in 2 to 3 divided doses until calcium levels normalize. High doses of calcium are necessary early in the course of therapy, after which doses are reduced by half for the next 1 to 2 weeks. Once vitamin D is reduced to 400 IU/day with normal PTH and 25(OH)-D levels, calcium supplementation is usually not necessary.

### Neonatal hypocalcemic seizures in offspring of a mother with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 (FHH1) [^112e94xN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 (FHH1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), which is encoded by the CASR gene on chromosome 3q21.1. The CaSR regulates calcium homeostasis by enhancing intracellular calcium (Ca 2+ i) mobilization and stimulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which in turn reduces parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and increases urinary calcium excretion. FHH1 is generally benign and characterized by mild-to-moderate elevations of serum calcium, normal or mildly raised serum PTH, and a calcium-to-creatinine clearance ratio of less than 0.01. However, the offspring of individuals with FHH1 may manifest a variety of disturbances of calcium homeostasis. Thus, children inheriting biallelic loss-of-function CaSR mutations from FHH1 parents can develop neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism. In addition, children inheriting a monoallelic loss-of-function CaSR mutation from the father are at risk of neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism if the mother is normocalcemic, whereas they would likely develop the more benign phenotype of FHH1 if they inherited the loss-of-function CaSR mutation from the mother, and can occasionally be normocalcemic because of incomplete penetrance of the CaSR mutation. Furthermore, maternal hypercalcemia caused by FHH1 may potentially cause transient hypoparathyroidism in the unaffected offspring, and such hypocalcemia has been reported in 2 unrelated neonates born to mothers with clinically diagnosed FHH, although the CASR mutation status in these cases was not established. Here, we report a 3-generation FHH1 kindred with a novel loss-of-function CASR mutation (p. Ser448Pro), in which an affected mother, who was heterozygous for the CaSR mutation, had 4 children, 2 of whom had asymptomatic hypercalcemia in association with the heterozygous CaSR Ser448Pro mutation, 1 without a CaSR mutation was normocalcemic, whereas another, also without a CaSR mutation, had hypocalcemic seizures as a consequence of transient neonatal hypoparathyroidism.

### Cardiac, bone and growth plate manifestations in hypocalcemic infants: revealing the hidden body of the vitamin D deficiency iceberg [^111U4KCh]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Patient 1

A 6-month old exclusively breastfed, African boy presented to the emergency department (ED) with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. In the weeks prior to presentation, he had 3 brief episodes of peri-oral cyanosis and pallor and presented twice to ED with increased work of breathing. On initial assessment by paramedics he showed no signs of life and was in asystole. He was resuscitated until spontaneous circulation was restored at 36 min. Investigations revealed low ionised calcium (0.72 mmol/L), warranting repeated intravenous calcium boluses followed by continuous infusion. Cefotaxime was commenced for presumed sepsis, and oseltamivir was added after isolating influenza A on a nasal swab. Intravenous fluids and inotropes were administered. In the intensive care unit, an echocardiogram showed severe dilated cardiomyopathy with poor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25–30% [normal 55–70%]), fractional shortening (FS) of 7% [normal 29–40%], dyskinetic septal motion, global hypokinesia, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with a structurally normal heart. Rickets was confirmed radiographically (Fig. 1b), with elevated serum ALP and PTH concentrations, and low 25OHD < 15 nmol/L (Table 1). Cholecalciferol (6000 IU daily) was commenced, and intravenous calcium was continued until serum calcium normalised (72 h). Cardiac failure was managed with diuretics and vasodilators. Brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed severe hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, correlating with the clinical finding of unresponsiveness to external stimuli. The care team and family elected to withdraw life support, and the infant died 6 days after presentation.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^115qyHxu]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Severe vitamin D deficiency — Currently, severe deficiency is somewhat arbitrarily defined as a 25(OH)-D level of ≤ 12.5 nmol/L (5 ng/mL). In one study, 86% of the children studied who had 25(OH)-D levels of < 20 nmol/L (8 ng/mL) had rickets, and 94% of the hypocalcemic children with vitamin D deficiency had levels of < 20 nmol/L (8 ng/mL).

### Cardiac, bone and growth plate manifestations in hypocalcemic infants: revealing the hidden body of the vitamin D deficiency iceberg [^116N5Wwm]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Whilst hypocalcemic complications from vitamin D deficiency are considered rare in high-income countries, they are highly prevalent among Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) group with darker skin. To date, the extent of osteomalacia in such infants and their family members is unknown. Our aim was to investigate clinical, cardiac and bone histomorphometric characteristics, bone matrix mineralization in affected infants and to test family members for biochemical evidence of osteomalacia.

Case Presentation

Three infants of BAME origin (aged 5–6 months) presented acutely in early-spring with cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest following seizure or severe respiratory distress, with profound hypocalcemia (serum calcium 1.22–1.96 mmol/L). All infants had dark skin and vitamin D supplementation had not been addressed during child surveillance visits. All three had severely dilated left ventricles (z-scores +4.6 to +6.5) with reduced ejection fraction (25–30%; normal 55–70), fractional shortening (7 to 15%; normal 29–40) and global hypokinesia, confirming hypocalcemic dilated cardiomyopathy. They all had low serum levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD < 15 nmol/L), and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH; 219–482 ng/L) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP; 802–1123 IU/L), with undiagnosed rickets on radiographs. One infant died from cardiac arrest. At post-mortem examination, his growth plate showed a widened, irregular zone of hypertrophic chondrocytes. Histomorphometry and backscattered electron microscopy of a trans-iliac bone biopsy sample revealed increased osteoid thickness (+262% of normal) and osteoid volume/bone volume (+1573%), and extremely low bone mineralization density. Five of the nine tested family members had vitamin D deficiency (25OHD < 30 nmol/L), three had insufficiency (< 50 nmol/L) and 6/9 members had elevated PTH and ALP levels.

Conclusions

The severe, hidden, cardiac and bone pathology described here exposes a failure of public health prevention programs, as complications from vitamin D deficiency are entirely preventable by routine supplementation. The family investigations demonstrate widespread deficiency and undiagnosed osteomalacia in ethnic risk groups and call for protective legislation.

### Prevalence of hypocalcaemia and its associated features in 22q11. 2 deletion syndrome [^111NPXt1]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Hypomagnesaemia

We reviewed available serum magnesium values (n = 84) because hypomagnesaemia is known to inhibit PTH activity. There was no significant association between the lifetime prevalence of hypomagnesaemia (13 of 84 subjects) and lifetime hypocalcaemia. However, the cooccurrence of hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia at measurement was significant (P = 0.046, two-tailed Fisher's exact test). Furthermore, among the 19 hypocalcaemic measurements with concurrent low intact PTH, six (31.6%) also had concurrent low serum magnesium documented. Conversely, only eight (10.8%) of 74 hypocalcaemic measurements with normal intact PTH were accompanied by hypomagnesaemia. As expected, in the presence of hypocalcaemia, the intact PTH level was significantly associated with hypomagnesaemia (χ 2 = 2.91, df = 1, P = 0.02).

### Loss of seizure control due to anticonvulsant-induced hypocalcemia [^11676U6R]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of loss of seizure control due to hypocalcemia resulting from long-term treatment with phenytoin and phenobarbital.

Case Summary

A 32-year-old mentally retarded man presented with a 12-month history of loss of seizure control, after being seizure-free for 5 years on a fixed regimen of phenobarbital and phenytoin. He had been institutionalized at the age of 10 years and had received anticonvulsant drugs since he was diagnosed with tonic-clonic epilepsy 20 years ago. On investigation, serum concentrations of the anticonvulsant drugs were within the therapeutic range, indicating adequate medication dosages. Serum biochemistry was consistent with vitamin D deficiency: hypocalcemia, reduced 25-hydroxyvitamin D, increased alkaline phosphatase, and increased parathormone. Seizure control was regained after serum calcium had been normalized with administration of vitamin D and calcium.

Discussion

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) cause vitamin D deficiency through induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize vitamin D. Institutionalized subjects are more vulnerable because of the added factors of multidrug therapy, poor diet, reduced exposure to sunlight, and physical inactivity. The resulting hypocalcemia can cause reactive seizures, thus offsetting the anticonvulsant action of the drugs. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse reactions of both phenobarbital and phenytoin were probable.

Conclusions

Hypocalcemic seizures are uncommon and underdiagnosed complications of long-term therapy with AEDs. Loss of seizure control in a patient stabilized on AEDs is an indication to check the patient's calcium status. Proper treatment of this complication is vitamin D and calcium supplementation. Prophylactic supplementation with vitamin D is necessary in institutionalized patients treated with AEDs.

### Hypoparathyroidism [^114tFU9o]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is a disease characterized by inadequately low circulating concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) resulting in low calcium levels and increased phosphate levels in the blood. Symptoms of the disease result from increased neuromuscular irritability caused by hypocalcaemia and include tingling, muscle cramps and seizures. The most common cause of the disease is inadvertent removal of, or injury to, the parathyroid glands during neck surgery, followed by genetic, idiopathic and autoimmune aetiologies. Conventional treatment includes activated vitamin D and/or calcium supplements, but this treatment does not fully replace the functions of PTH and can lead to short-term problems (such as hypocalcaemia, hypercalcaemia and increased urinary calcium excretion) and long-term complications (which include nephrocalcinosis, kidney stones and brain calcifications). PTH replacement has emerged as a new treatment option. Clinical trials using human PTH(1–34) and PTH(1–84) showed that this treatment was safe and effective in studies lasting up to 6 years. Recombinant human PTH(1–84) has been approved in the United States and Europe for the management of hypoparathyroidism; however, its effect on long-term complications is still being evaluated. Clinical practice guidelines, which describe the consensus of experts in the field, have been published and recognize the need for more research to optimize care. In this Primer, we summarize current knowledge of the prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of hypoparathyroidism.

### Parathyroid hormone — Natpara — parathyroid hormone [^112UGUfz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

Available data with NATPARA Injection use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are disease associated risks to the mother and the fetus related to hypocalcemia in pregnancy. (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when pregnant rats and rabbits were administered parathyroid hormone subcutaneously during the period of organogenesis at doses resulting in 123 times and 8 times, respectively, the human exposure at the 100 mcg/day clinical dose. When female rats were administered parathyroid hormone subcutaneously prior to birth and continuing to weaning at doses resulting in 10 times the human exposure at the 100 mcg/day clinical dose, increased incidence of dehydration, broken palate and palate injuries related to incisor misalignment and mortality were observed in offspring (see Data).

All pregnancies have a background risk of major birth defects, loss, and other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and Embryo/Fetal Risk

Maternal hypocalcemia can result in an increased rate of spontaneous abortion, premature and dysfunctional labor, and possibly preeclampsia.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions

Infants born to mothers with hypocalcemia can have associated fetal and neonatal hyperparathyroidism, which in turn can cause fetal and neonatal skeletal demineralization, subperiosteal bone resorption, osteitis fibrosa cystica and neonatal seizures. Infants born to mothers with hypocalcemia should be carefully monitored for signs of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia, including neuromuscular irritability (ranging from myotonic jerks to seizures), apnea, cyanosis and cardiac rhythm disorders.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: summary statement and guidelines from the fifth international workshop [^114DBWVe]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend to include the following in the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia and elevated levels of PTH:

- familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia in younger patients with a urinary Ca/Cr clearance ratio < 0.01 and/or a family history of hypercalcemia

- thiazide diuretics and lithium

- ectopic secretion of PTH (very rare).

### Evaluating the variety of GNAS inactivation disorders and their clinical manifestations in 11 Chinese children [^115cNbv2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

All of the patients recruited to this study presented with clinical features related to GNAS inactivation. We classified these patients into different disease types based on their clinical and molecular evaluations and performed genotype–phenotype correlation analysis. This revealed that patients with PTH resistance, such as P3, may present with hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and muscle weakness. Despite the presence of PTH resistance in patients 1 and 2, some cases might have elevated PTH levels with normal serum calcium and phosphate levels. There was no resistance to the effects of PTH in the bone or ascending tubules of these patients that could explain this outcome. Other subtypes of PHP could be distinguished from PHP1a based on these features. Furthermore, subclinical hypothyroidism was a hallmark of PHP1a. Both patients, P1 and P3, experienced elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with normal free thyroxine 4 (FT4) levels, suggesting that both of these patients were suffering from subclinical hypothyroidism. Patients P4, P5, and P6 presented with increased TSH and decreased FT4, which indicated TSH resistance, and all three received L-Thyroxine therapy.

The AHO phenotype, which is characterized by both skeletal and developmental defects, is a group of physical characteristics with variable expressivities. A clinical review showed that there were two different periods characterized by: 1) round face, rapid weight gain, subclinical hypothyroidism, and subcutaneous calcifications in toddlers, and 2) moderate intellectual disability, brachydactyly, afebrile seizures (hypocalcemia), short stature, and TSH resistance in older children. The presentation of our patients were consistent with the above clinical studies. In addition, brachydactyly and heterotopic ossifications have been thought to be the most distinctive feature of the AHO phenotype. Moreover, we observed strabismus in patient 3 and 9; this symptom has been reported in other studies and may represent an additional AHO-related feature.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^113sUr3o]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — screening advises that pediatricians "should have a low threshold for screening for vitamin D deficiency" in the presence of nonspecific symptoms, in dark-skinned infants at higher latitudes in winter and spring, in children on anticonvulsants or chronic glucocorticoids, and in those with malabsorption-related diseases; "Another possible group to consider screening" is children with frequent fractures and low bone mineral density. A practical tool is "serum ALP, which if elevated for age should be followed with measurements of serum 25(OH)-D, calcium, phosphorus, and PTH", along with "radiologic examination of the distal ends of (1) the radius and ulna (wrist anteroposterior view) or (2) tibia and femur (knee anteroposterior view)"; reference ranges note "ALP levels are usually < 500 IU/L in neonates and < 1000 IU/L in children up to 9 years of age", and "the wrist radiograph may be the most reliable test for detecting subclinical rickets".

### Efficacy and safety of transCon PTH in adults with hypoparathyroidism: 52-week results from the phase 3 paTHway trial [^111wpTHr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is an endocrine disease caused by insufficient levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Through its direct action on bone and kidney and indirect action on the intestine via increased synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), PTH is the primary regulator of the calcium-phosphate balance in the body. Clinical characteristics of hypoparathyroidism include hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, reduced 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels, elevated fractional excretion of calcium in urine, and low bone turnover relative to age- and sex-matched norms. As a result, individuals with hypoparathyroidism may experience a range of symptoms including neuromuscular irritability and cognitive impairment as well as renal complications and extraskeletal calcifications. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), physical functioning, and psychological well-being are also negatively impacted in individuals with hypoparathyroidism irrespective of disease etiology or serum calcium levels.

### Prevalence of hypocalcaemia and its associated features in 22q11. 2 deletion syndrome [^111ubRgi]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study showed that the high lifetime prevalence of hypocalcaemia in adults with 22q11.2DS was not only associated with hypoparathyroidism, as expected, but also associated with hypothyroidism. In addition, hypomagnesaemia may contribute to hypocalcaemia in this population, perhaps by inh-ibiting the release of PTH. Furthermore, we found that early onset of hypocalcaemia and hypoparathyroidism had a high risk of later recurrence. This is in contrast to previous thinking about neonatal hypoparathyroidism as entirely a 'transient' phenomenon in 22q11.2DS. We further observed that subjects who had episodes of very low ionized calcium (< 1.00 m) were at greater risk of developing hypocalcaemic seizures, as expected. This is the first systematic study to test for potential features associated with lifetime prevalence of hypocalcaemia and to investigate its long-term manifestation in adults with 22q11.2DS. Results of this study contribute to our understanding of the long-term outcome of hypocalcaemia and possible interacting features in 22q11.2DS.

The overall lifetime prevalence of hypocalcaemia in our adult cohort (80.4%) is higher than that in two previous retrospective studies, reporting hypocalcaemia in 77 (49%) of 158 paediatric patientsand 203 (60%) of 340 patients of mixed ages from across Europe. In our adult cohort, 64.8% of the first documented hypocalcaemic episodes were after age 17 years. This could be an overestimation due to the fact that routine calcium/PTH testing began in adulthood for most subjects, after the diagnosis of 22q11.2DS. We made every effort to review available paediatric records including laboratory values. However, subjects could have experienced asymptomatic or subclinical hypocalcaemic episodes as children that did not lead to follow-up by endocrinologists or a formal diagnosis entered into medical records. Nevertheless, we found that neonatal/paediatric onset of hypocalcaemia and hypoparathyroidism had high rates of recurrence in adulthood.

### Case report: acute clinical presentation and neonatal management of primary hyperparathyroidism due to a novel CaSR mutation [^116FnZJr]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of calcium homeostasis that presents shortly after birth, characterized by striking hyperparathyroidism, marked hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroid bone disease.

NSHPT patients shows hypotonia, respiratory distress, bone fractures, intestinal dysmotility and failure to thrive and their neurological development can be significantly affected. If NSHPT is not diagnosed and treated it can be fatal. NSHPT is caused by a loss of function of the calcium-sensing receptor CaSR, whose gene is encoded in the long arm of chromosome 3 (3p-13.3–21). More than 250 different CaSR inactivating mutations have been described. The type of mutation can affect both clinical severity and response to treatment. CaSR is a G-protein-coupled receptor found in many tissues throughout the body, but its action is best understood in the parathyroid gland and in the kidney, where parathyroid hormone (PTH) synthesis and secretion and calcium reabsorption and excretion are regulated, respectively. PTH is the main regulator of serum calcium levels and its secretion from the parathyroid is regulated by signals from CaSR. Different treatment options have been proposed for NSHPT, such as drug therapies or surgical removal of the hyperplastic parathyroids. Recently calcimimetics (Cinacalcet) have been used to increase the calcium-responsiveness of mutated CaSR proteins with significant and lasting effect. Medical treatment of NSHPT includes also intravenous hyper-hydration, diuretics and bisphosphonates. However, total or subtotal parathyroidectomy is still the treatment of choice often needed even if very difficult in newborns. We report the case of a newborn with NSHPT due to a homozygously inherited mutation not previously described, treated first medically and then by subtotal parathyroidectomy.

Presenting concerns

A full-term AGA neonate, by third-degree cousins, born at 38 weeks by spontaneous vaginal delivery, after a normal pregnancy, with no significant obstetric and family history was discharged at the 3rd DOL home.

At 8 days of age, because of poor feeding and lethargy, paediatrician was called at home. During her visit, the neonate had a cardiorespiratory arrest. Immediately high quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (30:2, single rescuer) was initiated and maintained for 3 minutes with reappearance of vital signs. The neonate was immediately brought to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the Department of Biomedical Science and Human Oncology, of "Aldo Moro" University of Bari, Italy.

### Safety and efficacy of PTH 1–34 and 1–84 therapy in chronic hypoparathyroidism: a meta-analysis of prospective trials [^111kFZRJ]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Increased serum phosphate is considered a predictor of poor health and has been correlated with various complications of hypoparathyroidism, including an increased risk of infectious diseases. Neurological and neuropsychiatric complications are also common, including basal ganglia calcifications, which seem to be correlated with calcium phosphate product. Surprisingly, we found that PTH 1−84 was more effective than PTH 1−34 in reducing calcium phosphate product. This finding, which needs further confirmation as only four studies could be included in the analysis, suggests that PTH 1−84 is more effective in preventing ectopic calcifications.

Another challenge in managing hypoparathyroidism is the control of urinary calcium excretion. Conventional therapy with active vitamin D does not restore natural PTH‐mediated tubular calcium reabsorption. Other strategies, such as the use of thiazide diuretics, are not always feasible or tolerated. Our meta‐analysis found that PTH replacement therapy is not only safe but is also decidedly superior to conventional therapy in controlling urinary calcium excretion.

The reduced urinary calcium achieved through PTH replacement therapy lowers the risk of kidney stones, which could otherwise contribute to a progressive deterioration of renal function, and ultimately end‐stage kidney disease. Furthermore, although the sample size was not powered to ultimately address the effects on eGFR, no treatment‐associated reduction at up to 6 years of follow‐up. This is an important finding, given that conventional therapy for hypoparathyroidism is associated with a progressive decline in renal function. In short, the analysis provides convincing evidence that PTH replacement therapy is superior to any available treatment at restoring a normal electrolyte balance in relation to calcium and phosphate reabsorption and excretion.

Low bone turnover is a major clinical concern in hypoparathyroid patients. BMD data revealed only a marginal increase in lumbar spine density after PTH replacement therapy, with no effects on total hip, femoral neck, or distal radius. However, data were only available for 92 patients, with variable treatment duration (6 and 36 months). In any case, BMD may be a misleading marker for bone health in hypoparathyroidism: despite a normal or even increased BMD compared to age and sex‐matched controls, there were conflicting data on the risk of fractures. Some studies reported that patients with hypoparathyroidism have an increased risk of fractures whereas others reported no increase in the risk of fracture or a reduced risk of upper extremity fracture in postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. In contrast with the results for BMD, both bone formation and resorption markers significantly increased during PTH replacement therapy.

### Familial hypomagnesaemia, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis associated with a novel mutation of the highly conserved leucine residue 116 of claudin 16 in a Chinese patient with a delayed diagnosis: a case report [^114UpMQh]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

In Mar 2013, a 33-year-old female came to the nephrology department because of 4 years of recurrent acute pyelonephritis. She had no other notable past medical history including polyuria, polydipsia, muscular cramps, carpopedal spasms or generalized seizures, and did not take any regular medication. Her parents, who aged 56 and 53 respectively, were second cousins and denied any remarkable medical history. Her only sibling died from renal failure without definite cause at age 25. The pedigree of the family is shown in Fig. 1. Physical examination revealed that her height was 160 cm (The average height of Chinese adult females at corresponding age is 159 cm.) and her weight was 55 kg with a BMI of 21.48 kg/m 2. Laboratory workup revealed impaired renal function (SCr 250 μmol/L, EPI-eGFR = 21.1 ml/min/1.73m 2), hypocalcemia (1.42 mmol/l, normal range 2.11–2.52), and normal serum parathyroid hormone levels (65.59 pg/ml) in the context of normal 25OH-Vitamin D levels (26 ng/ml, reference range 20.0–32.0) (Table 1). Her serum magnesium level was slightly low (0.60 mmol/l, reference range 0.65–1.20), and 24-h urinary calcium was 3.9 mmol/1.73m 2 (normal range 2.5–5.5) in the setting of decreased renal function. Distal renal tubular acidosis was excluded since she had normal urine acidification function (pH < 5.3) in the setting of nearly normal serum bicarbonate level (HCO 3 − 22 mmol/l). Renal ultrasound imaging demonstrated bilateral nephrocalcinosis and parenchymal renal calculi, with the right kidney length 9.5 cm and the left 9.4 cm. Ophthalmologic examination was normal. During the subsequent 3 years of follow-up, she had undergone six attacks of acute UPI. In the interictal phase of infections, she had accepted four times of biochemical assessment (Table 1). Repeated examinations in the follow-up revealed marked renal loss of magnesium (fractional excretion 42.7 ± 7.4%, normal range less than 5%) and hypercalciuria (urinary calcium/creatine 0.52 ± 0.08 mol/mol, normal range 0.15–0.33). Treatment with calcitriol and calcium but not with magnesium was difficult to achieve a considerable effect on her serum calcium, whereas her serum magnesium concentration fluctuated within the normal range (0.70–0.91 mmol/l) under the circumstances of renal failure. Plain abdominal radiograph and abdominal CT scanning, which were performed in Mar 2014 and Feb 2016 respectively, demonstrated gradually aggravated nephrocalcinosis and atrophy of renal parenchyma (Fig. 2). In the end, the patient unavoidably reached ESRD at the age of 36. The gradient of GFR decline was calculated to be 4.3 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 /yr. during the follow up, whereas the gradient of GFR decline was about 2.1 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 /yr. 3 years before the period of follow up, and the approved global slope of decline was 2.5 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 /yr.

### Identification of an orally active small-molecule PTHR1 agonist for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism [^113TBxqK]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Lack of functional PTH results in hypoparathyroidism, which is a rare disease characterized by hypocalcemia. The clinical manifestations of hypoparathyroidism include muscle cramping and potentially life-threatening complications, such as seizure or laryngeal spasm. Conventional therapy for hypoparathyroidism involves pharmacological doses of oral Ca and active vitamin D. However, although this treatment regimen can increase intestinal absorption of Ca, it cannot restore renal Ca reabsorption, and can thereby lead to hypercalciuria. Chronic hypercalciuria can cause irreversible renal damage and eventual renal failure. To avoid such risk, studies have focused on PTH replacement therapy using the full-length, native PTH molecule called human PTH(1–84) (hPTH(1–84))or a synthetic fragment called human PTH(1–34) (hPTH(1–34)). PTH replacement therapy has been demonstrated to ameliorate the blood, renal, skeletal and neuropsychological features of hypoparathyroidism to a greater extent than conventional treatment. hPTH(1–84) and hPTH(1–34) can elevate serum Ca without raising urinary Ca in patients with hypoparathyroidism; however, due to the short half-lives of these compounds, frequent injections or continuous pump delivery is necessary to maintain serum Ca levels at a steady level. The peptidic nature (or poor oral bioavailability) of PTH(1–34) has limited its use in the treatment of osteoporosis, since daily subcutaneous injection of hPTH(1–34) is also used clinically for treating severe osteoporosis. Given the chronic nature of hypoparathyroidism and osteoporosis, orally active PTH mimetics are desirable and will benefit patients in their long-term treatment. However, no orally active compounds for PTHR1 have been identified so far.

### Variants in exons 5 and 6 of ACTB cause syndromic thrombocytopenia [^113mgqcZ]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Patient 5 (P5, Fig. 1d), a five-year-old boy of Central European ancestry, presented with congenital microcephaly that progressed into severe postnatal microcephaly. He showed multiple minor facial anomalies (Fig. 2a; straight eyebrows, telecanthus, bilateral epicantic folds, broad nasal tip and thin upper lip vermilion) and had significant delays in speech development, which progressed with combined speech and physical therapy. This patient also displayed hematological anomalies including leukocytosis with increased eosinophil count, monocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. However, he did not have a history of recurrent infections or spontaneous bleedings. P5 had platelet anisotropy with enlarged platelets (Fig. 2b), an elevated fraction of immature platelets in the peripheral blood (Supplementary Data 1) and bone marrow examination showed increased MK count (Supplementary Fig. 2). Whole exome sequencing revealed a de novo in frame deletion in the last exon of ACTB, c. 1012_1023del (Supplementary Data 2), which results in the deletion of resides 338–341 within SD1 of β-CYA (Fig. 1d right, Supplementary Fig. 1).

Patient 6 (P6, Fig. 1e), a five-year-old girl of Western European origin, presented with early developmental delay, microcephaly and a history of recurrent thrombocytopenia during the first year of life, which normalized spontaneously. She made good developmental progress following intensive combined therapies, achieving a low normal IQ at 5 years of age. Brain MRI demonstrated two unilateral periventricular nodular heterotopias with otherwise normal brain morphology. No seizures were documented at the last follow up. Whole exome sequencing revealed a de novo insertion in the last exon of ACTB, c.1101dup (Supplementary Data 2), resulting in the substitution of 8 amino acids and addition of 4 residues at the far C-terminus of β-CYA (Fig. 1e right, Supplementary Fig. 1).

Common features amongst this cohort of patients with 3′ ACTB variants include developmental delay, mild intellectual disability, microcephaly, and thrombocytopenia with platelet anisotropy and enlarged platelets (Fig. 2b, c). Given the distinct genotype–phenotype correlation, we name this actinopathy ACTB -associated syndromic thrombocytopenia (ACTB -AST).

### Case series of neonatal hypocalcemia due to pseudohypoparathyroidism [^115kLhgB]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Four children; all between 10–40 days of age, were admitted with multiple episodes of multifocal seizure. After admission blood investigation was carried out and they were found to have hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia; kidney function tests were normal. Serum parathyroid hormone was highly elevated and serum magnesium level was found to be normal in these patients. The infants did not have any other features of pseudohypoparathyroidism. The seizure was initially resistant to intravenous calcium therapy and later responded to oral calcitriol and calcium therapy. The diagnosis of pseudohypoparathyroidism was made according to biochemical investigations. The infants were symptom-free during follow-up and the biochemistry reports were also normalized. One of the infants was also suffering from neonatal hepatitis, due to CMV infection.

### Child with suspected hypocalcemia [^1175DUnU]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected hypocalcemia — initial evaluation focuses on confirming true hypocalcemia and assessing symptoms; calcium is bound heavily to albumin and hypoalbuminic states can cause hypocalcemia with ionized calcium levels maintained and the child asymptomatic, and if the child is having seizures or spasms due to hypocalcemia then intravenous calcium therapy is indicated; if symptomatic, the child needs to be admitted and started on intravenous calcium therapy, which is very irritating to the veins, and preferably therapy should be given using a central line.

### Hypoparathyroidism: a rare treatable cause of epilepsy-report of two cases [^113v1kuB]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism occurs due to insufficient production of parathyroid hormone to maintain extracellular calcium levels within the normal range. The acute clinical symptoms and signs of hypoparathyroidism are those of hypocalcaemia, ranging from tingling and numbness of limb extremities to intractable seizures. Often seizures are mistaken for epilepsy. Though hypoparathyroidism is not uncommon, the diagnosis is often missed due to its unusual clinical manifestation. This is the first documented report with vitamin D, Parathormone levels and urinary biochemical parameters from India. We present two cases of hypoparathyroidism who presented with seizures along with a short review of literature.

### Use of teriparatide in a four year old patient with autosomal dominant hypocalcaemia [^1178S5pH]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Aim

We report the effective use of the synthetic parathyroid hormone (PTH) teriparatide to treat a 4 year old boy with autosomal dominant hypocalcaemia.

Background

Autosomal Dominant hypocalcaemia is characterised by hypocalcaemia with a lack of parathyroid hormone (PTH) response and inappropriately high urinary calcium excretion. It is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the extracellular calcium sensing receptor which then "over-reads" the extracellular fluid concentration of calcium resulting in suppression of PTH secretion. This then reduces PTH-mediated calcium reabsorption in the distal nephron. Treatment of hypocalcaemia with vitamin D analogues and calcium supplements results in further increases in urinary calcium concentrations, frequently causing nephrocalcinosis and progressive renal damage. Our four year old male patient presented in the neonatal period with seizures secondary to hypocalcaemia and low PTH levels. He suffered repeated seizures with associated tetany. Treatment with alfaclacidol and calcium supplements was able to provide seizure control, however episodes of tetany continued. A heterozygous, activating mutation of the extracellular calcium sensing receptor (c.2528C > A; p. Ala843Glu) was confirmed at age 2. The treatment caused significant hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis with a reduction in GFR to 73ml/mim/m.(2) Continuing this therapy would have resulted in end stage kidney disease requiring dialysis/transplantation. The decision was made to try treatment with PTH in order to raise the plasma calcium concentration while minimising the increase in urinary calcium excretion. Funding for treatment was approved by specialised commissioning and treatment was commenced at a dose of 0.4microg/kg BD.

Administration

Teriparatide is only available in a prefilled pen (Forsteo®) delivering 20microg in 80microlitre per dose. Following discussions with the pharmacy team at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children a protocol was developed to allow these set doses to be diluted prior to administration. By diluting the 20microg dose to 0.5ml in a 1ml syringe a solution containing 40microg/ml was obtained.

Outcome

Treatment was started at 3.66 years of age. Pre-treatment adjusted plasma calcium concentration was 1.96mmol/L and the urinary calcium excretion was 0.11mmol/kg/day (normal < 0.1). After 5 days of treatment the patient felt very much better and had more energy. The adjusted plasma calcium concentration had risen to 2.09mmol/L and the urinary calcium excretion had fallen to 0.045mmol/kg/day. Over the following 9 months the dose of alfacalcidol was reduced from 600 nanograms per day to 300 nanograms per day and calcium supplements were reduced from 16mmol four times per day to zero. The teriparatide dose was increased from an initial dose of 2 microgram twice daily to 6 microgram twice daily. The plasma calcium has remained above 2mmol/L apart from a period where further weaning of the alfacalcidol dose was attempted. Rather to our surprise, the patient did not experience symptoms of hypercalcaemia with plasma calcium concentrations within the normal range. His muscle power and tone has increased. We conclude that teriparatide is a useful agent for treating patients with gain-of-function mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor/autosomal dominant hypocalcaemia.

### Neonatal hypocalcemia: common, uncommon, and rare etiologies [^113Gej6e]. NeoReviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Calcium homeostasis in the neonatal period is a reflection of the transition from placental regulation to hormonal maturation in the newborn. Hypocalcemia occurring within the first 72 hours after birth, termed early-onset hypocalcemia (EOH), is more common and often asymptomatic. Hypocalcemia occurring beyond 72 hours of age is termed late-onset hypocalcemia (LOH). LOH is less common than EOH, and affected patients are more likely to be symptomatic. To prevent and treat hypocalcemia in the newborn, neonatal clinicians should be familiar with the common, uncommon, and rare etiologies of EOH and LOH, as summarized in this review.

### Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a and insulin resistance in a child [^11128fDt]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2009). Medium credibility.

Background. A 5-year-old white girl with a history of hypothyroidism in infancy presented to the endocrinology clinic of a tertiary hospital. Her physical examination noted a stocky physique, broad chest, short neck and short digits. Two years later, skin examination revealed subcutaneous nodules and acanthosis nigricans. Investigations. Measurement of levels of serum phosphate, parathyroid hormone, ionized calcium and insulin; measurement of peak growth hormone by the arginine-levodopa stimulation test; calculation of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance; assessment of bone age; DNA analysis of the GNAS gene. Diagnosis. Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a in a patient with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, characterized by hypocalcemia, hypothyroidism, growth-hormone deficiency and insulin resistance. Management. The child continued to take levothyroxine 25 microg once daily, and at 5 years of age she was started on 40 mg/kg elemental calcium as calcium carbonate daily, and calcitriol (active vitamin D) 0.25 microg twice daily. Lifestyle modifications were also recommended for weight control. At 6 years and 4 months of age, treatment with growth hormone was initiated at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg weekly.

### Child with suspected hypocalcemia [^112XLDX1]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Evaluation of pediatric hypocalcemia — other laboratory assessments and phosphorus context are outlined as follows: Other blood tests to be considered are: Intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are consistent with nutritional Vitamin D deficiency, and in this situation, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels may be normal or elevated due to the elevated PTH. The page also notes that parathyroid hormone increases phosphorous excretion leading to low phosphorus levels, while an elevated phosphorous level is seen with poor kidney function or pathology in the parathyroid hormone pathway.

### Successful pregnancies and reduced treatment requirement while breast feeding in a patient with congenital hypoparathyroidism due to homozygous C.68C > A null parathyroid hormone gene mutation [^113Afv9N]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A female patient with consanguineous parents presented at the age of 4 with isolated hypoparathyroidism due to a parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene mutation. She was managed with alfacalcidol and calcium supplements, and developed normally. Her consanguineous parents described symptoms suggestive of hypocalcaemia but had normal serum calcium and low normal PTH levels. A molecular diagnosis obtained in her adulthood revealed the presence of homozygous point mutation (c.68C > A) in exon 2 introducing a premature stop codon resulting in a non-functional precursor protein. This mutation has been reported only once before. Our patient remained on stable doses of alfacalcidol during pregnancy, but stopped all supplementation while breast feeding. This case confirms that alternative mechanisms (likely breast-derived parathyroid hormone-related protein) contribute to calcium homeostasis during breast feeding. Heterozygotes for the c.68C > Amutation may have latent hypoparathyroidism and maintain calcium homeostasis except during prolonged hypocalcaemia. This would suggest incomplete dominance, or a dose effect of the wild-type PTH allele.

### Parathyroid function and growth in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^1121n6WR]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the frequency and expression of hypoparathyroidism and the factors of short stature in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome to optimize clinical care.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study of 39 patients 9.7 ± 0.8 (2.5–20) years of age.

Results

The congenital abnormalities were cardiac defects in 33 of 39, thymus hypoplasia in 15 of 18 evaluated, and craniofacial dysmorphy in all; 15 patients (39%) had had one or more seizures. Before evaluation, 12 patients were hypocalcemic, with (n = 4) or without clinical manifestations, diagnosed before 1 month in 10 cases, at 3 months or 12 years in two others. At evaluation, 9 patients were hypocalcemic, 5 of 9 had been hypocalcemic, and 8 others had parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations low for their ionized calcium. One had high PTH without hypocalcemia and 2 were hypercalcemic. The values were below -2 SD at birth for weight and/or height in 26% of cases and at evaluation for height and body mass index in 23% and for insulin-like growth factor-I in 37%.

Conclusions

Parathyroid function was abnormal in 27 of 39 (69%) patients. This was not diagnosed in the majority. Short stature was probably due to intrauterine growth restriction, underweight, and growth hormone deficiency, as suggested by low insulin-like growth factor I.

### Efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^113MSfZT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Bone Loss and Mineralization Defects

Bone Mineral Density

In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected adults, TDF (a component of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets) was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving TDF.

Clinical trials evaluating TDF in pediatric and adolescent subjects were conducted. Under normal circumstances, BMD increases rapidly in pediatric patients. In HIV-1 infected subjects aged 2 years to less than 18 years, bone effects were similar to those observed in adult subjects and suggest increased bone turnover. Total body BMD gain was less in the TDF-treated HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects as compared to the control groups. Similar trends were observed in chronic hepatitis-B infected adolescent subjects aged 12 years to less than 18 years. In all pediatric trials, skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected.

The effects of TDF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for adult and pediatric patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial for all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected, then appropriate consultation should be obtained.

Mineralization Defects

Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with TDF use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Arthralgias and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving TDF-containing products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

5.10 Convulsions

Convulsions have been observed in adult and pediatric patients receiving EFV, generally in the presence of known medical history of seizures. Caution must be taken in any patient with a history of seizures.

Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant medications primarily metabolized by the liver, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, may require periodic monitoring of plasma levels [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

### Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1: a systematic review [^114TsQ4J]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1) is a rare form of hypoparathyroidism due to activating variants of the calcium-sensing receptor gene (CASR). Inherited or de novo activating variants of the CASR alter the set point for extracellular calcium, resulting in inadequate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and inappropriate renal calcium excretion leading to hypocalcemia and hypercalciuria. Conventional therapy includes calcium and activated vitamin D, which can worsen hypercalciuria, resulting in renal complications. A systematic literature review, using published reports from 1994 to 2021, was conducted to catalog CASR variants, to define the ADH1 clinical spectrum, and to determine the effect of treatment on patients with ADH1. There were 113 unique CASR variants reported, with a general lack of genotype/phenotype correlation. Clinical data were available in 191 patients; 27% lacked symptoms, 32% had mild/moderate symptoms, and 41% had severe symptoms. Seizures, the most frequent clinical presentation, occurred in 39% of patients. In patients with blood and urine chemistries available at the time of diagnosis (n = 91), hypocalcemia (99%), hyperphosphatemia (59%), low PTH levels (57%), and hypercalciuria (34%) were observed. Blood calcium levels were significantly lower in patients with severe symptoms compared with asymptomatic patients (6.8 ± 0.7 versus 7.6 ± 0.7 mg/dL [mean ± SD]; p < 0.0001), and the age of presentation was significantly lower in severely symptomatic patients (9.1 ± 15.0 versus 19.3 ± 19.4years; p < 0.01). Assessments for complications including nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, renal impairment, and brain calcifications in 57 patients on conventional therapy showed that 75% had at least one complication. Hypercalciuria was associated with nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, renal impairment, or brain calcifications (odds ratio [OR] = 9.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4–37.2; p < 0.01). In 27 patients with urine calcium measures before and after starting conventional therapy, the incidence of hypercalciuria increased by 91% (p < 0.05) after therapy initiation. ADH1 is a condition often associated with severe symptomatology at presentation with an increase in the risk of renal complications after initiation of conventional therapy. © 2022 The Authors.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^1178NX1e]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism

HypoPTH is a rare disorder characterized by deficient production or biological activity of PTH that results in hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. The prevalence of HypoPTH is estimated to be 37/100 000 habitants per year in the United States. HypoPTH may be an acquired or inherited condition, with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism being the most common form. Neck surgery is responsible for about 75% of HypoPTH cases. The next most frequent cause is immunity dysregulation, either affecting only parathyroid glands or multiple endocrine glands (autoimmune polyglandular syndromes). Other causes include infiltrative diseases and rare genetic disorders. However, it is important to exclude magnesium disorders early in our differential diagnosis process, as both hypo- and hypermagnesemia can lead to functional HypoPTH. The diagnosis is based on the finding of low ionized or corrected for albumin calcium levels, accompanied by undetectable, low, or inappropriately normal PTH levels. Under normal circumstances, low calcium levels trigger the production and excretion of PTH from parathyroid glands, via activation of CaSRs. PTH deficiency inhibits mobilization of calcium from bone, reabsorption of calcium from kidneys, and absorption of calcium from gastrointestinal tract through 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis. As a result, hypocalcemia is established, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is decreased because PTH can't stimulate 1-a hydroxylase, phosphate levels rise because of the lack of phosphaturic action of PTH, and the fraction of filtered calcium at the glomerulus is inappropriately increased.

Clinical presentation of HypoPTH usually includes neuromuscular signs and symptoms resulting from hypocalcemia, ranging from mild perioral numbness, paresthesias in the extremities, muscle cramps, and QT interval prolongation, to severe manifestations of arrhythmias, heart failure, seizures, and laryngospasm. However, some patients, especially those with genetic forms of HypoPTH, may be asymptomatic, thus they may be diagnosed due to routine biochemical screening or due to concomitant findings. Typical facial features, chronic candidiasis, or other autoimmune endocrinopathies may direct the diagnosis to DiGeorge or APECED (autoimmune polyendocrinopathy and candidiasis with ectodermal dystrophy syndrome), respectively. Absent or low levels of PTH result in reduced bone turnover and subsequent rise of BMD at both cortical and trabecular sites. However, bone disease derives from increased bone mineralization and altered skeletal microarchitecture. Whether these alterations relate to an increased fracture risk remains to be clarified.

### Delayed-onset hypoparathyroidism in an adolescent with chromosome 22Q11 deletion syndrome [^113btkYz]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the first case of established chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome with late onset presentation of hypocalcemia secondary to hypoparathyroidism.

Methods

We present the history, clinical and laboratory investigations, and management of a 17-year-old adolescent boy who presented with 3 separate seizures secondary to hypocalcemia. This patient had an established diagnosis of chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome at the time of the seizure presentations, but had previously normal calcium levels.

Results

Hypocalcemia was noted during each seizure, with corrected calcium levels ranging from 6.64 to 7.76 mg/dL (reference range, 8.52 to 10.52 mg/dL). The hypocalcemia was secondary to hypoparathyroidism, with parathyroid hormone levels < 2.75 pg/mL (reference range, 22.9 to 68.75 pg/mL). He was treated with calcitriol, 0.5 μg daily, and calcium carbonate, 2,400 mg daily, leading to normalization of serum calcium and resolution of seizures.

Conclusion

Chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome is a relatively common genetic disorder with a wide variety of phenotypic manifestations including cardiac abnormalities, abnormal facies, thymic dysfunction, cleft palate, and hypocalcemia. This case shows that medical practitioners should be aware that hypocalcemia can present after an established diagnosis, which has implications for the management of this disorder.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^1114pUyw]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — clinical stages and manifestations: The clinical presentation of vitamin D–deficiency rickets includes symptoms and signs of bone deformity and/or pain and may be associated with hypocalcemia and associated clinical features. The disease can be divided into 3 stages; the first stage is characterized by osteopenia and subclinical or overt hypocalcemia, followed in the second stage by rising PTH levels, and in the final stage bone changes become more severe with hypocalcemia again evident. Symptoms range from none to irritability, delay in gross motor development, and bone pain, and signs include widening of the wrists and ankles, genu varum or valgum, prominence of the costochondral junctions (rachitic rosary), delayed closure of fontanelles, craniotabes, and frontal bossing. Vitamin D deficiency presenting as hypocalcemic seizures or tetany is reported more frequently in infancy and adolescence than in childhood; hypocalcemic children may have apneic spells, stridor or wheezing, hypotonia, muscular weakness, and brisk reflexes, and severe deficiency may be associated with cardiomyopathy related to hypocalcemia that normalizes with treatment.

### Evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism summary statement and guidelines from the second international workshop [^114bvFbt]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

This clinical practice guideline addresses the prevention, diagnosis, and management of hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) and provides evidence-based recommendations. The HypoPT task forces included four teams with a total of 50 international experts including representatives from the sponsoring societies. A methodologist (GG) and his team supported the taskforces and conducted the systematic reviews. A formal process following the Gradingof Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and the systematic reviews provided the structure for seven of the guideline recommendations. The task force used a less structured approach based on narrative reviews for 20 non-GRADEd recommendations. Clinicians may consider postsurgical HypoPT permanent if it persists for > 12 months after surgery. To predict which patients will not develop permanent postsurgical HypoPT, we recommend evaluating serum PTH within 12 to 24 hours post total thyroidectomy (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). PTH > 10pg/mL (1.05pmol/L) virtually excludes long-term HypoPT. In individuals with nonsurgical HypoPT, genetic testing may be helpful in the presence of a positive family history of nonsurgical HypoPT, in the presence of syndromic features, or in individuals younger than 40years. HypoPT can be associated with complications, including nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, renal insufficiency, cataracts, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease, depression, and an increased risk of infection. Minimizing complications of HypoPT requires careful evaluation and close monitoring of laboratory indices. In patients with chronic HypoPT, the panel suggests conventional therapy with calcium and active vitamin D metabolites as first-line therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). When conventional therapy is deemed unsatisfactory, the panel considers the use of PTH. © 2022 The Authors.

Extraction of Information

The first author's name, year of publication, basic patient information, genetic results, laboratory measurements, and symptoms were extracted from each paper. In the case of missing data, authors were contacted. Consanguinity was defined based on parents who were first-, second-, or third-degree relatives, or on the basis of the definition of consanguinity given by the authors if the relation was not specified. Symptoms were considered present whenever the authors stated this and/or based on a reference range stated in the paper. In the absence of such statements, the following definitions were used. Intrauterine growth retardation was defined as low birth weight of ≤ −2 SD (or ≤ 3rd percentile). In cases where only birth weight was given without SD/percentile, a reference range relevant to the ethnicity (if given) was used and again ≤ −2 SD (or ≤ 3rd percentile) was the cut-off. Postnatal growth retardation was defined as short height of ≤ −2 SD (or ≤ 3rd percentile). Growth retardation was considered proportional if limbs were in proportion or when the upper to lower segment ratio deviated less than 2 SD. For patients of ≥ 18 years, ratios between 0.80 and 1.07 were considered proportionate. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were considered low when serum levels were below the lower limit of the normal reference range as described by MedScape (intact [whole] PTH: 1.06 pmol/L). Hypocalcemia was defined as serum total calcium values below the lower limit of the normal reference range for the particular age group as described by MedScape (< 10 days: 1.9 mmol/L, umbilical: 2.25 mmol/L, 10 days-2 years: 2.3 mmol/L, child [2 years-18 years]: 2.2 mmol/L, adult [≥ 18 years]: 2.25 mmol/L), assuming normal serum albumin levels unless otherwise specified. If the age was unknown, the following values were used: a total serum calcium concentration < 2.20 mmol/L in the presence of normal plasma protein concentrations or a serum ionized calcium concentration < 1.17 mmol/L. Hypomagnesemia was assumed when serum levels were below the lower limit of the normal reference range: 0.7 mmol/L. Hyperphosphatemia was defined as phosphorus serum levels above the normal reference range as described by MedScape: adult and elderly (≥ 18 years): 1.45 mmol/L, child (2 months-18 years): 2.1 mmol/L, newborn (< 2 months): 3 mmol/L. Growth hormone (GH) deficiency was defined as a GH stimulation test using arginine, glucagon, or insulin peak values of < 10 ng/mL. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) deficiency was assumed when values were ≤ −2 SD (or ≤ 3rd percentile). Hypothyroidism was defined as free thyroxine (FT4) < 0.8 ng/dL (10 pmol/L) and/or as thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) > 5 mIU/L. Reduced spleen function also entailed asplenia. Sleep apnea was solely based on the author's description. Hypoglycemia was defined as a glucose serum level of < 2.775 mmol/L. Anemia was solely based on the author's description and no distinction was made based on the type of anemia. Calcifications in the kidneys were grouped under nephrocalcinosis. Calcifications in other tissues than the kidneys were grouped as calcifications. Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) was grouped separately. Delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle was defined as a still patent anterior fontanelle from 2.5 years of age, based on information from MedScape. Osteosclerosis and bone cortical thickening and medullary stenosis were defined solely based on the author's statements. Delayed bone age was defined as a bone age of ≤ −2 SD. High alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were defined as > 90th percentile for age and sex. If > 18 years old, > 120 IU/L was considered high ALP, and if age was not known > 300 IU/L. Intellectual disability was defined as any sort of developmental delay, including language delay, fine motor/adaptive delay, cognitive delay, social delay, gross motor developmental delay, and/or behavioral disturbances, based on the definition from MedScape. Under seizures/spasms we grouped seizures, spasms, convulsions, and twitching. Infections were recorded independently of the frequency, and the following cases were included where a noninfectious cause could not be excluded but was unlikely: keratitis and otitis media. Dental abnormalities were defined to include tooth agenesis, edentulism, delayed dentition, premature shedding of permanent dentition, primary tooth retention, severe caries, early decay, taurodontism, and crown and enamel hypoplasia, or when the authors stated there were "dental abnormalities" without specifying. Eye problems were defined to include hyperopia, myopia, (pseudo)papilledema, cataracts, glaucoma, corneal opacity, astigmatism, strabismus, maculopathy, retinopathy, keratopathy, amblyopia, microphthalmia, optic nerve anomalies, and tortuous retinal vessels, or when the authors stated there were "eye abnormalities" without specifying. Male genital abnormalities were defined as any abnormalities to the male reproductive tract, either internal or external. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined based on the diagnosis described by the authors, or based on the definition from UpToDate: an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) value of < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 or albuminuria of > 30 mg/day for a period of > 3 months, urinary sediment abnormalities (detected by urinalysis); anatomic abnormalities were determined by imaging studies, and pathologic abnormalities were discovered upon biopsy and/or a history of kidney transplantation. Factors such as age and race were not taken into account. CKD was assumed to be absent in patients who were reported to have "normal kidney function". Hypercalciuria was defined as a ratio of urine calcium to urine creatinine above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile for age. Renal magnesium wasting was defined as a fractional excretion > 4% or a urinary magnesium excretion of > 1 mmol/day, combined with low serum magnesium. Exact laboratory values were extracted as well. In the case of electrolyte values, only those measurements were used that were taken before the start of treatment with supplementals or GH. In addition, the age at the time of measurement was extracted. When multiple values were available for a patient, the most extreme values were included.

### Presentation of hypoparathyroidism: etiologies and clinical features [^111AQnC5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Understanding the etiology, diagnosis, and symptoms of hypoparathyroidism may help to improve quality of life and long-term disease outcomes. This paper summarizes the results of the findings and recommendations of the Working Group on Presentation of Hypoparathyroidism.

Evidence Acquisition

Experts convened in Florence, Italy, in May 2015 and evaluated the literature and recent data on the presentation and long-term outcomes of patients with hypoparathyroidism.

Evidence Synthesis

The most frequent etiology is surgical removal or loss of viability of parathyroid glands. Despite precautions and expertise, about 20–30% of patients develop transient and 1–7% develop permanent postsurgical hypoparathyroidism after total thyroidectomy. Autoimmune destruction is the main reason for nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism. Severe magnesium deficiency is an uncommon but correctable cause of hypoparathyroidism. Several genetic etiologies can result in the loss of parathyroid function or action causing isolated hypoparathyroidism or a complex syndrome with other symptoms apart from those of hypoparathyroidism or pseudohypoparathyroidism. Neuromuscular signs or symptoms due to hypocalcemia are the main characteristics of the disease. Hyperphosphatemia can contribute to major long-term complications such as ectopic calcifications in the kidney, brain, eye, or vasculature. Bone turnover is decreased, and bone mass is increased. Reduced quality of life and higher risk of renal stones, renal calcifications, and renal failure are seen. The risk of seizures and silent or symptomatic calcifications of basal ganglia is also increased.

Conclusions

Increased awareness of the etiology and presentation of the disease and new research efforts addressing specific questions formulated during the meeting should improve the diagnosis, care, and long-term outcome for patients.

### Heterozygous pathogenic variants involvingcause a new skeletal disorder resembling cleidocranial dysplasia [^113zyBUs]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Subjects 7 and 8

Subject 7 was referred to the genetics clinic at the age of 11 months because of bilateral congenital cataracts, global developmental delay and possible dysmorphic features. She also had a history of traumatic birth with right shoulder dystocia, suspicion of bilateral clavicular fractures and multifocal intraparenchymal and subarachnoid haemorrhages. There had been an acute event on day 1 of life with profound hypoglycaemia, seizures and apnoeas with need for neonatal intensive care unit admission and invasive ventilation. Brain MRI at day 12 did not show signs of hypoxic ischaemic injury. Furthermore, there was a history of bilateral developmental dysplasia of the hip. At clinical examination, she showed a large anterior fontanel (8×3 cm) and mild dysmorphic features including a prominent forehead and mid-posterior plagiocephaly. There was bilateral mild fifth finger clinodactyly and hypoplasia of the fifth toenails. She showed normal growth with a height of 73.7 cm (50th percentile), weight 9.6 kg (50th–75th percentile) and head circumference of 46 cm (75th percentile). There was developmental delay, as she only began rolling at 10 months and is not yet able to sit independently at 11 months of age. At 3 years of age, she presented with feeding problems, failure to thrive and recurrent symptomatic hypercalcaemia with hypercalciuria and bilateral nephrocalcinosis. Parathyroid hormone level was decreased. A skeletal survey was performed that showed generalised osteopenia. It also revealed left-sided clavicula bipartita (figure 2). The right clavicle showed a sharp curve at the mid-diaphysis, possibly as a consequence of clavicular fracture due to the traumatic birth. There was hypoplasia of the distal phalanges in both hands and feet with ballooning of the epiphyses most pronounced in digit I, II and V. Pseudoepiphyses were present in the second through fifth metacarpals and metatarsals bilaterally. Ossification of the carpal bones and distal radius was delayed (figure 2). At 4 years and 10 months of age, progression towards stage 4 chronic kidney disease was noted. The girl still showed moderate developmental delay with gross motor as well as fine motor and language delay. There is some question as to whether she fit the criteria for autism spectrum disorder. There had been no more seizures since day 1 of life. Trio-exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous splice site variant (c.283–2A > G) in intron 3 of CBFB (CADD score: 34; MutationTaster: disease-causing, score 1; Splice ADA score: 0.999; Splice RF score: 0.926). MutationTaster predicts a full loss of the splice acceptor sequence motif and a gain of an alternative acceptor splice site after the first 6 nucleotides of exon 4 (score 0.37). This c.283–2A > G variant appeared to be inherited from the mother (subject 8). The mother does not recall any abnormal skeletal concerns, although she did report dental abnormalities at the age of 8 years, resulting in the removal of all teeth. Her adult teeth have been normal.

### Homozygous calcium-sensing receptor polymorphism R544Q presents as hypocalcemic hypoparathyroidism [^111Dy462]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Context

Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1) is caused by heterozygous activating mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor gene (CASR). Whether polymorphisms that are benign in the heterozygous state pathologically alter receptor function in the homozygous state is unknown.

Objective

To identify the genetic defect in an adolescent female with a history of surgery for bilateral cataracts and seizures. The patient has hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and low serum PTH level. The parents of the proband are healthy.

Methods

Mutation testing of PTH, GNA11, GCM2, and CASR was done on leukocyte DNA of the proband. Functional analysis in transfected cells was conducted on the gene variant identified. Public single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) databases were searched for the presence of the variant allele.

Results

No mutations were identified in PTH, GNA11, and GCM2 in the proband. However, a germline homozygous variant (c.1631G > A; p.R544Q) in exon 6 of the CASR was identified. Both parents are heterozygous for the variant. The variant allele frequency was near 0.1% in SNP databases. By in vitro functional analysis, the variant was significantly more potent in stimulating both the Ca2+i and MAPK signaling pathways than wild type when transfected alone (P < 0.05) but not when transfected together with wild type. The overactivity of the mutant CaSR is due to loss of a critical structural cation-π interaction.

Conclusions

The patient's hypoparathyroidism is due to homozygosity of a variant in the CASR that normally has weak or no phenotypic expression in heterozygosity. Although rare, this has important implications for genetic counseling and clinical management.

### Hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness and renal disease (barakat syndrome) caused by a reduced gene dosage in GATA3: a case report and review of literature [^1112tFVp]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The proband is a 13-year-old boy who presented to the emergency unit with bilateral carpopedal spasm along with an acute febrile illness. He had a history of similar events since the age of 7 months, presumably triggered by febrile conditions due to respiratory tract infections. He had recurrent muscle cramps and lethargy associated with acute febrile illnesses, and in-between these episodes, he was apparently well. He is the third child of a non-consanguineous couple and was delivered by normal-vaginal delivery, with a birth weight of 2.5 kg. His developmental milestones were age-appropriate and immunization schedule was up-to-date. He has two elder siblings who are apparently healthy.

On admission to the emergency unit, he was alert, conscious and febrile with stable vital signs. He had carpopedal spasm involving mainly the upper limbs (Fig. 1), which was reproducible by inflating a blood-pressure cuff placed on the patient's arms. Chvostek's sign was negative. He had diminished deep tendon reflexes in both upper and lower extremities with flexor plantar response. There was no papilledema, mental slowness or seizures. No facial dysmorphism was observed and other systemic examinations were unremarkable.

Fig. 1

Blood samples were taken for basic investigations including full blood count and inflammatory markers, which were all normal. He had persistent low serum corrected calcium levels with hyperphosphatemia, mild hypomagnesaemia, and low parathyroid hormone levels. His renal functions, urine full report, arterial blood gas analysis and renal tract imaging were unremarkable. Other hormonal assays including Thyroid stimulating hormone (2.27 mIU/ L), free thyroxine (1.37 ng/dL), follicle stimulating hormone (2.5 mIU/L), luteinizing hormone (1.01 mIU/L), 9 am cortisol (312 nmol/L), prolactin (138.7 mIU/L) and testosterone (0.6 nmol/L) were within the normal range.

### Hypoparathyroidism and the kidney [^1141rbcB]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia are the pathognomonic biochemical features of hypoparathyroidism, and result directly from lack of parathyroid hormone (PTH) action on the kidney. In the absence of PTH action, the renal mechanisms transporting calcium and phosphate reabsorption deregulate, resulting in hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Circulating calcium negatively regulates PTH secretion. Hypocalcemia causes neuromuscular disturbances ranging from epilepsy and tetany to mild paresthesia. Circulating phosphate concentration does not directly regulate PTH secretion. Hyperphosphatemia is subclinical, but chronically promotes ectopic mineralization disease. Vitamin D-thiazide treatment leads to ectopic mineralization and renal damage. PTH treatment has the potential for fewer side effects.

### A 3-year old girl with seizures, hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis [^116UVTAq]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

A 3-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with seizures, low-grade fever and vomiting. She had tachycardia and a slow capillary refill. Blood pressure could not be measured. Because of suspected sepsis and/or meningo-encephalitis, broad spectrum antibiotics and antiviral medication were given together, along with volume expansion and anticonvulsive therapy. A few hours later, after a second seizure, the blood pressure was extremely high (156/116 mm Hg). The girl was treated with anticonvulsants and intravenous antihypertensive agents. MRI of the brain showed signs of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Cultures of blood and cerebrospinal fluid remained sterile. Further investigation into the cause of the malignant hypertension revealed hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis and extremely high plasma renin activity, caused by a rare renal abnormality: bilateral renal segmental hypoplasia or Ask-Upmark kidneys.

### Investigation and management of hypocalcaemia [^111P3pbr]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypocalcaemia is a common clinical scenario in children with a range of aetiological causes. It will often present with common symptoms but may occasionally be identified in an asymptomatic child. An understanding of the physiological regulation of plasma calcium is important in understanding the potential cause of hypocalcaemia and its appropriate management. The age of presentation will influence the likely differential diagnosis. We have presented a stepwise approach to the investigation of hypocalcaemia dependent on the circulating serum parathyroid hormone level at the time of presentation. The acute and long-term management of the underlying condition is also reviewed.

### Persistent hypercalcemia mimicking hypophosphatasia after discontinuation of a ketogenic diet: a case report [^115aehwE]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Hypercalcemia has been reported as an uncommon complication of the ketogenic diet (KD). Here we present a toddler whose hypercalcemia persisted for 2 months after stopping the KD.

Case Presentation

A 2 year 11-month-old child with global developmental delay, infantile spasms, neuromuscular weakness with limited mobility, tracheostomy and ventilator dependence, and oropharyngeal dysphagia with G-tube dependence presented with hypercalcemia in the setting of recurrent vomiting. At presentation, the patient was adherent to a KD and taking topiramate since infancy for intractable seizures. His laboratory parameters at presentation showed hypercalcemia (11.9 mg/dL), hypercalciuria, acute renal failure, low alkaline phosphatase (76 IU/L [110–302 IU/L]), parathyroid hormone (PTH) < 6 pg/mL (18–80 pg/mL), normal thyroid function, cortisol and vitamin D level. The patient's hypercalcemia persisted post-discontinuation of the KD and topiramate. PTH-related protein was mildly elevated at 15.3 pmol/L. Follow-up laboratory and imaging studies ruled out malignancy. He was managed with calcitonin 4 u/kg/dose Q12H × 1 day and 8 u/kg/dose Q8H × 1 day, hydration and low-calcium formula. Post-discontinuation of the KD, normalization of alkaline phosphatase levels preceded the normalization of calcium on day 55 and PTH on day 85.

Conclusions

Hypercalcemia may persist for an extended period after weaning from a KD; lab parameters may mimic that of hypophosphatasia as previously described in the literature. Normalization of alkaline phosphatase, a marker of bone turnover, indicates recovery from the adynamic state induced by the KD and typically precedes the normalization of calcium and PTH.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^116ZwtS7]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Secondary and Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism (SHPT, THPT)

PTH possesses a crucial role in calcium homoeostasis, by aiming to restore serum calcium levels in the state of hypocalcemia through its renal, intestinal, and bone actions. The compensatory rise of PTH levels intended to rectify the lower bioavailability of calcium and/or vitamin D is referred to as SHPT. It may result from failure of 1 or more components of the calcium homoeostatic mechanisms. Although kidney disease is the most common cause of SHPT, any disorder that leads to hypocalcemia or vitamin D deficiency may result in elevated levels of PTH: reduced calcium intake or absorption, reduced absorption, synthesis or function of vitamin D and its active metabolites, hepatic failure, and impaired function of PTH are some examples of SHPT etiology. The diagnosis is supported by a detailed clinical history and examination, plus laboratory evaluation of calcium metabolism indices (serum albumin-adjusted calcium and ionized calcium, phosphate, PTH, 25OH-hydroxyvitamin D, ALP). By definition, hyperparathyroidism is characterized by increased levels of PTH. High or low/low-normal serum calcium levels are usually the key for differential diagnosis between PHPT and SHPT, respectively. Moreover, because of the phosphaturic impact of PTH, both PHPT and SHPT are typically linked to low-normal serum phosphate levels in the presence of intact renal function. However, the biochemical values assessed may differ depending on the underlying cause of SHPT. Although most signs and symptoms experienced by patients with SHPT are related to their underlying conditions, hypocalcemia (acute or chronic) can also be part of the clinical presentation, especially in severe cases, and patients may experience numbness, tingling, cramps, or even seizures and tetany, as well as complications of long-standing hyperparathyroidism. Chronic kidney disease is an area of major clinical and scientific interest regarding bone metabolism and development of therapeutic options.

### Severe hypercalcemia in an infant with unbalanced translocation of chromosomes 2 and 8: a possible contribution of 2p duplication [^114JvNL5]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We report an uncommon case of severe hypercalcemia in an infant with unbalanced translocation of chromosomes 2 and 8 with 2p duplication. After ruling out all the possible etiologies of hypercalcemia, we speculated a potential contribution of 2p duplication involving 225 genes.

Case Presentation

An 11-month old female infant with global developmental delay, failure to thrive (FTT), hypotonia, amblyopia, constipation, and recent onset emesis was admitted to the hospital after an incidental diagnosis of severe hypercalcemia. Labs revealed normal serum phosphate, serum 25 (OH) vitamin D levels, and low serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Elevated urinary calcium to creatinine ratio ruled out the possibility of hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. Endocrinological evaluations, including thyroid function test, Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), Cortisol, Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) were all normal. Transient elevation of parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP) level was noted, but skeletal survey, chest X-ray and lab values including low 1,25 (OH) 2 cholecalciferol, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid (UA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) excluded granulomatous diseases and malignancies. Further evaluation with chromosomal microarray (CMA) and whole exome gene sequencing (WES) showed an unbalanced chromosomal translocation with 2p duplication involving 225 genes. The infant showed an improvement with medical management.

Conclusions

2p duplication syndrome is a rare syndrome characterized by developmental delay, feeding problems, FTT, hypotonia, constipation, and unusual facial features as noted in our case. However, hypercalcemia has been only reported once earlier in 2p duplication syndrome, which was the presenting feature of our case. We attributed this genetic syndrome as an underlying etiology for hypercalcemia after ruling out all the common potential causes of hypercalcemia.

### Five-year estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients with hypoparathyroidism treated with and without rhPTH (1–84) [^114x9Grf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is an endocrine disorder, with a prevalence of 10 to 40 cases per a population of 100 000 in the United States and European countries, in which production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by the parathyroid gland is absent or inappropriately low. The most common cause of HypoPT is damage to or removal of the parathyroid glands during neck surgery, although it may also be idiopathic or due to autoimmune or congenital etiologies.

Typically, HypoPT is associated with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalciuria. Parathyroid hormone deficiency causes hypocalcemia due to reduced calcium reabsorption from renal tubules, decreased absorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract, and decreased calcium mobilization from bone. The symptoms of HypoPT, including fatigue, numbness of the distal extremities, muscle cramps, and neurocognitive deficit can vary from mild to severe. More serious and potentially life-threatening effects of hypocalcemia such as seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and laryngeal spasm occur in severe cases.

### Should we routinely perform blood tests in children with uncontrolled seizures? [^117GyiLd]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The value of biochemical tests in treating patients with uncontrolled seizures is unclear. We present the case of an 8-year-old boy with uncontrolled seizures receiving two antiepileptic drugs. He had been diagnosed with recurrent herpes encephalitis and treated with acyclovir 1 year previously. Laboratory blood analyses, performed because of his uncontrolled seizure episodes, revealed hypocalcemia. Hypoparathyroidism was detected with elevated levels of phosphorus and low levels of parathormone. In conclusion, blood tests, especially to measure calcium, in children with uncontrolled seizures are suggested. Hypoparathyroidism causing hypocalcemia, as present here, is not a rare occurrence.

### Neonatal seizures: soothing a burning topic [^114b625b]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Neonatal seizures are a potentially life-threatening pediatric problem with a variety of causes, such as birth trauma, asphyxia, congenital anomalies, metabolic disturbances, infections, and drug withdrawal or intoxication. Thorough and timely evaluations of such patients are necessary to identify and treat the underlying etiology, therefore reducing potential morbidity and mortality. We review neonatal seizures and hypocalcemia and present the case of a 6-day-old male infant who presented to a tertiary pediatric emergency department with seizure-like episodes. He was found to have markedly low serum calcium, magnesium, and parathyroid hormone concentrations, as well as a significantly elevated serum phosphate concentration. The etiology of these abnormalities was found to be maternal ingestion of extremely high doses of calcium carbonate during the third trimester of her pregnancy, an occurrence that has been reported only once in the literature. Education pertaining to the dangers of excessive calcium carbonate intake during pregnancy may be an important piece of anticipatory guidance for pregnant mothers with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, and questioning the mother of a neonate presenting with seizures about such over-the-counter medications may help to elucidate the diagnosis.

### Foscarnet sodium [^1163M5sv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities

Foscarnet sodium injection has been associated with changes in serum electrolytes including hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia (see ADVERSE REACTIONS section). Foscarnet sodium injection may also be associated with a dose-related decrease in ionized serum calcium which may not be reflected in total serum calcium. This effect is likely to be related to chelation of divalent metal ions such as calcium by foscarnet. Patients should be advised to report symptoms of low ionized calcium such as perioral tingling, numbness in the extremities and paresthesias. Particular caution and careful management of serum electrolytes is advised in patients with altered calcium or other electrolyte levels before treatment and especially in those with neurologic or cardiac abnormalities and those receiving other drugs known to influence minerals and electrolytes (see PATIENT MONITORING and Drug Interactions sections). Physicians should be prepared to treat these abnormalities and their sequelae such as tetany, seizures or cardiac disturbances. The rate of foscarnet sodium injection infusion may also affect the decrease in ionized calcium. Therefore, an infusion pump must be used for administration to prevent rapid intravenous infusion (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). Slowing the infusion rate may decrease or prevent symptoms.

Seizures

Seizures related to mineral and electrolyte abnormalities have been associated with foscarnet sodium injection treatment (see WARNING section; Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities). Several cases of seizures were associated with death. Cases of status epilepticus have been reported. Risk factors associated with seizures included impaired baseline renal function, low total serum calcium, and underlying CNS conditions.

Hypersensitivity

Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic shock, urticaria, angioedema) have been reported postmarketing in patients receiving foscarnet sodium injection (see ADVERSE REACTIONS section). If such an acute reaction occurs, therapy should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy immediately instituted.

### Neonatal hypocalcemic seizures in offspring of a mother with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 (FHH1) [^113BDqyd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Participants

The three generation FHH1 kindred comprised a man (individual I.1, Fig. 1A) with hypercalcemia and his daughter (individual II.2), who had hypercalcemia and hypocalciuria, and her 4 children (individuals III.1–4). Of the 4 children, 2 (individuals III.2 and III.3) had asymptomatic hypercalcemia, 1 was normocalcemic (individual III.1), and 1 (individual III.4) developed neonatal hypocalcemic seizures. Individual III.4, a girl, was born at 38 weeks' gestation following an uncomplicated pregnancy to nonconsanguinous parents of white European origin. She was well and normocalcemic at birth (serum adjusted-calcium 2.11 mmol/L [8.44 mg/dL]; normal, 2.00–2.80 mmol/L [8.0–11.2 mg/dL]) but was readmitted to the hospital at age 7 days with focal seizures affecting her upper limbs. Investigations showed a low serum adjusted-calcium of 1.57 mmol/L (6.28 mg/dL), elevated serum phosphate of 3.45 mmol/L (10.7 mg/dL); normal, 1.30 to 2.60 mmol/L (4.0–8.0 mg/dL), and an inappropriately normal serum PTH of 2.2 pmol/L; normal, 1.0 to 9.3 pmol/L (Fig. 1A and 1B). Serum magnesium was borderline low at 0.62 mmol/L (1.5 mg/dL); normal, 0.62 to 1.00 mmol/L (1.5–2.4 mg/dL), and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was low at 27 nmol/L; adequate is greater than 50 nmol/L. These findings indicated that she had hypoparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency. She did not have clinical or biochemical features of the Di George or hypoparathyroidism-deafness-renal anomalies syndromes. She was treated with intravenous infusions of 10% calcium gluconate (0.5 mL/kg over 30 minutes), magnesium sulfate (100 mg/kg over 10 minutes), phenobarbitone (5 mg/kg on 3 consecutive days), and also given cholecalciferol (1000 IU daily). Over the next 48 hours her serum calcium concentration increased into the normal range (Fig. 1B). This rapid improvement in serum calcium suggested a transient cause for the hypoparathyroidism, most likely secondary to the maternal hypercalcemia. She was discharged at age 3 weeks with normal serum calcium (Fig. 1B) and no further symptoms.

### A novel ATP1A2 mutation in a patient with hypokalaemic periodic paralysis and CNS symptoms [^116u73qF]. Brain (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Clinical presentation

A 9-year-old Brazilian boy presented with episodes of flaccid muscle paralysis. Pregnancy and birth history were unremarkable. He experienced absence seizures with ocular aversion from age 4 months. These were initially resistant to treatment with status epilepticus occurring at age 1 year but eventually controlled with a combination of sodium valproate and levetiracetam. Seizures recurred with increasing age and increased drug doses were required. He had delayed motor milestones, not walking independently until 2 years 9 months, and speech delay with learning difficulties. At age 2 years he woke with tetraparesis and dysphagia lasting several hours, concomitant with a lower respiratory tract infection. Symptoms resolved with the infection and no specific diagnosis was made. He had two similar episodes at ages 3 and 4 years lasting several days. Episodes became increasingly frequent, averaging 5–10 per month. Paralysis attacks were bilateral, not associated with migraine or headache, occurred usually on waking and lasted hours to days. Triggers included carbohydrate meals and viral illness. Creatine kinase ranged from 382 to 1793 IU/l. Serum potassium was low (2.4 mM) during symptoms. Routine electrocardiogram was normal. A muscle biopsy undertaken shortly after an attack showed evidence of a non-specific myopathic process (Fig. 1 A). Brain MRI was normal at 5 months but at 7 years demonstrated increased prominence of the ventricular system with bilateral mesial temporal sclerosis. EEG initially demonstrated epileptic activity although normalized on treatment. Routine EMG and nerve conduction study were normal but compound muscle action potential during an attack was significantly reduced compared to post-attack level, confirming peripheral impairment of neuromuscular function. Symptoms of paralysis improved with potassium supplements but were significantly worsened by acetazolamide.

### The A, B, C, D of hypercalcaemia in down syndrome [^117Wt8Ny]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hypercalcaemia in infants with Down syndrome is an uncommon condition with only five previous case reports. The patients often present in the toddler years with the classical triad of Down syndrome, biochemical hypercalcaemia, and nephrocalcinosis. We present the sixth case and second male with this condition and further review the clinical details of this under-recognised condition and stratify the diagnostic criteria. The management mandates a reduction in calcium intake as a first step. The natural history of the various aspects of this condition is also considered.

### Prevalence of hypocalcaemia and its associated features in 22q11. 2 deletion syndrome [^1179anYh]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

As originally described by DiGeorge, hypocalcaemia was attributed to aplasia or hypoplasia of the parathyroid glands due to a developmental defect. There are however few reported supporting autopsy findings to document structural parathyroid defects in 22q11.2DS. The analysis of the PTH response to ionized calcium in individuals with 22q11.2DS in our study suggests that the parathyroid glands were not completely dysfunctional but displayed variable (often poor) efficiency of response, likely related to reduced PTH reserve, in these subjects. The phenomenon of decreased parathyroid function has previously been described as relative or partial hypoparathyroidism. This is evident in Fig. 1 where 33% of the 'normal' PTH levels would be considered inappropriately low relative to the low ionized calcium levels, representing 61.54% (48 of 78 subjects) at at least one point in time, suggesting a lack of adequate PTH response to falling serum total/ionized calcium. There would thus be an enhanced probability of detecting an intact PTH level within the normal range under these circumstances. Only a few subjects showed elevated PTH in response to low ionized calcium levels, and often, the elevated PTH levels were accompanied by elevated creatinine levels, suggesting underlying renal disease as a contributing factor.

### A case of chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome diagnosed in a 32-year-old man with hypoparathyroidism [^111diiAk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Congenital hypoparathyroidism typically manifests with hypocalcemia with or without associated characteristic physical findings and is usually diagnosed during the neonatal period. This report describes an African-American male who was diagnosed at age 32 yr to have dysgenesis of the parathyroid glands due to chromosome 22 microdeletion. Symptomatic hypocalcemia did not develop until age 14 yr, a few weeks after initiation of anticonvulsant therapy for generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Because of the timing for onset of symptomatic hypocalcemia, it was presumed that the patient had anticonvulsant-induced hypocalcemia, and he carried that diagnosis for 18 yr. Chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome was first suspected at age 32 yr, based on the findings of subtle dysmorphic facial features and a history of learning disability in a patient with PTH-deficient hypocalcemia. The diagnosis was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. This case underscores the variable clinical presentation of this congenital form of hypoparathyroidism. Chromosome 22q11 microdeletions are relatively common, and the diagnosis should be considered even in adults with hypoparathyroidism because of the potential benefit of genetic counseling.

### Neonatal hypocalcemic seizures in offspring of a mother with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 (FHH1) [^114KNnjn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Transient hypocalcemia affects around 1 in 50 term neonates, and can cause irritability and seizures. It is commonly associated with vitamin D deficiency and low or inappropriately normal PTH concentrations, both of which were features of this case. Reduced PTH secretion in the neonatal period can arise from delayed parathyroid gland maturation, hypomagnesemia, or as a consequence of maternal hypercalcemia, which suppresses fetal parathyroid activity. The major cause of maternal hypercalcemia is primary hyperparathyroidism, which affects approximately 1 out of 3000 women of reproductive age. In contrast, FHH1 has rarely been reported as a cause of hypercalcemia in pregnancy, and this condition may remain asymptomatic throughout gestation. However, it is possible that some mothers with FHH1 may develop more severe hypercalcemia in the third trimester because of increases in circulating PTH-related peptide concentrations, and therefore warrant serum calcium monitoring during the later stages of pregnancy. In addition, the present case indicates that maternal FHH1 poses a risk to the unaffected neonate because of suppression of the parathyroid gland function in utero. The risk of transient neonatal hypoparathyroidism is likely related to the degree of maternal hypercalcemia, and it is notable that the maternal serum calcium concentration in this case, and the 2 reported cases of FHH-associated neonatal hypocalcemia, was substantially elevated at greater than 2.90 mmol/L (> 11.6 mg/dL). These findings indicate the importance of assessing maternal serum calcium as part of the evaluation of an infant with hypocalcemia, particularly because this may unmask the presence of FHH in the mother. Furthermore, serum calcium should be assessed at birth in the infant of a mother with FHH1 and also during the first 1 to 2 weeks after birth, and CaSR mutational analysis considered for the newborn offspring of FHH1 parents.

### Respiratory insufficiency as a rare presentation in a child with vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1 [^1154fskh]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Rickets in children usually present with skeletal manifestations. However, they can also rarely present with extraskeletal manifestations, one of them being respiratory insufficiency. We present an unusual case of a girl in early childhood with respiratory insufficiency, which turned out to be due to the underlying vitamin D-dependent rickets (VDDR). The girl was born to third-degree consanguineous parentage and had progressive skeletal deformities, acquired loss of motor milestones, recurrent lower respiratory tract infections and florid signs of rickets. She was hospitalised for respiratory insufficiency, which required prolonged oxygen supplementation. X-rays showed multiple fractures and florid rickets. Laboratory parameters revealed low serum calcium and phosphorus, high alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone and 25-OH vitamin D levels with a normal 1,25-OH2D level. Genetic testing confirmed autosomal recessive CYP27B1 mutation proving VDDR1A. She was started on calcitriol and calcium which led to her gradual improvement.

### Clinical, biochemical and metabolic characterization of patients with short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECHS1) deficiency: two case reports and the review of the literature [^115yMb34]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

Case 1

The child was a 2 year- old girl. She was born by caesarian section for fetal transverse presentation at term with birth weight 3.25 kg (percentile 50th–75th), height 48 cm (percentile 10th–25th), and head circumference 34 cm (percentile 50th). Her birth history was unremarkable and her early milestones were appropriate. From 8 months of age onwards motor developmental delay was noted. By 1 year of age, she had obvious developmental regression due to infection, but symptoms improved slightly after the infection was treated. The patient was first evaluated in our hospital at 14 months due to severe developmental delay. She was unable to sit alone or crawl, accompanied by language dysfunction, poor fine motion, and taking simple instructions. At this time, the patient growth parameters were: weight of 10 kg (percentile 3th–10th), length of 83 cm (percentile 10th–25th), and head circumference of 46.5 cm (percentile 25th–50th). Developmentally, she had hypotonia, language development delay, mental retardation and nystagmus. Elevated levels of blood lactate 4.84 mmol/L (normal 0.7–2.1 mmol/L), pyruvic acid122μmol/L (normal 20–100 mmol/L), and TSH3UL1.081 mTU/L(normal 1.7–9.1 mTU/L)were noted. Blood ammonia, blood routine, β-hydroxybutyric acid, ceruloplasmin, blood calcium/phosphorus/alkaline phosphatase, serum vitamin D, liver and kidney function, electrolytes were all normal. Urine organic acid analysis and electroencephalogram (EEG) in 2018 was normal, brain MRI (Fig. 1 a, A2) showed bilateral pale globular morphology and signal changes which suggested the possibility of genetic metabolic diseases. MRS showed bilateral lesions with inverted lactate peaks. Re-examination of urine metabolism in 2019 showed that 2,3-dihydroxy-2-methylbutyric acid was detected significantly.

### Neonatal hypocalcemic seizures: case report and literature review [^114SajKn]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Seizures during the neonatal period have a broad differential diagnosis, many with a specific treatment and prognosis. In the case reported, a combination of dietary and endocrinologic abnormalities resulted in hypocalcemic seizures, which continued despite aggressive correction of serum ionized calcium levels. Serial electroencephalograms (EEG) performed during the hospitalization were markedly abnormal, and treatment with anticonvulsant drugs was considered given the persistence of seizures despite normalization of serum calcium levels. After 4 days of intravenous calcium administration, the seizure activity resolved, and the patient returned to his normal baseline level of functioning. This case highlights the clinical course of neonatal hypocalcemic seizures, EEG findings in several cases, and possible mechanisms for both hypocalcemic precipitation of seizures and anticonvulsant ineffectiveness.

### Ketotic hypercalcemia: a case series and description of a novel entity [^112Uj55F]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

The ketogenic diet is increasingly used in refractory epilepsy and is associated with clinically significant effects on bone and mineral metabolism. Although hypercalciuria and loss of bone mineral density are common in patients on the ketogenic diet, hypercalcemia has not previously been described.

Objective

The aim of the study was to describe three children who developed hypercalcemia while on the ketogenic diet.

Design

A retrospective chart review of three children on the ketogenic with severe hypercalcemia was conducted.

Results

We describe three children on the ketogenic diet for refractory seizures who presented with hypercalcemia. Case 1 was a 5.5-year-old male with an undiagnosed, rapidly progressive seizure disorder associated with developmental regression. Case 2 was a 2.5-year-old male with a chromosomal deletion of 2q24.3, and case 3 was a 4.6-year-old male with cerebral cortex dysplasia. Patients had been on a ketogenic diet for 6 to 12 months before presentation. Daily intake of calcium and vitamin D was not excessive, and all three patients were not acidotic because they were taking supplemental bicarbonate. Each child had elevated serum levels of calcium and normal serum phosphate levels, moderately elevated urinary calcium excretion, and low levels of serum alkaline phosphatase, PTH, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. All patients responded to calcitonin.

Conclusions

Hypercalcemia is an uncommon complication of the ketogenic diet, and these children may represent the severe end of a clinical spectrum of disordered mineral metabolism. The mechanism for hypercalcemia is unknown but is consistent with excess bone resorption and impaired calcium excretion.

### Genetic evaluation of the child with intellectual disability or global developmental delay: clinical report [^1164d8he]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on developmental delay:

- **Definition**: DD in a child is an inability to achieve developmental milestones in comparison to peers of the same age range.
- **Pathophysiology**: DD is caused by genetic disorders (Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome), cerebral dysgenesis (microcephaly, hydrocephalus), vascular (occlusion, hemorrhage), drugs (cytotoxic, anti-epileptic), toxins (alcohol, smoking), early maternal infections (rubella, CMV), late maternal infections (varicella, HIV, malaria), prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal asphyxia, metabolic dysfunction, postnatal infections, head injury, stroke, maltreatment, malnutrition, and maternal mental health disorder.
- **Disease course**: Various prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal causes may lead to mild, moderate, and severe DD ranging from a single domain to multiple domains including growth (weight, height), occipitofrontal circumference, speech, fine motor skills, visual, auditory, and bone development. Late detection of DD may result in poor outcomes resulting in learning difficulties, behavior problems, and functional impairments later on in life.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: DD is not associated with increased mortality.

### A rare variant in the FHL1 gene associated with X-linked recessive hypoparathyroidism [^114DTCZZ]. Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Deep Sequencing, or Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), is a powerful tool to identify causative variants in clinical cases, where other methods have been exhausted. Here, we describe a 4-year-old male, born at full term following an uneventful pregnancy and delivery to non-consanguineous parents, and four siblings (Fig. 1) presented with generalized seizure at the age of 9 days. Upon ruling out all other major etiologies for seizures, initial evaluation identified severe hypocalcemia of 5.7 mg/dl [9–11], hyperphosphatemia of 11.5 mg/dl [5–9], and inappropriately low PTH of 20.7, alongside normal albumin, magnesium, potassium, chloride, blood gases, and vitamin D levels. Urinary calcium levels were low at 0.18 mg/dl [5.2–35.7]. Physical examination revealed no dysmorphic features, short stature, malformations, or developmental delay. Additional studies included chest X-ray, brain US, echocardiogram, renal ultrasound, electroencephalogram, bone age study, and audiogram were all normal. Following a clinical geneticist consultation, 22q11.2 deletion was ruled out via Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization (FISH). Sanger Sequencing detected no genomic variants in PTH and GCM2 genes. Since no additional loci were related to the phenotype, array-CGH was not performed.

Fig. 1
Family pedigree. Squares denote male family members, circles female members, and shaded symbols affected members; the arrow points to the proband

At the age of 4 years, the patient continued to exhibit persistent hypocalcemia alongside inappropriately low PTH levels. In addition, mild orolingual muscle weakness was detected in the patient. Notably, a younger, sixth female sibling was also found to have mild hypoparathyroidism albeit without any electrolyte abnormality, while all other family members exhibit normal PTH and calcium levels. The patient's father, as well as all other male siblings, demonstrates slight hypotonicity, requiring occupational therapy.

Taken together, these findings indicate that the patient suffers from isolated familial hypoparathyroidism of unknown origin. Exome sequencing of the affected male, his parents, and siblings was performed to detect a causal gene.

### Current evidence-based recommendations on investigating children with global developmental delay [^117Jkpyz]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Despite new advances in technology, particularly in the realm of genetic investigation, clinical assessment continues to be vital in guiding investigation. Clues to investigation may lie in the history and examination with clinical judgement being essential to enabling the right pathways to be taken in making a diagnosis. A good history can help direct which route to take in terms of investigation, particularly when exogenous causes are identified. Assessment over a period will provide clarity as to whether a condition is resolving, static or deteriorating. Assessment over time enables the phenotype to evolve and more appropriate targeting of investigations.

It is clear that establishing a diagnosis enables us to answer questions on: why it has happened (aetiology), what does it mean for our child (prognosis), what treatments might be available (precision medicine) and whether it can be prevented in the future (prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis).

In these recommendations, we have also highlighted the recent evidence that promotes metabolic screening tests to detect treatable conditions. This is a move away from older guidance where metabolic investigations were not recommended for children with no features/risk factors other than GDD. Though rare, the possibility of presentation as stable developmental delay and potential for treatment merits their inclusion as first-line tests. Treatment outcomes vary but can potentially improve cognitive development, slow deterioration, prevent metabolic decompensation and improve seizure control and systemic manifestations.

GDD and ID affect 2%–3% of the worldwide population with a lifetime cost of up to US$1 million. First-line metabolic investigations to identify treatable IEMs cost approximately $C568, with costs in Ireland for all first-line tests at €1335. Costs in the UK NHS laboratory for aCGH are not astronomical (£338–£350), with the majority of combined metabolic tests costing under £1000. Not all children will get a diagnosis and cost per diagnosis may be high, but there are obvious long-term cost savings if early diagnosis and treatment are possible. The options of genetic counselling and support for young families also make diagnosis invaluable.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117E4Y9W]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy — very low vitamin D status (25(OH)D < 10–12 ng/mL [< 25–30 nmol/L]) is associated with increased risk of neonatal hypocalcemic seizures, cardiomyopathy, and neonatal rickets, and many studies have described associations between 25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/mL, (< 50 nmol/L) and increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Whether nutritional requirements for vitamin D change during pregnancy is not known, and evidence for the role of vitamin D in improving perinatal outcomes is conflicting; accordingly, preconception or pregnancy-specific recommendations for vitamin D are not available, with no consensus on the dosage of vitamin D or 25(OH)D level required, and reported prevalence rates for low and very low vitamin D status (25(OH)D < 20 and < 12 ng/mL [< 50 and < 30 nmol/L], respectively) are high among women of reproductive age and during pregnancy. The guideline highlights two clinical questions: Question 8, "Should empiric vitamin D supplementation vs no empiric vitamin D supplementation be used during pregnancy?" and Question 9, "Should vitamin D supplementation vs no vitamin D supplementation be used during pregnancy only when 25(OH)D levels are below a threshold?"

5.8 Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs

In patients with or without a history of seizures or epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs, including topiramate, should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the potential for seizures or increased seizure frequency [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In situations where rapid withdrawal of topiramate is medically required, appropriate monitoring is recommended.

5.9 Decrease in Bone Mineral Density

Results of a one-year active-controlled study in pediatric patients (N = 63) demonstrated negative effects of topiramate monotherapy on bone mineral acquisition via statistically significant decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) measured in lumbar spine and in total body less head [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Twenty-one percent of topiramate-treated patients experienced clinically important reductions in BMD (Z score change from baseline of -0.5 or greater) compared to 0 patients in the control group. Although decreases in BMD occurred across all pediatric age subgroups, patients 6 to 9 years of age were most commonly affected. The sample size and study duration were too small to determine if fracture risk is increased. Decreased BMD in the lumbar spine was correlated with decreased serum bicarbonate, which commonly occurs with topiramate treatment and reflects metabolic acidosis, a known cause of increased bone resorption [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Although small decreases in some markers of bone metabolism (e.g., serum alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) occurred in topiramate-treated patients, more significant decreases in serum parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, hormones involved in bone metabolism, were observed, along with an increased excretion of urinary calcium.

5.10 Negative Effects on Growth (Height and Weight)

Results of a one-year active-controlled study of pediatric patients (N = 63) demonstrated negative effects of topiramate monotherapy on growth (i.e., height and weight) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Although continued growth was observed in both treatment groups, the topiramate group showed statistically significant reductions in mean annual change from baseline in body weight compared to the control group. A similar trend of attenuation in height velocity and height change from baseline was also observed in the topiramate group compared to the control group. Negative effects on weight and height were seen across all topiramate age subgroups. Growth (height and weight) of children receiving prolonged topiramate therapy should be carefully monitored.

### Activating calcium-sensing receptor gene variants in China: a case report of hypocalcaemia and literature review [^114LXdsb]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Autosomal dominant hypocalcaemia 1 (ADH1) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease, due to the activating mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) gene. The current paper presents a severe case of ADH1 with intellectual backwardness, and systematically reviews the reported 17 ADH1 patients in China.

Case Presentation

A 7 years old boy with recurrent seizures over 1 year was admitted at Yuying children' hospital, the clinical centre of south province of Zhejiang. Auxiliary examinations demonstrated hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalciuria, low parathyroid hormone (PTH), basal ganglia calcifications, normal range of serum creatinine, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Wechsler's intelligence test result indicated intellectually backward. The patient's genotype found a heterozygous variant in CASR gene, c.T416C p. (Ile139Thr). This article also systematically reviews the literatures on ADH1 in China and summarises the clinical characteristics and treatment.

Conclusions

ADH1 can be a cause of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism. Recognition and rational treatment is important for symptom improvement and reducing high potential adverse effects.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^112yAyNW]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) — definitions and diagnostic thresholds — Biochemical hypoPT is defined as a low intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level below the laboratory lower limit (usually 12 pg/mL) with hypocalcemia, while clinical hypoPT adds symptoms or signs of hypocalcemia; hypocalcemia itself is a total serum calcium below the center-specific reference range. Transient or temporary hypoPT lasts for less than six months after surgery, and permanent hypoPT continues beyond six months. The short half-life of PTH (3–5 minutes) contributes to postoperative vulnerability of parathyroid function. Parathyroid insufficiency (relative hypoPT) can occur after central neck surgery with symptoms despite normal laboratory values.

### Case report: a 10-year-old girl with primary hypoparathyroidism and systemic lupus erythematosus [^111TeFLX]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disease in children that occurs as a result of autoimmune destruction of the parathyroid glands, a defect in parathyroid gland development or secondary to physical parathyroid gland disturbance. Typical symptoms of hypoparathyroidism present as hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphatemia due to decreased parathyroid hormone secretion and may lead to nerve and muscles disturbances resulting in clinical manifestation of tetany, arrhythmias and epilepsy. Currently, there is no conventional hormone replacement treatment for hypoparathyroidism and therapeutic approaches include normalising mineral levels using an oral calcium supplement and active forms of vitamin D. Case presentation We present the case of a 10-year-old girl with primary hypoparathyroidism who had no prior history of autoimmune disorders, but who subsequently developed systemic lupus erythematosus.

Case presentation

A 5-year-old nonconsanguineous girl of African American and Hispanic origin presented with nephrotic syndrome, including nephrotic-range proteinuria (UPC of > 29 mg/mg), edema, and hypoalbuminemia. Her initial serum creatinine was 654 μmol/L. Other pertinent laboratory evaluation at time of presentation included albumin of 19 g/L, BUN of 38 mmol/L, potassium of 6 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 12 mmol/L, calcium of 1.7 mmol/L, phosphorus of 2.5 mmol/L, and parathyroid hormone of 396 ng/L. She was oligoanuric and hemodialysis was initiated. An ultrasound of her kidneys showed diffuse echogenicity and loss of corticomedullary differentiation (Fig. 1). Her history was significant for developmental delay and short stature. Her proteinuria presented in the setting of a previous respiratory illness but was not investigated. She has a normal-looking face and without dysmorphic features which was confirmed by the hospital's geneticist. An ophthalmological examination did not show cataract or retinal changes. She has normal looking ears and exhibited normal hearing. She was normocephalic and did not have an exam consistent with GAMOS and no uro-genital anomalies were identified. She had normal birth history, and her family history was not significant for renal, cardiac or neurological development problems.

### An unusual case of neonatal seizures as manifestation of asymptomatic maternal hypoparathyroidism [^114KBxaj]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Neonatal hypoparathyroidism is one of the rare causes of hypocalcaemia. Several cases of neonatal hypoparathyroidism secondary to maternal hyperparathyroidism have been reported. In this case report, we have a term neonate with normal birth history who presented with late onset hypocalcemic seizures. After excluding polyendocrinopathies and related syndromes, hypocalcaemia seizures were secondary to maternal asymptomatic hypoparathyroidism. Since this is one variety of unusual case of maternal and fetal hypoparathyroidism, further testing was mandatory to confirm familial origin. This focuses on the need for every clinician to test maternal metabolic status in case of neonatal manifestations.

Table 1.
Clinical data for families 1 and 2

An unrelated child of Spanish origin was hospitalized with convulsions at the age of 7 months (Fig. 1 A, F2). Nystagmus had been observed since birth. Blood analysis demonstrated the presence of severe hypomagnesaemia (0.44 mmol/L) (Table 1). Serum ionized Ca 2+ levels were low during episodes of convulsions (0.94 mmol/L), but were restored to normal values. Mg 2+ supplementation was unable to restore Mg 2+ levels (0.51 mmol/L) and urinary Mg 2+ excretion was increased (fractional excretion of magnesium 22%, normal value < 2.2%) and was associated with low urinary calcium excretion. He did not present proteinuria (protein:creatinine ratio < 22 mg/mmol) and PTH levels were in the normal range. Ultrasound evaluation showed normal kidneys. Since the first diagnosis, the patient has suffered repeatedly from seizures (epilepsy associated with psychomotor retardation). Other complementary examinations aimed at studying psychomotor retardation and epilepsy were negative. Both parents were healthy and had normal serum Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ levels (mother: Mg 2+ 0.77 mmol/L, total Ca 2.32 mmol/L; father: Mg 2+ 0.82 mmol/L, Ca 2+ 2.35 mmol/L).
