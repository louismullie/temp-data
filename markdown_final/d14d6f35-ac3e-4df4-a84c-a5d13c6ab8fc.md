## Question

How do clinicians diagnose alcohol-related ketosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how clinicians diagnose alcohol-related ketosis (alcoholic ketoacidosis, AKA) using the supplied literature. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical context and triggers that raise suspicion for AKA. Then, I should verify the focused history and examination features that differentiate AKA from other high–anion gap acidoses. Next, I will review the core laboratory strategy, including acid–base assessment, serum ketones, and the role of glucose. After that, I need to check the key differentials — DKA (including euglycemic DKA), starvation ketosis, and toxic alcohols — and the specific tests that help separate them. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic approach and highlight pitfalls and confirmatory steps with appropriate references throughout [^115qd9am] [^114cqmGM] [^113KospR] [^115BXWUQ].

> Let me first confirm the clinical definition and typical scenario. Alcoholic ketoacidosis is a metabolic acidosis with ketosis occurring in a person who uses alcohol, classically after heavy intake followed by abrupt cessation or markedly reduced oral intake; patients often present dehydrated, nauseated, and vomiting, with an anion gap acidosis and elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate, while serum glucose is low, normal, or only mildly elevated [^115qd9am] [^116HMEp8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before establishing the precipitating context and overlap with other ketotic states. Chronic alcohol use, recent binge episodes, prolonged vomiting, and poor nutrition are common precipitants, but a similar history may also lead to starvation ketosis or euglycemic DKA, particularly in patients with diabetes or exposure to SGLT2 inhibitors; I should confirm medication history, including any recent SGLT2 inhibitor use and timing relative to symptoms [^115qd9am] [^1152Ag4y] [^1147X3RR] [^112UNHfj].

> I need to check the focused history carefully. Let me ask about the pattern and timing of alcohol consumption and cessation, duration of poor oral intake, vomiting, abdominal pain, known diabetes and insulin adherence, and any SGLT2 inhibitor or ketogenic diet use; I should also ask about ingestion risks for toxic alcohols or solvents and coexisting illnesses that could raise lactate, because these findings pivot the differential away from isolated AKA if present [^114cqmGM] [^115BXWUQ] [^111QBddX].

> Next, I will examine for targeted physical signs. I should verify volume depletion (dry mucosae, tachycardia, hypotension), respiratory pattern (Kussmaul respirations can occur with any severe metabolic acidosis), abdominal tenderness, and any altered mental status; importantly, the presence or absence of coma does not rule in or out AKA by itself, so I need to correlate with labs [^115qd9am] [^114cqmGM] [^116oYFnC].

> Now, I need to establish the core laboratory panel and acid–base profile. I will obtain a basic metabolic panel to calculate the anion gap, venous or arterial blood gas for pH and bicarbonate, serum beta-hydroxybutyrate if available, serum lactate, and renal function; because severe volume contraction can elevate lactate and confound the picture, measuring lactate on admission is particularly helpful, and I should also obtain blood glucose concurrently [^114cqmGM] [^113KospR] [^1163sSVX].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I started to write that blood glucose distinguishes AKA by being low, normal, or mildly elevated and rarely greater than 200 mg/dL, but I cut myself off mid-sentence; let me correct that and be precise. In AKA, plasma glucose ranges from hypoglycemia to mild hyperglycemia, rarely exceeding 200 mg/dL, whereas in classic DKA it is usually above 250 mg/dL, although euglycemic DKA remains an important exception that prevents overreliance on glucose alone for triage decisions [^114cqmGM] [^1152Ag4y].

> I should double-check the optimal way to confirm ketosis. Because beta-hydroxybutyrate predominates in ketogenic acidoses and nitroprusside assays detect acetoacetate (and poorly detect acetone), urine dipsticks can underestimate total ketone burden; when available, direct venous or capillary beta-hydroxybutyrate measurement is preferred for diagnosis and for monitoring response, and point-of-care beta-hydroxybutyrate has better specificity than urine ketones at common cut points [^116QT6D3] [^113KospR] [^115AoRxm] [^116sN1Mz].

> But wait, what if the anion gap is high and the osmolal gap is also increased — could this reflect a toxic alcohol? I need to ensure calculation of measured–calculated osmolal gap and consider ethylene glycol or methanol if the gap is elevated; both measured and calculated gaps evolve over time with metabolism, and AKA itself can sometimes be associated with an increased osmolal gap, so serial assessment plus targeted assays and clinical context are essential to avoid missing toxic alcohols [^115BXWUQ] [^111QBddX].

> Hold on, I should verify SGLT2-related ketoacidosis risk and the approach when glucose is normal. In symptomatic patients on SGLT2 inhibitors, clinicians should assess serum or urine ketones even if glucose is normal and consider euglycemic DKA; FDA labeling emphasizes that ketoacidosis may present with glucose below 250 mg/dL, and clinical guidelines recommend acting on ketone results and acid–base status rather than glucose alone in these contexts [^1147X3RR] [^1113QQiV] [^117SrKhk] [^111N7noh].

> Let me reconsider other high–anion gap acidoses I must exclude in parallel. Lactic acidosis, renal failure, salicylates, and toxic alcohols (methanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol) can produce similar acid–base pictures; a systematic approach with targeted testing (lactate, salicylate level, osmolar gap, urinalysis for oxalate crystals, and specific alcohol assays where available) helps prevent anchoring on AKA when another primary process is present or coexists [^114cqmGM] [^1164Bq47] [^115BXWUQ].

> I should confirm that pancreatitis and starvation can complicate the picture. Alcoholic pancreatitis and prolonged poor intake may drive euglycemic DKA or mixed ketotic states in patients with diabetes; in these cases, beta-hydroxybutyrate elevation plus anion gap acidosis with euglycemia should still trigger a DKA protocol while the underlying pancreatitis and nutritional deficits are addressed [^112UNHfj].

> Now I will synthesize the diagnostic pattern that supports AKA. The combination of a high–anion gap metabolic acidosis with marked ketonemia (beta-hydroxybutyrate elevated), history of heavy alcohol use followed by cessation and reduced caloric intake, dehydration, and low/normal/mildly elevated glucose strongly favors AKA, particularly when toxic alcohol evaluation is negative and lactate elevation is explained by hypovolemia; documenting this pattern and the clinical trajectory helps differentiate from DKA and starvation ketosis at the bedside [^115qd9am] [^114cqmGM].

> Wait, I initially planned to lay out a table of "ketosis–acidosis panel" tests, but that risks oversimplifying; let me restate it narratively and be explicit. Order a basic metabolic panel for anion gap and renal function, point-of-care or laboratory beta-hydroxybutyrate, venous blood gas for pH and bicarbonate, serum lactate, and blood glucose; then add serum osmolality with an osmolal gap calculation and targeted toxicology tests if clinically indicated, recognizing the limitations of urine ketone dipsticks and prioritizing direct beta-hydroxybutyrate quantification [^113KospR] [^114cqmGM] [^111QBddX] [^113eLXyY].

> I need to ensure I don't misclassify AKA as DKA and over-treat with insulin. Alcoholic ketoacidosis may rarely present with hyperglycemia and can be mistaken for DKA; initiating insulin without dextrose and thiamine in AKA risks iatrogenic hypoglycemia, so I should cross-check the clinical history and lab pattern before committing to a DKA protocol, while remaining vigilant for mixed AKA–DKA presentations in people with diabetes and alcohol use [^113AqPuz] [^115qd9am].

> Action: Let me finalize the diagnostic approach. Suspect AKA in alcohol users with recent cessation and vomiting; confirm high–anion gap metabolic acidosis and elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate; verify glucose is not markedly elevated and assess ketones directly; screen for toxic alcohols and other HAGMA causes when the osmolal gap or clinical story suggests it; and document the pattern that points to AKA versus DKA or starvation ketosis before initiating condition-specific therapy and monitoring response to dextrose–saline, thiamine, and electrolytes as supportive diagnostic confirmation through rapid biochemical improvement [^115qd9am] [^115BXWUQ] [^114cqmGM].

Alcohol-related ketosis (alcoholic ketoacidosis, AKA) [^116HMEp8] is diagnosed by a combination of **clinical history, laboratory findings, and exclusion of other causes** [^111QBddX]. The key diagnostic features are **high anion gap metabolic acidosis** [^1164Bq47] with **elevated β-hydroxybutyrate** [^115qd9am] and **normal or low glucose** [^114cqmGM] in a patient with recent heavy alcohol use and poor oral intake.

---

## Clinical history and presentation

- **Alcohol use**: Recent heavy or chronic alcohol consumption [^115qd9am], often with abrupt cessation or reduction [^116HMEp8].
- **Poor intake**: Nausea, vomiting [^115qd9am], abdominal pain [^115HCHhw], and poor oral intake.
- **Mental status**: Typically preserved [^115qd9am] or only mildly altered, unlike DKA [^114cqmGM].

---

## Laboratory findings

- **Anion gap**: Elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis [^115qd9am] (anion gap > 12 mEq/L) [^1164Bq47].
- **Ketones**: Elevated serum β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) [^111N7noh], often > 3 mmol/L [^115qd9am].
- **Glucose**: Normal, low, or mildly elevated [^115qd9am] serum glucose (usually < 250 mg/dL) [^114cqmGM].
- **Lactate**: Elevated serum lactate [^114Tau7X] due to impaired hepatic metabolism [^115qd9am].
- **Electrolytes**: Hypokalemia [^1135r4eb], hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia [^115qd9am] are common [^116HMEp8].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

Diagnosis is **based on the following criteria** [^115qd9am]:

| **Criterion** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Clinical history | - Recent heavy alcohol use <br/> - Poor oral intake <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Abdominal pain [^116HMEp8] |
| Laboratory findings | - Elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis <br/> - Elevated serum β-hydroxybutyrate <br/> - Normal or low glucose <br/> - Elevated lactate [^113KospR] [^111f8ug3] |
| Exclusion of other causes | - Rule out diabetic ketoacidosis <br/> - Starvation ketosis <br/> - Toxic alcohol ingestion [^114cqmGM] [^111QBddX] |

---

## Differentiation from other ketoacidosis

Alcohol-related ketosis must be **differentiated from diabetic ketoacidosis**, which features hyperglycemia (> 250 mg/dL) [^114cqmGM], elevated β-hydroxybutyrate [^111N7noh], and metabolic acidosis. It should also be distinguished from **starvation ketosis** [^1164Bq47], which typically presents with mild ketosis, normal or low glucose, and minimal acidosis [^114cqmGM].

---

## Diagnostic tests and biomarkers

- **Serum β-hydroxybutyrate**: Direct measurement is the most reliable test [^112H9My1] for diagnosing [^111N7noh] and monitoring ketosis [^113KospR].
- **Urine ketones**: Useful adjunct [^116sN1Mz] but less specific than serum β-hydroxybutyrate [^114o9ADe].
- **Blood gas analysis**: Essential for assessing acid-base status [^1163sSVX] and severity of acidosis [^111f8ug3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize a detailed alcohol use and dietary history [^116HMEp8]; laboratory evaluation with **serum β-hydroxybutyrate measurement** [^113KospR], blood gas analysis [^1163sSVX], and electrolyte assessment [^114cqmGM]; and exclusion of alternative causes of ketoacidosis [^111QBddX]. Clinicians should specifically rule out diabetic ketoacidosis [^114cqmGM] and toxic alcohol ingestion [^115BXWUQ]. Diagnosis combines clinical history and laboratory findings while excluding other causes, with **elevated β-hydroxybutyrate** [^115qd9am] and **normal or low glucose** [^114cqmGM] as key features.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: {beta}-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^116sN1Mz]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

A total of 859 patients were screened, of which 616 provided informed consent. Out of these, 516 (83.7%) had all data elements necessary for data analysis. Excluded patients included 49 with no urine dipstick, 30 with no serum pH via venous blood gas, and 21 with no serum chemistry panel. In our final sample, 54 out of 516 subjects (10.5%) met the ADA criteria for DKA.

- **Demographic and laboratory characteristics**: See Table 1 for sample characteristics.

- **Diagnostic accuracy**: At the manufacturer-suggested cutoff of > 1.5 mmol/L, the sensitivity of capillary β-OHB and the urine dipstick for DKA were identical at 98.1% (95% CI 90.1–100). However, the specificity of β-OHB was significantly higher than the urine dipstick, with β-OHB at 78.6% (95% CI 74.5–82.2) versus 35.1% (95% CI 30.7–39.6) for the urine dipstick. The specificity improves further to 82.3% when the cutoff for β-OHB is increased to > 2 mmol/L, while maintaining the same sensitivity of 98.1%.

### Alcoholic ketoacidosis: Etiologies, evaluation, and management [^115qd9am]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is defined by metabolic acidosis and ketosis in a patient with alcohol use. This condition commonly presents in the emergency department (ED) and requires targeted therapies.

- **Objective**: This narrative review evaluates the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of AKA for emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: AKA is frequently evaluated and managed in the ED. The underlying pathophysiology is related to poor glycogen stores and elevated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and hydrogen. This results in metabolic acidosis with elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate levels. Patients with AKA most commonly present with a history of alcohol use (acute or chronic), poor oral intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, and ketoacidosis on laboratory assessment. Patients are generally dehydrated, and serum glucose can be low, normal, or mildly elevated. An anion gap metabolic acidosis with ketosis and electrolyte abnormalities are usually present on laboratory evaluation. Management includes fluid resuscitation, glucose and vitamin supplementation, electrolyte repletion, and evaluation for other conditions.

- **Conclusions**: Emergency clinician knowledge of the evaluation and management of AKA is essential in caring for these patients.

### Hyperglycemic crises in adult patients with diabetes [^114cqmGM]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis: Not all patients with ketoacidosis have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Starvation ketosis and alcoholic ketoacidosis are distinguished by clinical history and plasma glucose concentrations that range from mildly elevated (rarely > 200 mg/dl) to hypoglycemia. Additionally, although alcoholic ketoacidosis can result in profound acidosis, the serum bicarbonate concentration in starvation ketosis is usually not less than 18 mEq/l. DKA must also be distinguished from other causes of high–anion gap metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis; ingestion of drugs such as salicylate, methanol, ethylene glycol, and paraldehyde; and acute chronic renal failure. Because lactic acidosis is more common in patients with diabetes than in nondiabetic persons, and because elevated lactic acid levels may occur in severely volume-contracted patients, plasma lactate should be measured on admission.

A clinical history of previous drug abuse should be sought. Measurement of serum salicylate and blood methanol levels may be helpful. Ethylene glycol (antifreeze) is suggested by the presence of calcium oxalate and hippurate crystals in the urine. Paraldehyde ingestion is indicated by its characteristic strong odor on the breath. Because these intoxicants are low–molecular weight organic compounds, they can produce an osmolar gap in addition to the anion gap acidosis. A recent report states that active cocaine use is an independent risk factor for recurrent DKA.

Recently, one case report has shown that a patient with diagnosed acromegaly may present with DKA as the primary manifestation of the disease.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis as a complication of methanol poisoning; a case report [^111yMWkm]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Alcoholic beverages are prohibited in Islamic countries like Iran; therefore, methanol intoxication is rather prevalent in these countries. Methanol is essentially found in various household and industrial chemicals. Methanol poisoning often happens due to its accidental ingestion and can be fatal if left untreated. This intoxication should be included in differential diagnoses of any altered mental status.

In low-income countries, toxicologists face obstacles, including lack of laboratory tests to detect blood levels of methanol and its metabolites, making the diagnosis and management more complicated. Methanol is not toxic per se, while accumulation of its active metabolite, formic acid, plays a major role in the development of metabolic acidosis. In the late stages of intoxication, cellular damage is due to acidosis and the histotoxic effect of formate, which is accompanied by formation of free radicals.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening acute condition that more commonly occurs in type I diabetes. If DKA overlaps with high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) due to any other reason, it may become challengingly difficult to diagnose DKA.

In this case scenario, methanol poisoning was accompanied by DKA in a diabetic patient. Such a condition pronounces the hyperglycemic effect of methanol. On the other hand, DKA itself can be due to excessive exogenous acids like methanol. Additionally, stress-induced hyperglycemia is seen in critically ill and poisoned patients. In other words, increases in counterregulatory hormones as a result of acute stress caused by poisoning may contribute to hyperglycemia.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis: Etiologies, evaluation, and management [^1152Ag4y]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is an endocrine emergency. A subset of diabetic patients may present with relative euglycemia and acidosis, known as euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA), which is often misdiagnosed due to a serum glucose level below 250 mg/dL.

- **Objective**: This narrative review evaluates the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of EDKA for emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: EDKA is characterized by serum glucose below 250 mg/dL, with an anion gap metabolic acidosis and ketosis. It most commonly occurs in patients with a history of low glucose states, such as starvation, chronic liver disease, pregnancy, infection, and alcohol use. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which result in increased urinary glucose excretion, are also associated with EDKA. The underlying pathophysiology involves insulin deficiency or resistance with glucagon release, poor glucose availability, ketone body production, and urinary glucose excretion. Patients typically present with nausea, vomiting, malaise, or fatigue. Physicians must determine and treat the underlying etiology of EDKA. Laboratory assessment includes venous blood gas for serum pH, bicarbonate, and ketones. Management includes resuscitation with intravenous fluids, insulin, and glucose, along with treatment of the underlying etiology.

- **Conclusions**: Clinician knowledge of this condition can improve the evaluation and management of patients with EDKA.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^116MTGQQ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Low credibility.

Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a potentially fatal complication of type 1 diabetes, present with hyperglycemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis. Blood glucose and blood ketone results are often used to triage patients with suspected DKA. This study aimed to establish how effective blood glucose and blood ketone (beta-hydroxybutyrate, BOHB) measurements are in identifying patients with significant acidosis and sought to validate existing diagnostic BOHB thresholds.

- **Methods**: Initial Emergency Department results on 161 presumptive DKA episodes in 95 patients (42 F, 53 M, age range 14–89 years) containing a complete dataset of D (glucose), K (BOHB), and A (bicarbonate [HCO3] and pH) results.

- **Results**: Blood glucose correlated poorly with BOHB (r = 0.28, p = 0.0003), pH (r = -0.25, p = 0.002), and HCO3 (r = -0.17, p = 0.04). BOHB, though better, was still limited in predicting pH (r = -0.44), HCO3 (r = -0.49, p < 0.0001). BOHB levels varied significantly between hyperglycemic (≥ 13.9 mmol/L, n = 8), ketonemic (≤ 3 mmol/L, n = 9), or either (n = 5) cases.

- **Conclusions**: The commonly employed BOHB diagnostic cutoff of 3 mmol/L could not be verified. Since acid-base status was poorly predicted by both glucose and BOHB, this highlights that, regardless of their results, pH and/or HCO3 should also be tested in any patient suspected of DKA.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^116QT6D3]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Ketone bodies are usually present in urine and blood but in very low concentrations (e.g. total serum ketones, < 0.5 mmol/L). Increased ketone concentrations detected in patients with known diabetes, or in previously undiagnosed patients presenting with hyperglycemia, suggest impending or established diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a medical emergency. The two major mechanisms for high ketone concentrations in patients with diabetes are increased production from triglycerides and decreased utilization in the liver — both due to an absolute or relative insulin deficiency and increased counter-regulatory hormones, including cortisol, epinephrine, glucagon, and growth hormone.

The principal ketone bodies, β-hydroxybutyrate (βHBA) and acetoacetate (AcAc), are typically present in approximately equimolar amounts. Acetone, usually present in only small quantities, is derived from the spontaneous decarboxylation of AcAc. The equilibrium between AcAc and βHBA is shifted towards βHBA formation in any condition that alters the redox state of hepatic mitochondria to increase NADH concentrations, such as hypoxia, fasting, metabolic disorders (including DKA), and alcoholic ketoacidosis. Thus, assay methods for ketones that do not include βHBA measurement may provide misleading clinical information by underestimating total ketone body concentration.

### Hyperglycemic emergencies in adults [^116GY5Zs]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly concerning beta-hydroxybutyrate, the DC 2018 guidelines recommend considering point-of-care capillary β-hydroxybutyrate testing in the hospital or outpatient setting. This screening is advised for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who have a capillary blood glucose level greater than 14 mmol/L.

### Farxiga [^1147X3RR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, Farxiga significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo. Farxiga is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g. history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including Farxiga.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing Farxiga.

### Inpefa [^112WAsUA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, Inpefa significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to those who received placebo; this risk may be greater with higher doses of Inpefa. Inpefa is not indicated for glycemic control.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders, such as a history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery, are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes using SGLT2 inhibitors.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, insulin dose reduction, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for three days after discontinuing Inpefa [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of adverse events.

### Hyperglycemic emergencies in adults [^113266Dq]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetic ketoacidosis, specifically concerning beta-hydroxybutyrate, the DC 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining further testing for DKA if the β-hydroxybutyrate level is greater than 1.5 mmol/L.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^117Vb2Nc]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). High credibility.

The collection of the three components required to meet a DKA diagnosis — namely, increased glucose, increased blood ketones, and metabolic acidosis — is not consistently gathered. This inconsistency could potentially be detrimental if clinical staff do not see the need to assess the acid-base status of a patient because their blood glucose and/or ketones have not themselves reached their respective diagnostic thresholds. This could delay a diagnosis or lead to the patient re-presenting later with more severe illness. One approach to tackle this situation is the recommendation to reduce the threshold level for acting on blood ketones, for instance by having intermediate blood ketone concentrations such as 1.6–3 mmol/L or even lower. Our data includes patients with BOHB values of 1.6 to 18 mmol/L.

Euglycemic DKA, which was thought to comprise up to 10% of DKA presentations even before the advent of SGLT2 inhibitors, limits the lowering of glucose cut-offs in a similar way to BOHB. Indeed, this is the reason given for one guideline removing blood glucose altogether as a diagnostic criterion. In addition, exogenous ketone bodies themselves are known to be associated with a hypoglycemic effect, so it is possible that this phenomenon could influence the association between endogenous BOHB.

### Alcoholic ketoacidosis [^116HMEp8]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is a common reason for investigation and admission of alcohol-dependent patients in UK emergency departments. Although it is well described in international emergency medicine literature, UK emergency physicians rarely make the diagnosis of AKA. There is increasing evidence that, rather than being benign and self-limiting, AKA may be a significant cause of mortality in patients with alcohol dependence. This literature review discusses the history, characterization, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of AKA.

### Illnesses associated with ketosis including diabetic ketoacidosis during very low carbohydrate and ketogenic diets [^115PxhsG]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Due to warnings from the American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology against combining SGLT2 inhibitors with very low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKD) due to the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), the safety protocol is to stop SGLT2 inhibitors a few days before diet changes in people without cardiorenal indications. For individuals with cardiorenal SGLT2-inhibitor indications, the medications are continued through diet changes to maintain protective benefits. Diabetes medications, including SGLT2 inhibitors, are started de novo or resumed if needed for persistent hyperglycemia despite dietary changes.

All patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors in combination with carbohydrate restriction receive anticipatory guidance on the risk of DKA, a description of DKA symptoms, and caution on avoidable risk factors such as dehydration, fasting, and heavy alcohol use. A safety protocol is provided to hold the medication and hydrate if the ketones rise above 3 mmol/L and to resume the medication when the fingerstick blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) falls below 2 mmol/L.

### Teaching neuroimages: Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation in aceruloplasminemia [^116nstSZ]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

A 55-year-old African Canadian man with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and alcohol abuse presented with diabetic ketoacidosis. Progressive cognitive decline over the previous five years resulted in long-term care placement. Aside from pigmentary retinopathy, the general examination was unremarkable. MRI demonstrated iron accumulation in the brain (figure 1) and liver (figure 2A). Ceruloplasmin, a ferroxidase enzyme important in iron homeostasis, was undetectable and associated with low serum iron, low serum copper, and a tenfold increase in serum ferritin. Liver biopsy confirmed increased hepatocyte iron storage (figure 2B). Aceruloplasminemia was diagnosed. Iron chelation was not administered given the advanced dementia at presentation.

### Invokana [^114yKi7v]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, Invokana significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received a placebo; this risk may be greater with higher doses of Invokana. Invokana is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g. history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including Invokana.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL).

### Diabetic ketoacidosis as a complication of methanol poisoning; a case report [^116e1FPA]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Methanol intoxication is a toxicologic emergency that occurs due to the ingestion of methanol-containing alcoholic beverages, particularly in countries where alcohol consumption is prohibited. It is crucial to recognize methanol poisoning promptly and initiate treatment immediately in cases of high suspicion. Delays in treatment can result in severe consequences, including blindness and death. Symptoms encompass gastrointestinal and visual complications that may lead to critical involvement of the central nervous system and eventual complete vision loss. The formation of formic acid is responsible for the high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA).

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is one of the most debilitating complications of diabetes, presenting with nausea, vomiting, dehydration, abdominal pain, acetone breath, and a Kussmaul breathing pattern. Diabetic ketoacidosis is also associated with HAGMA. It is imperative to differentiate DKA from other causes of metabolic acidosis. We present a case of methanol poisoning presenting with DKA.

### Fasting ketone levels vary by age: Implications for differentiating physiologic from pathologic ketotic hypoglycemia [^111KPh1w]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Ketone production is a physiological phenomenon that occurs during the beta-oxidation of free fatty acids. Distinguishing physiologic ketosis from pathologic overproduction or underutilization of ketones is critical as part of the diagnostic evaluation of disorders of carbohydrate metabolism. There is limited literature on normal ketone production during fasting. Our aim is to measure fasting serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations in healthy children after an overnight fast.

- **Methods**: Children ≤ 18 years of age were prospectively recruited from elective procedures through our surgery centers. Exclusion criteria included a history of diabetes, hypopituitarism, adrenal, metabolic, or inflammatory disorders, dietary restrictions, trauma, or use of medications that might affect blood glucose. Serum glucose, cortisol, and BHB were assessed after an overnight fast.

- **Results**: Data from 94 participants (mean age 8.3 ± 5.7 years, 54% male, 46% female) were analyzed. Children ≤ 3 years of age (n = 19) have significantly higher mean (0.40 ± 0.06 mmol/L) and median (0.4, IQR 0.2–0.6 mmol/L) BHB concentrations compared to children > 3 years of age (n = 75) with mean (0.21 ± 0.02 mmol/L) and median BHB (0.1, IQR 0.1–0.2 mmol/L) concentrations. BHB concentrations > 1.0 mmol/L were rare (2%, n = 2), and 74% (n = 70) of participants had BHB levels < 0.5 mmol/L. BHB levels > 1.0 mmol/L are rare within our population and may identify a value above which there are few participants.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114o9ADe]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Interpretation

- **Recommendation**: Ketones measured in urine or blood in the home setting by patients with diabetes and in the clinic/hospital setting should be considered only an adjunct to the diagnosis of DKA GPP.

- **Urine ketone measurements**: The presence of positive urine ketone readings in a patient with known diabetes or a patient not previously diagnosed with diabetes but who presents with typical symptoms of diabetes and hyperglycemia suggests the possibility of impending or established DKA. Although DKA is most commonly associated with type 1 diabetes, it may occur rarely in type 2 diabetic patients. Patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis will have positive urine ketone readings, but hyperglycemia is not usually present. Positive urine ketone readings are found in up to 30% of first morning urine samples from pregnant women (with or without diabetes), during starvation, and after hypoglycemia.

- **Recommendation**: Blood ketone determinations that rely on the nitroprusside reaction should be used only as an adjunct to diagnose DKA and should not be used to monitor DKA treatment. Specific measurement of βHBA in blood can be used for diagnosis and monitoring of DKA B (moderate).

- **Blood ketone measurements**: Blood ketone measurements that rely on the nitroprusside reaction should be used with caution for DKA diagnosis because the results do not quantify βHBA, the predominant ketone in DKA. The test should not be used to monitor the course of therapy because AcAc and acetone may increase as βHBA decreases during successful therapy.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^1135r4eb]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly concerning potassium replacement, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend establishing adequate renal function (urine output approximately 0.5 mL/kg/h) and monitoring serum potassium levels for potassium replacement. The guidance for potassium management is as follows:

- **Serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L**: Faster potassium replacement will require central venous access.
- **Serum potassium 3.5–5.0 mmol/L**: Administer 10–20 mmol of potassium in each liter of IV fluid as needed to maintain serum potassium at 4–5 mmol/L.
- **Serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L**: Start insulin, but do not administer potassium. Assess serum potassium every 2 hours.

### Features and long-term outcomes of patients hospitalized for diabetic ketoacidosis [^115jndm7]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute metabolic complication characterized by hyperglycemia, ketones in blood or urine, and acidosis. The aim of this study was to characterize features of patients hospitalized for DKA, to identify triggers for DKA, and to evaluate the long-term effects of DKA on glycemic control, complications of diabetes, re-hospitalizations, and mortality.

Historical prospectively collected data of patients hospitalized to medical wards for DKA between 2011 and 2017 was used. Data regarding comorbidities, mortality, triggers, and re-hospitalizations for DKA were also collected.

- **Results**: The cohort consisted of 160 patients (mean age 38 ± 18 years, 43% male). One-fifth of the patients (34 patients, 21%) were newly diagnosed with diabetes, and DKA was their first presentation of the disease. Among the 126 patients with pre-existing diabetes, the common identified triggers for DKA were poor compliance to treatment (22%) and infectious diseases (18%). During over 7 years of follow-up, the mortality rate was 9% (15 patients), and the re-hospitalization rate for DKA was 31% (50 patients). Risk factors for re-hospitalization for DKA included young age (OR = 1.02, 95% CI, 1.00–1.04), pre-existing diabetes compared to DKA as the first presentation (OR = 5.4, 95% CI, 1.7–18), and poorer glycemic control before initial hospitalization (10.5 ± 2.5% vs. 9.4 ± 2.2%; OR = 0.8, 95% CI [0.68–0.96]) and after discharge (10.3 ± 2.4% vs. 9.0 ± 1.9%; OR = 0.73, 95% CI [0.61–0.87]).

### Hyperglycemic crises in adults with diabetes: A consensus report [^113aX4rv]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, specifically concerning fluid resuscitation, the ADA 2024 guidelines recommend modifying replacement fluids once the plasma glucose concentration is less than 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L). These fluids should contain 5–10% dextrose in addition to 0.9% sodium chloride to prevent hypoglycemia. This allows for continued insulin administration until ketonemia is corrected, as plasma glucose concentrations usually decrease before the resolution of ketoacidosis, typically within 4–8 hours.

### Unexplained metabolic acidosis: Alcoholic ketoacidosis or propylene glycol toxicity [^114Tau7X]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). Low credibility.

Severe metabolic acidosis with elevated anion and osmol gap is suggestive of toxic alcohol ingestion. The absence of detectable methanol or ethylene glycol in the serum could indicate that metabolism is complete or that other hypotheses must be considered. Ingestion of less common alcohols or alcoholic ketoacidosis should be investigated, as illustrated by the present observation.

- **Case report**: A 46-year-old woman was admitted with altered consciousness in the emergency department. In the presence of a high anion gap (peak value 39 mEq/L) metabolic acidosis with a mildly increased osmol gap (peak value 19 mOsm/kg), there was a high suspicion of toxic alcohol ingestion in an individual with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Serum arterial lactate concentration was particularly high at 27 mmol/L. Urinalysis failed to reveal the presence of ketone bodies or oxalate crystals. The results of the serum determination of ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropanol were obtained within 2 hours and were negative. Due to the severity of lactic metabolic acidosis and the persistent suspicion of intoxication by a less common toxic alcohol, antidotal therapy with ethanol was initiated together with hemodialysis. Correction of lactic metabolic acidosis was obtained. Results of urinalysis obtained later revealed the presence not only of propylene glycol and D-lactate but also of significant concentrations of ß-hydroxybutyrate as a marker of alcoholic ketoacidosis.

- **Discussion**: The combination of propylene glycol ingestion and alcoholic ketoacidosis may have contributed to the severity of the case.

### Jardiance [^1113QQiV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Jardiance significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. This risk is observed beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials involving patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly higher in those receiving sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to those receiving a placebo, with fatal ketoacidosis having occurred with Jardiance. Notably, Jardiance is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and those with pancreatic disorders (e.g. history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also at risk for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal ketoacidosis events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including Jardiance.

- **Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis**: These include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

- **Signs and symptoms**: Consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis, they include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be lower than typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected.

### Qtern [^116sL3TC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus and other ketoacidosis**: Inform patients that Qtern can cause potentially fatal ketoacidosis and that Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g. history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are risk factors. Educate all patients on precipitating factors such as insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, infection, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, dehydration, and alcohol abuse. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and labored breathing. Inform patients that blood glucose levels may be normal even in the presence of ketoacidosis. Advise patients that they may be asked to monitor ketones. If symptoms of ketoacidosis occur, instruct patients to discontinue Qtern and seek medical attention immediately.

- **Pancreatitis**: Inform patients that acute pancreatitis has been reported during postmarketing use of saxagliptin. Persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back, which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting, is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis. Instruct patients to promptly discontinue Qtern and contact their healthcare provider if persistent severe abdominal pain occurs.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^113eLXyY]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Urine ketones**: The concentrations of ketones in the urine of healthy individuals are below the detection limits of commercially available testing materials. False-positive results have been reported with highly colored urine and in the presence of several sulfhydryl-containing drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Urine test reagents deteriorate with exposure to air, giving false-negative readings; therefore, testing material should be stored in tightly sealed containers and discarded after the expiration date on the manufacturer's label. False-negative readings have also been reported with highly acidic urine samples, such as after large intakes of ascorbic acid. Loss of ketones from urine attributable to microbial action can also cause false-negative readings. Because acetone is a highly volatile substance, samples should be kept in a closed container. For point-of-care analyses in medical facilities and for patients in the home setting, control materials (that give both negative and positive readings) are not commercially available but would be desirable to ensure accuracy of test results.

- **Analytical**: Several assay principles have been described. Most commonly used is the colorimetric reaction that occurs between AcAc and nitroprusside (sodium nitroferricyanide) to produce a purple color. This method is widely available in the form of dipsticks and tablets and is used to measure ketones in both the urine and blood (either serum or plasma). Several manufacturers offer dipsticks for measuring glucose and ketones.

### Significant ketoacidosis at autopsy: A single-centre systematic review [^113d2JBQ]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to examine the value of vitreous beta-hydroxybutyrate and serum acetone in the investigation of sudden unexpected death.

- **Methods**: Coroners' autopsy reports from a provincial UK city, with a population of approximately 900,000, over a 24-month period with significant ketoacidosis were studied. Demographic features, medical history, anatomical and histological findings, and biochemical parameters, including renal function, vitreous glucose, serum and vitreous alcohol, were analysed.

- **Results**: Forty-two cases (28 males and 14 females) were identified; 55% had a history of alcohol and/or substance misuse, and mental health problems, particularly depression and anxiety, and 16% were diabetic. In all, 50% of subjects had alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA), 19% had diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and 12% had a history of both diabetes and alcohol abuse. In 19% of cases, an exact cause of ketoacidosis was established. In AKA, the subjects typically had low vitreous glucose and low or undetected blood alcohol levels. All of the subjects with raised vitreous glucose levels had DKA.

- **Conclusion**: Ketoacidosis is relatively common and should be considered as a cause of sudden death, especially in alcoholic patients and patients with diabetes with no clear cause of death at autopsy.

### Alcoholic ketoacidosis in an 11-year-old boy [^112AgRs2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

A history of ethanol consumption combined with vomiting, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and altered mental status is consistent with a broad differential diagnosis, which requires a systematic approach. Alcoholic ketoacidosis is rare after binge drinking in the naïve individual and typically occurs in patients with heavy, chronic use. We present the case of an 11-year-old boy with acute ethanol intoxication and a clinical course that is most consistent with alcoholic ketoacidosis. Alcoholic ketoacidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children with unexplained ketoacidosis when there is a history or evidence of ethanol consumption combined with the appropriate clinical presentation.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis as a complication of methanol poisoning; a case report [^111EByqG]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a complication of diabetes presenting with high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Methanol poisoning, on the other hand, is a toxicology emergency which presents with the same feature. We present a case of methanol poisoning in a patient who presented with DKA.

- **Case presentation**: A 28-year-old male was referred to us with blurred vision and loss of consciousness three days after ingestion of 1.5 liters of an unknown mixture of bootleg alcoholic beverage. He had a history of insulin-dependent diabetes and had neglected his insulin shots on the day prior to hospital admission due to progressive loss of consciousness. Vital signs were normal and venous blood gas analysis showed severe metabolic acidosis and a methanol level of 10.2 mg/dL. After eight hours of hemodialysis, he remained unresponsive. Diabetic ketoacidosis was suspected due to positive urine ketone and blood sugar of 411 mg/dL. Insulin infusion was initiated, which was followed by full awakening and extubation. He was discharged completely symptom-free after four weeks.

- **Conclusions**: Diabetic ketoacidosis and methanol poisoning can happen simultaneously in a diabetic patient. Given the analogous high anion gap metabolic acidosis, physicians should pay particular attention to the examination of diabetic patients. Meticulous evaluation for both conditions is highly recommended.

### Metabolomics, stable isotopes, and a-β+ ketosis-prone diabetes [^115kMK23]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

First described in 1987 by Winter et al. as "atypical diabetes", A−β+ ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) describes a group of primarily middle-aged individuals brought to medical attention by an episode of spontaneous ketoacidosis (i.e. without evidence of infection, alcohol abuse, etc) and subsequently diagnosed with diabetes. Although not exclusive to a particular ethnic group, KPD has primarily been described in individuals of African descent, Hispanics, and groups traditionally classified as ethnic minorities.

Experience from our county hospital in Dallas, Texas, suggests that among those who present with new-onset diabetes and ketoacidosis, 60% meet the criteria for the diagnosis of KPD. These patients generally lack evidence of endocrine pancreas autoimmunity (A−) and experience improved insulin secretory capacity (β+) and sensitivity after near-normalization of glycemia. Patients with KPD tend to be male and obese, and they typically have a family history of diabetes.

Over time, this condition is characterized by a period of near-normoglycemia followed by sustained deterioration in glucose control and episodes of ketoacidosis. The metabolic perturbations that lead to transient β-cell dysfunction and spontaneous ketoacidosis in individuals with KPD remain unclear. Insights on the extreme metabolic phenotype of KPD have the potential to improve our understanding of more subtle metabolic derangements of type 2 diabetes.

### Synjardy [^117LCRAJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Empagliflozin, an active ingredient in Synjardy or Synjardy XR, significantly elevates the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, a potentially life-threatening complication, beyond the baseline incidence rate. In placebo-controlled trials, patients with type 1 diabetes who received sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, such as empagliflozin, exhibited a markedly higher risk of ketoacidosis compared to those who received a placebo. Fatal ketoacidosis cases have been associated with empagliflozin use. It is important to note that Synjardy and Synjardy XR are not approved for glycemic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

- **Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders**: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or those with a history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery are also at risk for ketoacidosis. Postmarketing reports have documented fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients using SGLT2 inhibitors, including Synjardy or Synjardy XR.

- **Precipitating conditions for ketoacidosis**: Factors that may trigger diabetic ketoacidosis or other forms of ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to reductions in insulin dosage or missed doses, acute febrile illness, decreased caloric intake, adherence to a ketogenic diet, surgical procedures, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

### Toxic alcohol ingestions: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management [^115BXWUQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Alcohol-related intoxications, such as methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and alcoholic ketoacidosis, can present with a high anion gap metabolic acidosis and increased serum osmolal gap. In contrast, isopropanol intoxication presents with hyperosmolality alone. The effects of these substances, except for isopropanol and possibly alcoholic ketoacidosis, are primarily due to their metabolites, which can cause metabolic acidosis and cellular dysfunction. The accumulation of these alcohols in the blood can increase osmolality, while their metabolites can increase the anion gap and decrease serum bicarbonate concentration.

The concurrent presence of both laboratory abnormalities is an important diagnostic clue, although either may be absent depending on the time after exposure that the blood sample is taken. Alongside metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure and neurological disease can occur in some of these intoxications. Dialysis to remove unmetabolized alcohol and possibly the organic acid anion can be beneficial in treating several alcohol-related intoxications. Administration of fomepizole or ethanol, which inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase, a critical enzyme in the metabolism of these alcohols, is beneficial in treating ethylene glycol and methanol intoxications, and possibly diethylene glycol and propylene glycol intoxications.

Given the potentially high morbidity and mortality of these intoxications, it is crucial for clinicians to maintain a high degree of suspicion for these disorders in cases with a high anion gap.

### Comparisons of biochemical parameters and diabetic ketoacidosis severity in adult patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes [^1166byoJ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening acute complication of diabetes mellitus characterized by hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. It can occur in both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes patients under stress conditions such as infection, surgery, and trauma, or under the administration of SGLT2 inhibitors. The mortality rate for patients with DKA is about 1% and rises to 5% in elderly patients. Multiple studies of DKA have been carried out in Caucasian populations, mainly with type 1 diabetes. However, a significant proportion of DKA in Asian populations occurs in type 2 diabetes, and it is unclear if clinical courses of DKA differ between type 1 and type 2 diabetes in Asian populations.

The severity of DKA is generally classified as mild, moderate, or severe according to the American Diabetes Association. However, variations in the criteria exist among different professional societies. It should be noted that the severity criteria for DKA were mainly derived in Western countries, and it remains unclear whether the criteria are appropriate for Asian populations. Furthermore, it is currently unknown whether the severity of DKA based on clinical and biochemical parameters differs between patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Laboratory findings in DKA consist of hyperglycemia (> 250 mg/dL), high anion gap metabolic acidosis, and detection of serum ketones or urine ketone bodies.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis caused by alcoholic pancreatitis and starvation ketosis [^112UNHfj]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Starvation ketosis and pancreatitis are uncommon and underrecognized etiologies of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Euglycemic DKA is commonly associated with pregnancy, the use of insulin en route to the hospital, and the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. A 58-year-old male with a past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus and alcoholism presented with a chief complaint of nausea, vomiting, and poor oral intake for several weeks. Despite an extensive history of diabetes and no recent SGLT-2 inhibitor use, his labs were consistent with euglycemic DKA. His imaging and clinical history also confirmed alcoholic pancreatitis. The patient was admitted for euglycemic DKA secondary to starvation ketosis and alcoholic pancreatitis. His anion gap and beta-hydroxybutyrate rapidly cleared with the initiation of the DKA protocol. This case teaches us that clinicians should consider the early initiation of the DKA protocol even in the setting of euglycemia when a patient presents with high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis, a high beta-hydroxybutyrate level, and a clinical picture of pancreatitis and starvation.

### The influence of hyperchloraemia on acid base interpretation in diabetic ketoacidosis [^114H2xD7]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

During the acute treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis, we determined the temporal incidence of hyperchloraemia and quantified its influence on the interpretation of common blood gas-derived acid-base parameters, namely base deficit and bicarbonate.

- **Design and setting**: Retrospective chart review in two regional paediatric intensive care units.

- **Measurements and results**: Stewart's physicochemical theory was used to develop regression equations quantifying the acidifying effect of hyperchloraemia on both base deficit and bicarbonate. These equations were then applied retrospectively to blood chemistry results from 18 children (median age 12.7 years, weight 43 kg) with diabetic ketoacidosis. Plasma ketonaemia was estimated using the albumin-corrected anion gap. The incidence of hyperchloraemia, as documented by a ratio of plasma chloride to sodium greater than 0.79, increased from 6% at admission to 94% after 20 hours of treatment. Correction for chloride produced a dramatic improvement in the relationship between changes in the anion gap versus both base deficit (from R² = 0.55 to R² = 0.95) and bicarbonate (from R² = 0.51 to R² = 0.96) during treatment. After 20 hours of treatment, the mean base deficit decreased from 24.7 mmol/l to 10.0 mmol/l; however, the proportion due to hyperchloraemia increased from 2% to 98%.

It is now possible, using a simple correction factor, to quantify the confounding effect of hyperchloraemia on both base deficit and bicarbonate in diabetic ketoacidosis. This bedside tool may be a useful adjunct to guide therapy and improve patient outcomes in these cases.

### Bedside detection of urine beta-hydroxybutyrate in diagnosing metabolic acidosis [^114YBuYr]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

While critically important, the rapid identification of the etiology of metabolic acidosis (MA) may be labor-intensive and time-consuming. Alcoholic, starvation, and severe diabetic ketoacidosis (AKA, SKA, and DKA, respectively) may produce beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) in marked excess of acetone (ACET) and acetoacetate (AcAc). Unfortunately, urine dipstick technology poorly detects ACET and cannot measure BOHB. The inability to detect BOHB might delay therapy for ketoacidoses or provoke unnecessary evaluation or empirical treatment of other causes of MA, such as toxic alcohol poisoning. The authors tested the previous assertion that commonly available hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) would improve BOHB detection. The effectiveness of alkalinization and the use of a silver nitrate (AgNO(3)) catalyst was also assessed.

- **Methods**: Control and urine test specimens containing from 0.5 to 800 mmol/L ACET, AcAc, and BOHB were prepared. Urine specimens were oxidized with H(2)O(2) (3%) at a 1:9 ratio (H(2)O(2):urine), alkalinized with potassium hydroxide (KOH; 10%), exposed to AgNO(3) sticks, or altered with a combination of these methods in a random fashion. Three emergency physicians (EPs) blinded to the preparation technique evaluated urine dipsticks (Multistix, Bayer Corp.) placed in the specimens for "ketones".

- **Results**: Multistix detected AcAc appropriately, while ACET was detected only at high concentrations of ≥ 600 mmol/L. Multistix failed to measure BOHB at all concentrations tested. H(2)O(2) improved urinary BOHB detection, although not to clinically relevant levels (40 mmol/L).

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^117Lu9uo]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

The ADA 2025 guidelines provide recommendations for the medical management of diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly in relation to insulin infusion. Insulin route and dosage should be determined based on the severity of the hyperglycemic crisis.

- **Mild DKA**:
	- **Insulin SC**: Administer 0.1 units/kg of rapid-acting insulin analog as a subcutaneous bolus, then continue with 0.1 units/kg every hour or 0.2 units/kg every two hours.
	- **Insulin IV**: This is an alternative to insulin SC, following a regimen similar to that used in moderate-to-severe DKA.
	- Once glucose reaches a certain level, reduce the short-acting insulin dose to 0.1 units/kg SC every two hours.
	- Consider administering 0.1 units/kg of short-acting insulin as an IV bolus if there is a delay in setting up the infusion.
	- When glucose levels decrease below 150 mg/dL, reduce the short-acting insulin dose to 0.05 units/kg/h IV, or use a nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values.
	- Maintain glucose within the 200–250 mg/dL range.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^116rLYRF]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Low credibility.

This study of patients presumed to have DKA has been unable to verify the equivalence between a BOHB concentration of 3 mmol/L and a bicarbonate concentration of 18 mmol/L. On average, pH and bicarbonate concentrations that were not abnormal equated to a BOHB of 3 mmol/L. The 3 mmol/L value originally adopted by several guidelines appears derived from preliminary recommendations based on a study of only 14 patients admitted to the hospital with DKA. A single larger study, which equated BOHB concentrations to an 18 mmol/L bicarbonate concentration, actually only quoted the BOHB equivalence of 3.0 mmol/L to be in children, whereas in adults, this was 3.8 mmol/L. Notwithstanding these data, a BOHB threshold of 3.0 mmol/L continues to be promulgated in guidelines.

In this study, the 18 mmol/L bicarbonate level equated, on average, to a BOHB concentration of 4.3 mmol/L, which is closer to the aforementioned Sheikh-Ali adult value and other contemporary findings. More recent DKA diagnostic guidelines have suggested a lower bicarbonate concentration of < 15 mmol/L as a diagnostic criterion. In our study, this equated to a BOHB value of 4.7 mmol/L.

It might be assumed that our data suggests consideration should be given to raising the diagnostic DKA threshold for blood BOHB concentrations. However, what this study has also shown is that in real-world situations, using modern point-of-care blood ketone testing, there is a marked spread of BOHB values around the same (including pathological) bicarbonate concentration (r = -0.49).

### Severe metabolic derangement: A case of concomitant diabetic ketoacidosis and beer potomania [^116oYFnC]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyponatraemia associated with beer potomania are severe diagnoses warranting intensive care level management. Our patient, a middle-aged man with a history of chronic alcohol abuse and insulin non-compliance, presents with severe DKA and severe hyponatraemia. Correcting sodium and metabolic derangements in each disorder requires significant attention to fluid and electrolyte levels. Combined, they prove challenging and necessitate an individualized approach to prevent the overcorrection of sodium. Furthermore, management of these conditions highlights the importance of understanding the pathophysiology behind their hormonal and osmotic basis.

### Point-of-care test identifies diabetic ketoacidosis at triage [^114Zxwf4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common, life-threatening complication of diabetes. The diagnosis of DKA relies on signs and symptoms, as well as laboratory findings, which include blood glucose (BG) levels of greater than 250 mg/dL, an anion gap (AG) of greater than or equal to 15 mmol/L, and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels of less than 18 mEq/L. In a study conducted in a large urban hospital emergency department, 160 subjects with BG levels greater than 250 mg/dL underwent testing for beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) using the Precision Xtra meter (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) at triage. The diagnosis of DKA was made by clinicians using standard clinical criteria, without knowledge of the beta-OHB test.

- **Results**: A diagnosis of DKA was made in 57 of the 160 subjects. The beta-OHB values showed strong correlation with AG (r = 0.66, p < 0.001) and CO2 (r = -0.69, p < 0.001), as well as with glucose (r = 0.31, p < 0.001). Cross-classification of DKA versus beta-OHB yielded a sensitivity of 98% (95% CI = 91% to 100%) and a specificity of 85% (95% CI = 78% to 91%). The positive likelihood ratio was 6.7 (95% CI = 4.22 to 10.78), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.021 (95% CI = 0.003 to 0.144) at the manufacturer-suggested beta-OHB level of 1.5.

- **Conclusions**: The point-of-care test for beta-OHB was as sensitive as more established indicators of DKA. It is more useful than glucose alone for the diagnosis of DKA and offers immediate diagnostic information.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^116cQgcP]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute metabolic complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidosis. The pathophysiology of DKA is reviewed, and diagnostic and therapeutic modalities are discussed in the context of the currently available evidence. Complications associated with DKA are often a result of the treatment itself, and these issues are also discussed.

### Xigduo XR [^113HvAGX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Xigduo XR, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Xigduo XR.

Withhold Xigduo XR, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Xigduo XR when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue Xigduo XR and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Volume depletion**: Dapagliflozin can cause intravascular volume depletion, sometimes manifesting as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating Xigduo XR in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Steglujan, promptly evaluate and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Steglujan.

Withhold Steglujan, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Steglujan when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct them to discontinue Steglujan and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Pancreatitis**: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking sitagliptin, a component of Steglujan. After initiation of Steglujan, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, Steglujan should promptly be discontinued, and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using Steglujan.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^116dywr1]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis requires the patient's plasma glucose concentration to be above 250 mg per dL (although it usually is much higher), the pH level to be less than 7.30, and the bicarbonate level to be 18 mEq per L or less. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is a better measurement of the degree of ketosis than serum ketones. Intravenous insulin and fluid replacement are the mainstays of therapy, with careful monitoring of potassium levels. Phosphorus and magnesium also may need to be replaced. Bicarbonate therapy rarely is needed.

- **Precipitating factors**: Infection, insulin omission, and other problems that may have precipitated ketoacidosis should be treated. Myocardial infarction is a precipitating cause of diabetic ketoacidosis that is especially important to look for in older patients with diabetes.

- **Complications and education**: Cerebral edema is a major complication that occurs primarily in children. Education to prevent recurrence should be offered to all patients, including how to manage sick days and when to call a physician.

### Differential evolution of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults with pre-existent versus newly diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^117Kx47r]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive patients with index DKA admissions from January 2015 to March 2021 in four general hospitals of Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar.

- **Patient selection**: Patients were included according to the following criteria: adult patients (14 years and above) with index DKA admissions within the study period. Patients either had a known DM diagnosis or were newly diagnosed with DM on admission. Hyperglycemia was not used to identify DKA in order to include euglycemic DKA (EDKA) patients. Patients who did not fulfill the American Diabetes Association (ADA) DKA criteria were excluded. Patients with ketoacidosis secondary to other conditions (starvation ketoacidosis, alcohol ketoacidosis) were also excluded. Additionally, reDKA admissions from the same patient were excluded and not analyzed. Patients were categorized into T1D and T2D and were further subdivided into new or pre-existing DM. We used International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes to identify T1D and T2D in the EMR. We validated the accuracy of these codes in a subgroup of patients by looking at C-peptides and Anti-GAD antibodies where available. However, the levels were unavailable in most patients, so validation could not be done for all patients. Diagnosis of the type of DM relied mainly on the clinical judgment of the treating physicians.

### Point-of-care capillary blood ketone measurements and the prediction of future ketoacidosis risk in type 1 diabetes [^116oyT6h]. Diabetes Care (2023). High credibility.

Objective: Rather than during illness while diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is developing, we aimed to determine if levels of routine point-of-care capillary blood ketones could predict future DKA.

Research design and methods: We examined previously collected data from placebo-assigned participants in an adjunct-to-insulin medication trial program that included measurement of fasted capillary blood ketone levels twice per week in a 2-month baseline period. The outcome was 6- to 12-month trial-adjudicated DKA.

Results: DKA events occurred in 12 of 484 participants at a median of 105 (interquartile range 43, 199) days. Maximum ketone levels were higher in patient cases compared with control patients (0.8 [0.6, 1.2] vs. 0.3 [0.2, 0.7] mmol/L; P = 0.002), with a nonparametric area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77 (95% CI 0.66–0.88). Ketone levels ≥ 0.8 mmol/L had a sensitivity of 64%, a specificity of 78%, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 2.9 and 0.5, respectively.

Conclusions: This proof of concept that routine capillary ketone surveillance can identify individuals at high risk of future DKA implies a role for future technologies including continuous ketone monitoring.

### Derivation and validation of a formula to calculate the contribution of ethanol to the osmolal gap [^117DYLPj]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Serum Osmolality and Osmolarity" is an essential tool for assessing conditions such as hyponatremia, cerebral edema, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemia, and ethylene glycol poisoning. This calculator serves as a clinical tool to determine the concentration of solutes in the blood. It is particularly applicable to patients with suspected fluid and electrolyte imbalances, such as those with diabetes insipidus, hypernatremia, hyponatremia, or suspected alcohol intoxication.

### Ketoacidosis is not always due to diabetes [^113AqPuz]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic alcoholism is a frequently unrecognized cause of ketoacidosis. Most patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis present with normal or low glucose levels; however, this condition can also present with hyperglycemia. This can lead to a misdiagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis and inappropriate treatment with insulin. We describe a 37-year-old Caucasian woman with chronic pancreatitis secondary to excess alcohol consumption, admitted with abdominal pain and vomiting, fulfilling the criteria for diabetic ketoacidosis. She was treated according to the diabetic ketoacidosis protocol and experienced a hypoglycemic attack within an hour of the initiation of insulin. Upon reviewing her history, it was found that she had experienced three similar episodes over the past 12 months.

Alcoholic ketoacidosis can present with hyperglycemia due to a relative deficiency of insulin and a relative surplus of counter-regulatory stress hormones, including glucagon. Awareness of the syndrome, along with a detailed history, helps to differentiate alcoholic ketoacidosis from diabetic ketoacidosis and prevent iatrogenic hypoglycemia.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: β-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^115AoRxm]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Rapid and accurate identification of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is critical but is complicated by the fact that DKA only affects a small percentage of the total number of patients with hyperglycemia. Clinical practice in the emergency department is to screen hyperglycemic patients with a urine dipstick for ketones and conduct a laboratory evaluation for DKA on patients whose results screen positive. Although the urine dipstick is easily accessible, inexpensive, rapid, and has excellent sensitivity for DKA, its poor specificity (estimated at < 50%) results in a large number of false-positive tests and unnecessary work-ups.

This has led the American Diabetes Association (ADA) to discourage using the urine dipstick and encourage using serum ketones for DKA screening. The development of point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) devices has made following these ADA recommendations feasible in the emergency department. The goal of this prospective study was to compare the test characteristics of a point-of-care β-OHB meter with the urine dipstick for screening for DKA at emergency-department triage.

### Blood β-hydroxybutyrate vs. urine acetoacetate testing for the prevention and management of ketoacidosis in type 1 diabetes: A systematic review [^112H9My1]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a life-threatening complication of type 1 diabetes. Blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing is now widely available as an alternative to urine acetoacetate testing for detecting ketosis. The aim of this study was to review the effectiveness of capillary or serum β-hydroxybutyrate compared with urine acetoacetate testing in the prevention and management of diabetic ketoacidosis.

The study searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, The Cochrane Library, and CINAHL up until April 2012, with no language restrictions and focusing on studies in humans. It included experimental and observational studies comparing the effectiveness of blood β-hydroxybutyrate and urine acetoacetate testing. Outcomes examined were prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis, time to recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis, healthcare costs, and patient or caregiver satisfaction. Additional sources included reference lists, conference proceedings, and contact with experts in the field.

Four studies (two randomized controlled trials and two cohort studies) met the eligibility criteria, including 299 participants across 11 centers. The risk of bias was low to moderate. Blood ketone testing, compared with urine testing, was associated with reduced frequency of hospitalization (one study), reduced time to recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis (three studies), cost benefits (one study), and greater satisfaction (one study, intervention group only). No study assessed prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis. A meta-analysis could not be performed because of heterogeneity in study design and published data.

### Alcoholic ketoacidosis with multiple complications: A case report [^115HCHhw]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Alcoholic ketoacidosis is a poorly diagnosed medical emergency usually identified in chronic alcohol misusers following an abrupt cessation or reduction of alcohol consumption. Acute physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion, as the response to treatment is rapid, with complete resolution of metabolic derangements. Complications typically arise from the failure to initiate the correct treatment or to address associated conditions. We describe a case of alcoholic ketoacidosis with multiple complications at presentation.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^116vxCdp]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend determining hydration status and administering IV fluids according to the severity of hypovolemia:

- **Mild hypovolemia**: Use 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid at a clinically appropriate rate, aiming to replace 50% of the estimated fluid deficit in the first 8–12 hours. Add 5% or 10% dextrose to the 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid when glucose reaches specific levels. Start 5% or 10% dextrose alongside 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid at the start of insulin treatment in euglycemic DKA (glucose < 200 mg/dL and positive β-hydroxybutyrate).

- **Severe hypovolemia**: Administer 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid at 1.0 L/hr.

- **Cardiac compromise**: Implement hemodynamic monitoring and use pressors if needed.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^114Y6xhZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a major acute life-threatening complication of diabetes, mostly seen in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and less commonly in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). It is usually defined as a metabolic state in which the individual has either a glucose concentration of more than 11.1 mmol/L (> 200 mg/dL) at presentation, or has been previously diagnosed with diabetes; they must have a plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentration of 3.0 mmol/L or higher, or urine ketones of more than 2+ on a standard urine ketone test-stick; and a pH less than 7.3 or a serum bicarbonate of less than 15.0 mmol/L. Blood glucose levels may not always be elevated in DKA, a state referred to as euglycemic ketoacidosis.

DKA results from a relative or absolute deficiency in circulating insulin associated with elevated glucagon, which promotes the uncontrolled release of free fatty acids that are converted to ketone bodies, resulting in an anion gap acidosis. Acetoacetate, the primary ketone body, is then converted enzymatically to β-hydroxybutyrate, the predominant circulating ketone body, and non-enzymatically to acetone, which is exhaled. The reduced peripheral uptake of glucose and increased endogenous glucose production result in marked hyperglycemia and dehydration. The metabolic acidosis, hypovolemia, electrolyte disturbance, and hyperosmolar state stimulate a counter-regulatory hormone response increasing insulin resistance and ketogenesis, further exacerbating the metabolic disturbance, resulting in a downward spiral.

- **Pancreatitis**: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking saxagliptin. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), cases of definite acute pancreatitis were confirmed in 17 of 8240 (0.2%) patients receiving saxagliptin compared to 9 of 8173 (0.1%) receiving placebo. Pre-existing risk factors for pancreatitis were identified in 88% (15/17) of those patients receiving saxagliptin and in 100% (9/9) of those patients receiving placebo.

After initiation of QTERN, observe patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue QTERN.

### Synjardy [^112B6qW7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Signs and symptoms consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing Synjardy or Synjardy XR; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days, with some cases up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Synjardy or Synjardy XR, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Synjardy or Synjardy XR.

Withhold Synjardy or Synjardy XR, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Synjardy or Synjardy XR when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake.

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct them to discontinue Synjardy or Synjardy XR and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

### Approach to the evaluation of a patient with an increased serum osmolal gap and high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis [^111QBddX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

An increase in serum osmolality and serum osmolal gap, with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis, is an important clue to exposure to one of the toxic alcohols, which include methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or isopropanol. However, the increase in serum osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis can occur either together or alone, depending on several factors, including the baseline serum osmolal gap, the molecular weight of the alcohol, and the stage of metabolism of the alcohol.

In addition, other disorders, including diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and lactic acidosis, can cause high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis associated with an increased serum osmolal gap and therefore should be explored in the differential diagnosis. It is essential for clinicians to understand the value and limitations of the osmolal gap to assist in reaching the correct diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment.

In this teaching case, we present a systematic approach to diagnosing high serum osmolality and increased serum osmolal gap, with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^112DKyXG]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Low credibility.

When bicarbonate was correlated to pH (r = 0.79, p < 0.01), it fell below 18 mmol/L in all significantly acidotic cases of blood ketone-detected diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA, n = 12). These acidosis levels were not significantly affected by glucose, and euglycemic ketoacidosis (n = 29) did not correlate with increased acidosis beyond bicarbonate predictive markers.

Patients were categorized as hyperglycemic (13.9 mmol/L, n = 8), ketonemic (≤ 3 mmol/L, n = 9), or either (n = 5). Reducing the diagnostic threshold for BOHB to ≥ 1.6 mmol/L identified 130 of the 133 (98%) subjects with bicarbonate concentrations ≤ 18 mmol/L but also a further 11 where bicarbonate was instead > 18 mmol/L.

- **Linear relationships**: There was no statistically significant linear relationship between serum creatinine concentration and BOHB, pH, or glucose (p = 0.45, p = 0.9, p = 0.17, respectively, n = 156), despite the potential analytical interference of ketones with serum creatinine. Similarly, there was no statistically significant linear relationship between serum urea, as a marker of circulatory volume, and BHB (p = 0.97) or pH (p = 0.86).

- **Significant findings**: There was a significant relationship between urea and glucose (p = 0.039), but the r squared was only 0.03, indicating a weak association.

### Utility of ketone measurement in the prevention, diagnosis and management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^113oCyb2]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Ketone measurement is advocated for the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis and assessment of its severity. Assessing the evidence base for ketone measurement in clinical practice is challenging because multiple methods are available, but there is a lack of consensus about which is preferable. Evaluating the utility of ketone measurement is additionally problematic due to variability in the biochemical definition of ketoacidosis internationally and in the proposed thresholds for ketone measures. This has led to conflicting guidance from expert bodies on how ketone measurement should be used in the management of ketoacidosis.

The development of point-of-care devices that can reliably measure the capillary blood ketone β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) has widened the spectrum of applications of ketone measurement. However, whether the evidence base supporting these applications is robust enough to warrant their incorporation into routine clinical practice remains unclear. The imprecision of capillary blood ketone measures at higher values, the lack of availability of routine laboratory-based assays for BOHB, and the continued cost-effectiveness of urine ketone assessment prompt further discussion on the role of capillary blood ketone assessment in ketoacidosis.

In the present article, we review the various existing methods of ketone measurement, the precision of capillary blood ketone as compared with other measures, its diagnostic accuracy in predicting ketoacidosis, and other clinical applications including prevention, assessment of severity, and resolution of ketoacidosis.

### Clinicopathologic appearance of advanced ketoacidosis with basal vacuolation in renal tubules [^113D5Exs]. Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Basal vacuolization (BV) in renal tubules is a histopathologic hallmark of advanced ketoacidosis that enables us to retrospectively diagnose these cases.

- **Objective**: To clarify the pathologic background and serologic findings of ketoacidosis with BV and to reveal the pathologic findings by each pathologic background.

- **Design**: We examined 664 serial autopsy cases. A systemic histopathologic examination and measurement of serum β-hydroxybutyrate concentration were performed for the cases with BV. The extent of steatosis and fibrosis in the organs and the degree of coronary artery stenosis were semiquantitatively investigated. Immunohistochemistry for adipophilin was also performed to analyze its usefulness for the pathologic diagnosis.

- **Results**: Basal vacuolization was found in 16 cases, all of which showed a pathologic serum β-hydroxybutyrate concentration. The main background of ketoacidosis was considered as alcohol abuse in 6 cases, diabetes in 5, malnutrition in 3, and hypothermia and infection in 1 case each. Severe hepatic fibrosis was observed only in the alcohol-abuser group. Moreover, cardiac steatosis was more severe in patients with possible alcohol abuse than in those with other causes. Immunohistochemistry for adipophilin showed immunoreactivity consistent with BV in 13 of 16 cases. There was no correlation between β-hydroxybutyrate concentration and either the postmortem or storage interval.

- **Conclusions**: Basal vacuolization may be a useful finding for detecting ketoacidosis cases in a postmortem investigation.
