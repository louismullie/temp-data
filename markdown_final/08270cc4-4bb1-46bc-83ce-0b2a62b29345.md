## Question

What is the treatment for alcoholism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for alcoholism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about terminology and diagnostic framing. Then, I should verify screening and assessment steps. Next, I will consider treatment goals and shared decision-making. After that, I need to review first-line pharmacotherapies and their evidence. Then, I will examine psychosocial interventions and their comparative effectiveness. I should confirm the strength of combined treatment and where it fits. I will then address special populations and settings, including ALD, adolescents, and digital care. Finally, I need to appraise implementation gaps, monitoring, and future directions, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate sources and that I correct any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate constructs. Alcoholism is encompassed by Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in DSM-5, ranging from mild to severe, and characterized by compulsive use, loss of control, and continued use despite harm; I should also note that "alcohol dependence" is an older term now subsumed under AUD, and that the condition is chronic and relapsing for many, though not all, individuals.

> Next, I should review screening and assessment, and I need to ensure I'm precise about validated tools. Routine screening with AUDIT-C or AUDIT in primary care is recommended, with brief intervention for hazardous use and referral for suspected AUD; I initially thought the WHO mhGAP explicitly endorsed AUDIT-C, but wait, let me verify — mhGAP emphasizes routine screening and structured psychosocial care without naming a specific tool, whereas AUDIT-C is commonly used in primary care and endorsed by hepatology guidance for hazardous drinking, so I should cite both appropriately [^1136R9zH] [^115AzgXQ]. I should confirm that diagnosis requires a clinical interview, collateral information when appropriate, assessment of severity, readiness to change, and screening for psychiatric and medical comorbidities, including liver disease and withdrawal risk, which is standard in primary care and specialty settings [^116rFP64] [^114TwxyN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about goals; I need to check guideline positions on abstinence versus reduction. While sustained abstinence is optimal for severe AUD, shared decision-making that documents patient-preferred goals — abstinence, reduction, or harm minimization — is endorsed by APA and aligns with evolving regulatory acceptance of drinking-reduction endpoints; the FDA's qualification of WHO Risk Drinking Level reductions as a primary endpoint supports harm-reduction paradigms when abstinence is not initially acceptable to patients [^1139H8uB] [^112RRfzD]. I should also confirm that pragmatic, patient-centered engagement increases treatment uptake and retention, which is repeatedly emphasized in high-quality reviews and guidelines [^116rFP64] [^1125nPSb].

> I will now examine first-line pharmacotherapies and their comparative effectiveness, and I need to double-check the strength of evidence. Naltrexone (oral 50 mg/day or extended-release injectable) and acamprosate are first-line, FDA-approved agents; naltrexone reduces return to heavy drinking and increases percent days abstinent, while acamprosate supports abstinence maintenance, with numbers needed to treat around 11–18 depending on outcome and agent, and both are underprescribed relative to potential benefit [^115VWcqA] [^114TwxyN]. Wait, I should verify disulfiram's role — most guidelines list it as second-line due to adherence and safety concerns, but supervised disulfiram can be effective in highly motivated patients with strong supports; open-label trials and contemporary reviews argue for reconsideration in selected contexts, though blinded RCTs have been less consistent, so I should present both views and individualize use [^112PE2MB] [^115Q6Zrt]. I also need to check off-label options; topiramate has moderate-quality evidence and is recommended by VA/DoD as an alternative, and gabapentin may help some patients, particularly with insomnia or withdrawal-related symptoms, though evidence is less robust [^111zTVqR] [^114TwxyN].

> Let me consider psychosocial treatments next, and I should confirm which have the strongest evidence. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), motivational interviewing/motivational enhancement therapy, and 12-step facilitation (TSF) are all evidence-based; TSF and manualized AA-linked interventions show high-certainty evidence for improving abstinence at 12 months and sustained benefits, while CBT and MI are broadly effective across settings and severities [^112CPUp3] [^1125nPSb]. I should double-check brief interventions — yes, brief advice and SBIRT reduce consumption in hazardous drinkers and can facilitate earlier treatment entry for those with more severe AUD, reinforcing the value of stepped care in primary care [^116rFP64] [^1125nPSb].

> Now, I need to ensure I accurately characterize combined treatment. Multiple meta-analyses and the landmark COMBINE trial indicate that adding pharmacotherapy (especially naltrexone) to psychosocial treatment improves drinking outcomes versus psychosocial treatment alone, with moderate-certainty evidence for fewer heavy drinkers and low-certainty evidence for more continuous abstinence; importantly, acamprosate did not show added benefit in COMBINE, though other meta-analyses support its role in maintaining abstinence, so I should reconcile this by noting heterogeneity in populations, dosing, and concomitant care [^114Sw4YZ] [^113yGsWE] [^114zK4Ko] [^115VWcqA]. Let me reconsider the practical implication: best practice is to offer combined treatment routinely, tailoring the behavioral modality and medication to patient preference and comorbidity, rather than choosing one in isolation [^116vGr4w] [^115Wev9o].

> Next, I should review special populations and settings, and I need to check liver disease guidance carefully. In alcohol-associated liver disease, complete abstinence is the cornerstone; baclofen is conditionally recommended to prevent relapse, and integrated multidisciplinary care is advised, with attention to hepatic metabolism when selecting medications and dosing [^112nGr2W] [^114mt82w]. For adolescents and young adults, I should confirm that evidence for pharmacotherapy is limited and that brief MI, CBT, and family-based approaches are preferred; guidelines emphasize psychosocial interventions with insufficient evidence for routine medications in this group [^115j8SHG]. For co-occurring PTSD, trauma-focused therapy combined with SUD pharmacotherapy yields the largest effect sizes on both PTSD and alcohol outcomes, supporting integrated care models [^114JRA4D]. In primary care, Alcohol Care Management models improve engagement and reduce heavy drinking, underscoring feasibility outside specialty addiction settings [^113mNveG].

> I will now examine digital and remote interventions, and I should verify comparative effectiveness claims. Therapist-guided digital CBT is non-inferior to face-to-face CBT for reducing weekly drinks in some trials, though secondary outcomes like therapeutic alliance may be weaker; remote care that supplements in-person treatment reduces relapse and days of use, whereas fully replacing in-person care shows less consistent effects, so I should frame digital tools as effective adjuncts rather than wholesale substitutes in most cases [^116TZVPZ] [^111SNHsJ] [^115598Jj]. But wait, what if I overstated non-inferiority across all outcomes? I should correct that — some trials show non-inferiority on consumption but not on all secondary measures, and VA/DoD cites insufficient evidence to recommend for or against computer-delivered behavioral treatments alone, so shared decision-making and safety monitoring remain essential when using digital modalities [^111NVCvC] [^115pRQmC].

> I need to ensure I address implementation gaps and real-world effectiveness. Only about 1 in 6 people with AUD receive any treatment, and fewer than 2% receive medications; yet, prescribing MAUD at discharge from alcohol-related hospitalizations is associated with a 42% reduction in readmission or mortality, suggesting that systemic barriers, not lack of efficacy, drive underuse [^114APF9J] [^111to6Ps] [^115PtTqg]. I should confirm that stigma, limited physician training, and fragmented care contribute to this gap, and that routine screening, education, and integrated models can mitigate it [^115AzgXQ] [^114TwxyN].

> Next, I should review monitoring, safety, and follow-up, and I need to check withdrawal management guidance. For withdrawal, benzodiazepines are first-line with symptom-triggered protocols when feasible; importantly, AUD treatment should be initiated concurrently with withdrawal management as cognition permits, including offering pharmacotherapy and arranging linkage to ongoing care to prevent the common gap after detoxification [^1139ZyWY] [^111fWvEZ]. I should double-check medication-specific monitoring: naltrexone requires hepatic assessment and is contraindicated with current opioid use; acamprosate is renally cleared and requires dose adjustment; disulfiram necessitates supervised administration in appropriate candidates due to hepatotoxicity and aversive reactions; and topiramate requires slow titration with attention to cognitive effects [^114TwxyN] [^111zTVqR]. Biomarkers such as PEth or GGT can support objective monitoring, and I should document goals, risks, and legal obligations in the record to align care [^117KuCNu] [^112JxGMq].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepped approach, and I should verify alignment with guidelines. Start with universal screening and brief intervention in primary care, escalate to diagnostic assessment for suspected AUD, engage in shared decision-making to set goals, and initiate combined treatment with a first-line medication plus evidence-based psychotherapy; consider disulfiram selectively with supervision, integrate mutual-help groups as an adjunct, and tailor for special populations such as those with ALD, adolescents, or PTSD, using digital tools to extend reach when appropriate [^116vGr4w] [^115Wev9o] [^112CPUp3]. Hold on, I should verify that this matches the evidence hierarchy — yes, combined treatment is consistently favored over monotherapy, and first-line medications have the most robust support, with CBT, MI, and TSF as acceptable behavioral partners based on patient preference and setting [^115VWcqA] [^114Sw4YZ].

> Finally, I should review future directions and correct any overstatements. Precision approaches targeting genetic or phenotypic subgroups may improve effect sizes, but I need to note that current evidence does not yet support routine pharmacogenetics to personalize AUD treatment; nonetheless, ongoing work on dopaminergic and stress systems, and early signals from psychedelics and PDE4 inhibitors, suggest potential avenues, while the field also advances harm-reduction endpoints and implementation science to close the treatment gap [^114TwxyN] [^1118mXnX] [^115RT2i4] [^112RRfzD]. I should confirm that these remain investigational for the most part and counsel patients accordingly while continuing to deliver guideline-concordant care [^115RT2i4].

Effective treatment for alcoholism (alcohol use disorder, AUD) requires a **combined approach** of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions, tailored to patient goals and comorbidities [^116vGr4w] [^115Wev9o]. First-line medications are **naltrexone or acamprosate** [^115VWcqA]; naltrexone reduces heavy drinking and craving [^114yDfTU], while acamprosate supports abstinence maintenance [^112W2q4U]. Disulfiram is an option for highly motivated patients with supervision [^112PE2MB]. Psychosocial treatments such as **CBT, motivational interviewing, and 12-step facilitation** improve adherence and outcomes [^112CPUp3] [^1125nPSb]. Combined treatment is superior to either alone [^114Sw4YZ], and digital CBT can expand access [^116F9hWR] [^111ZVqjP]. Management should be individualized, with attention to withdrawal, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^111fWvEZ] [^1139H8uB].

---

## Pharmacological treatments

Pharmacotherapy is a cornerstone of AUD treatment, with **FDA-approved medications** and others supported by evidence:

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical evidence** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Naltrexone | - Opioid receptor antagonist <br/> - Reduces craving and heavy drinking | - Strong evidence <br/> - NNT ~11 for return to heavy drinking [^115VWcqA] | - Contraindicated with opioid use <br/> - Monitor liver function [^notfound] |
| Acamprosate | - Modulates glutamate <br/> - Supports abstinence | - Strong evidence <br/> - NNT ~11 for abstinence [^115VWcqA] | - Requires renal dosing <br/> - Well tolerated [^notfound] |
| Disulfiram | - Inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase <br/> - Causes aversive reaction with alcohol | - Effective with supervision <br/> - Limited adherence | - Supervision required <br/> - Not first-line [^112PE2MB] |
| Topiramate | - GABAergic and glutamatergic modulation | - Moderate evidence <br/> - Reduces heavy drinking | Off-label; cognitive side effects [^113aGMEe] |
| Gabapentin | - GABA analog <br/> - Reduces craving | - Moderate evidence <br/> - Useful for withdrawal | Off-label; sedation [^115RT2i4] |

## Psychosocial interventions

Psychosocial treatments are essential and **often combined with medication**:

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Effective for reducing drinking, preventing relapse, and addressing comorbidities [^114Z4Fym] [^116zv8wS].
- **Motivational interviewing (MI)**: Enhances readiness to change and adherence [^notfound].
- **12-step facilitation (TSF)**: Strong evidence for abstinence and sustained recovery [^112CPUp3].
- **Brief interventions**: Effective in primary care for hazardous use and early intervention [^116rFP64] [^1136R9zH].

---

## Combined pharmacological and psychosocial treatments

Combined treatment yields **superior outcomes** versus either modality alone, with **moderate-certainty evidence** that adding pharmacotherapy to psychosocial care reduces heavy drinking and may increase abstinence [^114Sw4YZ]. The **COMBINE trial** showed that naltrexone plus medical management improved abstinence and reduced heavy drinking [^114zK4Ko].

---

## Emerging and digital interventions

Digital therapeutics expand access and engagement. Digital CBT is effective and can be **non-inferior to face-to-face CBT** [^1141hrkv] [^116TZVPZ], and **telehealth** is effective as an adjunct or replacement for in-person care, though evidence quality varies [^115598Jj] [^116VKPT3].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Liver disease**: Acamprosate is preferred; naltrexone is contraindicated in advanced liver disease [^notfound].
- **Pregnancy**: Acamprosate is preferred; naltrexone and disulfiram are generally avoided.
- **Adolescents**: Psychosocial interventions are first-line; pharmacotherapy is limited [^115j8SHG].

---

## Barriers to treatment and strategies to improve engagement

Treatment engagement is hindered by **stigma, limited access, and underuse of medications** [^115AzgXQ] [^114TwxyN]. Strategies to improve engagement include **integrated care, digital tools, and education** to reduce stigma and expand access [^115pRQmC] [^113mNveG].

---

## Long-term outcomes and relapse prevention

AUD is chronic and relapsing; long-term management includes ongoing pharmacotherapy, psychosocial support, and monitoring [^116rFP64]. Relapse prevention focuses on **CBT, MI, and peer support** to sustain recovery [^115j8SHG] [^112CPUp3].

---

Effective treatment for alcoholism centers on **combined pharmacotherapy and psychosocial care**, individualized to patient goals and comorbidities, with emerging digital tools to improve access and engagement [^116vGr4w] [^1144pVHg].

### Developing neuroscience-based treatments for alcohol addiction: a matter of choice? [^114DMazN]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Excessive alcohol use is the cause of an ongoing public health crisis, and accounts for ~5% of global disease burden. A minority of people with recreational alcohol use develop alcohol addiction (hereafter equated with "alcohol dependence" or simply "alcoholism"), a condition characterized by a systematically biased choice preference for alcohol at the expense of healthy rewards, and continued use despite adverse consequences ("compulsivity"). Alcoholism is arguably the most pressing area of unmet medical needs in psychiatry, with only a small fraction of patients receiving effective, evidence-based treatments. Medications currently approved for the treatment of alcoholism have small effect sizes, and their clinical uptake is negligible. No mechanistically new medications have been approved since 2004, and promising preclinical results have failed to translate into novel treatments. This has contributed to a reemerging debate whether and to what extent alcohol addiction represents a medical condition, or reflects maladaptive choices without an underlying brain pathology. Here, we review this landscape, and discuss the challenges, lessons learned, and opportunities to retool drug development in this important therapeutic area.

### Prevention, screening, and treatment for heavy drinking and alcohol use disorder [^1125nPSb]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Heavy drinking and alcohol use disorder are major public health problems. Practitioners not specialising in alcohol treatment are often unaware of the guidelines for preventing, identifying, and treating heavy drinking and alcohol use disorder. However, a consensus exists that clinically useful and valuable tools are available to address these issues. Here, we review existing information and developments from the past 5 years in these areas. We also include information on heavy drinking and alcohol use disorder among individuals with co-occurring psychiatric disorders, including drug use disorders. Areas covered include prevention; screening, brief intervention, and referral for treatment; evidence-based behavioural interventions; medication-assisted treatment; technology-based interventions (eHealth and mHealth); and population-level interventions. We also discuss the key topics for future research.

### Alcohol use disorders [^116rFP64]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Alcohol use disorders are common in developed countries, where alcohol is cheap, readily available, and heavily promoted. Common, mild disorders often remit in young adulthood, but more severe disorders can become chronic and need long-term medical and psychological management. Doctors are uniquely placed to opportunistically assess and manage alcohol use disorders, but in practice diagnosis and treatment are often delayed. Brief behavioural intervention is effective in primary care for hazardous drinkers and individuals with mild disorders. Brief interventions could also encourage early entry to treatment for people with more-severe illness who are underdiagnosed and undertreated. Sustained abstinence is the optimum outcome for severe disorder. The stigma that discourages treatment seeking needs to be reduced, and pragmatic approaches adopted for patients who initially reject abstinence as a goal. To engage people in one or more psychological and pharmacological treatments of equivalent effectiveness is more important than to advocate a specific treatment. A key research priority is to improve the diagnosis and treatment of most affected people who have comorbid mental and other drug use disorders.

### Reductions in World Health Organization risk drinking levels as a primary efficacy end point for alcohol clinical trials: a review [^112RRfzD]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent and costly psychiatric disorder. Abstinence has been considered the optimal outcome of treatment for AUD. Yet, most individuals with AUD do not seek treatment because they do not have a goal of abstinence. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently qualified reductions in drinking, defined by at least a 2-level reduction in the World Health Organization risk drinking levels (WHO RDLs), as a primary end point for alcohol pharmacotherapy trials. The approval of drinking reductions as an end point for alcohol clinical trials aligns with an accumulating literature on drinking reductions in the alcohol field. This article provides a narrative review of 34 articles that have examined WHO RDLs as a surrogate marker of how people with AUD feel and function.

Observations

Results from epidemiological studies, community samples, and clinical trials indicate that drinking reductions are associated with improvements in how patients feel and function, including reduced risk of substance use disorder and medical and psychiatric diseases and reductions in alcohol-related consequences, craving, and health care costs. Drinking reductions are also associated with improvements in functioning and quality of life. Drinking reductions are also achieved by most clinical trial participants, and effect sizes for the WHO RDL reductions for active medications vs placebo are similar to or better than alternative end points.

Conclusions and Relevance

The FDA acceptance of reduction in WHO RDLs as a primary end point for alcohol clinical trials may increase opportunities for AUD medications development, encourage patients to seek treatments that target drinking reductions, and engage clinicians in prescribing medications shown to be effective in supporting drinking reductions. The WHO RDLs may be particularly useful for targeted drinking reductions in clinical practice. Qualification of the WHO RDL end point facilitates a paradigm shift toward a harm reduction approach in AUD treatment.

### Treatment rates for alcohol use disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114APF9J]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

To estimate the treatment rate for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in the general adult population. Treatment rates were also considered in relation to economic differences.

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases to identify studies that reported treatment rates for alcohol use disorders in the general population. Independent reviewers screened the articles based on predefined inclusion criteria. Data were extracted using a standardized data extraction form. We conducted quality assessments of the included studies. The overall treatment rates were estimated from studies that reported any treatment for AUDs from healthcare or informal non-healthcare settings (any treatment). We estimated the separate treatment rates for each diagnostic category as reported in the primary studies: AUD as a single disorder, alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. Data were pooled using a random-effect model.

Results

Thirty-two articles were included to estimate the treatment rates (percentage treated among the total number of people with AUDs). The pooled estimate of people with AUDs who received any treatment were 14.3% (95% CI: 9.3–20.3%) for alcohol abuse, 16.5% (95% CI: 12–21.5%) for alcohol dependence and 17.3% (95% CI: 12.8–22.3%) for AUD. A subgroup analysis by World Bank economic classification of countries found that the treatment rate for AUD was 9.3% (95% CI: 4.0–15.7%) in low and lower-middle-income countries.

Conclusion

Globally, approximately one in six people with AUDs receives treatment. Treatment rates for AUDs are generally low, with even lower rates in low and lower-middle-income countries.

### Developing neuroscience-based treatments for alcohol addiction: a matter of choice? [^115KeYxd]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Alcohol addiction: an area of large unmet medical needs

Excessive alcohol use accounts for about 5% of global disease burden and close to 6% of all deaths. By many measures, the harm from alcohol exceeds that from illicit drugs. A population of alcohol-addicted people with very heavy drinking, defined as > 100 or 60 g/day for males or females, respectively, are disproportionately affected. This population, ~0.8% of people aged 15–65 years in a group of European countries, accounts for about half of all liver cirrhosis cases, and has a life expectancy that is dramatically shortened, by 25 — 31 years.

Only about 25% of people with alcoholism ever receive treatment; for those who do, the lag from filling diagnostic criteria to receiving treatment is about a decade. This treatment gap is in large part caused by a lack of effective treatments with good patient acceptance. Behavioral treatments with support for efficacy exist, but their effect sizes are modest. Pharmacotherapies for alcoholism are few, have limited efficacy and patient acceptance, and their uptake in clinical practice is minimal. It is frequently claimed that alcoholism medications are not developed because their commercial potential would be small, but data suggest otherwise. The market in alcoholism treatment provision has been estimated to ~$35 billion/year in the US alone. However, treatment for the most part takes place outside the medical system. A lack of medications with robust effect sizes and good patient acceptance is a major reason for this situation, but other factors, such as insufficient physician training in addiction medicine, also contribute.

### Alcohol use disorders [^115AzgXQ]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Alcohol use disorders consist of disorders characterised by compulsive heavy alcohol use and loss of control over alcohol intake. Alcohol use disorders are some of the most prevalent mental disorders globally, especially in high-income and upper-middle-income countries; and are associated with high mortality and burden of disease, mainly due to medical consequences, such as liver cirrhosis or injury. Despite their high prevalence, alcohol use disorders are undertreated partly because of the high stigma associated with them, but also because of insufficient systematic screening in primary health care, although effective and cost-effective psychosocial and pharmacological interventions do exist. Primary health care should be responsible for most treatment, with routine screening for alcohol use, and the provision of a staggered treatment response, from brief advice to pharmacological treatment. Clinical interventions for these disorders should be embedded in a supportive environment, which can be bolstered by the creation of alcohol control policies aimed at reducing the overall level of consumption.

### Combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for alcohol use disorder [^114Sw4YZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a mental disorder characterised by a strong desire to consume alcohol and impaired control of alcohol use, with devastating consequences. Many people with AUD do not respond to psychosocial or pharmacological interventions when these are provided alone. Combining these interventions may improve the response to treatment, though evidence remains limited.

Objectives

To assess the effects of combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for the treatment of AUD in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trials registers in November 2023, without language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions versus pharmacological or psychosocial interventions alone, or no intervention/treatment as usual (TAU), in adults with AUD. Our primary outcomes were continuous abstinent participants, frequency of use (measured as heavy drinkers, percentages of abstinent days, heavy-drinking days), amount of use (number of drinks per drinking day), adverse events, serious adverse events, dropouts from treatment, and dropouts due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool, performed random-effects meta-analyses, and evaluated the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 21 RCTs (4746 participants). The most studied pharmacological and psychosocial interventions were naltrexone (81.0%) and cognitive behavioural therapy (66.7%), respectively. Most participants were men (74%), aged about 44 years, with AUD, without comorbid mental disorders or other substance use disorders; 15 RCTs detoxified participants before treatment. We judged 28.5% of the studies as at low risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, performance bias for objective and subjective outcomes, and detection bias for subjective outcomes; all studies were at low risk of detection bias for objective outcomes; 85.7% of studies were at low risk of attrition bias; 14.2% of studies were at low risk of reporting bias. 1) Compared to psychosocial intervention alone, combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions probably reduce the number of heavy drinkers (above the clinically meaningful threshold (MID) of 2%; absolute difference (AD) -10%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -18% to -2%; risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.97; 8 studies, 1609 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). They may increase continuous abstinent participants (MID 5%; AD 5%, 95% CI 1% to 11%; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.34; 6 studies, 1184 participants; low-certainty evidence). They probably have little to no effect on:

- the rate of abstinent days (MID 8%; mean difference (MD) 4.16, 95% CI 1.24 to 7.08; 10 studies, 2227 participants);
- serious adverse events (MID 1%; AD -2%, 95% CI -3% to 0%; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.12; 4 studies; 524 participants);
- dropouts from treatment (MID 10%; AD -3%, 95% CI -5% to 0%; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.01; 15 studies, 3021 participants); and
- dropouts due to adverse events (MID 5%; AD 2%, 95% CI 0% to 5%; RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.52; 8 studies, 1572 participants) (all moderate-certainty evidence). They may have little to no effect on:

- heavy-drinking days (MID 5%; MD -3.49, 95% CI -8.68 to 1.70; 4 studies, 470 participants);
- number of drinks per drinking day (MID 1 drink; MD -0.57, 95% CI -1.16 to 0.01; 7 studies, 805 participants); and
- adverse events (MID 30%; AD 17%, 95% CI -5% to 46%; RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.68; 4 studies, 508 participants) (all low-certainty evidence). 2) Compared to pharmacological intervention alone, combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on:

- the rate of abstinent days (MID 8%; MD -1.18, 95% CI -4.42 to 2.07; 2 studies, 1158 participants); and
- dropouts from treatment (MID 10%; AD 1%, 95% CI -10 to 14%; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.47; 3 studies, 1246 participants) (all low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about their effect on:

- continuous abstinent participants (MID 5%; AD 3%, 95% CI -5% to 18%; RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.40; 1 study, 241 participants);
- the number of heavy drinkers (MID 2%; AD 2%, 95% CI -4% to 8%; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.12; 1 study, 917 participants);
- the number of drinks per drinking day (MID 1 drink; MD -2.40, 95% CI -3.98 to -0.82; 1 study, 241 participants); and
- dropouts due to adverse events (MID 5%; AD -1%, 95% CI -3% to 6%; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.72; 2 studies, 1165 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence). 3) We are uncertain about the effect of combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions, when compared to TAU, on:

- the number of heavy drinkers (MID 2%; AD -5%, 95% CI -13% to 2%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.03; 1 study, 616 participants);
- the rate of abstinent days (MID 8%; MD 3.43, 95% CI -1.32 to 8.18; 1 study, 616 participants);
- dropouts from treatment (MID 10%; AD 0%, 95% CI -10% to 15%; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.65; 2 studies, 696 participants); and
- dropouts due to adverse events (MID 5%; AD 3%, 95% CI 0% to 15%; RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 12.67; 1 study, 616 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence). The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low, downgraded mainly due to risk of bias and imprecision.

As implications for practice, our findings indicate that adding pharmacological to psychosocial interventions is safe and helps people with AUD recover. These conclusions are based on low- to moderate-certainty evidence. Given the few studies and very low-certainty evidence, any benefits of adding psychosocial to pharmacological interventions or comparing the combined intervention to TAU are less clear. As implications for research, further studies should investigate the effects of the combined intervention compared to pharmacotherapy or TAU.

### Diagnosis and pharmacotherapy of alcohol use disorder: a review [^114TwxyN]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Alcohol consumption is associated with 88 000 US deaths annually. Although routine screening for heavy alcohol use can identify patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and has been recommended, only 1 in 6 US adults report ever having been asked by a health professional about their drinking behavior. Alcohol use disorder, a problematic pattern of alcohol use accompanied by clinically significant impairment or distress, is present in up to 14% of US adults during a 1-year period, although only about 8% of affected individuals are treated in an alcohol treatment facility.

Observations

Four medications are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat AUD: disulfiram, naltrexone (oral and long-acting injectable formulations), and acamprosate. However, patients with AUD most commonly receive counseling. Medications are prescribed to less than 9% of patients who are likely to benefit from them, given evidence that they exert clinically meaningful effects and their inclusion in clinical practice guidelines as first-line treatments for moderate to severe AUD. Naltrexone, which can be given once daily, reduces the likelihood of a return to any drinking by 5% and binge-drinking risk by 10%. Randomized clinical trials also show that some medications approved for other indications, including seizure disorder (eg, topiramate), are efficacious in treating AUD. Currently, there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of pharmacogenetics to personalize AUD treatments.

Conclusions and Relevance

Alcohol consumption is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality, and heavy alcohol use is the major risk factor for AUD. Simple, valid screening methods can be used to identify patients with heavy alcohol use, who can then be evaluated for the presence of an AUD. Patients receiving a diagnosis of the disorder should be given brief counseling and prescribed a first-line medication (eg, naltrexone) or referred for a more intensive psychosocial intervention.

### Pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VWcqA]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Alcohol use disorder affects more than 28.3 million people in the United States and is associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To compare efficacy and comparative efficacy of therapies for alcohol use disorder.

Data Sources

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Trials Registry, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched from November 2012 to September 9, 2022 Literature was subsequently systematically monitored to identify relevant articles up to August 14, 2023, and the PubMed search was updated on August 14, 2023.

Study Selection

For efficacy outcomes, randomized clinical trials of at least 12 weeks' duration were included. For adverse effects, randomized clinical trials and prospective cohort studies that compared drug therapies and reported health outcomes or harms were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers evaluated each study, assessed risk of bias, and graded strength of evidence. Meta-analyses used random-effects models. Numbers needed to treat were calculated for medications with at least moderate strength of evidence for benefit.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was alcohol consumption. Secondary outcomes were motor vehicle crashes, injuries, quality of life, function, mortality, and harms.

Results

Data from 118 clinical trials and 20 976 participants were included. The numbers needed to treat to prevent 1 person from returning to any drinking were 11 (95% CI, 1–32) for acamprosate and 18 (95% CI, 4–32) for oral naltrexone at a dose of 50 mg/d. Compared with placebo, oral naltrexone (50 mg/d) was associated with lower rates of return to heavy drinking, with a number needed to treat of 11 (95% CI, 5–41). Injectable naltrexone was associated with fewer drinking days over the 30-day treatment period (weighted mean difference, -4.99 days; 95% CI, -9.49 to -0.49 days) Adverse effects included higher gastrointestinal distress for acamprosate (diarrhea: risk ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.27–1.97) and naltrexone (nausea: risk ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.51–1.98; vomiting: risk ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.23–1.91) compared with placebo.

Conclusions and Relevance

In conjunction with psychosocial interventions, these findings support the use of oral naltrexone at 50 mg/d and acamprosate as first-line pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder.

### Developing neuroscience-based treatments for alcohol addiction: a matter of choice? [^113dwQtZ]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

It should also be noted that a deep understanding of a drug's mechanism of action is in no way a condition sine qua non to therapeutic efficacy. After all, the site of action of substances, such as cocaine has been known for decades and yet there is no better advancement in therapeutics for cocaine addiction. Also, alcohol's known actions on the dopamine system have been targeted many times, with negative or even detrimental outcomes in all these trials (reviewed in ref.). It has become clear that, without the ability to determine the specific state of an individual's dopamine system and its responsivity, direct pharmacological interference with DA receptors and transporters is unlikely to succeed as a viable treatment approach.

The failure so far to achieve more than at best marginal gains in alcoholism treatment through pharmacotherapy strongly suggest that business as usual in alcoholism research should not be considered an acceptable option. Non-medical strategies, such as addressing societal factors that promote addictionand implementing policies that limit alcohol consumptionshould of course be pursued to reduce the disease burden from alcohol use, but do not replace effective medical treatments for people who nevertheless develop alcohol addiction, in particular the population of people with dependence and very heavy drinking.

### Developing neuroscience-based treatments for alcohol addiction: a matter of choice? [^1118mXnX]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

The therapeutic approaches discussed here should be taken as illustrative concepts, rather than specific clinical options, or drug development pathways. It is still early days. But some important takeaways to guide future treatment development efforts already seem to be emerging:
The development of alcohol addiction certainly does not render patients completely insensitive to reward contingencies. It does, however, lead to the emergence of systematic biases in reward choice preferences. It is reasonable to assume that these reflect a persistent pathology of neurocircuitry that integrates outcome values and guides action selection. As a result, patients repeatedly make maladaptive choices, under conditions when people without an addiction decide advantageously. It is unclear to us why this pathophysiology would not qualify for being a disease mechanism.
Alcohol use in patients with alcohol addiction represents a shift of choice behaviors away from non-drug rewards and toward alcohol. It seems unlikely to us that the brain pathology behind this shift can be understood through research strategies that study alcohol reinforcement in the absence of alternatives.
The pathological shift in choice preferences, and continued use despite adverse consequences that are the hallmarks of alcohol addiction occurs only in a minority of alcohol users. It seems unlikely to us that it can be understood by studying behaviors that emerge in all animals tested.
While worthwhile, identifying the vulnerable minority and using it for screening candidate therapeutics poses challenges when it come to throughput. A complementary approach in identifying novel therapeutic mechanisms may come from studies of the resilient majority.
Using pharmacotherapeutic strategies that have activity-dependent effects in its infancy, but seems to offer a new area of exploration that may fruitfully combine behavioral and pharmacological interventions.
Precision medicine is the road forward to improve outcomes in the treatment of alcohol addiction. Although tailoring medicines towards subpopulations presenting with distinct genetic factors and intermediate phenotypes seems counterintuitive to expensive medication development efforts, the issue at hand is to increase effect sizes towards levels that are clinically meaningful and thereby to gain patient and prescriber trust in such therapies. Their increased acceptance is likely to raise utilization and ultimately also sales.

### Alcoholics anonymous and other 12-step programs for alcohol use disorder [^112CPUp3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) confers a prodigious burden of disease, disability, premature mortality, and high economic costs from lost productivity, accidents, violence, incarceration, and increased healthcare utilization. For over 80 years, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) has been a widespread AUD recovery organization, with millions of members and treatment free at the point of access, but it is only recently that rigorous research on its effectiveness has been conducted.

Objectives

To evaluate whether peer-led AA and professionally-delivered treatments that facilitate AA involvement (Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF) interventions) achieve important outcomes, specifically: abstinence, reduced drinking intensity, reduced alcohol-related consequences, alcohol addiction severity, and healthcare cost offsets.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO from inception to 2 August 2019. We searched for ongoing and unpublished studies via ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 15 November 2018. All searches included non-English language literature. We handsearched references of topic-related systematic reviews and bibliographies of included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and non-randomized studies that compared AA or TSF (AA/TSF) with other interventions, such as motivational enhancement therapy (MET) or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), TSF treatment variants, or no treatment. We also included healthcare cost offset studies. Participants were non-coerced adults with AUD.

Data Collection and Analysis

We categorized studies by: study design (RCT/quasi-RCT; non-randomized; economic); degree of standardized manualization (all interventions manualized versus some/none); and comparison intervention type (i.e. whether AA/TSF was compared to an intervention with a different theoretical orientation or an AA/TSF intervention that varied in style or intensity). For analyses, we followed Cochrane methodology calculating the standard mean difference (SMD) for continuous variables (e.g. percent days abstinent (PDA)) or the relative risk (risk ratios (RRs)) for dichotomous variables. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses to pool effects wherever possible.

Main Results

We included 27 studies containing 10,565 participants (21 RCTs/quasi-RCTs, 5 non-randomized, and 1 purely economic study). The average age of participants within studies ranged from 34.2 to 51.0 years. AA/TSF was compared with psychological clinical interventions, such as MET and CBT, and other 12-step program variants. We rated selection bias as being at high risk in 11 of the 27 included studies, unclear in three, and as low risk in 13. We rated risk of attrition bias as high risk in nine studies, unclear in 14, and low in four, due to moderate (> 20%) attrition rates in the study overall (8 studies), or in study treatment group (1 study). Risk of bias due to inadequate researcher blinding was high in one study, unclear in 22, and low in four. Risks of bias arising from the remaining domains were predominantly low or unclear. AA/TSF (manualized) compared to treatments with a different theoretical orientation (e.g. CBT) (randomized/quasi-randomized evidence) RCTs comparing manualized AA/TSF to other clinical interventions (e.g. CBT), showed AA/TSF improves rates of continuous abstinence at 12 months (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.42; 2 studies, 1936 participants; high-certainty evidence). This effect remained consistent at both 24 and 36 months. For percentage days abstinent (PDA), AA/TSF appears to perform as well as other clinical interventions at 12 months (mean difference (MD) 3.03, 95% CI -4.36 to 10.43; 4 studies, 1999 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and better at 24 months (MD 12.91, 95% CI 7.55 to 18.29; 2 studies, 302 participants; low-certainty evidence) and 36 months (MD 6.64, 95% CI 1.54 to 11.75; 1 study, 806 participants; low-certainty evidence). For longest period of abstinence (LPA), AA/TSF may perform as well as comparison interventions at six months (MD 0.60, 95% CI -0.30 to 1.50; 2 studies, 136 participants; low-certainty evidence). For drinking intensity, AA/TSF may perform as well as other clinical interventions at 12 months, as measured by drinks per drinking day (DDD) (MD -0.17, 95% CI -1.11 to 0.77; 1 study, 1516 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and percentage days heavy drinking (PDHD) (MD -5.51, 95% CI -14.15 to 3.13; 1 study, 91 participants; low-certainty evidence). For alcohol-related consequences, AA/TSF probably performs as well as other clinical interventions at 12 months (MD -2.88, 95% CI -6.81 to 1.04; 3 studies, 1762 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). For alcohol addiction severity, one study found evidence of a difference in favor of AA/TSF at 12 months (P < 0.05; low-certainty evidence). AA/TSF (non-manualized) compared to treatments with a different theoretical orientation (e.g. CBT) (randomized/quasi-randomized evidence) For the proportion of participants completely abstinent, non-manualized AA/TSF may perform as well as other clinical interventions at three to nine months follow-up (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.70 to 4.18; 1 study, 93 participants; low-certainty evidence). Non-manualized AA/TSF may also perform slightly better than other clinical interventions for PDA (MD 3.00, 95% CI 0.31 to 5.69; 1 study, 93 participants; low-certainty evidence). For drinking intensity, AA/TSF may perform as well as other clinical interventions at nine months, as measured by DDD (MD -1.76, 95% CI -2.23 to -1.29; 1 study, 93 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and PDHD (MD 2.09, 95% CI -1.24 to 5.42; 1 study, 286 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the RCTs comparing non-manualized AA/TSF to other clinical interventions assessed LPA, alcohol-related consequences, or alcohol addiction severity. Cost-effectiveness studies In three studies, AA/TSF had higher healthcare cost savings than outpatient treatment, CBT, and no AA/TSF treatment. The fourth study found that total medical care costs decreased for participants attending CBT, MET, and AA/TSF treatment, but that among participants with worse prognostic characteristics AA/TSF had higher potential cost savings than MET (moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high quality evidence that manualized AA/TSF interventions are more effective than other established treatments, such as CBT, for increasing abstinence. Non-manualized AA/TSF may perform as well as these other established treatments. AA/TSF interventions, both manualized and non-manualized, may be at least as effective as other treatments for other alcohol-related outcomes. AA/TSF probably produces substantial healthcare cost savings among people with alcohol use disorder.

### Internet-based therapy versus face-to-face therapy for alcohol use disorder, a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^112FyEnQ]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Background

Alcohol use is a leading risk factor for premature death and disability‐adjusted life‐years. Among the population aged 15–49 years, alcohol use was the leading risk factor in 2016, accounting for nearly 10% of global deaths. A dose–response relationship exists between alcohol use and many major diseases [1]. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by impaired control and continued heavy use, despite these known negative consequences [2]. The prevalence of AUD is estimated to be 4.9% world‐wide and 6.1% in western Europe [3]. Effective treatment options are available, both psychological and pharmacological, that can help an individual reduce their alcohol consumption [4, 5]. However, of all mental disorders, alcohol and substance use disorders have the widest treatment gap between the number of individuals affected and the number in treatment, with only approximately 7% estimated to receive treatment [6]. Shame, stigma and poor access to attractive treatment options are common reasons why people with AUDs do not receive treatment [7].

Digital interventions for problematic alcohol use have been developed for access via computers and the internet during the last 30 years. Meta‐analyses have shown that internet interventions yield significantly better effects in terms of reduced alcohol consumption compared to control groups [8, 9]. The majority of studies on digital interventions for alcohol have been conducted on brief single‐session interventions aimed at students or similar risk populations [10]. Extended digital interventions, aimed at people with AUDs, are intended to be used over a number of weeks and are often based on treatment principles such as cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) and/or motivational interviewing (MI) [11]. An individual patient meta‐analysis has reported a significant effect of guided internet interventions for alcohol, with a reduction of 10 weekly standard units [95% confidence intervals (CI) = 5.4–14.6, P = 0.001) compared to controls [9].

### Overview of alcohol use disorder [^115RT2i4]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Alcohol is regularly consumed throughout most of the world, including by nearly half the U.S. population age 12 or older. Heavy drinking, which is also common, contributes to multiple adverse medical, psychiatric, and social outcomes and more than 140,000 deaths annually in the United States. It is the major risk factor for alcohol use disorder (AUD), whose current U.S. prevalence is 11%. However, AUD is undertreated, with less than 15% of individuals with a lifetime diagnosis receiving any treatment. Risk of AUD is nearly equally genetic and environmental. AUD is responsive to psychosocial treatments, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and motivational enhancement therapy. Alcohol affects multiple neurotransmitter systems, and thus pharmacotherapy for AUD is also effective. The three medications approved in the United States to treat AUD-disulfiram, naltrexone (oral and long-acting injectable formulations), and acamprosate-are underprescribed, despite being considered first-line treatments in clinical practice guidelines. Two medications not approved for treating AUD, topiramate and gabapentin, have shown efficacy in treating the disorder and are used off-label. Recent studies of novel drug candidates, including psychedelics and phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors, are promising additions for the treatment of AUD, although they require further evaluation before being used clinically. Despite the growing availability of efficacious psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for AUD, it remains a highly stigmatized condition. Research aimed at enhancing the identification and treatment of AUD, including precision therapeutics, could broaden the acceptability of AUD treatment, benefiting affected individuals and their families and reducing the stigma associated with the disorder.

### Internet-based therapy versus face-to-face therapy for alcohol use disorder, a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^11736T2f]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this study we found that internet‐delivered treatment was not inferior to face‐to‐face treatment in reducing alcohol consumption among help‐seeking patients with alcohol use disorder. Differences in secondary outcomes indicate that internet‐delivered treatment might be inferior to face‐to‐face treatment on some alcohol‐related outcomes.

### How effective are remote and / or digital interventions as part of alcohol and drug treatment and recovery support? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115598Jj]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and Aims

Although remote drug/alcohol interventions have been widely reviewed, their effectiveness specifically for people in treatment remains unclear. We aimed to systematically review the effectiveness of remote interventions (delivered by telephone or computer) in alcohol/drug treatment and recovery support.

Methods

We searched 29 databases including Medline and PsycINFO for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of remote interventions for adults diagnosed with alcohol/drug use disorder conducted in Organization for Economic Co‐operation and Development (OECD) countries published 2004–2023. We grouped interventions according to whether they supplemented or replaced/partially replaced in‐person care. We used random effects meta‐analyses to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) for relapse, and standardised mean differences (SMD) for days of alcohol/drug use. We appraised outcomes using Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.

Results

We identified 34 RCTs (6461 participants) evaluating 42 remote interventions, with diverse therapeutic approaches. Over 70% of outcomes were judged to be at high risk‐of‐bias. When remote interventions supplemented in‐person care, there was a 39% lower odds of relapse [17 interventions; OR 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.46, 0.81; P = 0.001; I² = 40.3%) and a reduction in the mean days of use (17 interventions; SMD −0.18; 95% CI = −0.28 to −0.08; P = 0.001; I² = 27.3%) compared with in‐person care alone. When remote interventions replaced/partially replaced in‐person care, there was a 49% lower odds of relapse (7 interventions; OR 0.51; 95% CI = 0.34, 0.76; P = 0.001; I² = 39.7%) and a very slight and uncertain reduction in mean days of use (8 interventions; SMD −0.08; 95% CI = −0.24 to 0.07; P = 0.301; I² = 48.4%) compared with in‐person care. Subgroup analyses by type of substance and therapeutic approach were mixed and inconclusive.

Conclusions

Remote interventions which supplement in‐person alcohol/drug treatment appear to reduce relapse and days of use. The evidence is less conclusive regarding remote interventions that replace/partially replace in‐person care due to a smaller body of evidence and uncertainty (days of use). High risk‐of‐bias means findings should be interpreted with caution.

### Comparative effectiveness of digital versus face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy for alcohol use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Z4Fym]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major and growing public health concern worldwide. In 2021, an estimated 111.12 million individuals globally were living with AUD, marking a 14.66% increase since 2000 (Danpanichkul et al.). Harmful alcohol use ranks among the leading causes of premature mortality and contributes to approximately 4.7% of the total global disease burden (World Health Organization [WHO]). Despite this substantial burden, treatment coverage for AUD remains critically low; globally, only about 7% of individuals with AUD (and other substance use disorders) who need treatment receive even minimally adequate care (WHO). This wide treatment gap underscores the urgency of expanding access to effective AUD interventions on a broader scale.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-established, evidence-based treatment modality for AUD. It is among the most extensively evaluated psychosocial interventions for substance use disorders, with robust evidence supporting its effectiveness for alcohol dependence. Major clinical guidelines – including those from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism – recommend CBT as a first-line psychosocial treatment for individuals with AUD. By training patients to identify high-risk situations, modify maladaptive drinking-related thoughts, and develop healthier coping strategies, CBT can significantly reduce alcohol consumption and relapse rates. Given its demonstrated efficacy, face-to-face CBT delivered by trained clinicians has long been a cornerstone of AUD treatment in traditional clinical settings.

### Mesa grande: a methodological analysis of clinical trials of treatments for alcohol use disorders [^112Fv1ny]. Addiction (2002). Low credibility.

Aim

A 3-year update with 59 new controlled trials is provided for the ongoing Mesa Grande project reviewing clinical trials of treatments for alcohol use disorders. The project summarizes the current evidence for various treatment approaches, weighting findings differentially according to the methodological strength of each study.

Design

The review includes 361 controlled studies that (1) evaluated at least one treatment for alcohol use disorders, (2) compared it with an alternative condition (such as a control group, a placebo, a brief intervention or an alternative treatment), (3) used a procedure designed to create equivalent groups before treatment and (4) reported at least one outcome measure of drinking or alcohol-related consequences. Studies were rated by two reviewers on 12 methodological criteria, and outcome logic was analyzed for the specific treatment modalities tested.

Findings

Methodological quality of studies was significantly but modestly correlated with the reporting of a specific effect of treatment. Among psychosocial treatments, strongest evidence of efficacy was found for brief interventions, social skills training, the community reinforcement approach, behavior contracting, behavioral marital therapy and case management. For the first time, two pharmacotherapies also appeared among the most strongly supported approaches: opiate antagonists (naltrexone, nalmefene) and acamprosate. Least supported were methods designed to educate, confront, shock or foster insight regarding the nature and causes of alcoholism.

Conclusions

Treatment methods differ substantially in apparent efficacy. It would be sensible to consider these differences in designing and funding treatment programs.

### Pharmacogenetic approaches to the treatment of alcohol addiction [^114fUZEx]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2011). Medium credibility.

Addictive disorders are partly heritable, chronic, relapsing conditions that account for a tremendous disease burden. Currently available addiction pharmacotherapies are only moderately successful, continue to be viewed with considerable scepticism outside the scientific community and have not become widely adopted as treatments. More effective medical treatments are needed to transform addiction treatment and address currently unmet medical needs. Emerging evidence from alcoholism research suggests that no single advance can be expected to fundamentally change treatment outcomes. Rather, studies of opioid, corticotropin-releasing factor, GABA and serotonin systems suggest that incremental advances in treatment outcomes will result from an improved understanding of the genetic heterogeneity among patients with alcohol addiction, and the development of personalized treatments.

### Supervised disulfiram should be considered first-line treatment for alcohol use disorder [^115Q6Zrt]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Despite the prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) in the United States, the armamentarium of FDA-approved medications available for AUD treatment is remarkably small. Disulfiram, 1 of only 3 approved medications, is consistently designated as a second-line option in national treatment guidelines, citing inconsistent evidence, lack of patient preference, and safety concerns. These concerns, however, stem from a misguided interpretation of the evidence that exclusively relies upon double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCT). When viewed instead as both a medication and a behavioral intervention, open-label RCTs become a more appropriate research method, yielding overwhelmingly favorable efficacy data for disulfiram, and supervised disulfiram, in particular. With these data in mind, supervised disulfiram should be redesignated as a first-line intervention in both treatment guideline creation and clinical pathway tools. The addiction medicine community can no longer afford to neglect this critical therapeutic resource.

### Alcohol use [^112For5z]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Unhealthy alcohol use-the consumption of alcohol at a level that has caused or has the potential to cause adverse physical, psychological, or social consequences-is common, underrecognized, and undertreated. For example, data from the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health indicate that 7.0% of adults reported heavy alcohol use in the previous month, and only 4.2% of adults with alcohol use disorder received treatment. Primary care is an important setting for optimizing screening and treatment of unhealthy alcohol use to promote individual and public health.

### Combined pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for adults with alcohol or substance use disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113yGsWE]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Substance use disorders (SUDs) represent a pressing public health concern. Combined behavioral and pharmacological interventions are considered best practices for addiction. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a first-line intervention, yet the superiority of CBT compared with other behavioral treatments when combined with pharmacotherapy remains unclear. An understanding of the effects of combined CBT and pharmacotherapy will inform best-practice guidelines for treatment of SUD.

Objective

To conduct a meta-analysis of the published literature on combined CBT and pharmacotherapy for adult alcohol use disorder (AUD) or other SUDs.

Data Sources

PubMed, Cochrane Register, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Embase databases from January 1, 1990, through July 31, 2019, were searched. Keywords were specified in 3 categories: treatment type, outcome type, and study design. Collected data were analyzed through September 30, 2019.

Study Selection

Two independent raters reviewed abstracts and full-text articles. English language articles describing randomized clinical trials examining CBT in combination with pharmacotherapy for AUD and SUD were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Inverse-variance weighted, random-effects estimates of effect size were pooled into 3 clinically informative subgroups: (1) CBT plus pharmacotherapy compared with usual care plus pharmacotherapy, (2) CBT plus pharmacotherapy compared with another specific therapy plus pharmacotherapy, and (3) CBT added to usual care and pharmacotherapy compared with usual care and pharmacotherapy alone. Sensitivity analyses included assessment of study quality, pooled effect size heterogeneity, publication bias, and primary substance moderator effects.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Substance use frequency and quantity outcomes after treatment and during follow-up were examined.

Results

The sample included 62 effect sizes from 30 unique randomized clinical trials that examined CBT in combination with some form of pharmacotherapy for AUD and SUD. The primary substances targeted in the clinical trial sample were alcohol (15 [50%]), followed by cocaine (7 [23%]) and opioids (6 [20%]). The mean (SD) age of the patient sample was 39 (6) years, with a mean (SD) of 28% (12%) female participants per study. The following pharmacotherapies were used: naltrexone hydrochloride and/or acamprosate calcium (26 of 62 effect sizes [42%]), methadone hydrochloride or combined buprenorphine hydrochloride and naltrexone (11 of 62 [18%]), disulfiram (5 of 62 [8%]), and another pharmacotherapy or mixture of pharmacotherapies (20 of 62 [32%]). Random-effects pooled estimates showed a benefit associated with combined CBT and pharmacotherapy over usual care (g range,0.18–0.28; k = 9). However, CBT did not perform better than another specific therapy, and evidence for the addition of CBT as an add-on to combined usual care and pharmacotherapy was mixed. Moderator analysis showed variability in effect direction and magnitude by primary drug target.

Conclusions and Relevance

The present study supports the efficacy of combined CBT and pharmacotherapy compared with usual care and pharmacotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy did not perform better than another evidence-based modality (eg, motivational enhancement therapy, contingency management) in this context or as an add-on to combined usual care and pharmacotherapy. These findings suggest that best practices in addiction treatment should include pharmacotherapy plus CBT or another evidence-based therapy, rather than usual clinical management or nonspecific counseling services.

### Pharmacotherapy for anxiety and comorbid alcohol use disorders [^114U8rKm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Anxiety disorders are a potentially disabling group of disorders that frequently co-occur with alcohol use disorders. Comorbid anxiety and alcohol use disorders are associated with poorer outcomes, and are difficult to treat with standard psychosocial interventions. In addition, improved understanding of the biological basis of the conditions has contributed to a growing interest in the use of medications for the treatment of people with both diagnoses.

Objectives

To assess the effects of pharmacotherapy for treating anxiety in people with comorbid alcohol use disorders, specifically: to provide an estimate of the overall effects of medication in improving treatment response and reducing symptom severity in the treatment of anxiety disorders in people with comorbid alcohol use disorders; to determine whether specific medications are more effective and tolerable than other medications in the treatment of particular anxiety disorders; and to identify which factors (clinical, methodological) predict response to pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders.

Search Methods

Review authors searched the specialized registers of The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group (CCDANCTR, to January 2014) and the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group (CDAG, to March 2013) for eligible trials. These registers contain reports of relevant randomized controlled trials (RCT) from: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Review authors ran complementary searches on EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO and the Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Science Database (ETOH) (to August 2013). We located unpublished trials through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) RePORTER service and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to August 2013). We screened reference lists of retrieved articles for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

All true RCTs of pharmacotherapy for treating anxiety disorders with comorbid alcohol use disorders. Trials assessing drugs administered for the treatment of drinking behaviour, such as naltrexone, disulfiram and acomprosate were not eligible for inclusion in this systematic review.

Data Collection and Analysis

A systematic review is a standardised evaluation of all research studies that address a particular clinical issue. Two review authors independently assessed RCTs for inclusion in the review, collated trial data and assessed trial quality. We contacted investigators to obtain missing data. We calculated categorical and continuous treatment effect estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for treatment using a random-effects model with effect-size variability expressed using Chi(2) and I(2) heterogeneity statistics.

Main Results

We included five placebo-controlled pharmacotherapy RCTs (with 290 participants) in the review. Most of the trials provided little information on how randomization was performed or on whether both participants and study personnel were blinded to the intervention. Two of the three trials reporting superiority of medication compared with placebo on anxiety symptom outcomes were industry funded. We regarded one trial as being at high risk of bias due to selective reporting. Study participants had Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) III- and DSM IV-diagnosed alcohol use disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (two studies), social anxiety disorder (SAD; two studies) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; one study). Four trials assessed the efficacy of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs: sertraline, paroxetine); one RCT investigated the efficacy of buspirone, a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) partial agonist. Treatment duration lasted between eight and 24 weeks. Overall, 70% of participants included in the review were male. There was very low quality evidence for an effect of paroxetine on global clinical response to treatment, as assessed by the Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement scale (CGI-I). Global clinical response was observed in more than twice as many participants with paroxetine than with placebo (57.7% with paroxetine versus 25.8% with placebo; risk ratio (RR) 2.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.41; 2 trials, 57 participants). However, there was substantial uncertainty regarding the size of the effect of paroxetine due to the small number of studies providing data on clinically diverse patient samples. The second primary outcome measure was reduction of anxiety symptom severity. Although study investigators reported that buspirone (one trial) was superior to placebo in reducing the severity of anxiety symptoms over 12 weeks, no evidence of efficacy was observed for paroxetine (mean difference (MD) -14.70, 95% CI -33.00 to 3.60, 2 trials, 44 participants) and sertraline (one trial). Paroxetine appeared to be equally effective in reducing the severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms as the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine in one RCT. The maximal reduction in anxiety disorder symptom severity was achieved after six weeks with paroxetine (two RCTs) and 12 weeks with buspirone (one RCT), with maintenance of medication efficacy extending to 16 with paroxetine and 24 weeks with buspirone. There was no evidence of an effect for any of the medications tested on abstinence from alcohol use or depression symptoms. There was very low quality evidence that paroxetine was well tolerated, based on drop-out due to treatment-emergent adverse effects. Nevertheless, levels of treatment discontinuation were high, with 43.1% of the participants in the studies withdrawing from medication treatment. Certain adverse effects, such as sexual problems, were commonly reported after treatment with paroxetine and sertraline.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence-base for the effectiveness of medication in treating anxiety disorders and comorbid alcohol use disorders is currently inconclusive. There was a small amount of evidence for the efficacy of medication, but this was limited and of very low quality. The majority of the data for the efficacy and tolerability of medication were for SSRIs; there were insufficient data to establish differences in treatment efficacy between medication classes or patient subgroups. There was a small amount of very low quality evidence that medication was well tolerated. There was no evidence that alcohol use was responsive to medication. Large, rigorously conducted RCTs would help supplement the small evidence-base for the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy for anxiety and comorbid alcohol use disorders. Further research on patient subgroups who may benefit from pharmacological treatment, as well as novel pharmacological interventions, is warranted.

### Disulfiram should remain second-line treatment for most patients with alcohol use disorder [^112PE2MB]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is responsible for a significant burden of medical, economic, and social harm globally and across the United States. Currently, only three FDA-approved medications for AUD are available, and most patients with AUD never receive pharmacotherapy. Disulfiram, the first medication that FDA approved for treatment of AUD, is recommended as a second-line treatment option by several national treatment guidelines citing safety concerns and lack of high-quality comparative studies. In this issue, Holt argues that disulfiram should be reclassified as a first-line treatment for AUD based on promising open-label randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for disulfiram as a behavioral intervention. Review of the literature suggests that disulfiram can be a useful treatment for a highly selected group of patients with no medical or psychiatric contraindications, high motivation for abstinence, and adequate family support. Unfortunately, many patients with AUD, a disorder characterized by high rates of medical and psychiatric multimorbidity and social vulnerability, fall outside of this narrow selection criteria. Prescribers should consider other FDA-approved medications as first-line treatment options for most patients with AUD, reserving disulfiram for the rare patients in whom the potential for benefit clearly outweighs risk of harm.

### Internet-based therapy versus face-to-face therapy for alcohol use disorder, a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^115cS6RJ]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this randomized controlled non‐inferiority trial was to investigate the effects of internet‐delivered CBT, compared to face‐to‐face CBT, among adult users with AUD at a specialized clinic for AUDs. The main hypothesis of the trial was that internet‐delivered CBT for reducing alcohol use would not be less effective in reducing alcohol consumption, in terms of standard units consumed per week, compared to face‐to‐face CBT. The margin for the difference between treatments, within which internet‐delivered therapy would be considered non‐inferior, was set to five standard units of alcohol consumed per week.

### Helping patients who drink too much: an evidence-based guide for primary care clinicians [^1149gQtq]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Excessive alcohol consumption is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality, but few heavy drinkers receive treatment. Primary care physicians are in a position to address heavy drinking and alcohol use disorders with patients, and can do so quickly and effectively. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has published a guide for physicians that offers an evidence-based approach to screening, assessing, and treating alcohol use disorders in general health care settings. Screening can be performed by asking patients how many heavy drinking days they have per week. Assessing patients' willingness to change their drinking behaviors can guide treatment. Treatment recommendations should be presented in a clear, nonjudgmental way. Patients who are not alcohol-dependent may opt to reduce drinking to lower risk levels. Patients with alcohol dependence should receive pharmacotherapy and brief behavioral support, as well as disease management for chronic relapsing dependence. All patients with alcohol dependence should be encouraged to participate in community support groups

### Internet-based therapy versus face-to-face therapy for alcohol use disorder, a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^116TZVPZ]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and aims

Most people with alcohol use disorder (AUD) are never treated. Internet‐based interventions are effective in reducing alcohol consumption and could help to overcome some of the barriers to people not seeking or receiving treatment. The aim of the current study was to compare internet‐delivered and face‐to‐face treatment among adult users with AUD.

Design

Randomized controlled non‐inferiority trial with a parallel design, comparing internet‐delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (ICBT) (n = 150) with face‐to‐face CBT (n = 151), at 3‐ and 6‐month follow‐ups.

Setting

A specialized clinic for people with AUD in Stockholm, Sweden. Participants were recruited between 8 December 2015 and 5 January 2018.

Participants

A total of 301 patients [mean age 50 years, standard deviation (SD) = 12.3] with AUD, of whom 115 (38%) were female and 186 (62%) were male.

Intervention and comparator

Participants were randomized in blocks of 20 at a ratio of 1: 1 to five modules of therapist‐guided ICBT or to five modules of face‐to‐face CBT, delivered over a 3‐month period. The same treatment material and the same therapists were used in both groups.

Measurements

The primary outcome was standard drinks of alcohol consumed during the previous week at 6‐month follow‐up, analysed according to intention‐to‐treat. The pre‐specified non‐inferiority limit was five standard drinks of alcohol and d = 0.32 for secondary outcomes.

Results

The difference in alcohol consumption between the internet and the face‐to‐face group was non‐inferior in the intention‐to‐treat analysis of data from the 6‐month follow‐up [internet = 12.33 and face‐to‐face = 11.43, difference = 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) = −1.10 to 2.88]. The secondary outcome, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test score, failed to show non‐inferiority of internet compared with face‐to‐face in the intention‐to‐treat analysis at 6‐month follow‐up (internet = 12.26 and face‐to‐face = 11.57, d = 0.11, 95% CI = –0.11 to 0.34).

Conclusions

Internet‐delivered treatment was non‐inferior to face‐to‐face treatment in reducing alcohol consumption among help‐seeking patients with alcohol use disorder but failed to show non‐inferiority on some secondary outcomes.

### Real-world effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of alcohol use disorders in a Swedish nation-wide cohort of 125 556 patients [^1139ZyWY]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol use disorders (AUD) cause health problems and are one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity world‐wide. More than 5% of the global disease burden is caused by harmful use of alcohol, and in 2016 more than 3 million people died due to alcohol‐related causes. The harmful use of alcohol is associated with risk of mental and behavioral disorders, and regular alcohol abuse can lead to serious somatic diseases. Alcohol use also increases the risk of injuries resulting from violence and accidents.

The mainstay of AUD treatment is psychosocial intervention, but combining psychosocial treatments with pharmacotherapy can lead to better outcomes. Disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate are approved for the treatment of AUD in the United States and Europe. Nalmefene is also approved in Europe. According to the latest meta‐analyses and systematic reviews on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), these medications have shown their efficacy in comparison with placebo: disulfiram under supervision to advance treatment adherence, acamprosate in maintaining abstinence, naltrexone, especially in reducing binge drinking, and nalmefene in reducing heavy drinking days. Despite their potential to improve clinical outcome for individuals with AUD, these medications are under‐utilized. Deficient knowledge of these medications and possible doubts about their effectiveness may lead to the low utilization rate. Benzodiazepines are generally accepted as pharmacotherapy for managing alcohol withdrawal, but not recommended for use after detoxification. Nonetheless, benzodiazepine misuse is common among people with AUD. All mentioned medications can cause some adverse effects, disulfiram even fatal ones, but very little is known about overall health outcomes (such as risks of hospitalization and mortality) associated with specific treatments in real‐world circumstances. Furthermore, the possible association of specific treatments with work‐related outcomes (such as sickness absences and disability pensions) is less well established, despite the fact that AUD has a strong effect on work performance. As patients included in RCTs are highly selected populations, it is not known how effective treatments are in non‐selected patient population in real‐world treatment settings.

The aim of this study is to investigate the real‐world effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of alcohol dependence on (1) risk of hospitalization due to AUD as a main outcome and (2) hospitalization due to any cause, alcohol‐related somatic causes and work disability and death as secondary outcomes.

### Is alcohol dependence best viewed as a chronic relapsing disorder? [^112Uxdzo]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

This 'For Debate' paper starts by recognizing the growing trend towards considering alcohol dependence as a chronic relapsing disorder. We argue that the adoption of this model results from focusing on those in treatment for alcohol dependence rather than considering the larger number of people in the general population who meet criteria for alcohol dependence at some point in their lives. The majority of the general population who ever experience alcohol dependence do not behave as though they have a chronic relapsing disorder: they do not seek treatment, resolve their dependence themselves and do not relapse repeatedly. We suggest that caution is therefore needed in using the chronic relapsing disorder label. Our primary concerns are that this formulation privileges biological aspects of dependence to the detriment of psychological and social contributions, it inhibits much-needed developments in understanding alcohol dependence and leads to inefficient distributions of public health and clinical care resources for alcohol dependence. We invite debate on this issue.

Regarding medical management for alcohol use disorder, more specifically with respect to goals of treatment, APA 2018 guidelines recommend to consider setting the initial goals of treatment of AUD (abstinence from alcohol use, reduction or moderation of alcohol use, or other elements of harm reduction) agreed on between the patient and clinician and documented this agreement in the medical records.

### Acupuncture for alcohol use disorder: research status and potential strategies to improve therapeutic efficacy [^111bNvVR]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a prevalent, chronic relapsing substance use disorder, with its prevalence increasing worldwide, along with socioeconomic development. Given the limitations of conventional AUD treatments, including the variable efficacy of pharmacotherapy and implementation challenges of some psychotherapy methods, researchers have increasingly investigated acupuncture as a potential adjunctive therapy. Acupuncture is a traditional complementary therapy that has shown potential in managing mental and behavioral disorders. While its cost-effectiveness and accessibility vary across healthcare systems, preliminary evidence suggests adjunctive benefits for AUD. Through modulation of the dopaminergic and opioid systems and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, acupuncture may reduce alcohol consumption and cravings, thereby facilitating AUD management and alleviating associated mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia. This review investigated and stratified commonly used acupoints in preclinical and clinical studies, offering recommendations for enhanced application and investigation of acupuncture treatment for AUD. The paucity of research in this domain warrants further exploration through well-structured research initiatives.

### Treatment of alcohol use disorders in patients with alcoholic liver disease [^114bBu3X]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) is one of the leading causes of disease and disability in almost all European countries. Among the alcohol-related diseases, alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the most common. At present, alcohol is the most frequent cause of liver cirrhosis in the Western world. The cornerstone of treatment for ALD is achieving total alcohol abstinence and preventing relapse; medical and surgical treatments for ALD are limited when drinking continues. This narrative review summarizes current treatments for AUDs with a particular emphasis to the treatment of AUDs in patients with ALD. Medical management, psychosocial and pharmacological interventions are analyzed, underlying limits and options in AUD patients. Finally, this review discusses the most appropriate setting for the management of AUD patients with advanced liver disease as well as the indications for liver transplantation in AUD patients.

### Brief, cognitive-behavioral intervention to promote treatment seeking in adults with severe alcohol use disorder: a randomized controlled trial [^113Ayu5F]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

There is little RCT evidence that brief interventions improve treatment seeking in individuals with severe alcohol use disorder (AUD) or treatment seeking reduces alcohol use. The aim was to test the efficacy of a brief intervention to increase treatment seeking in treatment naïve adults with severe AUD and measure its effects on alcohol use.

Design

Parallel group, non-pharmacologic RCT with intervention (n = 197) and active control (n = 203) conditions, with blinded assessors conducting follow-ups at 1, 3 and 6 months.

Setting

Online recruitment in a 17-county region of upstate New York, USA.

Participants

Inclusion criteria consisted of ages ≥ 18years, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test score ≥ 16, exceeds recommended limits for alcohol use and no history of AUD treatment. n = 400; 50% female; 79% white; mean age, 40.7; mean education, 14.6 years.

Intervention and Comparator

One-session telephone-delivered interventions: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Treatment Seeking (CBT-TS; intervention), review of a National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism pamphlet on AUD treatment (control).

Measurements

Self-report of any AUD treatment use over 3 months (primary outcome) and two standard measures of alcohol use over 6 months (secondary outcomes).

Findings

Intent-to-treat analyses were used. Assessment follow-up rates were ≥ 93%. Any alcohol-related treatment use over 3-month follow-up was obtained by 38 (19%) intervention participants and 36 (18%) control participants, a non-significant difference, χ²(1) = 0.16, P = 0.689. Secondary analysis showed a significant interaction term between sex and intervention assignment (β = −1.197, P = 0.027). The interaction suggested CBT-TS was effective in men (22% vs 13%), although the evidence was somewhat weak (P = 0.071), and it was not effective in women (17% vs 24%).

Conclusions

A one-session cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention to increase treatment seeking in treatment naïve adults with severe alcohol use disorder did not increase treatment seeking.

### Medications for alcohol use disorder [^113DpUxm]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that clinicians screen adults for alcohol misuse and provide persons engaged in risky or hazardous drinking behaviors with brief behavioral counseling to reduce alcohol misuse. However, only a minority of American adults with high-risk alcohol use receive treatment. Three medications are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat alcohol use disorder: acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone. Acamprosate and naltrexone reduce alcohol consumption and increase abstinence rates, although the effects appear to be modest. Disulfiram has been used for years, but evidence supporting its effectiveness is inconsistent. Other medications may be beneficial to reduce heavy alcohol use. The anticonvulsants topiramate and gabapentin may reduce alcohol ingestion, although long-term studies are lacking. Antidepressants do not decrease alcohol use in patients without mood disorders, but sertraline and fluoxetine may help depressed patients decrease alcohol ingestion. Ondansetron may reduce alcohol use, particularly in selected subpopulations. Further study is needed for genetically targeted or as-needed medications to reduce alcohol use.

### Treatment of alcohol use disorder in patients with alcoholic liver disease [^115otmnq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Alcohol is a leading cause of liver disease worldwide. Although alcohol abstinence is the crucial therapeutic goal for patients with alcoholic liver disease, these patients have less access to psychosocial, behavioral, and/or pharmacologic treatments for alcohol use disorder. Psychosocial and behavioral therapies include 12-step facilitation, brief interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy, and motivational enhancement therapy. In addition to medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for alcohol use disorder (disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate), recent efforts to identify potential new treatments have yielded promising candidate pharmacotherapies. Finally, more efforts are needed to integrate treatments across disciplines toward patient-centered approaches in the management of patients with alcohol use disorder and alcoholic liver disease.

### Internet-based therapy versus face-to-face therapy for alcohol use disorder, a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^111ZVqjP]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Although several studies have shown that digital interventions are effective in reducing alcohol use, it is not clear how effective they are compared to face‐to‐face interventions. A recent Cochrane Review of internet interventions found no evidence of a difference in effect on alcohol consumption between internet and face‐to‐face intervention arms in five trials of brief interventions targeting college students' alcohol use [8]. Research on other psychiatric and somatic disorders has suggested that internet interventions that are therapist‐guided have effects comparable to those of face‐to‐face interventions [12]. Previous studies conducted in clinical settings have tested digital interventions for alcohol as an alternative to treatment as usual (TAU) [13, 14, 15] or as an addition to TAU [15, 16, 17]. A recent meta‐analysis found that when digital CBT for alcohol was tested as an addition to TAU, compared with TAU only, the effect size from seven studies was positive and significant. It also found that the pooled effect size from two studies comparing digital CBT for alcohol use to TAU did not suggest superior efficacy [18].

In order to investigate whether a new treatment modality such as internet‐delivered treatment is actually no less effective than an established treatment, a non‐inferiority or equivalence design is needed. Such a design can also help to avoid ethical problems with using placebo or inactive control groups in the evaluation of a new treatment for a serious condition such as AUD, where there is already evidence of efficacy for an existing standard treatment. The use of a non‐inferiority design can be problematic, however, if the new treatment does not offer other advantages compared to an already established treatment [19]. Possible advantages of internet‐delivered treatment for alcohol use disorders include overcoming problems with cost, accessibility and stigma in traditional face‐to‐face treatment [20]. One previous non‐inferiority study of an internet intervention for alcohol has been conducted in primary care, with the proportion of hazardous drinkers in each group as the primary outcome. The study failed to show non‐inferiority for facilitated access to an internet self‐help programme compared to a face‐to‐face brief intervention at 3‐ and 12‐month follow‐ups, when a biased outcome measure was removed from the analysis [21].

### Combined pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for adults with alcohol or substance use disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113QLxYU]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The goal of this meta-analysis is to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive review of CBT in conjunction with pharmacotherapy for AUD/SUD. This meta-analysis provides effect-size estimates across 3 distinct subgroups that may be informative to best-practice guidelines or individual clinician decision-making: (1) CBT plus pharmacotherapy compared with usual care (eg, clinical management, nonspecific drug counseling) plus pharmacotherapy, (2) CBT plus pharmacotherapy compared with another specific therapy (eg, motivational enhancement therapy, contingency management) plus pharmacotherapy, and (3) CBT added to usual care and pharmacotherapy compared with usual care and pharmacotherapy alone. Sensitivity analyses included tests of heterogeneity, study influence, and publication bias. Given the robust literature on CBT for addiction, the critical role of pharmacotherapy in addiction treatment, and the notion that combined treatments may be most effective, this meta-analytic review seeks to inform clinical practice and best-practice guidelines for addiction.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^116yUKWU]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — glossary core terms define abstinence, provider roles, therapy types, assessment dimensions, and substance use terminology as follows: Abstinence is the voluntary refraining from alcohol and other substances, and the use of FDA‑approved medication for substance use disorder is consistent with abstinence. Addiction specialist physicians include addiction medicine physicians and addiction psychiatrists. Adjunct therapy is a pharmaceutical drug used with a primary pharmaceutical to assist the primary treatment, whereas monotherapy is the use of a single drug to treat a disorder or disease. The ASAM Criteria uses six dimensions to define a holistic biopsychosocial assessment for service and treatment planning. Patients is intentionally broad and encompasses anyone who receives care for a substance use disorder in a specialty addiction treatment center or other healthcare setting. Pharmacotherapy is therapy using pharmaceutical drugs. Recovery capital refers to the breadth and depth of internal and external resources that can be drawn upon to initiate and sustain recovery from alcohol and other drug problems. Substance use refers to the use of psychotropic substances, which may include illegal drugs, medications or alcohol, and does not refer to nicotine. Substance use disorders are marked by a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms indicating continued use despite significant problems, with diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5, and the term replaces what was included as substance dependence and substance abuse in the DSM-4.

### Combined pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for adults with alcohol or substance use disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116pCCqe]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Substance use disorders (SUDs) represent a pressing public health concern, which calls for clinicians and scientists to identify and implement best practices in treatment. To that end, the combination of pharmacological and behavioral interventions has long been considered the criterion standard in addiction care, although differences between best practices for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and SUD have been noted. For SUDs without a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved pharmacotherapy, such as cocaine, methamphetamine, and cannabis, behavioral treatments are the principal approach. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a first-line behavioral approach for treating AUD and other SUDs (AUD/SUD). Cognitive behavioral therapy is a time-limited, multisession intervention that targets cognitive, affective, and environmental risks for substance use and provides training in behavioral self-control skills to help an individual achieve and maintain abstinence or harm reduction.

Despite the importance of combined pharmacological and behavioral interventions for AUD/SUD, few meta-analyses on this intervention approach have been performed. Typically, meta-analytic reviews in the AUD/SUD literature have been conducted on specific pharmacotherapies, groups of pharmacotherapies, or specific behavioral interventions, such as CBT. As a result, the evidence-informed guideline will relate only to the selection of a single, stand-alone therapy, whether pharmacological or behavioral, and not their combination. For example, in a review of 122 clinical trials of AUD pharmacotherapies delivered in outpatient settings, the authors could not conclude about the efficacy of pharmacotherapies when combined with a behavioral cointervention.

The meta-analytic evidence on CBT supports efficacy at short- and long-term follow-ups. In an early review (1999) of 26 studies by Irvin et al, the authors found CBT to be generally effective across a range of conditions, but effect sizes were roughly 5 times higher when CBT was combined with pharmacotherapy than when delivered as a stand-alone intervention. This subgroup analysis was based on 4 studies and should therefore be interpreted with caution. In 2009, Magill and Rayfollowed up this work with a meta-analysis of 53 CBT clinical trials, reporting a similar overall effect size and a larger effect when CBT was combined with pharmacotherapy than when delivered alone, but the difference in effect-size magnitude between groups was smaller than observed in the previous review including 13 studies.

### A digital cognitive behavioral therapy program for adults with alcohol use disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^116F9hWR]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol use disorder (AUD), characterized by an impaired ability to stop or control alcohol use despite adverse consequences, ranks as one of the most prevalent mental disorders globally and is associated with high mortality and disease burden. Implementation of evidence-based psychotherapies for treating AUD, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), into community practice settings has been challenging. Marked by low fidelity to the established intervention, many patients seeking treatment may not in fact be receiving the true intervention that has been shown to be effective. Multicomponent training improves therapist knowledge and delivery, but is too costly and time-intensive for most settings.

Digital therapeutics (mobile, web, or other software-based platforms that deliver treatments for medical conditions or diseases) offer the potential to enhance the ability of patients to access evidence-based treatment for AUD. They also offer major advantages of standardization and consistent quality, reduction of cost and clinician time, and potential continuous availability. However, evidence supporting the efficacy of digital therapeutics through randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is needed ensure these tools can benefit people with AUD.

A digital version of CBT, called Computer-Based Training for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT4CBT), was developed in early 2000s by the late Kathleen Carroll, PhD, and colleagues. This digital CBT program is a web-based program consisting of core skill topics (modules) designed to teach patients generalizable CBT strategies for avoiding drug use, with a subsequent version targeting alcohol use, via video, graphics, audio instruction, and interactive exercises. Patient improvement in coping skills, cognitive control, and response inhibition have been identified as potential mechanisms of the effectiveness of this digital CBT program. The alcohol version of the program follows the same format used in the original, with content adapted based on the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism CBT manual. Results from a pilot RCT in a sample of 68 adults with AUD indicated that this digital CBT program added to standard outpatient treatment was superior to standard treatment alone at improving alcohol abstinence; also, outcomes from digital CBT delivered as a stand-alone program with weekly clinical monitoring were not significantly different from standard treatment.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^112nGr2W]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease — management of alcohol-use disorder recommendations and key concepts state that, in patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD), "In patients with ALD, baclofen is effective in preventing alcohol relapse (Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence)" and that "In patients with ALD, brief motivational interventions are effective in reducing alcohol relapse compared with no intervention (Conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence)". The guideline emphasizes that "Alcohol consumption is a major determinant of disease progression and long-term outcome of patients with ALD. Complete abstinence from alcohol consumption is the cornerstone in the management of every spectrum of ALD". It also notes that "Medical treatment of ALD should be ideally performed by multidisciplinary teams including alcohol addiction specialists".

### Are we making inroads? A randomized controlled trial of a psychologist-supported, web-based, cognitive behavioral therapy intervention to reduce anxiety and hazardous alcohol use among emerging adults [^115DWNsR]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Co-occurrence between anxiety and alcohol use disorders can also interfere with treatment and recovery from either disorder. People with co-occurring anxiety and alcohol use disorders may be less willing to seek or engage with treatment, and standard single-disorder treatments are less effective for people with co-occurring anxiety and alcohol use. Given the mutually reinforcing connections between anxiety and alcohol use, effective treatment may require an integrated approach that targets both disorders concurrently, as well as the inter-relationship between them. Emerging evidence from clinical trials supports this view, with results showing greater reduction in anxiety symptoms, alcohol use and/or functional impairment following integrated treatment compared to traditional single-disorder approaches.

Emerging adulthood is a key window of opportunity for intervention to prevent the significant burden associated with co-occurring anxiety and alcohol use disorders. The term "emerging adulthood" has been applied to describe the unique period from the late teens through the mid-20s, which is characterised by a range of significant personal and social role changes, including increased independence, new relationships, occupational and living arrangements. For some young people, adjusting to these changes can be challenging, and this developmental stage is a key risk period for the development and escalation of both anxiety and alcohol use disorders. In Australia, one in six emerging adults aged 16–24 years met diagnosis for an anxiety disorder in the 12 months prior, and nearly one in three consume alcohol at hazardous levels as defined by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Anxiety disorders in youth are associated with increased risk of coping-motivated drinking, earlier first use of alcoholand progression from first alcohol use to regular use, and from regular use to alcohol use disorder. In view of this inter-relationship, there are clear advantages to intervening in youth to promote adaptive coping strategies and address the interconnection between anxiety and alcohol use, before these conditions become deeply intertwined in an exacerbating self-perpetuating cycle.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment initiation and engagement — Recommendation V.12: The period of alcohol withdrawal management should be used to engage patients with an alcohol use disorder with comprehensive treatment. When feasible, AUD treatment should be initiated concurrently with alcohol withdrawal management as cognitive status permits, and clinicians should also offer to initiate pharmacotherapy for AUD as cognitive status permits. Clinicians should explain the range of evidence-based treatment services available at the current site and in the community and should proactively connect patients to treatment services as seamlessly as possible, including initiating a warm handoff to treatment providers.

### Association between alcohol use disorder and receipt of direct-acting antiviral hepatitis C virus treatment [^115hrGhn]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the association of alcohol use with receipt of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection?

Findings

In this cohort study of 133 753 adults with HCV infection, those with alcohol use disorder, even if abstinent, were statistically significantly less likely to receive DAA treatment within 1 and 3 years after eligibility compared with those with lower-risk drinking after adjusting for demographic characteristics and comorbidities.

Meaning

This study suggests that, although guidelines recommend DAA treatment for patients with HCV regardless of alcohol use, patients with alcohol use disorder encounter barriers to HCV treatment.

### A randomized clinical trial of alcohol care management delivered in department of veterans affairs primary care clinics versus specialty addiction treatment [^113mNveG]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol use disorder is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments, few individuals with an alcohol use disorder are actively engaged in treatment. Available evidence suggests that primary care may play a crucial role in the identification of patients with an alcohol use disorder, delivery of interventions, and the success of treatment.

Objective

The principal aims of this study were to test the effectiveness of a primary care-based Alcohol Care Management (ACM) program for alcohol use disorder and treatment engagement in veterans.

Design

The design of the study was a 26-week single-blind randomized clinical trial. The study was conducted in the primary care practices at three VA medical centers. Participants were randomly assigned to treatment in ACM or standard treatment in a specialty outpatient addiction treatment program.

Participants

One hundred and sixty-three alcohol-dependent veterans were randomized.

Intervention

ACM focused on the use of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial support. ACM was delivered in-person or by telephone within the primary care clinic.

Main Measurements

Engagement in treatment and heavy alcohol consumption.

Key Results

The ACM condition had a significantly higher proportion of participants engaged in treatment over the 26 weeks [OR = 5.36, 95% CI = (2.99, 9.59)]. The percentage of heavy drinking days were significantly lower in the ACM condition [OR = 2.16, 95% CI = (1.27, 3.66)], while overall abstinence did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

Results demonstrate that treatment for an alcohol use disorder can be delivered effectively within primary care, leading to greater rates of engagement in treatment and greater reductions in heavy drinking.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^115P5zLM]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to management of alcohol use disorder, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate treatment for alcohol use disorder concurrently with alcohol withdrawal management when feasible and as cognitive status permits. Offer initiation of pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder if appropriate and as cognitive status permits. Explain the range of evidence-based treatment services available in the community, and engage patients with these options. Consider offering information about local recovery support groups, including 12-step groups.

### Designing clinical trials to address alcohol use and alcohol-associated liver disease: an expert panel consensus statement [^113eHZ54]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Most patients with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) engage in heavy drinking defined as 4 or more drinks per day (56g) or 8 (112g) or more drinks per week for women and 5 or more drinks per day (70g) or 15 (210g) or more drinks per week for men. Although abstinence from alcohol after diagnosis of ALD improves life expectancy and reduces the risk of decompensation of liver disease, few studies have evaluated whether treatment of alcohol use disorders will reduce progression of liver disease and improve liver-related outcomes. In November 2021, the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism commissioned a task force that included hepatologists, addiction medicine specialists, statisticians, clinical trialists and members of regulatory agencies to develop recommendations for the design and conduct of clinical trials to evaluate the effect of alcohol use, particularly treatment to reduce or eliminate alcohol use in patients with ALD. The task force conducted extensive reviews of relevant literature on alcohol use disorders and ALD. Findings were presented at one in-person meeting and discussed over the next 16 months to develop the final recommendations. As few clinical trials directly address this topic, the 28 recommendations approved by all members of the task force represent a consensus of expert opinions.

### Topiramate treatment of alcohol use disorder in clinical practice [^115Bm8wR]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Topiramate is an anticonvulsant medication with increasingly strong evidence, supporting its use for treating alcohol use disorder (AUD) based on clinical trials. These clinical cases summarize the initiation and titration of topiramate in AUD treatment. The core issues of patient selection, consideration of comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions, side-effect profile, safety and effectiveness are reviewed. Addiction physicians should take a leading role in using topiramate to treat AUDs, working with patients to balance the benefits of topiramate with the risk.

### Closing the care gap: management of alcohol use disorder in patients with alcohol-associated liver disease [^112JxGMq]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD)-related morbidity and mortality are rising in the United States. Although effective medications and behavioral interventions are available for the treatment of patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD), patients with ALD are profoundly undertreated for AUD. This article reviews the management of AUD in patients with ALD, with a focus on appropriate screening and diagnosis, management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, pharmacotherapy for AUD, alcohol biomarkers, and behavioral interventions. Expanding access to AUD treatment is imperative for improving health outcomes in patients with ALD.

### How effective are remote and / or digital interventions as part of alcohol and drug treatment and recovery support? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115DDHeU]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Study categorisation

Studies were categorised by: outcome measured, type of therapeutic approach, substance targeted and by type of evaluation.

Outcome measured

Our two outcomes were relapse (abstinence not maintained) and days of alcohol/drug use. To ensure comparability, we extracted outcome data for the most commonly reported timepoint, which was at the end of intervention. Outcomes were measured by self‐report and/or toxicology.

Type of therapeutic approach

We categorised remote interventions into three main types; any interventions not of these types were categorised as 'other':
Remote recovery support: a range of interventions to check up on recovery progress, maintain or improve motivation, support recovery goals, identify risks of or actual relapse and/or facilitate access to treatment or other recovery services if required.
Remote talking therapy: remote, synchronous group or individual counselling sessions, typically based on cognitive, behavioural, psychological, psychodynamic or 12‐step interventions and delivered by a trained, qualified therapist or counsellor.
Self‐guided therapy: a structured programme containing different activities that people work through themselves, such as self‐monitoring and skill development.

Type of substance use targeted

We categorised substance use into three main types:
Alcohol only.
Mixed drugs and alcohol.
Drugs only.

Type of evaluation

Studies broadly fell into two evaluation categories: (1) those which evaluated remote interventions as a supplement to in‐person treatment, compared to in‐person care alone and (2) those that evaluated remote interventions as a replacement or partial replacement to in‐person treatment, compared to exclusively in‐person treatment. Partial replacement interventions were those where some of the in‐person components were replaced with remote components. Replacement interventions were those where, following assessment and diagnosis, intervention participants received only remote intervention.

We created this categorisation because we assumed that for interventions delivered as a supplement to in‐person treatment, to demonstrate success, outcomes should be superior to the comparator. However, for interventions replacing or partially replacing in‐person treatment, we assumed that to demonstrate success, outcomes should not be unacceptably worse than the comparator. It should be noted that most of the individual studies were not formally designed or conducted as inferiority/superiority analyses.

### Clinical practice guideline: assessment and treatment of adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders and problematic substance use (excluding tobacco) [^115j8SHG]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Adolescents and young adults with substance use disorder (SUD) and problematic substance use (PSU) — grading framework and suggested treatments are detailed as follows: Evidence of each studied intervention was assigned a Strength of Evidence (SOE) rating of A (high), B (moderate), C (low), or insufficient, and interventions with SOE C or higher were eligible for a category of Recommendation (1) or Suggestion (2). Suggested (2C) safe and effective short-term treatments include brief (1–2 sessions) motivational interviewing for alcohol use; non-brief (> 2 sessions) motivational interviewing, family therapy, or cognitive-behavioral therapy for alcohol use disorder or SUD overall with or without other drug use; motivational interviewing plus cognitive-behavioral therapy for illicit drug disorders; behavioral interventions for college students with problematic alcohol use; and longer-term buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder. The SOE was insufficient to support suggestions or recommendations for the pharmacological or behavioral treatment of any other adolescent SUD/PSU.

### Alcohol use disorder treatment availability at mental health treatment facilities [^111to6Ps]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Among adults with mental illness, 18.9% or 11 million individuals have co-occurring alcohol use disorder (AUD). Yet, only 8% of individuals with AUD receive treatment, and less than 2% receive medications for alcohol use disorder (MAUD).MAUD in particular has been shown to decrease drinking and associated harms from alcohol use. Among those with co-occurring disorders, remission from both conditions is more likely if each condition is treated. One approach to increase treatment access is to integrate alcohol treatments into behavioral health care settings. Our objective is to assess whether specialty mental health facilities offer treatment for AUD to patients with co-occurring mental health disorders and AUD.

### Substance use within trials of psychological interventions for psychosis: sample inclusion, secondary measures, and intervention effectiveness [^1144oXeG]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Current clinical guidelines recommend that patients with co-occurring psychosis and alcohol or substance use disorders (A/SUD) receive evidenced-based treatment for both disorders, including psychological intervention for psychosis. However, the efficacy of such treatments for individuals with co-occurring psychosis and A/SUD is unclear.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions for psychosis were systematically reviewed, to investigate how alcohol and substance use has been accounted for across sample inclusion and secondary measures. Findings from trials including individuals with co-occurring alcohol or substance use issues were then narratively summarized using the Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis guidelines, to indicate the overall efficacy of psychological interventions for psychosis, for this comorbid population.

Study Results

Across the 131 trials identified, 60.3% of trials excluded individuals with alcohol or substance use issues. Additionally, only 6.1% measured alcohol or substance use at baseline, while only 2.3% measured alcohol or substance use as a secondary outcome. Across trials explicitly including individuals with alcohol or substance use issues, insufficient evidence was available to conclude the efficacy of any individual psychological intervention. However, preliminary findings suggest that psychoeducation (PE) and metacognitive therapy (MCT) may be proposed for further investigation.

Conclusion

Overall, co-occurring alcohol and substance use issues have been largely neglected across the recent RCTs of psychological interventions for psychosis; highlighting the challenges of making treatment decisions for these individuals using the current evidence base.

### A digital cognitive behavioral therapy program for adults with alcohol use disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^1141hrkv]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

This RCT provides support for the efficacy of digital CBT at increasing alcohol abstinence when provided with brief clinical support. The acceptance of digital therapeutics as a tool to address mental health and substance use issues has grown in the past decade, particularly during the COVID-19 era, yet many of the products marketed to address substance use lack research validation. While more work is needed to identify the optimal strategies for implementation in routine clinical practice, as well as patient characteristics that may moderate outcomes, these findings contribute further evidence that this digital CBT program provided with weekly clinical monitoring is an effective and appealing option for patients seeking help for AUD.

### Clinical practice guideline: assessment and treatment of adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders and problematic substance use (excluding tobacco) [^116inWws]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

College alcohol interventions and resources for problematic use — Access to care is highly variable across college settings within the United States, and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) created the College Alcohol Intervention Matrix (CollegeAIM), which lists individual-level and environmental-level strategies to address problematic alcohol use and provides resource links to training. Individual-level strategies with high effectiveness and low-to-mid-range costs include normative re-education, skills training with an alcohol focus and general life skills, brief motivational intervention, and personalized feedback intervention; an individual strategy with high effectiveness and higher cost is the multi-component education-focused program (MCEFP). Environmental-level strategies aim to change campus and community environments, educate the student body, and reduce alcohol availability, with CollegeAIM linking to more information about implementation; resources to support and educate parents of college students with problematic alcohol use have been developed by NIAAA and the Treatment Research Institute.

### Psychosocial interventions to reduce alcohol consumption in concurrent problem alcohol and illicit drug users [^112hg7YK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Problem alcohol use is common among illicit drug users and is associated with adverse health outcomes. It is also an important factor contributing to a poor prognosis among drug users with hepatitis C virus (HCV) as it impacts on progression to hepatic cirrhosis or opiate overdose in opioid users.

Objectives

To assess the effects of psychosocial interventions for problem alcohol use in illicit drug users (principally problem drug users of opiates and stimulants).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group trials register (June 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 11, June 2014), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2014); EMBASE (1974 to June 2014); CINAHL (1982 to June 2014); PsycINFO (1872 to June 2014) and the reference lists of eligible articles. We also searched: 1) conference proceedings (online archives only) of the Society for the Study of Addiction, International Harm Reduction Association, International Conference on Alcohol Harm Reduction and American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence; 2) online registers of clinical trials: Current Controlled Trials, Clinical Trials.org, Center Watch and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing psychosocial interventions with another therapy (other psychosocial treatment, including non-pharmacological therapies, or placebo) in adult (over the age of 18 years) illicit drug users with concurrent problem alcohol use.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Four studies, involving 594 participants, were included. Half of the trials were rated as having a high or unclear risk of bias. The studies considered six different psychosocial interventions grouped into four comparisons: (1) cognitive-behavioural coping skills training versus 12-step facilitation (one study; 41 participants), (2) brief intervention versus treatment as usual (one study; 110 participants), (3) group or individual motivational interviewing (MI) versus hepatitis health promotion (one study; 256 participants) and (4) brief motivational intervention (BMI) versus assessment-only (one study; 187 participants). Differences between studies precluded any data pooling. Findings are described for each trial individually. Comparison 1: low-quality evidence; no significant difference for any of the outcomes considered Alcohol abstinence as maximum number of weeks of consecutive alcohol abstinence during treatment: mean difference (MD) 0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.14 to 1.94); illicit drug abstinence as maximum number of weeks of consecutive abstinence from cocaine during treatment: MD 0.80 (95% CI -0.70 to 2.30); alcohol abstinence as number achieving three or more weeks of consecutive alcohol abstinence during treatment: risk ratio (RR) 1.96 (95% CI 0.43 to 8.94); illicit drug abstinence as number achieving three or more weeks of consecutive abstinence from cocaine during treatment: RR 1.10 (95% CI 0.42 to 2.88); alcohol abstinence during follow-up year: RR 2.38 (95% CI 0.10 to 55.06); illicit drug abstinence as abstinence from cocaine during follow-up year: RR 0.39 (95% CI 0.04 to 3.98), moderate-quality evidence. Comparison 2: low-quality evidence, no significant difference for all the outcomes considered Alcohol use as AUDIT scores at three months: MD 0.80 (95% -1.80 to 3.40); alcohol use as AUDIT scores at nine months: MD 2.30 (95% CI -0.58 to 5.18); alcohol use as number of drinks per week at three months: MD 0.70 (95% CI -3.85 to 5.25); alcohol use as number of drinks per week at nine months: MD -0.30 (95% CI -4.79 to 4.19); alcohol use as decreased alcohol use at three months: RR 1.13 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.93); alcohol use as decreased alcohol use at nine months: RR 1.34 (95% CI 0.69 to 2.58), moderate-quality evidence. Comparison 3 (group and individual MI), low-quality evidence: no significant difference for all outcomes Group MI: number of standard drinks consumed per day over the past month: MD -0.40 (95% CI -2.03 to 1.23); frequency of drug use: MD 0.00 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.03); composite drug score (frequency*severity for all drugs taken): MD 0.00 (95% CI -0.42 to 0.42); greater than 50% reduction in number of standard drinks consumed per day over the last 30 days: RR 1.10 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.48); abstinence from alcohol over the last 30 days: RR 0.88 (95% CI 0.49 to 1.58). Individual MI: number of standard drinks consumed per day over the past month: MD -0.10 (95% CI -1.89 to 1.69); frequency of drug use (as measured using the Addiction Severity Index (ASI drug): MD 0.00 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.03); composite drug score (frequency*severity for all drugs taken): MD -0.10 (95% CI -0.46 to 0.26); greater than 50% reduction in number of standard drinks consumed per day over the last 30 days: RR 0.92 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.26); abstinence from alcohol over the last 30 days: RR 0.97 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.67). Comparison 4: more people reduced alcohol use (by seven or more days in the past month at 6 months) in the BMI group than in the control group (RR 1.67; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.60), moderate-quality evidence. No significant difference was reported for all other outcomes: number of days in the past 30 days with alcohol use at one month: MD -0.30 (95% CI -3.38 to 2.78); number of days in the past month with alcohol use at six months: MD -1.50 (95% CI -4.56 to 1.56); 25% reduction of drinking days in the past month: RR 1.23 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.57); 50% reduction of drinking days in the past month: RR 1.27 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.68); 75% reduction of drinking days in the past month: RR 1.21 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.75); one or more drinking days' reduction in the past month: RR 1.12 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.38).

Authors' Conclusions

There is low-quality evidence to suggest that there is no difference in effectiveness between different types of interventions to reduce alcohol consumption in concurrent problem alcohol and illicit drug users and that brief interventions are not superior to assessment-only or to treatment as usual. No firm conclusions can be made because of the paucity of the data and the low quality of the retrieved studies.

### Advancing alcohol research and treatment: contentions and debates about treatment intensity, goals and outcomes in the 1970s and 1980s [^1119giu7]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

This narrative exploration of alcohol treatment research focuses on key contentions and advances in alcohol treatment during the critical 1970s and 1980s.

Methods

Papers and books which signal some of the major debates and advances in alcohol treatment research were selected from the 1970s and 1980s. The selection process was based on significant debate during this period, and included those that influenced the field in general and this author in particular.

Results

This was a period where challenges to traditional models and concepts, and the perceived universal need for long-term treatment, were accompanied by contention but also advances in research and treatment approaches. The debates and advances resonate today. These include the recognition that: intensive and long-term treatment is not always required; for dependent drinkers, relapse is a common treatment outcome meriting specific treatment approaches to prevent and reduce this risk; controlled drinking is a treatment option, especially for younger and less dependent drinkers; and an important contributor to enduring change is access to, and realization of, improvements in the quality of life.

Conclusions

Pioneering research and publications in the 1970s and 1980s, sometimes conducted and produced in contentious contexts, influenced significantly conceptualizations of alcohol-related problems, and laid the foundations for treatment hypotheses and research, improving access to a broader range of evidence-based treatment. These underpinning works influenced the development of stepped-up care from brief to intensive interventions, relapse prevention and treatment options not limited to abstinence, and they identified the need to include a stronger focus on quality of life.

### Treatment interventions to maintain abstinence from alcohol in primary care: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112W2q4U]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To determine the most effective interventions in recently detoxified, alcohol dependent patients for implementation in primary care.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data sources

Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.

Study selection

Randomised controlled trials comparing two or more interventions that could be used in primary care. The population was patients with alcohol dependency diagnosed by standardised clinical tools and who became detoxified within four weeks.

Data extraction

Outcomes of interest were continuous abstinence from alcohol (effectiveness) and all cause dropouts (as a proxy for acceptability) at least 12 weeks after start of intervention.

Results

64 trials (43 interventions) were included. The median probability of abstinence across placebo arms was 25%. Compared with placebo, the only intervention associated with increased probability of abstinence and moderate certainty evidence was acamprosate (odds ratio 1.86, 95% confidence interval 1.49 to 2.33, corresponding to an absolute probability of 38%). Of the 62 included trials that reported all cause dropouts, interventions associated with a reduced number of dropouts compared with placebo (probability 50%) and moderate certainty of evidence were acamprosate (0.73, 0.62 to 0.86; 42%), naltrexone (0.70, 0.50 to 0.98; 41%), and acamprosate-naltrexone (0.30, 0.13 to 0.67; 17%). Acamprosate was the only intervention associated with moderate confidence in the evidence of effectiveness and acceptability up to 12 months. It is uncertain whether other interventions can help maintain abstinence and reduce dropouts because of low confidence in the evidence.

Conclusions

Evidence is lacking for benefit from interventions that could be implemented in primary care settings for alcohol abstinence, other than for acamprosate. More evidence from high quality randomised controlled trials is needed, as are strategies using combined interventions (combinations of drug interventions or drug and psychosocial interventions) to improve treatment of alcohol dependency in primary care.

### Combined pharmacotherapies and behavioral interventions for alcohol dependence: the COMBINE study: a randomized controlled trial [^114zK4Ko]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Alcohol dependence treatment may include medications, behavioral therapies, or both. It is unknown how combining these treatments may impact their effectiveness, especially in the context of primary care and other nonspecialty settings.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of medication, behavioral therapies, and their combinations for treatment of alcohol dependence and to evaluate placebo effect on overall outcome.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized controlled trial conducted January 2001-January 2004 among 1383 recently alcohol-abstinent volunteers (median age, 44 years) from 11 US academic sites with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnoses of primary alcohol dependence.

Interventions

Eight groups of patients received medical management with 16 weeks of naltrexone (100 mg/d) or acamprosate (3 g/d), both, and/or both placebos, with or without a combined behavioral intervention (CBI). A ninth group received CBI only (no pills). Patients were also evaluated for up to 1 year after treatment.

Main Outcome Measures

Percent days abstinent from alcohol and time to first heavy drinking day.

Results

All groups showed substantial reduction in drinking. During treatment, patients receiving naltrexone plus medical management (n = 302), CBI plus medical management and placebos (n = 305), or both naltrexone and CBI plus medical management (n = 309) had higher percent days abstinent (80.6, 79.2, and 77.1, respectively) than the 75.1 in those receiving placebos and medical management only (n = 305), a significant naltrexone x behavioral intervention interaction (P = 0.009). Naltrexone also reduced risk of a heavy drinking day (hazard ratio, 0.72; 97.5% CI, 0.53–0.98; p = 0.02) over time, most evident in those receiving medical management but not CBI. Acamprosate showed no significant effect on drinking vs placebo, either by itself or with any combination of naltrexone, CBI, or both. During treatment, those receiving CBI without pills or medical management (n = 157) had lower percent days abstinent (66.6) than those receiving placebo plus medical management alone (n = 153) or placebo plus medical management and CBI (n = 156) (73.8 and 79.8, respectively; P < .001). One year after treatment, these between-group effects were similar but no longer significant.

Conclusions

Patients receiving medical management with naltrexone, CBI, or both fared better on drinking outcomes, whereas acamprosate showed no evidence of efficacy, with or without CBI. No combination produced better efficacy than naltrexone or CBI alone in the presence of medical management. Placebo pills and meeting with a health care professional had a positive effect above that of CBI during treatment. Naltrexone with medical management could be delivered in health care settings, thus serving alcohol-dependent patients who might otherwise not receive treatment.

### Project harmony: a meta-analysis with individual patient data on behavioral and pharmacologic trials for comorbid posttraumatic stress and alcohol or other drug use disorders [^114JRA4D]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Treatment efficacy for co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders is well established, yet direct evidence for comparative effectiveness across treatments is lacking. The present study compared the effectiveness of several behavioral and pharmacological therapies for adults with co-occurring PTSD and alcohol or other drug use disorders.

Methods

A systematic search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted through December 2020 for trials targeting PTSD, alcohol or other drug use disorders, or both disorders (36 studies, N = 4,046). Primary outcomes were severity scores for PTSD, alcohol use, and drug use, estimated via moderated nonlinear factor analysis. Propensity score weight-adjusted multilevel models were used. Model-predicted effect sizes were estimated for each treatment, and comparative effect sizes for each active arm against treatment as usual, at end of treatment and at 12-month follow-up.

Results

Compared with treatment as usual, combining trauma-focused therapy and pharmacotherapy for substance use disorders showed the largest comparative effect sizes for PTSD severity (d = -0.92, 95% CI = -1.57, -0.30) and alcohol use severity (d = -1.10, 95% CI = -1.54, -0.68) at end of treatment. Other treatments with large comparative effect sizes included pharmacotherapies for alcohol or other drug use disorders, trauma-focused integrated therapies, and trauma-focused nonintegrated therapies. Reductions in outcomes for PTSD symptoms and alcohol use were observed for nearly all treatments.

Conclusions

The findings provide support for treating comorbid PTSD and substance use disorders using a variety of approaches, with alcohol-targeted pharmacotherapies and trauma-focused behavioral therapies as a combination of treatments that lead to early and sustained improvements in PTSD and alcohol use severity. Further treatment development is indicated for combining behavioral and pharmacological treatments for synergized impact and understanding the mechanisms of action and conditions under which each treatment type is optimized.

### Topiramate pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder and other addictions: a narrative review [^113aGMEe]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Topiramate is a non-benzodiazepine anticonvulsant medication with multi-faceted pharmacologic action. It has emerged as an efficacious pharmacotherapeutic option for the treatment of addiction, especially alcohol use disorder (AUD). We present a broad narrative review of the putative mechanism of action and clinical utility of topiramate with regard to AUD and other substance use disorders. Collective evidence suggests topiramate is an effective treatment option in AUD, with notable efficacy in reducing harmful drinking patterns in AUD. Though not currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the indication of AUD, topiramate should be considered as a pharmacological treatment option with high utility among AUD patients. Early pharmacogenetic studies raise the intriguing possibility of identifying patients likely to respond to topiramate using genetic testing, and initial studies show that topiramate may also be useful in treating cocaine use disorder, smoking cessation and behavioral addictions. However, further research is needed in all these areas.

### Managed alcohol as a harm reduction intervention for alcohol addiction in populations at high risk for substance abuse [^111Fe16i]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Managed alcohol programmes (MAP) are a harm reduction strategy used to minimise the personal harm and adverse societal effects that alcohol dependence can lead to by providing an alternative to zero-tolerance approaches that incorporate drinking goals (abstinence or moderation) that are compatible with the needs of the individual, and promoting access to services by offering low-threshold alternatives. This enables clients to gain access to services despite continued alcohol consumption and works to help the patient understand the risks involved in their behaviour and make decisions about their own treatment goals.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of MAP treatment regimens (serving limited quantities of alcohol daily to alcoholics) on their own or as compared to moderate drinking (self-controlled drinking), screening and brief intervention using a harm reduction approach, traditional abstinence-based interventions (12 step programmes) and no intervention.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO up to March 2012. This search was expanded by handsearching of high-yield journals and conference proceedings that had not already been handsearched on behalf of The Cochrane Collaboration, searching reference lists of all papers and relevant reviews identified, references to ongoing and recently completed clinical trials in the National Research Register and IFPMA Clinical Trials Database (which contains ClinicalTrials.gov, Centerwatch, Current Controlled Trials and ClinicalStudyResults.gov, and Osservatorio Nazionale sulla Sperimentazione Clinica dei Medicinali). Trials registers, grey literature and reference lists were also searched. Individuals, organisations and experts in the field were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised control trials (RCT), controlled clinical trials (CCT), interrupted time series (ITS) studies, and control before and after (CBA) studies involving vulnerable people aged 18 years or older who were at high risk for alcohol abuse attending MAP, defined as a structured programme that provided clients with controlled amounts of alcohol on a daily schedule, comparing no treatment, moderate drinking, brief intervention or 12-step variants.

Data Collection and Analysis

All study citations were collated into a single database. Two review author independently screened titles and abstracts and selected references potentially relevant to the review. Differences between selection lists were resolved by discussion. Two review authors independently evaluated whether studies should be included or excluded according to the eligibility criteria. In the event of a disagreement, a third author was consulted.

Main Results

No studies were included in the review. This systematic review was intended to assess the effectiveness of a brief MAP on the reduction of incidence of harmful behaviour; however, no evidence was available to make this comparison; 22 articles were considered possibly relevant and all were excluded. Most articles were excluded because they failed to compare or consider managed alcohol as the experimental or control intervention, as well as one study (Baker 2010), which was also excluded because study participants were under 18 years of age. No study reviewed offered an intervention that was compared with managed alcohol or considered it as the intervention of interest, providing insufficient evidence to address the objectives of the review. Four studies (Aalto 2001; Baker 2010; Bertholet 2005; Tracy 2007) considered alcohol reduction as an outcome of interest, while four engaged interventions in a shelter setting or targeted vulnerable people (Baker 2010; Bradford 2005; Lapham 1993; McGlynn 1993); only one study (Kidd 2011) offered a qualitative assessment of a participant being admitted to MAP, but offered no analysis of the programme itself. These results accurately reflect the use of MAPs in current practice as existing programmes are ongoing only in a small number of sample pilot projects that target individuals with severe alcohol dependence or who consume non-beverage alcohol.

Authors' Conclusions

The lack of evidence does not allow for a conclusion regarding the efficacy of MAP on their own, or as compared to brief intervention, moderate drinking, no intervention or 12-step variants. It is the review authors' opinion that it is likely to be the objective of MAPs that reduce their reportability and use in current practice, rather than a failure to provide an intervention that reduces the effects of alcohol dependence. Aiming to reduce harmful or antisocial behaviour in vulnerable individuals through the regulation of daily alcohol intake, rather than reducing harmful alcohol intake over time, provides considerable difficulty in developing measures of success from self-reported data (low treatment thresholds), monitoring long-term efficacy or establishing causal links between programme admission and a reduction in targeted behaviours, owing to the fact that prolonged participation in the programme is likely to indicate a willingness in the individual to change their behaviour patterns. More effort is needed to develop reporting measures, as well as methodologies, which address these specific challenges.

### Current status of co-occurring mood and substance use disorders: a new therapeutic target [^112fD53R]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Mood and substance use disorders commonly co-occur, yet there is little evidence-based research to guide the pharmacologic management of these comorbid disorders. The authors review the existing empirical findings, some of which may call into question current clinical pharmacotherapy practices for treating co-occurring mood and substance use disorders. The authors also highlight knowledge gaps that can serve as a basis for future research. The specific mood disorders reviewed are bipolar and major depressive disorders (either one co-occurring with a substance use disorder). Overall, findings from the relatively small amount of available data indicate that pharmacotherapy for managing mood symptoms can be effective in patients with substance dependence, although results have not been consistent across all studies. Also, in most studies, medications for managing mood symptoms did not appear to have an impact on the substance use disorder. In a recent trial for comorbid major depression and alcohol dependence, combination treatment with a medication for depression and another for alcohol dependence was found to reduce depressive symptoms and excessive drinking simultaneously. However, research has only begun to address optimal pharmacologic management of co-occurring disorders. In addition, current clinical treatment for alcohol and drug dependence often excludes new pharmacotherapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating certain types of addiction. With new data becoming available, it appears that we need to revisit current practice in the pharmacological management of co-occurring mood and substance use disorders.

### Excessive alcohol use and alcohol use disorders: a policy brief of the American College of Physicians [^114zMkdX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Alcohol is used by more people in the United States than tobacco, electronic nicotine delivery systems, or illicit drugs. Several health conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and liver disease, are associated with excessive alcohol use and alcohol use disorder. Nearly 30 million people aged 12 years or older in the United States reported past-year alcohol use disorder in 2022, but-despite its prevalence-alcohol use disorder is undertreated. In this policy brief, the American College of Physicians outlines the health effects of excessive alcohol use and alcohol use disorder, calls for policy changes to increase the availability of treatment of alcohol use disorder and excessive alcohol use, and recommends alcohol-related public health interventions.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^115B94p7]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — AUD treatment initiation and engagement (Recommendation IV.12) states that when feasible, alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment should be initiated concurrently with alcohol withdrawal management as cognitive status permits. Clinicians should offer to initiate pharmacotherapy for AUD as cognitive status permits, explain the range of evidence-based treatment services available in the community, and engage patients with these options, and may offer information about local recovery support groups, including 12-step groups. To the fullest extent possible, patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal management should be engaged, if not initiated, in treatment for AUD as soon as cognitive status permits, and this engagement should be considered part of the withdrawal management process and should not be delayed until withdrawal management is complete. Motivational interviewing or enhancement, delivered in primary care settings, has been demonstrated to reduce alcohol and other drug use and to help engage patients in AUD treatment. Regular follow-up visits at least monthly for a year in Level 1-WM settings may increase chances of continued recovery, although the Guideline Committee did not find strong evidence to support this statement.

### A digital cognitive behavioral therapy program for adults with alcohol use disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^1144pVHg]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based treatment for alcohol use, yet patient access is limited and may be enhanced through digital therapeutics.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of a digital CBT program (Computer-Based Training for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT4CBT]) or clinician-delivered CBT compared with standard treatment for reducing alcohol use.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A 3-arm randomized clinical trial was conducted at outpatient substance use treatment facilities in Connecticut between February 14, 2017, and December 31, 2021, that included an 8-week treatment period with a 6-month follow-up period. Treatment-seeking adults were included who met criteria for current alcohol use disorder and reported drinking at least 14 (men) or 7 (women) drinks per week in the past month and were sufficiently stable for outpatient treatment.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the following groups: (1) treatment as usual (TAU) consisting of weekly group or individual counseling, (2) CBT delivered weekly by trained and fidelity-monitored clinicians, or (3) web-based CBT plus brief weekly clinical monitoring.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Rates of alcohol use were measured weekly during the treatment period and at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up using the timeline follow-back method. The primary outcome was the percentage of days abstinent (PDA) from alcohol per month. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted.

Results

Of the 99 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 45.5 [12.7]), 66 were male (66.7%); 39 identified as Black/African American (39.8%), 19 (19.2%) as Hispanic, and 47 (48.0%) as White. Mean (SD) rates of PDA from baseline to 6-month follow-up were 49.3% (27.8%) to 69.6% (34.4%) for TAU; 53.7% (29.8%) to 70.2% (35.1%) for CBT; and 47.6% (31.8%) to 82.6% (25.3%) for digital CBT. Results of random-effects regression showed a significant increase in PDA during the study period, with those assigned to digital CBT increasing PDA at a faster rate than TAU (t₇₃₃ = 2.55; p = 0.01) and CBT (t₇₃₃ = 3.36; P < .001). However, there was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups during the 8-week treatment period.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, while there was no significant difference between treatment groups during the 8-week treatment period, there was differential change between treatments during the 8-month study period that provides support for the efficacy of this digital CBT program.

### High-versus low-intensity internet interventions for alcohol use disorders: results of a three-armed randomized controlled superiority trial [^1166sDcK]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Internet interventions can be conceptualized in two main ways: public health‐oriented low‐intensity internet interventions (LIII) characterized by brief treatment content and minimal or no therapist contact, and clinically oriented high‐intensity internet interventions (HIII) characterized by extensive treatment content akin to bibliotherapy and guidance by an active therapist 8. The central argument for the low‐intensity concept has been its potential to radically increase treatment accessibility to the public at a small cost, while the main argument for the high‐intensity concept has been increase of patient access to manual‐based therapy while minimizing therapist time. Although internet interventions targeting alcohol problems are not new 9, most have been LIII, typically single‐module 'brief interventions' 10 aimed at undiagnosed individuals with hazardous, rather than severe, drinking problems 11. HIII have been extensively studied for depression and anxiety, and with meta‐analyses showing no differences in outcome between these interventions and face‐to‐face therapy 12 these interventions have been successfully implemented within psychiatric care in several countries 13. However, studies investigating HIII for people with alcohol problems, especially among those with levels of severity similar to the population seen in clinics (i.e. individuals with AUD), are rare 11. Two studies on alcohol problems directly compared a cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) internet program with and without therapist guidance 14, 15. In both, groups receiving therapist guidance reported significantly lower alcohol consumption at varying follow‐ups compared to the group not receiving therapist guidance, with small and medium differential effect sizes respectively. In a third study, a CBT internet program with therapist guidance was compared to a waiting‐list, rendering large between‐group effect sizes 16. An important limitation of these studies is the absence of interview‐based diagnostic assessments, hampering generalizations to the AUD population 11. Another limitation is that none of the studies investigated negative effects, a critical but neglected component when evaluating internet interventions 17.

We conducted a randomized controlled trial among individuals with AUD to compare the effects of a HIII compared with a LIII and a waiting‐list (WL). We hypothesized that:
participants in HIII would have reduced their alcohol consumption more than participants in LIII at a 6‐month follow‐up (primary end‐point); and
participants in HIII and LIII would have reduced their alcohol consumption more than participants in WL at post‐treatment (treatment response).

A secondary aim was to evaluate negative effects of the internet interventions.

Regarding medical management for alcohol use disorder, more specifically with respect to acamprosate, APA 2018 guidelines recommend to consider offering acamprosate in patients with moderate-to-severe AUD with a goal of reducing alcohol consumption or achieving abstinence, preferring pharmacotherapy or not responding to nonpharmacological treatments alone, and not having contraindications to acamprosate.

Alcohol use disorder pharmacotherapy — recommendation for moderate-severe AUD states: "we recommend offering one of the following medications: - Naltrexone (oral or extended-release) - Topiramate" with "(Strong for | Not reviewed, Amended)". Evidence notes that "Two RCTs (183, 184) and three SRs/meta-analyses (185–187) showed moderate quality evidence that naltrexone and topiramate improved alcohol consumption outcomes for the treatment of AUD". Use guidance specifies that "These medications should be offered in conjunction with a psychosocial intervention and after considering the preferences of appropriately informed patients", that "Dosing of these pharmacotherapies should be consistent with medication trials and published recommendations", and that "In the absence of contraindications, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine use of one of these medications over another; therefore, treatment should be individualized considering patient preferences and history".

### Comparative effectiveness of digital versus face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy for alcohol use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112wc3MB]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the encouraging results, this review has several limitations that must be acknowledged. First, the number of studies directly comparing digital and face-to-face CBT was limited, and the evidence base showed substantial heterogeneity. The digital interventions evaluated varied considerably in format (e.g. web-based modules, smartphone apps, and therapist-guided vs. fully automated programs) and intensity, while the face-to-face CBT interventions also differed in session number, duration, and whether they included adjunct techniques (e.g. motivational enhancement). This variability introduces uncertainty when generalizing our findings – all digital CBT programs and traditional CBT implementations are not identical (Sundström et al.). Second, outcomes were often measured via self-report (e.g. self-reported drinks per week or days of use), which can be prone to bias such as underreporting due to social desirability or recall errors (Tait & Christensen). Although such measures are standard in alcohol research, future studies should, where possible, include objective or corroborative measures (e.g. biomarker indicators of alcohol use) to strengthen confidence in the results. Third, the follow-up duration posed a challenge in many studies. Most trials assessed outcomes immediately post-treatment or at short-term follow-ups (e.g. 3 or 6 months). Thus, whether the observed reductions – especially those achieved via digital CBT – are maintained in the long term (12 months or beyond) remains unclear. Recent 2-year follow-up findings by Sundström et al. suggest that higher-intensity digital CBT programs yield more durable effects, underscoring the need to calibrate digital interventions beyond minimal contact models. Some prior data suggest that the effects of brief interventions can diminish over time (Kaner et al.), so ongoing engagement or booster sessions (digital or in-person) might be necessary to sustain gains. Additionally, there may be a selection bias in who chooses digital versus in-person therapy. Participants who enroll in digital programs might differ in motivation or severity from those in face-to-face therapy (e.g. those with very severe AUD or comorbid mental health conditions might be underrepresented in digital trials) (Tait & Christensen). This could influence outcome patterns, limiting the direct comparability of groups. Finally, while our review focused on alcohol consumption metrics, we did not comprehensively examine other important outcomes such as psychosocial functioning, quality of life, or adverse events; differences in these dimensions between digital and face-to-face CBT must be explored.

### Behavioral therapies for drug abuse [^116DLmYt]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The past three decades have been marked by tremendous progress in behavioral therapies for drug abuse and dependence, as well as advances in the conceptualization of approaches to development of behavioral therapies. Cognitive behavior therapy, contingency management, couples and family therapy, and a variety of other types of behavioral treatment have been shown to be potent interventions for several forms of drug addiction, and scientific progress has also been greatly facilitated by the articulation of a systematic approach to the development, evaluation, and dissemination of behavioral therapies. The authors review recent progress in strategies for the development of behavioral therapies for drug and alcohol abuse and dependence and discuss the range of effective behavioral therapies that are currently available.

### Alcoholics anonymous and other 12-step programmes for alcohol dependence [^1123rjhC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international organization of recovering alcoholics that offers emotional support through self-help groups and a model of abstinence for people recovering from alcohol dependence, using a 12-step approach. Although it is the most common, AA is not the only 12-step intervention available there are other 12-step approaches (labelled Twelve Step Facilitation (TSF)).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of AA or TSF programmes compared to other psychosocial interventions in reducing alcohol intake, achieving abstinence, maintaining abstinence, improving the quality of life of affected people and their families, and reducing alcohol associated accidents and health problems.

Search Strategy

We searched the Specialized Register of Trials of the Cochrane Group on Drugs and Alcohol, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE from 1966, EMBASE from 1980, CINAHL from 1982, PsychINFO from 1967. Searches were updated in February 2005. We also inspected lists of references for relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

Studies involving adults (< 18) of both genders with alcohol dependence attending on a voluntary or coerced basis AA or TSF programmes comparing no treatment, other psychological interventions, 12-step variants.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer (MF) assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data using a pre-defined data extraction form. Studies were evaluated for methodological quality and discussed by all reviewers.

Main Results

Eight trials involving 3417 people were included. AA may help patients to accept treatment and keep patients in treatment more than alternative treatments, though the evidence for this is from one small study that combined AA with other interventions and should not be regarded as conclusive. Other studies reported similar retention rates regardless of treatment group. Three studies compared AA combined with other interventions against other treatments and found few differences in the amount of drinks and percentage of drinking days. Severity of addiction and drinking consequence did not seem to be differentially influenced by TSF versus comparison treatment interventions, and no conclusive differences in treatment drop out rates were reported. Included studies did not allow a conclusive assessment of the effect of TSF in promoting complete abstinence.

Authors' Conclusions

No experimental studies unequivocally demonstrated the effectiveness of AA or TSF approaches for reducing alcohol dependence or problems. One large study focused on the prognostic factors associated with interventions that were assumed to be successful rather than on the effectiveness of interventions themselves, so more efficacy studies are needed.

### Combined pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for adults with alcohol or substance use disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116zv8wS]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first targeted meta-analysis of CBT in combination with pharmacotherapy for adults with AUD and other SUDs to summarize the data in a manner relevant to clinical practice guidelines. Furthermore, we provided pooled effect size estimates by consumption outcome type and outcome point. Most of these subgroup estimates showed acceptable homogeneity, which suggests that the selected variables were informative effect-size modifiers for the sample of clinical trials reviewed. In the present study, a small and statistically significant effect size was observed across outcome type and time for CBT combined with pharmacotherapy when compared with usual care combined with pharmacotherapy. For context in interpreting this effect, meta-analyses among this patient population generally show effect sizes that are in the small-to-moderate range, and this includes effect sizes for pharmacological interventions. This contrast suggests that prescribing clinicians should favor CBT over usual care to improve clinical outcomes for addiction, in the context of pharmacotherapy.

The second subgroup contrast was combined CBT and pharmacotherapy compared with another specific therapy combined with pharmacotherapy. Here, results suggested no unique benefit of adding CBT to pharmacotherapy compared with other evidence-based behavioral modalities. Such modalities may include contingency management, motivation enhancement therapy, 12-step facilitation, and interpersonal therapy, all of which have received some level of empirical support for addiction, including meta-analytic support at various follow-up periods. The lack of superiority of CBT over other evidence-based behavioral treatment for addiction is consistent with our recent findings, and this meta-analysis extends this result to combined pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatments. Although there may be evidence of some advantage for contingency management, removal of contingency management trials in this review did not change our substantive conclusions. This suggests that CBT is not superior to other evidence-based behavioral treatments for addiction, yet when combined with the aforementioned superiority to usual care, we suggest that clinicians favor an evidence-based behavioral therapy, CBT or otherwise, in conjunction with pharmacological treatments.

### Medications for alcohol use disorder… [^117R7DH4]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

A systematic review of 27 studies including 7, 519 patients using acamprosate showed a number needed to treat of 12 to prevent a return to any drinking. 9 A Cochrane review of 24 trials including 6, 915 patients concluded that acamprosate reduced drinking compared with placebo. 16 One randomized trial found no difference between acamprosate and placebo, although outcomes improved significantly in both groups. This may be because enrolled patients were highly motivated to decrease alcohol use, increasing the likelihood of success with any treatment.
17. One trial randomized 243 patients to naltrexone, acamprosate, or disulfiram with supervision over 12 weeks and determined that patients taking disulfiram had fewer heavy drinking days, lower weekly consumption, and a longer period of abstinence compared with the other drugs.

18 However, a 2014 meta-analysis of 22 randomized trials found that in open-label studies, disulfiram was more effective than naltrexone, acamprosate, and no disulfiram, but blinded studies did not demonstrate benefit for disulfiram. Naltrexone. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, reduces alcohol consumption in patients with AUD, and is more successful in those who are abstinent before starting the medication. 8 The opioid receptor system mediates the pleasurable effects of alcohol. Alcohol ingestion stimulates endogenous opioid release and increases dopamine transmission. Naltrexone blocks these effects, reducing euphoria and cravings. 20 Naltrexone is available in oral and injectable long-acting formulations. A Cochrane review that included 50 randomized trials and 7, 793 patients found that oral naltrexone decreased heavy drinking and slightly decreased daily drinking. The number of heavy drinking days and the amount of alcohol consumed also decreased.

Injectable naltrexone did not decrease heavy drinking, but the sample size was small. Ondansetron. Ondansetron may decrease alcohol consumption in patients with AUD. In three studies, ondansetron combined with cognitive behavior therapy decreased alcohol consumption and cravings and increased abstinence in young adults with early AUD. 39–41 In another trial, a higher dosage of ondansetron combined with cognitive behavior therapy decreased depression, anxiety, and hostility.

### Sobering perspectives on the treatment of alcohol use disorder… [^115PtTqg]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Treatment options for the 30 million individuals with alcohol use disorder 4 in the US include behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapy. Naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram are 3 approved drugs for treating AUD. Since disulfiram works only through aversive effects, with no impact on the desire to drink, it tends to work best in supervised settings and with highly motivated patients with strong social supports. 5 A recent systematic review suggested the number-needed-to-treat to prevent 1 person from returning to drinking was 11 for acamprosate and 18 for oral naltrexone. 1 Naltrexone use, in addition, was associated with a substantial decrease in heavy drinking. 1 Moreover, these drugs are well tolerated by patients with minimal side effects. In this population-based study, Bernstein et al7 report on MAUD prescribing to Medicare patients with alcohol-related hospitalizations.

7 In a propensity score–matched analysis, receipt of a prescription for either naltrexone, acamprosate, or disulfiram was associated with a 42% lower risk of all-cause mortality or hospital readmission within the next month. 7 Roughly 6 patients would need to fill a prescription for MAUD to prevent 1 repeat emergency visit or hospital admission within a month. The substantial effect size was primarily driven by reductions in all-cause rehospitalization. This study provides an estimate of the effect of prescribing MAUD to patients following an alcohol-related hospitalization. The results also reaffirm the underuse of MAUD: among the nearly 10 000 admitted patients eligible for study inclusion, only 1 in 50 filled a discharge prescription. 7 This low rate of use is consistent with past studies.

6, 8 However, the infrequency of prescriptions raises questions about the external generalizability and the extent to which the dramatic reduction in subsequent use of acute care services reflects the effects of MAUD alone. An important question is how the results of this study should influence clinical practice. Despite its methodological shortcomings, this study by Bernstein et al7 highlights the benefits of prescribing MAUD at hospital discharge — benefits consistent with those seen in clinical trials. 1 In addition, the study provides a compelling argument for clinicians to offer MAUD to all hospitalized patients with AUD. 7 During a hospitalization, patients experience health vulnerability which may drive behavior change. Implementation of a discharge pathway for patients with AUD on internal medicine wards was associated with substantially increased prescribing. 14.

### Patient information: treatment of alcohol use disorder… [^112jNXnX]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The severity of AUD ranges from mild to severe, and symptoms have the potential for recurrence and remission. No matter how severe the disorder is, individuals can benefit from treatment. To diagnose AUD, a doctor performs a face-to-face evaluation, assessment of symptoms, and review of medical history, and obtains information from family members if applicable. The doctor conducts a diagnostic evaluation for any co-occurring mental health conditions. People with AUD have a higher rate of anxiety and depressive disorders than those without AUD. Treatment for AUD can vary depending on individual goals. In general, the goals of AUD treatment are to reduce and manage symptoms and improve health and functioning. People commonly think of "rehab, " a 28-day residential program, for AUD treatment. However, most people do not need or benefit from 28-day residential treatment.

Advances have led to evidence-based treatments that are less intensive and can be accessed through a primary care physician or mental health clinic. Components of effective treatment include medications and behavioral treatments, ideally in combination. Community mutual-aid groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous can also help support a person's goals, but peer support groups are not meant to replace formal medical treatment. Three medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for AUD. These medications are nonaddictive and are designed to help manage disease. Medication may not be effective or necessary for everyone with AUD, but as part of a personalized treatment plan, they can help an individual meet their goals. Naltrexone has been proven to reduce heavy drinking days and help promote abstinence. It can also help manage cravings to drink for some people. It is a once-daily pill or once-monthly injection.

Acamprosate has been proven to reduce heavy drinking and maintain abstinence once someone is already sober. It can also help manage cravings in some people. Disulfiram blocks the breakdown of alcohol in the body and causes unpleasant symptoms such as nausea if alcohol is consumed. These symptoms can help some people not to drink alcohol. Several evidence-based psychotherapy options exist for AUD. One is cognitive behavior therapy, which focuses on the relationships among thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to help manage urges and triggers. This therapy can also address co-occurring mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression. There is no one-size-fits-all treatment that works for everyone. What is effective for one person may not be a good fit for someone else. The decision to get treatment is often more important than the type of treatment used.

### Medications for treating alcohol dependence… [^1149ZLqT]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and activate γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors, and was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of alcohol dependence. A systematic review 10 of 15 studies showed that acamprosate reduces short-term and long-term relapse rates in patients with alcohol dependence when combined with psychosocial treatments. Outcomes in favor of acamprosate included fewer patients returning to drinking and higher percentage of days of total abstinence.
10. Serotonergic Agents Research into the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors to treat patients with alcohol dependence has been under way for the past decade; however, most of this work has used small samples and inconsistent outcome measures. One clinical trial. 3 ondansetron was shown to significantly reduce self-reported drinking.

Patients who received ondansetron 4 mcg per kg twice per day had fewer drinks per day. They also had a greater percentage of days of abstinence and a greater total number of days abstinent per study week in patients with early-onset alcoholism. All patients also received weekly group cognitive behavior therapy. In a 12-week double-blind RCT 4 of actively drinking patients with alcohol dependence, topiramate was more effective than placebo in initiating abstinence and in reducing self-reported drinks per day, drinks per drinking day, and heavy drinking days. Compared with placebo, it also significantly reduced craving as measured on an obsessive-compulsive–drinking scale. These findings occurred in patients with early-onset and late-onset alcoholism. 21to significantly reduce relapse to heavy drinking in outpatients with alcohol dependence.

Patients receiving nalmefene had a 37 percent relapse rate compared with 59 percent in the placebo group. However, treatment groups did not differ significantly in the percentage of days abstinent, in the mean number of drinks consumed in a drinking day, or in self-reported craving ratings. This 12-week study 21 also provided weekly cognitive behavior therapy to all groups. Outside of research, nalmefene is available only in an injectable form.
