## Question

ECMO (early and late)
steroid role + dosing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role and dosing of corticosteroids in ARDS, with attention to timing, ECMO context (early and late), COVID-19, and safety. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching guideline stance on corticosteroids in ARDS. Then, I should verify the evidence base and quantify benefits and harms. Next, I will examine timing and agent selection, including COVID-19-specific regimens. After that, I need to consider the ECMO context and whether steroids change outcomes. Finally, I should review safety, tapering, and special populations, and close with a practical, risk-stratified recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the guideline position so I don't jump to conclusions: the 2024 American Thoracic Society (ATS) guideline issues a conditional recommendation to use corticosteroids for adult ARDS, reflecting moderate certainty of benefit, while acknowledging heterogeneity in regimens and uncertainty about the optimal agent, dose, and duration, which means the recommendation is supportive but not prescriptive about a single protocol [^113krQRy] [^112FpHoD] [^113crMig].

> I need to check the magnitude and nature of benefit to anchor dosing choices; pooled analyses and contemporary guidelines suggest corticosteroids reduce mortality by roughly 8% and shorten mechanical ventilation by about 7 days in ARDS, with signals consistent across agents and durations, though the certainty varies and heterogeneity persists, which supports a pragmatic, risk-tailored approach rather than a one-size-fits-all regimen [^113Ysm1S] [^113kj1vd] [^1147BbZ9].

> Now, timing and agent selection: I should confirm that early initiation is favored and that dexamethasone has the most robust mortality signal in COVID-19 ARDS, whereas methylprednisolone has pharmacologic advantages in lung tissue penetration and NF-κB inhibition that some experts prefer for non-COVID ARDS; importantly, starting steroids after about 14 days may be harmful, so I need to ensure we avoid late initiation unless there is a compelling, etiology-specific rationale [^111MWn4t] [^116Qftbs] [^113crMig].

> For COVID-19 ARDS, let me verify the exact regimen: multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on dexamethasone 6 mg IV or orally daily for up to 10 days or until discharge, with strong recommendations in critically ill patients including those on invasive ventilation or ECMO; if dexamethasone is unavailable, equivalent doses of hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone are acceptable, but dexamethasone has the most consistent mortality benefit signal in RCTs and meta-analyses [^113eXsgS] [^112acsYP] [^111MWn4t] [^113SaJmd].

> For non-COVID ARDS, I should double-check the methylprednisolone protocol endorsed by SCCM/ESICM: 1 mg/kg/day IV for early ARDS (within about 14 days), and for persistent ARDS beyond day 6, 2 mg/kg/day with a slow taper over roughly 13 days to mitigate rebound inflammation; this approach balances anti-inflammatory potency with the risk of adverse effects and aligns with data showing faster disease resolution when started early [^115PB789] [^113MTYRF] [^111FWM4s].

> Wait, let me verify the ECMO context because I recall conflicting signals: some observational COVID-19 cohorts suggested worse outcomes with corticosteroids around the time of ECMO, but this likely reflects selection bias for more refractory disease and evolving patient mix rather than true harm from steroids; in contrast, high-volume centers and emulated target trials show survival with ECMO in COVID-19 ARDS comparable to non-COVID ARDS, and pre-ECMO dexamethasone has been associated with lower mortality in some models, so I should not withhold indicated steroids solely due to ECMO [^111jRMwd] [^111aiuRS] [^114TGRdw] [^1111FZtd] [^113iCVec].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical approach on ECMO: continue guideline-concordant corticosteroids for the underlying ARDS etiology, typically dexamethasone 6 mg daily for COVID-19 or methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day for non-COVID ARDS, while maintaining vigilance for secondary infections and ensuring lung-protective, ultra-low tidal volume ventilation on ECMO; if there is no improvement and infection is excluded, a carefully selected subset may benefit from a second steroid course, but that remains low-certainty and should be individualized [^111FWM4s] [^113eXsgS] [^113vbdPt].

> I need to ensure safety is front and center: corticosteroids increase risks of hyperglycemia, secondary infections, and neuromuscular weakness, and initiation after day 14 may worsen outcomes, so I should screen for infections, monitor glucose closely, minimize or avoid concomitant neuromuscular blockade when possible, and taper slowly rather than stop abruptly; in immunocompromised patients or those in TB-endemic regions, I should be particularly cautious and tailor the regimen to risk [^113crMig] [^113crMig] [^115PB789].

> Let me reconsider the tapering question because abrupt cessation can cause rebound: SCCM/ESICM advises a slow taper over 6–14 days, and some protocols extend up to 4 weeks, especially after prolonged high-dose therapy; practically, many clinicians align steroid discontinuation with extubation when feasible, but if the course is prolonged, a deliberate taper mitigates relapse of inflammation and ventilator dependence [^115PB789] [^116Qftbs] [^113crMig].

> But wait, what if the ARDS phenotype is steroid-responsive beyond classic COVID-19 or community-acquired pneumonia; I should confirm that organizing pneumonia and other fibroproliferative processes can mimic refractory ARDS and may respond to steroids, so in non-resolving cases with negative infectious workup, a therapeutic trial of methylprednisolone may be reasonable, ideally guided by imaging and clinical trajectory [^113crMig] [^113vbdPt].

> Putting this together, my practical recommendation is as follows: for COVID-19 ARDS, use dexamethasone 6 mg daily IV or PO for up to 10 days or until discharge; for non-COVID ARDS, use methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day IV for early disease and 2 mg/kg/day with a slow taper for persistent ARDS, ideally initiated within 7–14 days; avoid starting after day 14 unless there is a compelling, etiology-specific rationale; continue steroids on ECMO if indicated by the underlying ARDS, monitor closely for infections and hyperglycemia, and taper gradually to reduce rebound risk [^113eXsgS] [^115PB789] [^113Ysm1S] [^111FWM4s].

---

Corticosteroids are recommended in ARDS [^113Ysm1S] because they reduce mortality [^1147BbZ9] and shorten mechanical ventilation [^113kj1vd]; **early initiation** (within 7 days) is preferred [^115PB789]. For early ARDS, use methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day (max 80 mg/day) for 7–14 days with a **slow taper** [^111FWM4s]; for late/persistent ARDS (after day 7), use 2 mg/kg/day (max 160 mg/day) for 7–14 days with a taper [^115PB789]. Dexamethasone 20 mg/day for 5 days, then 10 mg/day for 5 days, is an alternative [^1147BbZ9]. In COVID-19 ARDS, use dexamethasone 6 mg/day for up to 10 days [^113eXsgS] [^111MWn4t]. On ECMO, continue low-to-moderate dose steroids [^113eXsgS] and avoid high-dose pulses unless refractory; monitor for infection, hyperglycemia, and neuromuscular complications [^115PB789] [^111CNZvz] [^112FpHoD].

## Clinical evidence supporting corticosteroid use in ARDS

Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show that corticosteroids improve outcomes in ARDS [^1147BbZ9] — reducing mortality and shortening mechanical ventilation [^113kj1vd] — with **early initiation** providing the greatest benefit [^115PB789].

---

## Timing of corticosteroid administration

Early administration (within 7 days of ARDS onset) is associated with improved survival and faster resolution [^115PB789], whereas **late initiation** (after day 14) may increase harm, including infections and neuromuscular complications [^112xcvUS] [^113crMig].

## Recommended corticosteroid regimens

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended corticosteroid regimen** | **Duration and tapering** |
|-|-|-|
| Early ARDS (≤ 7 days) | Methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day (max 80 mg/day) | 7–14 days, then slow taper over 13 days [^115PB789] [^111FWM4s] |
| Late/persistent ARDS (> 7 days) | Methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day (max 160 mg/day) | 7–14 days, then slow taper over 13 days [^115PB789] [^111FWM4s] |
| Alternative regimen | Dexamethasone 20 mg/day for 5 days, then 10 mg/day for 5 days | Total 10 days, no taper required [^1147BbZ9] |
| COVID-19 ARDS | Dexamethasone 6 mg/day | Up to 10 days or until discharge [^113eXsgS] [^111MWn4t] |

## Role of corticosteroids in ECMO

Corticosteroids are commonly used in ECMO-supported ARDS to reduce inflammation and facilitate lung recovery, but **high-dose pulses** should be avoided because of infection risk; maintain low-to-moderate dosing unless refractory [^113eXsgS].

---

## Risks and benefits of corticosteroids in ECMO

Benefits include improved oxygenation, reduced inflammation, and potentially shorter ECMO duration, whereas **risks** include secondary infections, hyperglycemia, neuromuscular weakness, and delayed wound healing [^111CNZvz].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with corticosteroid use in ECMO

Evidence is mixed: some studies suggest improved oxygenation and shorter ECMO duration, whereas others show no significant mortality benefit; careful patient selection and monitoring are essential [^1179uJmu] [^111URkPt].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines recommend corticosteroids for ARDS [^113Ysm1S], with **early initiation** and individualized dosing based on severity and patient factors [^113kj1vd]. On ECMO, continue low-to-moderate steroids and avoid high-dose pulses unless refractory [^113eXsgS].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Early initiation**: Start corticosteroids within 7 days of ARDS onset when possible [^115PB789].
- **Dosing**: Use methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day for early ARDS; 2 mg/kg/day for late/persistent ARDS [^111FWM4s].
- **Tapering**: Gradually taper over 13 days to prevent rebound inflammation [^115PB789].
- **ECMO**: Continue low-to-moderate dose steroids; avoid high-dose pulses unless refractory [^113eXsgS].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for infections, hyperglycemia, and neuromuscular complications [^111CNZvz].

---

Corticosteroids are recommended for ARDS [^113Ysm1S], with **early initiation** and individualized dosing; on ECMO, continue low-to-moderate steroids and avoid high-dose pulses unless refractory, with close monitoring for complications [^113crMig].

Uncertainties and research priorities

Several questions about corticosteroids remain unanswered. The optimal corticosteroid regimen remains unknown; further research is needed to determine the appropriate formulation, dose, timing, and course of therapy to better guide clinical care. Additional longitudinal data are also needed to better understand the adverse consequences of corticosteroids. Finally, there is a possibility that corticosteroids have variable effects on different subpopulations of patients based on ARDS etiology, severity, patient characteristics, or other factors. Understanding the impact of corticosteroids on potentially vulnerable patients, such as those at increased risk for superimposed infections (e.g. immunocompromised patients) and metabolic complications (e.g. those with diabetes mellitus), is of particular importance. Two large, multicenter RCTs assessing the impact of corticosteroids on ARDS outcomes will soon be underway – Glucocorticoids in Adults with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (GuARDS) and Corticosteroid Early and Extended (CORT-E2). These trials may help answer questions about differential treatment effects in ARDS subgroups and strengthen the certainty of evidence surrounding corticosteroid use in ARDS overall.

Question 2: Should Patients with ARDS Receive VV-ECMO?

Recommendation

We suggest the use of VV-ECMO in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence)

### Role of corticosteroids in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^115k7cBG]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence exploring the use of corticosteroids for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has targeted various stages of disease progression, from preventing ARDS in high-risk patients to halting disease evolution once ARDS has developed.

Objective

The aim of this review was to evaluate randomized, controlled trials describing the role of corticosteroids in preventing and treating ARDS.

Methods

English-language randomized, controlled trials were identified using MEDLINE via PubMed and EMBASE searches (key terms: acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury, and corticosteroids; years: 1968-January 2008).

Results

A total of 10 trials were found and included in this analysis. Trials describing the role of high-dose corticosteroids compared with controls in preventing ARDS found no benefit, with the range of occurrence of ARDS in at-risk populations from 14% to 64% and absolute increases in mortality from 4% to 31%. Conflicting evidence was found for treating late-phase ARDS with corticosteroids, with 13% hospital mortality among patients receiving corticosteroids versus 63% with controls (P = 0.03) in one small study, but no significant difference was found when evaluating 60-day mortality (corticosteroid group, 29.2% vs control, 28.6%) in another investigation. The use of high-dose corticosteroids for the treatment of early phase ARDS was not associated with significant differences in 45-day mortality (methylprednisolone, 60% vs control, 63%). However, one trial found that methylprednisolone taper for early ARDS was associated with significant improvement in lung function or extubation (69.8% vs 35.7%; P = 0.002), fewer days on mechanical ventilation (median, 5.0 vs 9.5; P = 0.002), higher intensive care unit survival (79.4% vs 57.4%; P = 0.03), but similar rates of hospital survival (methylprednisolone, 76.2% vs control, 57.1%; P = NS).

Conclusions

Data from clinical trials did not support the use of short-course, high-dose corticosteroids for preventing ARDS or for the treatment of early ARDS. Longer-course corticosteroids have not conclusively been associated with improved survival in the treatment of late-phase ARDS but have provided some benefits in other markers of disease severity in this setting and in early phase ARDS. Published trials support the administration of low- to moderate-dose corticosteroids in the treatment of early (< 7 days) and late-phase (days 7\2–14) ARDS, but this evidence is controversial.

Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — methylprednisolone use is characterized by earlier initiation and specified dosing, with the task force noting a reduction in hospital mortality by approximately 7% and 11% in mild and severe ARDS, respectively, and that early (< 72 h) versus late (≥ 7 days) initiation shows response to a low dose (1 mg/kg/day vs 2 mg/kg/day) with faster disease resolution. An individual patient data analysis of four trials (n = 322) confirmed improved survival and decreased duration of mechanical ventilation. The task force suggested that methylprednisolone be considered in early ARDS (up to day 7 of onset; PaO2/FiO2 of < 200) at 1 mg/kg/day and in late (after day 6 of onset) persistent ARDS at 2 mg/kg/day followed by slow tapering over 13 days; methylprednisolone should be weaned slowly (6–14 days) and not stopped rapidly (2–4 days), and infection surveillance is recommended because glucocorticoids blunt the febrile response.

### Evolving outcomes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111jRMwd]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis reported a pooled mortality rate of 48.8% (95% CI 44.8% to 52.9%) among patients receiving ECMO for COVID-19, which were robust in a number of sensitivity analyses. Mortality was positively associated with age, time of last patient enrolment from 1 January 2020, and the proportion of patients receiving corticosteroids, while mortality was negatively associated with ECMO duration. The pooled ECMO duration was approximately 16 days, and patients remained in the ICU for 33.5 days, and in the hospital for 39 days.

Consistent with previous analyses, this review found that age was associated with increased mortality. An important evolution in the management of severe COVID-19 was the use of corticosteroids and interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) antagonists. While corticosteroids reduce mortality in COVID-19, some studies have suggested that there exist steroid-responsive and -resistant phenotypes. It is possible that a subgroup of patients receiving this treatment, who would otherwise progress to severe ARDS, eventually improved and did not require ECMO. As such, the increase in mortality might stem from selection bias for patients with more severe ARDS refractory to adjunctive therapies than earlier on in the pandemic. Even amongst those who eventually require ECMO, a study of 40 patients found that mortality rates of patients receiving ECMO after a full 10-day course of dexamethasone was 100% compared to 57% where ECMO was instituted before completing the course of dexamethasone. In addition to this, immunomodulatory treatment might be associated with increased rates of secondary infections, which itself is associated with increased mortality rates, though this is not confirmed by all the available evidence. In addition, other possible factors that might also confound patient selection longitudinally include the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the more common and prolonged use of noninvasive ventilation, and changes in patient selection based on local resource availability changes. Interestingly, a longer duration of ECMO was associated with reduced mortality. This has previously been described and is partially attributable to immortal time bias — patients need to survive a certain duration of time while supported with ECMO to fulfil the criteria for weaning, while patients who had early life-threatening complications might have had their ECMO stopped earlier for futility or died. Another possible factor to consider is the potential conversion of ECMO as a bridge to recovery to a bridge to lung transplant. This siphons off some of the sickest patients who have the longest ECMO runs and would not have survived without ECMO and the lung transplant. This could have skewed the data, resulting in an increased mean duration of ECMO reported at the study level.

### Are corticosteroids useful in late-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome? [^111CNZvz]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by intense inflammation and alveolar-capillary disruption that can progress to a state of unresolving inflammation and disordered fibrosis, referred to as fibroproliferative, late-stage, or persistent ARDS. These pathophysiologic features may be responsive to corticosteroids, but early high-dose, short-duration therapy was proven ineffective. More recently, several small and one moderate-size multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated low-to-moderate-dose prolonged corticosteroid treatment. The RCT and meta-analysis consistently demonstrated improved oxygenation and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation with methylprednisolone. The largest RCT also revealed less pneumonia and shock, and shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stay, but more cases of severe myoneuropathy, with methylprednisolone. There were virtually identical 60-day and 180-day mortality rates for methylprednisolone and placebo in the largest RCT. Sub-group analysis of that study showed significantly higher mortality with methylprednisolone than with placebo when enrollment occurred > 13 days after onset of ARDS, but small sample size and differences in subject characteristics probably confound those results. Most meta-analyses demonstrated trends toward better survival with methylprednisolone, and, when restricted to patients enrolled in RCTs who received prolonged administration of methylprednisolone that was initiated within the first 14 days of ARDS, one meta-analysis demonstrated better survival with corticosteroids. Importantly, the aforementioned studies have methodological limitations, and the number of subjects enrolled was small. Experts differ in their recommendations regarding corticosteroids for late-stage ARDS, although one consensus group supported a "weak" recommendation of low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids for ARDS of < 14 days duration. If corticosteroids are administered, infection surveillance, avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, and gradual taper of corticosteroids are recommended.

Inhaled Pulmonary Vasodilators (iNO, Epoprostenol, Etc)

Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) can be considered as a rescue strategy in cases of severe hypoxemia/ARDS with P/F ratio < 100 when other strategies discussed above have not resulted in improved oxygenation, and before consideration of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). Systematic reviews of all RCTs documented significantly improved oxygenation with iNO treatment, but no mortality benefit. – We do not recommend the routine use of iNO in ARDS given no mortality benefit, high expense and potential risk for AKI, but it can be considered as a rescue strategy for patients with severe hypoxemia (Table 3). In a report examining ARDS management over a 12-year period of two randomized clinical trials, iNO use increased (24.9–65.8%) with no change in prone positioning (16.2–18.9%). The increasing use of iNO in severe hypoxemia patients may result in significantly improved oxygenation, which can provide time for treatment of underlying factors contributing to ARDS.

Steroids for ARDS

The DEXA-ARDS multicenter randomized trial (n = 277) documented that dexamethasone treatment (20 mg IV daily for 5 days, reduced to 10 mg once daily from Day 6 to Day 10) was significantly associated with increased ventilator-free days at 28 days (12.3 days vs. 7.5 days, p < 0.0001) and an absolute 15% (36% vs. 21%) reduction in all-cause mortality at 60 days in moderate-to-severe ARDS enrolled 24 hours after onset. However only 21 trauma patients were included in the DEXA-ARDS study, significantly limiting the generalizability of these conclusions regarding steroids for use in trauma ARDS.

A meta-analysis of 18 RCTs (n = 2826) confirmed that the use of corticosteroids reduced mortality in patients with ARDS of any etiology (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.95; ARR, 8.0%; 95% CI, 2.2–12.5%, moderate certainty). Patients who received a longer course of corticosteroids (over 7 days) had higher rates of survival compared with a shorter course. This effect was consistent for all ARDS patients, and all steroid types and dosages studied. But many of these studies did not include trauma-related ARDS patients.

Systemic corticosteroids are recommended for patients with COVID-related ARDS.

### Evidence synthesis of outcomes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for life-threatening asthma exacerbations [^114waGPj]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Patients with life-threatening asthma exacerbations who fail to improve on receiving standard and adjunctive therapies (eg, bronchodilators, glucocorticoids, magnesium, anesthetic/inhalational agents) are sometimes considered for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as salvage therapy. However, reports describing ECMO initiation in patients with life-threatening asthma have varied in both the types of outcomes reported and their estimates. We synthesized the body of evidence, using meta-analyses to estimate the outcomes of adults with life-threatening asthma exacerbations who undergo ECMO.

Pharmacologic treatment of critically ill COVID-19 needing invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO — Patients with COVID-19 pulmonary disease needing invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO have the highest risk of mortality, and pharmacologically, we recommend treating them similarly to those on non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula. Corticosteroids are strongly recommended as trials have demonstrated a mortality benefit. In addition to steroids, the panel recommends using either IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab is preferred over sarilumab) in critically ill patients who have elevated inflammatory markers like CRP; where IL-6 inhibitors are not available, baricitinib can be used in mechanically ventilated patients as a small trial showed a mortality benefit. Most other COVID-19 therapies studied in other severities have either not demonstrated benefit or not been studied in this population.

### Corticosteroid use in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis on clinical outcomes [^114s3HPz]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the start of the outbreak, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has spread globally from Wuhan, China. A total of 40,559,736 cases have been reported, and 1,121,499 people have died as of October 19. Many countries have been affected, causing immense stress on healthcare systems worldwide. This is the third epidemic caused by a coronavirus, after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. The clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic or mild disease to severe pneumonia in which the most severe cases deteriorate with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation, or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Approximately 16–35% develop severe pneumonia, 2–17% need mechanical ventilation, of whom up to 15% need ECMO therapy, and the case fatality rate is 1.4–15%. In the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19, the host immune response plays a key role and it has become evident that COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with both hyper inflammation and immunoparalysis. A clinical presentation of massive vascular inflammation, disseminated coagulation, shock and ARDS is frequently triggered.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113Ysm1S]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society ARDS guideline — new recommendations emphasize adjunctive therapies and ventilatory strategies: We suggest using corticosteroids for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); we suggest using venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) in selected patients with severe ARDS; and we suggest using neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS. With regard to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), we suggest using higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers (LRMs) as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS, and we recommend against using prolonged LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS.

### Evolving outcomes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111aiuRS]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used extensively for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Reports early in the pandemic suggested that mortality in patients with COVID-19 receiving ECMO was comparable to non-COVID-19-related ARDS. However, subsequent reports suggested that mortality appeared to be increasing over time. Therefore, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis, to characterise changes in mortality over time and elucidate risk factors for poor outcomes.

Methods

We conducted a meta-analysis (CRD42021271202), searching MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus databases, from 1 December 2019 to 26 January 2022, for studies reporting on mortality among adults with COVID-19 receiving ECMO. We also captured hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and ECMO, as well as complications of ECMO. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses, assessed risk of bias of included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist and evaluated certainty of pooled estimates using GRADE methodology.

Results

Of 4522 citations, we included 52 studies comprising 18,211 patients in the meta-analysis. The pooled mortality rate among patients with COVID-19 requiring ECMO was 48.8% (95% confidence interval 44.8–52.9%, high certainty). Mortality was higher among studies which enrolled patients later in the pandemic as opposed to earlier (1st half 2020: 41.2%, 2nd half 2020: 46.4%, 1st half 2021: 62.0%, 2nd half 2021: 46.5%, interaction p value = 0.0014). Predictors of increased mortality included age, the time of final patient enrolment from 1 January 2020, and the proportion of patients receiving corticosteroids, and reduced duration of ECMO run.

Conclusions

The mortality rate for patients receiving ECMO for COVID-19-related ARDS has increased as the pandemic has progressed. The reasons for this are likely multifactorial; however, as outcomes for these patients evolve, the decision to initiate ECMO should include the best contextual estimate of mortality at the time of ECMO initiation.

Corticosteroids rationale and ARDS evidence — early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, recommendations cautioned against systemic corticosteroids due to risk of worsening clinical status, delayed viral clearance, and adverse events, yet given the hyper-inflammatory state in COVID-19, immunomodulatory approaches including steroids continue to be evaluated to address ARDS and systemic inflammation; notably, a recent multicenter RCT in moderate to severe ARDS demonstrated a reduced number of ventilatory days and reduction in mortality with use of a 10-day regimen of dexamethasone.

### The clinical impact of prolonged steroid therapy in severe COVID-19 patients: a retrospective cohort study with propensity score matching [^116YoCdH]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study setting and participants

This single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted at a 2,800-bed tertiary hospital in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Adult patients (≥ 18 years) diagnosed with initial COVID-19 infection within 7 days of hospital admission between September 1, 2020 and May 31, 2022 were included. Eligible patients had World Health Organization Clinical Progression Scale (WHO-CPS) scores between 6 and 9 and received oxygen support via high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), noninvasive ventilation (NIV), mechanical ventilation (MV), or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed via nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and all patients received 6 mg dexamethasone daily or equivalent for at least 5 days.

We excluded patients who had been taking ≥ 5 mg of oral prednisolone (or equivalent) for over 4 weeks due to conditions such as rheumatologic or pulmonary diseases and solid organ transplantation. These patients were already on steroids before their COVID-19 infection and maintained steroid therapy after recovery, complicating the determination of tapering duration. Moreover, almost all these patients underwent steroid tapering, making comparisons between early withdrawal and prolonged tapering groups challenging. Additionally, we excluded patients with WHO-CPS scores < 6, those treated with steroids for < 5 days, or those who died within 10 days of admission.

### High-dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy during refractory COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome: a retrospective observational study [^114u9Y33]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Current COVID-19 guidelines recommend the early use of systemic corticoids for COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It remains unknown if high-dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy (MPT) ameliorates refractory COVID-19 ARDS after many days of mechanical ventilation or rapid deterioration with or without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

Methods

This is a retrospective observational study. Consecutive patients with COVID-19 ARDS treated with a parenteral high-dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy at the intensive care units (ICU) of two University Hospitals between January 1st 2021 and November 30st 2022 were included. Clinical data collection was at ICU admission, start of MPT, 3-, 10- and 14-days post MPT.

Results

Thirty-seven patients (mean age 55 ± 12 years) were included in the study. MPT started at a mean of 17 ± 12 days after mechanical ventilation. Nineteen patients (54%) received ECMO support when commencing MPT. Mean p a O 2 /F i O 2 significantly improved 3- (p = 0.034) and 10 days (p = 0.0313) post MPT. The same applied to the necessary F i O 2 10 days after MPT (p = 0.0240). There were no serious infectious complications. Twenty-four patients (65%) survived to ICU discharge, including 13 out of 20 (65%) needing ECMO support.

Conclusions

Late administration of high-dose MPT in a critical subset of refractory COVID-19 ARDS patients improved respiratory function and was associated with a higher-than-expected survival of 65%. These data suggest that high-dose MPT may be a viable salvage therapy in refractory COVID-19 ARDS.

### Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during respiratory pandemics: past, present, and future [^113ZPPVk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Although largely speculative, a number of factors have been proposed to explain the worsening mortality over time as noted from these observational studies. First is increased use of noninvasive respiratory support before endotracheal intubation, perhaps leading to more patient self-inflicted lung injury before ECMO, a factor that may not necessarily be adequately reflected in baseline assessments of severity of illness. Second is a selection bias for more treatment-refractory disease, given that those receiving ECMO would have progressed despite having been more likely to receive initial COVID-19–targeted therapies, such as corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants, therapies that had become more routine later in the pandemic. Third, such COVID-19–targeted therapies may also contribute to superimposed bacterial infections. Fourth, and likely most speculative, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants may have impacted patient trajectory. Fifth is the use of ECMO in centers less experienced with ECMO for COVID-19 in later phases of the pandemic, as suggested by the data. Sixth, patient selection criteria are poorly reported in many of these studies, and initial success may have contributed to more liberal application of ECMO in later phases of the pandemic, although this was not detected in the ELSO registry data, where the latter cohort (with higher mortality) was expected to have a lower relative risk of mortality after adjusting for pre-ECMO characteristics.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines on the management of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the ICU: first update [^111MWn4t]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 ICU corticosteroid evidence and dosing: Across 1,703 COVID-19 patients, the use of corticosteroids reduced the risk of 28-day mortality compared to no corticosteroids or placebo (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.86; high quality), with similar results in mechanically ventilated patients (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.82; moderate quality), translating to 96 fewer deaths (95% CI 142 fewer to 47 fewer) per 1,000 patients receiving corticosteroids; the effect size for 28-day mortality was largest in trials using dexamethasone for up to 10 days (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.82; moderate quality), followed by hydrocortisone (374 patients, OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.12, low quality) and methylprednisolone (47 patients, OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.22, very low quality), and a firm conclusion on comparative efficacy cannot be made; the effect of late administration in mechanically ventilated patients remains unclear, and the optimal dosing and duration are unclear, so until more evidence is available, we prefer using the dosing regimen from the RECOVERY trial (i.e., dexamethasone 6 mg/day for 10 days or equivalent); serious adverse events were variably reported and corticosteroids have a range of adverse effects, with several studies in viral pneumonia patients in the ICU showing increased or prolonged coronavirus RNA shedding with corticosteroid use and the clinical consequences of increased shedding uncertain because effects on duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital and ICU length of stay were not reported.

Justification and implementation considerations

Although pooled analysis demonstrated a mortality benefit with moderate certainty of evidence, multiple caveats prompted a conditional recommendation. There is substantial heterogeneity in the dosing, timing, and duration of corticosteroids in clinical trials in patients with ARDS, resulting in uncertainty about the optimal course of treatment. Data addressing the short- and long-term adverse effects of corticosteroids are also limited; infectious complications could not be systematically evaluated, and there is low- to very low-certainty evidence for other safety outcomes. Additionally, previous studies assessing the use of corticosteroids for varied indications have demonstrated the potential for harm even when used in short courses.

There are several factors to consider for implementation (Figure 2). Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer. As such, they have the potential to reach and benefit a substantial number of patients. With regard to corticosteroid dosing and administration, although the panel was not comfortable making recommendations for a specific agent and course of therapy, there are some considerations that may help guide clinicians when selecting a regimen. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (i.e. severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit from corticosteroids, with regimens that have been defined and evaluated in large RCTs. For other ARDS etiologies, any of several regimens used in clinical trials (Table E10 in the online supplement) could reasonably be chosen based on the individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. Although the duration of corticosteroid treatment has varied in clinical trials, corticosteroids were stopped at the time of extubation in a number of the included studies. Additionally, although the optimal timing of therapy is also unclear, it is important to note that the initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after the onset of ARDS may be associated with harm. Furthermore, the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in patient populations that may be at higher risks of harm, such as patients who are immunocompromised, have metabolic syndrome, or live in regions where infections such as tuberculosis and parasitic disease are endemic. Finally, although this recommendation is based on evidence from trials on intubated patients with ARDS and applies specifically to this group, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some groups of nonintubated patients with ARDS. For nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit from corticosteroid treatment (i.e. COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia). The role of steroids in nonintubated patients with ARDS of other etiologies remains uncertain.

### Dexamethasone for inpatients with COVID-19 in a national cohort [^113SaJmd]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Limited effective therapeutics are available to hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials and observational studies have shown varying effects of systemic corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with limited descriptions of important patient subgroups.

Objective

To examine the clinical use of dexamethasone for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 respiratory illness and to explore the heterogeneity of treatment outcomes across different subgroups.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a retrospective, propensity score-weighted cohort study of adult patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours for COVID-19 respiratory illness between July 1, 2020, and October 31, 2021, at a large health care network of 156 hospitals across the US. Data analysis was performed from March 2022 to February 2023.

Exposures

Systemic dexamethasone administered within 48 hours of either admission or escalation in oxygen support.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause in-hospital mortality or discharge to hospice.

Results

A total of 80 699 patients who met the eligibility criteria were identified (median [IQR] age, 64 [52–76] years; 37 606 women [46.6%]); 13 230 patients (16.4%) identified as Black, 49 222 (60.9%) as White, 18 247 (22.6%) as other race, and 20 340 (25.2%) as Hispanic ethnicity. Of these patients, 13 040 (16.2%) did not require supplemental oxygen within 48 hours of admission, 56 368 (69.8%) required supplemental oxygen, 7618 (9.4%) required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), and 3673 (4.6%) required mechanical ventilation (MV) and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). After adjustment by propensity score overlap weighting, early use of dexamethasone was associated with reduction in a composite outcome of in-hospital mortality or discharge to hospice for patients receiving supplemental oxygen (aOR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86–0.98) and MV and/or ECMO (aOR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68–0.99). In contrast, all-cause inpatient mortality or discharge to hospice was not lower for patients who received dexamethasone in the no supplemental oxygen group (aOR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78–1.03) and in the NIPPV group (aOR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.73–1.04). Importantly, patients with more comorbidities had greater benefit from dexamethasone use.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this national multicenter cohort study of inpatients with COVID-19, early administration of dexamethasone was associated with significantly reduced odds of mortality or discharge to hospice in those requiring supplemental oxygen or MV and/or ECMO but not in those requiring no supplemental oxygen or NIPPV. These results support the continued use of systemic dexamethasone in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111q5Y1S]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — implementation and safety considerations are outlined as follows: Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer, yet there is substantial heterogeneity in dosing, timing, and duration with uncertainty about the optimal course, and data on short- and long-term adverse effects are limited with low- to very-low certainty for other safety outcomes. Although evidence applies to intubated ARDS, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some nonintubated groups; for nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit (COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia), and the role in nonintubated patients with other etiologies remains uncertain. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit with regimens defined in large randomized controlled trials, whereas for other ARDS etiologies, several regimens used in clinical trials may reasonably be chosen based on an individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. The initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after onset of ARDS may be associated with harm, and the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in higher-risk populations such as immunocompromised patients or those in regions endemic for tuberculosis or parasitic disease.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1116v4vi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This document updates previously published Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), incorporating new evidence addressing the use of corticosteroids, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

Methods

We summarized evidence addressing four "PICO questions" (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome). A multidisciplinary panel with expertise in ARDS used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to develop clinical recommendations.

Results

We suggest the use of: 1) corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence), 2) venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), 3) neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), and 4) higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty), and 5) we recommend against using prolonged lung recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).

Conclusions

We provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the management of ARDS. Individual patient and illness characteristics should be factored into clinical decision making and implementation of these recommendations while additional evidence is generated from much-needed clinical trials.

### Higher dose corticosteroids in hospitalised COVID-19 patients requiring ventilatory support (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial [^11245YBG]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients aged at least 18 years admitted to hospital were eligible for the study if they had clinically suspected or laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical evidence of hypoxia (i.e. receiving oxygen with or without other forms of respiratory support, or with oxygen saturations < 92% on room air) and no medical history that might, in the opinion of the attending clinician, put the patient at significant risk if they were to participate in the trial. Patients were ineligible for the comparison of higher dose corticosteroid vs. usual care if there was a known contra-indication to short-term use of corticosteroids, suspected or confirmed influenza, or current use of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, ritonavir or other potent CYP3A inhibitors. Ventilatory support includes continuous positive airway pressure, bi-level positive airway pressure, high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO, together non-invasive ventilation), invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Endemic infections were screened for in accordance with local practice. Other immunomodulatory therapies were not contra-indicated but investigators were advised to consider the total burden of such therapy (e.g. combining an IL-6 receptor antagonist with higher dose corticosteroid). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, or a legal representative if patients were too unwell or unable to provide consent.

### Management of refractory ventricular Fibrillation: extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or epinephrine? [^113Q7ACo]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2017). Low credibility.

One technique that is promulgated to support patients with refractory cardiac arrest is the use of cardiopulmonary bypass during attempted resuscitation. This consists of emergent cannulation of a large vein and artery, then initiation of venoarterial extracorporeal circulation and oxygenation with an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO). Multiple observational studies, primarily originating in Southeast Asia, suggest that ECMO is associated with improved outcome after refractory cardiac arrest. Because the overall survival in these locations is low compared with contemporary survival in the United States, it is unclear if one can generalize from their experience with ECMO. Observational studies in Melbourne, Australia and Paris, France suggest that early use of ECMO in combination with other interventions may be associated with good neurologic outcomes. A case-control study in Minneapolis, Minnesota of patients with refractory OHCA caused by a shockable rhythm reported that early transport to the cardiac catheterization laboratory followed by ECMO then PCI was associated with greater survival with good neurologic function as compared with historical control subjects (50% vs. 8.2%; p < 0.0001). A randomized feasibility trial of ECMO in patients with refractory cardiac arrest was recently initiated in the United States. In summary, there is considerable interest in the effectiveness of ECMO in humans with refractory OHCA.

Another technique that is promulgated to support patients with cardiac arrest is IV administration of medication to improve blood pressure and flow to the coronary and cerebral circulation so as to enhance the likely restoration of circulation and to reduce brain injury. Increased coronary perfusion pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure during CPR may be offset by increased myocardial work and reduced subendocardial perfusion. Multiple large observational studies from southeast Asia have suggested that early but not late use of epinephrine is associated with improved outcomes after OHCA. The only placebo-controlled trial of epinephrine (also called adrenalin) reported to date did not achieve its maximum expected enrollment but did observe that epinephrine significantly increased restoration of circulation and survival to admission as compared with placebo. Pooled analyses of prior trials confirm that vasopressin has no significant benefit over epinephrine. In 2 small trials in Greece, epinephrine combined with vasopressin and multiple doses of corticosteroids increased the likelihood of restoration of circulation as compared with placebo. A large pragmatic trial comparing epinephrine with placebo is currently enrolling patients with OHCA in England. In summary, there is considerable interest in the effectiveness of IV vasopressors in humans with refractory cardiac arrest.

### Prophylactic corticosteroids for paediatric heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass [^113Upoyq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are routinely given to children undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in an attempt to ameliorate the inflammatory response. Their use is still controversial and the decision to administer the intervention can vary by centre and/or by individual doctors within that centre.

Objectives

This review is designed to assess the benefits and harms of prophylactic corticosteroids in children between birth and 18 years of age undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science in June 2020. We also searched four clinical trials registers and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included studies of prophylactic administration of corticosteroids, including single and multiple doses, and all types of corticosteroids administered via any route and at any time-point in the perioperative period. We excluded studies if steroids were administered therapeutically. We included individually randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with two or more groups (e.g. multi-drug or dose comparisons with a control group) but not 'head-to-head' trials without a placebo or a group that did not receive corticosteroids. We included studies in children, from birth up to 18 years of age, including preterm infants, undergoing cardiac surgery with the use of CPB. We also excluded studies in patients undergoing heart or lung transplantation, or both; studies in patients already receiving corticosteroids; in patients with abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; and in patients given steroids at the time of cardiac surgery for indications other than cardiac surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the Covidence systematic review manager to extract and manage data for the review. Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We resolved disagreements by consensus or by consultation with a third review author. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

We found 3748 studies, of which 888 were duplicate records. Two studies had the same clinical trial registration number, but reported different populations and interventions. We therefore included them as separate studies. We screened titles and abstracts of 2868 records and reviewed full text reports for 84 studies to determine eligibility. We extracted data for 13 studies. Pooled analyses are based on eight studies. We reported the remaining five studies narratively due to zero events for both intervention and placebo in the outcomes of interest. Therefore, the final meta-analysis included eight studies with a combined population of 478 participants. There was a low or unclear risk of bias across the domains. There was moderate certainty of evidence that corticosteroids do not change the risk of in-hospital mortality (five RCTs; 313 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 2.07) for children undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. There was high certainty of evidence that corticosteroids reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (six RCTs; 421 participants; mean difference (MD) 11.37 hours lower, 95% CI -20.29 to -2.45) after the surgery. There was high-certainty evidence that the intervention probably made little to no difference to the length of postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) stay (six RCTs; 421 participants; MD 0.28 days lower, 95% CI -0.79 to 0.24) and moderate-certainty evidence that the intervention probably made little to no difference to the length of the postoperative hospital stay (one RCT; 176 participants; mean length of stay 22 days; MD -0.70 days, 95% CI -2.62 to 1.22). There was moderate certainty of evidence for no effect of the intervention on all-cause mortality at the longest follow-up (five RCTs; 313 participants; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.07) or cardiovascular mortality at the longest follow-up (three RCTs; 109 participants; RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.46). There was low certainty of evidence that corticosteroids probably make little to no difference to children separating from CPB (one RCT; 40 participants; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.92). We were unable to report information regarding adverse events of the intervention due to the heterogeneity of reporting of outcomes. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for several reasons, including imprecision due to small sample sizes, a single study providing data for an individual outcome, the inclusion of both appreciable benefit and harm in the confidence interval, and publication bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Corticosteroids probably do not change the risk of mortality for children having heart surgery using CPB at any time point. They probably reduce the duration of postoperative ventilation in this context, but have little or no effect on the total length of postoperative ICU stay or total postoperative hospital stay. There was inconsistency in the adverse event outcomes reported which, consequently, could not be pooled. It is therefore impossible to provide any implications and policy-makers will be unable to make any recommendations for practice without evidence about adverse effects. The review highlighted the need for well-conducted RCTs powered for clinical outcomes to confirm or refute the effect of corticosteroids versus placebo in children having cardiac surgery with CPB. A core outcome set for adverse event reporting in the paediatric major surgery and intensive care setting is required.

Figure 2 — Intervention-specific populations and numeric precautions in ARDS: For venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO), population criteria include PaO2/FIO2 < 80 or pH < 7.25 with pCO2 ≥ 60; conditions associated with increased risk for futility include Mechanical ventilation ≥ 7 days and Chronic medical condition and life expectancy < 1 y. For neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA), population criteria are Early ARDS (≤ 48 hours of MV) with PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 100, with a precaution of unknown and potentially increased incidence of neuromuscular weakness with infusions of > 48 hours duration. For corticosteroids, a precaution is that use may be associated with increased risk of harm when initiated after > 14 d of mechanical ventilation. For high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), precautions include that prolonged recruitment maneuvers should be avoided.

### Repurposed pharmacological agents for the potential treatment of COVID-19: a literature review [^115w5cX6]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

From the February 2021 update of the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines, the Panel strongly recommends dexamethasone for hospitalised COVID-19 patients who require supplemental oxygen through high-flow devices or non-invasive ventilation. A combination with remdesivir is also mentioned as a treatment option for these patients. Dexamethasone is also strongly recommended for hospitalised patients on invasive ventilation or ECMO. For hospitalised patients who require increasing amounts of supplemental oxygen not through a high-flow device, non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or ECMO the use of dexamethasone can optionally be added to the treatment of remdesivir or can be administered as monotherapy if a combination with remdesivir is not feasible. Furthermore, the Panel strongly recommends against the use of dexamethasone for hospitalised COVID-19 patients who do not need supplemental oxygen and to non-hospitalised, mild to moderate COVID-19 patients. Recommended alternatives for dexamethasone, if not available, are prednisone, methylprednisolone, and hydrocortisone. The ERS supports this viewpoint by strongly suggesting systemic corticosteroids to patients who are hospitalised for COVID-19 that need oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^111t6ft5]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

GRADE recommendation statement

The use of corticosteroids in established ARDS should be the subject of a suitably powered, multicentre RCT with long-term follow-up (GRADE Recommendation: research recommendation).

GRADE recommendation justification

Current evidence includes the possibility of substantial patient benefit and the risk of harm appears small, although the group noted that the trials did not include longer term follow-up of survivors. However, the evidence is of low to very low quality from clinical trials, which were mostly conducted before the current era of lung protective ventilation. In addition, the lack of sufficient power in any individual study or in the combined MA and the heterogeneity of the dose, timing and agent used also influenced the decision. The group believed that a position of equipoise exists and the research recommendation reflects this view.

As a caveat, it is worth mentioning that specific steroid responsive disorders may mimic ARDS, for example, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonia and diffuse alveolar haemorrhage.

Implications for future research

A large, multicentre study on steroids in established ARDS is currently planned.

However, a study on the use of V-V ECMO in COVID-19 patients (n = 32) carried out in Japan reported a 67% ECMO weaning rate, with 2% mortality, with the remaining patients still supported. Early outcomes of ECMO support in COVID-19 patients in a single institution in the United States showed an overall survival rate of 96%, and 48% of the patients were successfully decannulated. Moreover, the use of V-A ECMO for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)-related cardio-circulatory impairment was found to be associated with a 100% survival rate. Previous studies reported a relatively better prognosis in children and a rapid resolution of systolic dysfunction due to differences in the mechanism of COVID-19-related cardiogenic shock in children and adults. In children, myocardial involvement is due to stunning or oedema rather than inflammatory damage, and rapid recovery with the use of immunoglobulin and steroids has been reported. Schmidt et al. explored data from 83 COVID-19-related ARDS patients (median age 49 [IQR 41–56] years; 61 [73%] men) in the Paris–Sorbonne University Hospital Network, which is composed of 5 ICUs. Patients presented with severe ARDS with a median PO 2 /FiO 2 of 60 (IQR 54–68) mmHg before ECMO initiation. Further analysis showed that the estimated 60-day mortality rate was 31% (95% CI 22–42), which is similar to the rate reported in the EOLIA trial and the large prospective LIFEGARD registry of ECMO for severe ARDS not caused by COVID-19. Notably, 78 (94%) patients received adjuvant therapy, including prone positioning before ECMO initiation and a homogeneous ultraprotective ventilation strategy with tight control of the driving pressure during ECMO. In October 2020, the ELSO registry published the largest multicentre study to date, involving 1035 COVID-19-related ECMO patients from 213 centres across 36 countries. This multicentre study reported a mortality rate of 37% (95% CI 34–40) after ECMO initiation. The median age of the patients included in the study was 49 years (IQR 41–57), and 724 (70%) patients had at least one pre-ECMO comorbidity. The median PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio prior to ECMO use was 72 (IQR 59–94), and 60% of the patients underwent prone positioning prior to ECMO initiation. The risk factors identified in this study were age, immunocompromised state, chronic respiratory disease, pre-ECMO cardiac arrest, severe hypoxaemia, acute kidney injury, and the use of ECMO for temporary circulatory support (V-A ECMO support vs. V-V ECMO support).

### Antenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of imminent preterm birth in low-resource countries: the case for equipoise and the need for efficacy trials [^113eGadx]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

The Antenatal Late Preterm Steroids Trial

The findings of the Antenatal Late Preterm Steroids (ALPS) Trial were published in early 2016 (after the release of the WHO recommendations). This was a multicentre, randomised trial in tertiary care centres in the United States that recruited women with a singleton pregnancy, at high risk for preterm birth and at 34 weeks 0 days to 36 weeks 5 days of gestation. Participants were randomised to receive up to two injections of betamethasone or matching placebo, 24 hours apart. The primary outcome was a management-based, composite severe adverse neonatal outcome relating to need for respiratory support. It was defined as one or more of the use of CPAP or high-flow nasal cannula for at least two consecutive hours, supplemental oxygen with a fraction of inspired oxygen of at least 0.30 for at least four continuous hours, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or mechanical ventilation. Stillbirth and neonatal death within 72 hours were included as competing events.

The authors reported that the primary outcome was significantly reduced in the intervention arm, 11.6% vs 14.4% (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.97). Other newborn secondary outcomes (including severe respiratory complications, transient tachypnoea of the newborn, surfactant use and bronchopulmonary dysplasia) were also significantly less frequent in the betamethasone group, although neonatal hypoglycaemia was more common in the betamethasone group (24.0% vs 15.0%; RR 1.60; 95% CI 1.37 to 1.87). There were no apparent differences in the incidence of chorioamnionitis, respiratory distress syndrome or neonatal sepsis.

The ALPS Trial findings were meta-analysed with similar trials in a recent systematic review by Saccone and Berghella, who explored the role of ACS in term or near-term fetuses. The review included six trials, comprising 5698 singleton pregnancies. The review authors concluded that ACS at ≥ 34 weeks' gestation reduces neonatal respiratory morbidity, and that a single course of corticosteroids can be considered for women at risk of imminent late premature birth (34 weeks 0 days to 36 weeks 6 days) gestation, as well as for the subgroup of women undergoing planned caesarean delivery at ≥ 37 weeks' gestation.

### Dexamethasone therapy in neonates treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^1179uJmu]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that infants who received dexamethasone would have a shorter length of time on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Study design Infants placed on ECMO for respiratory failure were randomly assigned to receive either dexamethasone for 3 days or placebo. Chest radiographs were scored through the use of a validated standard scoring system to assess lung injury.

Results

Thirty infants received dexamethasone and 29 received placebo. The median (25th%, 75th%) duration of time on ECMO was 143.5 (100, 313) hours in the dexamethasone group and 160 (111, 303) hours in the placebo group (not significant). Survival was 80% in the dexamethasone group and 83% in the placebo group. Radiographic lung injury scores (mean ± SEM) were significantly improved in the dexamethasone group (10.5 ± 0.6) versus placebo (12.3 ± 0.5) on day 3 of ECMO (P = 0.013). Hypertension developed in 27 of the 30 infants receiving dexamethasone and 13 of the 29 infants in the placebo group during ECMO (P < .01).

Conclusions

Dexamethasone given during the first 3 days of ECMO results in significant improvement in lung injury scores by day 3 of ECMO but does not significantly decrease the duration of ECMO or improve survival. The preponderance of evidence would not support the use of dexamethasone in this setting.

### Early short-course corticosteroids in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^113r4AHs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

As of 9 April 2020, the United States has over 400 000 cases of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Most patients will have mild illness, but older persons and those with comorbidities may develop severe disease necessitating hospitalization and time in the intensive care unit (ICU). The disease pathophysiology presents in 2 distinct overlapping phases, the initial pathogenic viral response followed by host inflammatory response with grades of severity associated with distinct clinical findings. The pathological progression in severe COVID-19 includes an excessive and unregulated proinflammatory cytokine storm resulting in immunopathological lung injury, diffuse alveolar damage with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death.

In the absence of any proven antiviral therapy, the current clinical management is primarily supportive care, supplemental oxygen, and mechanical ventilatory support. Adjunctive therapy with immunomodulatory agents targeting the inflammatory cytokine storm are being evaluated. Studies of corticosteroid therapy for phylogenetically similar coronavirus infections showed no benefit and potential harm. Despite the frequent use in treating patients with COVID-19 in China, the role of corticosteroids is undefined. A more recent observational study reported improved outcomes in patients with COVID-associated ARDS that received corticosteroids.

We postulated that early treatment with a short course of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 may attenuate the excessive host respiratory and systemic inflammatory responses. We report the clinical characteristics and early outcomes of patients with COVID-19 receiving short courses of methylprednisolone.

### Prophylactic corticosteroids for infants undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116umMkT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We reported this systematic review and meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Before our study started, the protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (registration number: CRD42023400176).

Search strategy and selection criteria

We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases from inception to March 1, 2024. Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and free text terms related to corticosteroids, infants, and cardiac surgery were selected. Search strategies are shown in Supplementary Material 1. We also searched the Clinical Trials Registry and Google Scholar to identify grey literature. In addition, the reference lists of all the included studies were screened to identify additional studies missed from the original electronic search. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) design: randomized controlled trials; (2) population: infants (≤ 12 months) scheduled for cardiac surgery with CPB; (3) intervention: perioperative (preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative) administration of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, or other corticosteroids) for prophylactic purposes; (4) control: placebo or none; and (5) outcomes: eligible studies must report at least one of the predetermined outcomes. The primary outcome was in-hospital postoperative mortality. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI), cardiac arrest, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), neurologic events, infection, insulin treatment, duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation, and length of postoperative ICU stay. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) organ transplantation; (2) corticosteroid administration for other purposes, such as supplement therapy, and allergy treatment; and (3) patients with abnormalities of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis.

Data extraction

Two authors (SYW and YX) independently screened the literature and extracted data using the standard data collection form. A third author (HY) was involved when discrepancies appeared. We extracted the following data: first author, title, journal, year of publication, study design, country, number of enrolled patients, distribution in both groups, patient characteristics, type of surgery, type of corticosteroids, corticosteroid administration regimen, in-hospital postoperative mortality, AKI, cardiac arrest, ECMO support, LCOS, neurologic events, infection, insulin treatment, duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation, and length of postoperative ICU stay. Authors were contacted for missing data relevant to our study.

### Extracorporeal hemoadsorption in critically ill COVID-19 patients on VV ECMO: the cytoSorb therapy in COVID-19 (CTC) registry [^116yJByD]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Timing of initiation of organ support therapies

Overall, VV ECMO and CytoSorb were initiated relatively early in patients that failed mechanical ventilation (MV) and standard of care measures such as proning and corticosteroids. Median duration of MV to initiation of ECMO was 19.5 [7–43] h, with generally concurrent initiation of CytoSorb: 0 [0–5] h from ECMO start (Table 1). However, compared to G L patients, those in the G E group started ECMO and CytoSorb significantly earlier following both ICU admission and the initiation of MV. The time interval between ECMO start and initiation of hemoadsorption treatment specifically was also shorter in the G E group (Table 1).

Need and duration of organ support therapies

Overall, earlier initiation of VV ECMO and CytoSorb was associated with significant reductions in the duration of organ support. After the start of hemoadsorption, patients in G E required significantly shorter ECMO support than those in G L (median 13 [7–31] vs 29 [10–47] days, respectively, p = 0.02) and had needed shorter duration of MV (median 7 [2–26] vs. 17 [7–37] days, p = 0.02) (Fig. 1). ICU stay evaluated after the start of hemoadsorption was also significantly shorter in G E compared with G L (17 [10–40] vs. 36 [19–55] days, respectively, p = 0.002) (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Days on organ support and ICU stay in G E and G L. G E, early group; G L, late group; ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; MV, mechanical ventilation; ICU, intensive care unit

Despite the same number of patients requiring vasopressors in both groups (76%), the G L group tended to require vasopressor support for longer and also had higher final cumulative fluid balance (Table 2). Need for CRRT (30% in G E vs. 22% in G L, p = 0.36), and duration: G E (30 [7–53] vs. 5 [4–24] days, p = 0.12, showed no significant differences between the groups.

### Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with COVID-19: an emulated target trial analysis [^113iCVec]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite being on the basis of a large detailed multicenter cohort of patients with a low rate of missing values who were critically ill with COVID-19, the results of this emulated target trial should be interpreted cautiously. First, our inclusion criteria for the emulated target trial were on the basis of Pa O 2 /F O 2 < 80 and/or Pa CO 2 ⩾ 60 mm Hg at one point (regardless of the timing of adjunct therapies during that day), which contrasts with the EOLIA trial and expert recommendations which advocate considering the duration of time (i.e., > 6 h) below a Pa O 2 /F O 2 or above a Pa CO 2 threshold. This difference could have caused a potential bias toward better outcomes for patients not treated with ECMO and hampered exchangeability. Second, the management of patients on ECMO has not been specifically captured by our study and could have differed between ECMO centers. As previously reported in patients with and without COVID, venovenous ECMO case volume markedly influenced outcome, with better 90-day survival for patients treated in experienced centers in our study. Third, the use of specific COVID-19 therapies other than dexamethasone was not collected in the COVID-ICU cohort. Fourth, although we carefully designed this emulated trial on the basis of observational data, applied methodological corrections to each identified source of bias, and performed several sensitivity analyses, we cannot exclude residual confounding, which could question the conditional exchangeability assumption. The validity of other assumptions of causal inference may also be discussed. The assumption of no interference (the treatment applied to one unit does not affect the outcome of other units) is likely to be valid in this setting, as the assumption of positivity (by carefully selecting clinically meaningful ECMO eligibility criteria). Assumption of consistency could also have been challenged in a period when hospital strain was intense. This potential issue was explored by two sensitivity analyses restricted to centers from the greater Paris region and centers with high ECMO volume, reducing potential heterogeneity in ECMO management. The assumptions surrounding missing data may also not be justified. Lastly, because an increase in mortality in patients with COVID-19 on ECMO has been recently reported during the second surge of the pandemic (i.e. after September 2020), our results might have changed over time with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with more severe forms of ARDS.

Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

SCCM/ESICM CIRCI guideline — rating the quality of evidence across outcomes followed GRADE by initially categorizing it as high if it originated from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and low if it originated from observational data; the quality was subsequently downgraded by one or two levels for serious or very serious risk of bias, serious inconsistencies across studies, indirect evidence, sparse or imprecise data, or likely publication bias; when observational evidence had large effect sizes, evidence of a dose–response gradient, or plausible confounding that would reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spurious effect when results showed no effect, the quality was upgraded; by repeating this procedure, an overall quality of the evidence was obtained for each outcome and each intervention.

### Evolving outcomes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for severe COVID-19 ARDS in sorbonne hospitals, paris [^114MNPg2]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was frequently used to treat coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during the initial outbreak from January to June 2020. High-volume ECMO centers and large ECMO networks reported similar survival rates for these patients compared to ECMO-supported patients with non-COVID-associated ARDS.

Management of COVID-19 patients evolved over the following months, as knowledge of the disease improved with the publication of landmark randomized trials. In June 2020, RECOVERY-trial results showed that dexamethasone (6 mg/day for 10 days) significantly reduced mortality compared to usual care for patients receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone. That dexamethasone regimen was recommended by the World Health Organization and largely prescribed to COVID-19 patients. High-flow oxygen through a nasal cannula (HFNO) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) was also shown to lower COVID-19 patients' need for invasive mechanical ventilation and was recommended in national and international guidelines.

Because the care of COVID-19 patients evolved during the second part of 2020, we compared the characteristics and outcomes of patients who received ECMO support before and after July 1, 2020, for laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Paris–Sorbonne Hospitals.

NIH COVID-19 treatment guidelines.

For patients with COVID-19 who are not hospitalized or who are hospitalized with moderate disease but do not require supplemental oxygen.

Recommendations: There are insufficient data for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19.

For hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen but who do not require delivery of oxygen through a high-flow device, noninvasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO).

Recommendations: The options given next are listed in order of preference; however, all these options are considered acceptable.
1 Remdesivir 200 mg intravenously (IV) for 1 day, followed by remdesivir 100 mg IV for 4 days or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first (AI); or
2 a combination of remdesivir (dose and duration as aforementioned) plus dexamethasone 6 mg IV or orally for up to 10 days or until hospital discharge (BIII); or
3 if remdesivir cannot be used, dexamethasone may be used instead (BIII). (See Remdesivir for more information.)

For hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who require delivery of oxygen through a high-flow device or noninvasive ventilation but not invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO.

### Potential for recovery after extremely prolonged VV-ECMO support in well-selected severe COVID-19 patients: a retrospective cohort study [^1149CctU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Four patients received a second empirical course of steroids, and all had a subsequent improvement, suggesting underlying corticosteroid-sensitive disease. Treatment was initiated when the absence of improvement had no overt etiology and after excluding any infectious cause. It was therefore suspected that the persistent respiratory insufficiency might be linked to an ARDS that was no longer related to COVID-19, and that the pathology could respond to steroids. In line with this, the development of organizing pneumonia after COVID-19 infection has been described in several case-reports. These are only four observations but they point to the need for a more detailed evaluation of the evolution of etiology and underlying histology in persistent ARDS.

This study has limitations, including its observational retrospective design and relatively small sample size. Additionally, a potential selection bias has occurred by excluding patients who died before day 50 on ECMO. However, the study's strength lies in the highly standardized management of patients at an experienced ECMO center, which facilitated a detailed analysis of Vt and FDO 2 trends over time.

### Dexamethasone for inpatients with COVID-19 in a national cohort [^11512oMQ]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Patient Selection

We selected adult patients (aged > 17 years), hospitalized and alive for at least 48 hours, with an International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision diagnosis code for COVID-19, as well as respiratory illness during the same encounter. The level of oxygen support was categorized using a modified World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 1), and available data on liters per minute of supplemental oxygen delivered were used to stratify patients into 4 analytic cohorts on the basis of their daily supplemental oxygen requirement. We excluded patients with consecutive missing ordinal scale status and those who received dexamethasone before admission (eAppendix 2, eFigure 3, and eFigure 4 in Supplement 1). The eligible population was stratified into 4 cohorts: (1) no supplemental oxygen, (2) supplemental oxygen, (3) noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), and (4) MV and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Patients were eligible for a given cohort if they were hospitalized at that level of oxygen support (immediately eligible) or stepped up to that level of oxygen support without previously starting systemic steroids. Patients were included in a given cohort at the first time of eligibility, regardless of changes to oxygen support that could arise during subsequent follow-up for outcomes. Patients were required to remain alive and under follow-up for 48 hours after initial eligibility, and patients who started a steroid other than dexamethasone within this window were excluded. The question of interest for each cohort was, for a hospitalized patient who immediately received or required escalation to a particular level of supplemental oxygen support, what was the association with outcome of starting dexamethasone within 48 hours vs not starting any steroid in that time?

### The role of rescue therapies in the treatment of severe ARDS [^1156Dq2b]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

ARDS is characterized by a non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema with bilateral chest radiograph opacities and hypoxemia refractory to oxygen therapy. It is a common cause of admission to the ICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Corticosteroids are not recommended in ARDS patients. Rescue therapies alleviate hypoxemia in patients unable to maintain reasonable oxygenation: recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, inhaled nitric oxide, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation improve oxygenation, but their impact on mortality remains unproven. Restrictive fluid management seems to be a favorable strategy with no significant reduction in 60-d mortality. Future studies are needed to clarify the efficacy of these therapies on outcomes in patients with severe ARDS, and institution of these therapies may be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Of the entire cohort, 13 patients (93%) were treated with an initial 10-day course of Dexamethasone. Four subsequently received a second course of steroids, as their condition did not improve despite the absence of complications, especially infections. Infections were screened by daily blood cultures, bronchoalveolar lavage, and plasma PCRs for at least cytomegalovirus and herpes detection. Treatment consisted of methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg daily for three days, followed by a tapering regimen at the physician's discretion. The second course of corticoid treatment was initiated at 6, 8, 12, and 15 weeks after initiation of VV-ECMO. In all these patients, treatment was associated with improved oxygen requirements (decreasing FDO2) and increased Vt within one week. ECMO could be weaned within two to seven weeks (Fig. 3).

### Effect of hydrocortisone on 21-day mortality or respiratory support among critically ill patients with COVID-19: a randomized clinical trial [^114nm7Kt]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with severe lung damage. Corticosteroids are a possible therapeutic option.

Objective

To determine the effect of hydrocortisone on treatment failure on day 21 in critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and acute respiratory failure.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter randomized double-blind sequential trial conducted in France, with interim analyses planned every 50 patients. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure were enrolled from March 7 to June 1, 2020, with last follow-up on June 29, 2020. The study intended to enroll 290 patients but was stopped early following the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive low-dose hydrocortisone (n = 76) or placebo (n = 73).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome, treatment failure on day 21, was defined as death or persistent dependency on mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy. Prespecified secondary outcomes included the need for tracheal intubation (among patients not intubated at baseline); cumulative incidences (until day 21) of prone position sessions, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and inhaled nitric oxide; Pao2:Fio2 ratio measured daily from day 1 to day 7, then on days 14 and 21; and the proportion of patients with secondary infections during their ICU stay.

Results

The study was stopped after 149 patients (mean age, 62.2 years; 30.2% women; 81.2% mechanically ventilated) were enrolled. One hundred forty-eight patients (99.3%) completed the study, and there were 69 treatment failure events, including 11 deaths in the hydrocortisone group and 20 deaths in the placebo group. The primary outcome, treatment failure on day 21, occurred in 32 of 76 patients (42.1%) in the hydrocortisone group compared with 37 of 73 (50.7%) in the placebo group (difference of proportions, -8.6% [95.48% CI, -24.9% to 7.7%]; p = 0.29). Of the 4 prespecified secondary outcomes, none showed a significant difference. No serious adverse events were related to the study treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure, low-dose hydrocortisone, compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce treatment failure (defined as death or persistent respiratory support) at day 21. However, the study was stopped early and likely was underpowered to find a statistically and clinically important difference in the primary outcome.

The role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the management of patients with COVID-19 continues to evolve. The purpose of this analysis is to review our multi-institutional clinical experience involving 200 consecutive patients at 29 hospitals with confirmed COVID-19 supported with ECMO.

Methods

This analysis includes our first 200 COVID-19 patients with complete data who were supported with and separated from ECMO. These patients were cannulated between March 17 and December 1, 2020. Differences by mortality group were assessed using χ 2 tests for categoric variables and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests and Welch's analysis of variance for continuous variables.

Results

Median ECMO time was 15 days (interquartile range, 9 to 28). All 200 patients have separated from ECMO: 90 patients (45%) survived and 110 patients (55%) died. Survival with venovenous ECMO was 87 of 188 patients (46.3%), whereas survival with venoarterial ECMO was 3 of 12 patients (25%). Of 90 survivors, 77 have been discharged from the hospital and 13 remain hospitalized at the ECMO-providing hospital. Survivors had lower median age (47 versus 56 years, P < .001) and shorter median time from diagnosis to ECMO cannulation (8 versus 12 days, P = 0.003). For the 90 survivors, adjunctive therapies on ECMO included intravenous steroids (64), remdesivir (49), convalescent plasma (43), anti-interleukin-6 receptor blockers (39), prostaglandin (33), and hydroxychloroquine (22).

Conclusions

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation facilitates survival of select critically ill patients with COVID-19. Survivors tend to be younger and have a shorter duration from diagnosis to cannulation. Substantial variation exists in drug treatment of COVID-19, but ECMO offers a reasonable rescue strategy.

### Clinical impact of stress dose steroids in patients with septic shock: insights from the PROWESS-shock trial [^112KeLz5]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

In the midst of these conflicting results, two recent observational studies were published that brought a little light to these issues. The first study from Katsenos et al. showed a potential mortality benefit from early initiation of steroids (in the first 9 hours after vasopressors). However, these results are compromised by several limitations, namely the small and asymmetric sample size, the fact that the impact of steroid therapy was not adjusted for clinical severity nor organ dysfunction, and the very high mortality rate at 28 days (almost 70% in patients with late steroid initiation). The study from Funk et al. was a large retrospective multicenter propensity-matched cohort study that showed no benefit from low-dose corticosteroids in septic shock patients either in 30-day mortality or vasopressor dependence. However, in those with higher severity, with APACHE II ≥ 30, there might be a benefit, whereas in the lower clinical-severity quartiles there might be potential harm. Similarly, this study has also several limitations, in particular the very long period of patient inclusion (11 years) during which a marked change in mortality was expectable, and the propensity score did not include variables associated with shock severity, namely the SOFA score or the number and dose of vasopressors. Finally, almost 16% of low-dose corticosteroids given to septic shock patients did not have APACHE II score recorded.

### Variation in survival in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a multi-institutional analysis of 594 consecutive patients with coronavirus disease 2019 supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at 49 hospitals within 21 States [^114e4FTu]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We reviewed 594 consecutive patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at 49 hospitals within 21 states and examined patient characteristics, treatments, and variation in outcomes over the course of the pandemic.

Methods

A multi-institutional database was used to assess all patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 cannulated for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between March 17, 2020, and December 20, 2021, inclusive, and separated from ECMO on or prior to January 14, 2022. Descriptive analysis was stratified by 4 time categories: group A = March 2020 to June 2020, group B = July 2020 to December 2020, group C = January 2021 to June 2021, group D = July 2021 to December 2021. A Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression was used to assess continuous trends in survival where time was operationalized as the number of days between each patient's cannulation and that of the first patient in March 2020, controlling for multiple variables and risk factors.

Results

At hospital discharge, of 594 patients, 221 survived (37.2%) and 373 died. Throughout the study, median age [interquartile range] declined (group A = 51.0 [41.0–60.0] years, group D = 39.0 [32.0–48.0] years, P < .001); median days between Coronavirus Disease 2019 diagnosis and intubation increased (group A = 4.0 [1.0–8.5], group D = 9.0 [5.0–14.5], P < .001); and use of medications (glucocorticoids, interleukin-6 blockers, antivirals, antimalarials) and convalescent plasma fluctuated significantly (all P < .05). Estimated odds of survival varied over the study period with a decline between April 1, 2020, and November 21, 2020 (odds ratio, 0.39, 95% credible interval, 0.18–0.87, probability of reduction in survival = 95.7%), improvement between November 21, 2020, and May 17, 2021 (odds ratio, 1.85, 95% credible interval, 0.86–4.09, probability of improvement = 93.4%), and decline between May 17, 2021, and December 1, 2021 (odds ratio, 0.49, 95% credible interval, 0.19–1.44, probability of decrease = 92.1%).

Conclusions

Survival for patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has fluctuated during the stages of the pandemic. Minimizing variability by adherence to best practices may refine the optimal use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in a pandemic response.

### Potential for recovery after extremely prolonged VV-ECMO support in well-selected severe COVID-19 patients: a retrospective cohort study [^113vbdPt]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

VenoVenous ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VV-ECMO) has been widely used as supportive therapy for severe respiratory failure related to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Only a few data describe the maximum time under VV-ECMO during which pulmonary recovery remains possible. The main objective of this study is to describe the outcomes of prolonged VV-ECMO in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS.

Methods

This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary ECMO center in Brussels, Belgium, between March 2020 and April 2022. All adult patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 who were managed with ECMO therapy for more than 50 days as a bridge to recovery were included.

Results

Fourteen patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean duration of VV-ECMO was 87 ± 29 days. Ten (71%) patients were discharged alive from the hospital. The 90-day survival was 86%, and the one-year survival was 71%. The evolution of the patients was characterized by very impaired pulmonary compliance that started to improve slowly and progressively on day 53 (± 25) after the start of ECMO. Of note, four patients improved substantially after a second course of steroids.

Conclusions

There is potential for recovery in patients with very severe ARDS due to COVID-19 supported by VV-ECMO for up to 151 days.

### Extracorporeal hemoadsorption in critically ill COVID-19 patients on VV ECMO: the cytoSorb therapy in COVID-19 (CTC) registry [^112Pb7DS]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 100 critically ill patients meeting the EUA clinical criteria of life-threatening respiratory failure treated with combined ECMO and hemoadsorption therapy at 5 US centers between April 2020 and January 2022 comprised the study cohort.

Demographics and baseline physiological parameters

Demographic data and baseline characteristics for the entire study group as well as for early and late treatment subgroups are depicted in Table 1. Patients had a mean age of 44 years and 63% were male. All patients had evidence of hyperinflammation before the start of hemoadsorption indicated by high ferritin (median 1132 [618–2592] ng/mL) and/or CRP (median 116 [43–234] mg/L) levels. Most patients had moderately elevated D-dimer levels (median 2.11 [1.29–5.57] ug/mL. Patients had severe respiratory failure as indicated by the need for VV ECMO, and baseline median values of PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio of 73 [62–154] mmHg, PEEP of 14 [10–15] cm H 2 O, and P peak of 29 [25–35] cm H 2 O.

Table 1
Demographics and baseline characteristics

Data are presented as n (%), median [interquartile range] or mean ± standard deviation as appropriate

Patients in the G L (late initiation of CytoSorb > 87 h from ICU admission) group were older and had fewer comorbidities compared with the G E (early initiation of CytoSorb ≤ 87 h from ICU admission) group. In G E hemoadsorption was started almost immediately following cannulation and the initiation of VV ECMO, while there was a significant delay in G L (Table 1). There were no other significant differences in demographics or baseline biomarker levels. Patients in G E required significantly higher PEEP, P peak, and driving pressure at baseline (Table 1). The PaO 2 /FiO 2, PaCO 2 and lactate levels did not differ significantly between the groups.

Approximately 90% of patients received at least one medication for treatment of COVID-19 (i.e. anakinra, azithromycin, betamethasone, convalescent plasma, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone, prednisolone, remestemcel-l, ritonavir, remdesivir, lopinavir, sarilumab, siltuximab and tocilizumab) before being placed on ECMO, with 45% of patients continuing to receive treatment during ECMO.

### Evolving outcomes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for severe COVID-19 ARDS in sorbonne hospitals, paris [^1111FZtd]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Patient mortality 90 days after starting ECMO support in our experienced center for the most severe forms of COVID-19 ARDS increased from 36% before to 48% after July 1, 2020. Patients admitted after that date were older, had longer ICU-admission-to-intubation intervals, with more frequent HFNO or NIV use, and most of them had received dexamethasone at ECMO onset. Independent pre-ECMO predictors of 90-day mortality for the entire cohort were older age, longer ICU-admission-to-ECMO interval, cardiovascular dysfunction, not having received dexamethasone and being admitted after July 1, 2020.

The higher mortality rate of our ECMO-treated COVID-19 patients admitted after July 1, 2020, was unexpected. Differences in patient characteristics, management and SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity might explain that observation. First, the responsibility of pathogenicity seems unlikely, since the original European SARS-CoV-2 represented > 90% of strains circulating in France until mi-January 2021, after which the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant progressively became dominant. Second, most patient characteristics were comparable for the two periods, except for a 5-year higher median age during the second period. However, pre-ECMO patient management differed markedly after July 1, 2020. After RECOVERY trial results (published in June 2020) demonstrated lower mortality of patients randomized to receive 10 days of dexamethasone (6 mg/day) compared to usual care of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients (29% vs. 41%, respectively), most patients received corticosteroids. Pertinently, having started dexamethasone pre-ECMO was significantly associated with lower 90-day mortality in our predictive model. Also, more frequent use of dexamethasone and high-dose corticosteroids for persistent ARDS after July 1 was not associated with a higher rate of infectious complications.

### Role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in children with sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116fL2CG]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The use of ECMO to resuscitate and support children with sepsis and refractory shock is feasible and is associated with survival rates as high as 59%. Neonates had higher survival rates and central cannulation may be associated with better outcomes in children needing ECMO with sepsis. Despite the limitations of studies included in this metanalysis, the aggregate data indicate that survival for patients treated with septic shock overall justifies recommendation to consider ECMO in refractory septic shock for all pediatric age groups. Future studies should provide more evidence to inform on timing and thresholds for ECMO initiation, including dynamic assessment of response to therapy/deterioration.

NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — shock key considerations emphasize that early, aggressive IV fluid administration is essential in the treatment of suspected septic shock; patients predisposed to shock include immunocompromised (patients undergoing chemotherapy or with a primary or acquired immunodeficiency), adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, chronic or recent steroid use), and those with a history of a solid organ or bone marrow transplant as well as infants and elderly; in most adults, tachycardia is the first sign of compensated shock and may persist for hours, whereas in children tachycardia can be a late sign and a tachycardic child may be close to cardiovascular collapse; hypotension indicates uncompensated shock, which may progress to cardiopulmonary failure within minutes and is a late and ominous sign in pediatric uncompensated shock; for adrenal insufficiency, hydrocortisone succinate, if available, is preferred over methylprednisolone and dexamethasone, hydrocortisone should be considered for any patient showing signs of treatment-resistant shock, and patients with adrenal insufficiency may have an emergency dose of hydrocortisone available that can be administered IV or IM.

Septic shock — dose and duration when corticosteroids are used: If using corticosteroids for septic shock, we suggest using long course and low dose (e.g. IV hydrocortisone < 400 mg/day for at ≥ 3 days at full dose) rather than high dose and short course in adult patients with septic shock (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). The task force suggests the use of low-dose IV hydrocortisone < 400 mg/day for at least 3 days at full dose in adult patients with septic shock that is not responsive to fluid and moderate- to high-dose (> 0.1 μg/kg/min of norepinephrine or equivalent) vasopressor therapy; survival benefits were associated with lower doses (< 400 mg of hydrocortisone or equivalent per day) and longer duration (3 or more days at the full dose).

### Management of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome: a primer [^115KgUGP]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

This narrative review explores the physiology and evidence-based management of patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and refractory hypoxemia, with a focus on mechanical ventilation, adjunctive therapies, and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO). Severe ARDS cases increased dramatically worldwide during the Covid-19 pandemic and carry a high mortality. The mainstay of treatment to improve survival and ventilator-free days is proning, conservative fluid management, and lung protective ventilation. Ventilator settings should be individualized when possible to improve patient-ventilator synchrony and reduce ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Positive end-expiratory pressure can be individualized by titrating to best respiratory system compliance, or by using advanced methods, such as electrical impedance tomography or esophageal manometry. Adjustments to mitigate high driving pressure and mechanical power, two possible drivers of VILI, may be further beneficial. In patients with refractory hypoxemia, salvage modes of ventilation such as high frequency oscillatory ventilation and airway pressure release ventilation are additional options that may be appropriate in select patients. Adjunctive therapies also may be applied judiciously, such as recruitment maneuvers, inhaled pulmonary vasodilators, neuromuscular blockers, or glucocorticoids, and may improve oxygenation, but do not clearly reduce mortality. In select, refractory cases, the addition of V-V ECMO improves gas exchange and modestly improves survival by allowing for lung rest. In addition to VILI, patients with severe ARDS are at risk for complications including acute cor pulmonale, physical debility, and neurocognitive deficits. Even among the most severe cases, ARDS is a heterogeneous disease, and future studies are needed to identify ARDS subgroups to individualize therapies and advance care.

### AAST critical care committee clinical consensus: ECMO, nutrition [^113jjWcc]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

What should the expected survival be for trauma patients supported by ECMO?

Recommendation: Individual centers should have process improvement strategies in place to ensure this high-risk patient population receives optimal care.

Discussion: In evaluating the literature on ECMO, survival rates for trauma patients range from 28% to 74.1% in small cohort studies. In the largest analysis of the ELSO registry focused on trauma patients, survival to discharge was 61% in a cohort of 279 patients. This compared favorably to non-trauma indications for ECMO. In one study of 80 trauma patients, Injury Severity Score (ISS) was the only significant difference between survivors and non-survivors (ISS 24 (10–30) vs 29 (21–38)). Another study in a more severely ill cohort demonstrated similar findings (ISS 46.5 ± 16.3 vs 65 ± 9.6), suggesting that the severity of the underlying traumatic injury remains an important determinant of survival after ECMO.

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Evidence and implementation — steroid timing and cuff leak test use: We assumed a 1-day delay in extubation after a failed cuff leak test, but two trials of administering systemic steroids found that extubation was delayed by only 4 to 12 hours. In addition to our analysis above, systemic steroid use was further supported by a randomized, double-blind trial of methylprednisolone (four 20-mg doses administered over 12 h) versus placebo before extubation in all patients (a cuff leak test was not performed), which found that steroids reduced postextubation stridor, reintubations, and reintubations due to postextubation stridor. The panel concluded that the cuff leak test should be reserved for high-risk patients and considered the postextubation stridor rate [2.7%] versus the downsides of cuff leak–guided management, including a large absolute increase in the delayed extubation rate [9.2%].

### The role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in COVID-19 [^114dMn12]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

An extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program is an important component in the management of patients with COVID-19, but it is imperative to implement a system that is well-supported by the institution and staffed with well-trained clinicians to both optimize patient outcomes and to keep providers safe. There are many unknowns related to COVID-19, and one of the most challenging aspects for clinicians is the lack of predictive knowledge as to why some patients fail medical therapy and require advanced support such as ECMO. These factors can create challenges during a time of resource scarcity and interruptions in the supply chain. In the current environment, in which resources are limited and an ongoing pandemic, healthcare practitioners need to focus on evidence-based best practice for supportive care of patients with COVID-19 in refractory respiratory or cardiac failure. with As experience is gained, a greater understanding will develop in this cohort of patients regarding need and timing of ECMO. As this pandemic continues, it will be important to compile and analyze multicentered data pertaining to patient-specific outcomes to help guide clinicians caring for patients with COVID-19 undergoing ECMO support. In this paper, the authors demonstrate the strategies utilized by a major quaternary care center in the utilization and management of ECMO for patients with COVID-19.

Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the 2008 consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) in adult and pediatric patients.

Participants

A multispecialty task force of 16 international experts in critical care medicine, endocrinology, and guideline methods, all of them members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and/or the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine.

Design/Methods

The recommendations were based on the summarized evidence from the 2008 document in addition to more recent findings from an updated systematic review of relevant studies from 2008 to 2017 and were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The strength of each recommendation was classified as strong or conditional, and the quality of evidence was rated from high to very low based on factors including the individual study design, the risk of bias, the consistency of the results, and the directness and precision of the evidence. Recommendation approval required the agreement of at least 80% of the task force members.

Results

The task force was unable to reach agreement on a single test that can reliably diagnose CIRCI, although delta cortisol (change in baseline cortisol at 60min of < 9 μg/dL) after cosyntropin (250 μg) administration and a random plasma cortisol of < 10 μg/dL may be used by clinicians. We suggest against using plasma-free cortisol or salivary cortisol level over plasma total cortisol (conditional, very low quality of evidence). For treatment of specific conditions, we suggest using IV hydrocortisone < 400mg/day for ≥ 3 days at full dose in patients with septic shock that is not responsive to fluid and moderate- to high-dose vasopressor therapy (conditional, low quality of evidence). We suggest not using corticosteroids in adult patients with sepsis without shock (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest the use of IV methylprednisolone 1mg/kg/day in patients with early moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2/FiO2 < 200 and within 14 days of onset) (conditional, moderate quality of evidence). Corticosteroids are not suggested for patients with major trauma (conditional, low quality of evidence).

Conclusions

Evidence-based recommendations for the use of corticosteroids in critically ill patients with sepsis and septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and major trauma have been developed by a multispecialty task force.

### A narrative review on antimicrobial dosing in adult critically ill patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^1174suRR]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Not only can the circuit affect drug delivery, but physiologic changes in patients requiring ECMO can be substantial and may require alternative dosing strategies. Patients receiving ECMO frequently have increased Vd secondary to their critical illness, and the associated fluid resuscitation, fluid retention, and low protein states. Low protein state leads to increase in the fraction of unbound drug, which makes these drugs more available for elimination and distribution. Kidney and liver failure can also affect drug metabolism and excretion, further complicating effective antimicrobial management. Patients who are receiving ECMO have significant immune activation and may have a suboptimal response to antimicrobials leading to more adverse outcomes with decreased antimicrobial exposure. These patient factors are dynamic and can change rapidly. Implications of the infection itself, including the site, causative microorganism(s), and ability of the drug to achieve adequate concentration at the site also must be considered, adding further complexity beyond the circuit and patient considerations.

Understanding these complexities and optimizing antibiotic management is key to successful patient outcomes. However, there is currently limited evidence and no specific guidelines to direct optimal antimicrobial dosing on ECMO, most data are based on case series and limited observational data. We review the recent clinical evidence supporting antimicrobial dosing on ECMO and summarize our recommendations for adult patients based on the strength of supporting evidence.

The variable nature of the literature for different drugs makes it challenging to form generalized statements summarizing each antimicrobial classifications. Hence, we urge the reader to attempt to read and understand drugs in an individual context. For ease, we will include a summary statement at the end of each drug. Throughout this article, the term "standard dosing" refers to a dose of antimicrobials used for a patient with normal organ function and normal range of weight indicated for the infection(s) that the antimicrobial agent is used for.

### Timing of initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and outcomes among patients with cardiogenic shock [^112tj4AY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study carries all the same limitations as other retrospective analyses of registry data, including selection bias insofar as all patients in this cohort received ECMO. Most importantly, this analysis cannot demonstrate causation due to the inability to adjust for unmeasured confounders (including comorbidities), particularly the individual reasons for early versus late ECMO initiation, which cannot be discerned. Numerous factors drive the timing of ECMO initiation in clinical practice, including patient condition (eg, the severity and trajectory of CS and response to initial treatment), logistics (eg, availability of staff and equipment), patient‐level factors, and institutional or provider preferences. While we adjusted for the number of vasopressors and MCS devices provided at the time of ECMO initiation, this is a crude measure that might not have fully captured the magnitude of shock severity (particularly given the high missingness of lactate, pH, and other laboratory markers of hypoperfusion). We lacked data on the cause of CS, which could influence both the timing of ECMO initiation and its association with outcomes, as well as nonfatal complications, which could be affected by ECMO timing. We could not determine the true onset of CS, preventing us from determining the time from CS onset to ECMO initiation, which could have differed from the time from admission to ECMO initiation. Insofar as all patients in the ELSO registry received ECMO, we cannot comment on the outcomes of these patients with another form of hemodynamic support, and it is possible that patients who received early ECMO could have done well with an alternative strategy. Without vasopressor doses, we could not precisely evaluate total vasopressor load at the time of ECMO initiation, which is an important predictor of death in patients with CS.

### Hydrocortisone treatment in early sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome: results of a randomized controlled trial [^116Qftbs]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Our trial is a single-center RCT, which may raise concerns regarding the generalization of the results based on participants' characteristics and the intervention tested. In comparison with our study, severity of illness scores and LISs were higher in five RCTs and similar in two RCTs. Fundamental variables of the treatment protocol that may significantly affect overall response to glucocorticoid treatment in ARDS include study drug, dosage, and duration of administration, including tapering. Our treatment intervention was comparable to the one investigated in the two RCTs with lower severity of illness and differed from the other five RCTs by study drug (hydrocortisone vs. hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone or methylprednisolone), duration of treatment (7 days vs. 14–28 days), and tapering (lack of tapering vs. slow tapering).

In the past exogenous glucocorticoids were thought to be qualitatively indistinguishable because they act via the same receptor, but qualitative differences have been discovered, and one glucocorticoid cannot be simply replaced by another. In reference to the RCTs described above, hydrocortisone has (1) less anti-inflammatory potency when it is not combined with fludrocortisone (a drug with both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid activities) and (2) lesser direct inhibitory NF-κB activity than methylprednisolone (half-maximal inhibitory concentration for NF-κB inhibition 16 and 2.8, respectively). Methylprednisolone, because of its greater penetration in lung tissue and longer residence time, is the most frequently used intravenous glucocorticoid for the treatment of severe acute inflammatory lung diseases.

New understanding of the central role played by glucocorticoids in resolution of inflammation and restoration of tissue homeostasis provides support for longer duration of treatment incorporating slow tapering (up to 4 weeks). A recent IPD meta-analysis demonstrates that lack of glucocorticoid tapering after extubation of patients with ARDS is frequently associated with clinical deterioration and return to MV. Similarly, researchers in a comparison study of two concurrent RCTs — hydrocortisone 7-day infusion vs. prolonged methylprednisolone — reported that removing hydrocortisone without tapering led to a rebound of systemic inflammation with worsening organ dysfunction requiring reintubation. In our study, we did not measure markers of inflammation and cannot comment on the presence of rebound inflammation. After completion of study treatment, however, the hydrocortisone group continued to demonstrate improved gas exchange and LIS, and the two groups had a similar rate of reintubation by day 28. While these findings may suggest that a clinically significant rebound effect is less likely, most patients (n = 55) had hydrocortisone treatment discontinued prior to extubation, masking a possible rebound.

### Antibiotics and extracorporeal circulation – one size does not fit all [^1179oLts]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

In a recent edition of Critical Care, on behalf of the Antibiotic, Sedative and Analgesic Pharmacokinetics during Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation study investigators, Shekar and colleagues assessed meropenem pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), with or without continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

Patients on ECMO commonly have infections, reaching rates of more than 15 per 1,000 ECMO days according to data pooled from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry, and these infections are associated with increased mortality. There is also increasing evidence that initial antibiotic appropriateness impacts the outcome of severe infections. To ensure maximal bacterial killing, antibiotics should achieve adequate exposure as soon as possible; that is, an adequate concentration during an ideal time, according to the antibiotic's characteristics. Consequently, not only starting an antibiotic but also selecting an ideal dose is crucial for therapeutic success.

High antibiotic doses are usually needed to achieve therapeutic concentrations early in the infection course. This has been shown for β-lactams, vancomycin and aminoglycosides, implying the need for higher than recommended doses. These high doses may also be necessary to overcome the impact of bacteria resistance, especially for hospital-acquired infections.

Antibiotics are usually prescribed in a traditional pattern, taking into account only the existence of renal or liver dysfunction and considering the susceptibility pattern of the microorganism. Moreover, the antibiotic dose is usually maintained throughout the treatment course, although significant PK changes occur from the resuscitation phase to the recovery phase.

Ideally, individualized dosing strategies should account for the altered PK and pathogen susceptibility in each patient. In order to achieve this goal it is necessary to understand the full impact of therapeutic interventions and patient characteristics on antibiotic PK.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^111FWM4s]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroid dosing regimens — Common corticosteroid regimens are detailed for septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Regimens include hydrocortisone 200 mg IV per day (continuous infusion or divided every 6 hr) with or without fludrocortisone 50 μg enteral daily for 7 d or until ICU discharge. For early ARDS (within 24 hr), dexamethasone 20 mg IV daily for 5 d, then 10 mg IV daily for 5 d until extubation is described. For early ARDS, methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg IV bolus is followed by days 1–14: 1 mg/kg/d continuous infusion, days 15–21: 0.5 mg/kg/d, days 22–25: 0.25 mg/kg/d, and days 26–28: 0.125 mg/kg/d, with the note that if extubated between days 1 and 15 then advance to day 15 of regimen. For unresolving ARDS (7–21 d), methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg IV bolus is followed by days 1–14: 2 mg/kg/d divided every 6 hr, days 15–21: 1 mg/kg/d, days 22–28: 0.5 mg/kg/d, days 29–30: 0.25 mg/kg/d, and days 31–32: 0.125 mg/kg/d, with the note that if extubated before day 14, then advance to day 15 of regimen drug therapy. In severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, hydrocortisone 200 mg IV daily (for 4 or 8 d based on clinical improvement), then taper (for a total duration of 8 or 14 d duration) with discontinuation on ICU discharge is listed; alternative regimens include methylprednisolone 0.5 mg/kg IV every 12 hr for 7 d (within 36 hr of hospital admission, C-reactive protein > 150 mg/L) and methylprednisolone 40 mg IV bolus, then days 1–7: 40 mg/d, days 8–14: 20 mg/d, days 15–17: 12 mg/d, and days 18–20: 4 mg/d.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1124K3Nr]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute respiratory distress syndrome, more specifically with respect to ECMO, BTS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider initiating ECMO with lung-protective mechanical ventilation in selected patients with severe ARDS (Lung Injury Score ≥ 3 or pH < 7.20 due to uncompensated hypercapnia).

### Timing of initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and outcomes among patients with cardiogenic shock [^117TfQug]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Prior studies examining the timing of ECMO initiation have been limited. A multicenter Korean registry analysis of 362 patients with CS from mixed causes (most had acute MI and prior cardiac arrest) who underwent ECMO within 24 hours of shock onset. Patients in the lowest tertile of shock‐to‐ECMO time (< 0.9 hours) had a lower adjusted 30‐day mortality rate than intermediate (0.9–2.2 hours) or late (> 2.2 hours). Notably, the median shock‐to‐ECMO times were all within 6 hours, and the early ECMO group was within 1 hour. A prior Korean study including 253 patients with acute MI–CS found that those who had ECMO initiation before revascularization had a lower mortality rate. Likewise, among 184 patients with acute MI with CS after cardiac arrest, those who had ECMO initiation prior to revascularization had lower mortality. Together, these studies further support earlier initiation of ECMO in patients with CS requiring ECMO, particularly those with acute MI. Our analysis examined longer times to ECMO, and we found that most patients in the ELSO registry had a greater delay until ECMO was initiated than was observed in these Korean studies, highlighting the differences in the timeliness of ECMO that may exist between centers.

The recently published ECMO‐CS trial, which randomized 117 patients with severe or refractory CS to either immediate venoarterial ECMO initiation versus initial conservative therapy with rescue ECMO (which was required in > 40%) and did not show a difference in mortality rate, would seem to argue against the benefit of early ECMO in CS. While the evidence provided by this well‐conduced randomized clinical trial should not be overshadowed by observational analyses, the ECMO‐CS trial is not definitive. Importantly, enrolled patients were older (median age, 66 years) and on high vasopressor doses (median Vasoactive–Inotropic Score > 60) reflecting SCAI shock stage D and E. In our observation analysis, the association between earlier ECMO initiation and better survival appeared stronger in patients with lower shock severity, which could suggest that the shock severity in the ECMO‐CS trial population was too high (and therefore ECMO initiated too late during the disease course) to observe a benefit of ECMO in this clinical trial. Because all patients in our population received ECMO, our analysis should not be interpreted as a comparison of ECMO to medical therapy (or other forms of temporary MCS), and instead can only inform the timing of ECMO initiation among patients who have been selected to receive ECMO.

### Machines that help machines to help patients: optimising antimicrobial dosing in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and renal replacement therapy using dosing software [^116hhvKH]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Practical dosing recommendations

Currently, there are a lack of robust guidelines for dosing of drugs in critically ill adult patients receiving ECMO. The physicochemical properties of drugs can be used to predict PK changes and determine loading dose adjustments and subsequent maintenance dosing in this patient group (Table 3). Drugs with high protein binding (e.g. > 70%) and highly lipophilic (e.g. Log P > 2) are likely to be sequestered on the circuit and may require an increase in their dose, or frequency of administration. As the PK changes of increased apparent V d and altered CL may both be seen concurrently in critical illness, the use of dosing strategies derived from critically ill adult patients not on ECMO is acceptable for empiric dosing of most other drugs.

### Report of the ISHLT working group on primary lung graft dysfunction part VI: treatment [^114CtSL5]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2005). Medium credibility.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for severe primary graft dysfunction (PGD) after lung transplantation — timing, monitoring, and outcomes — are summarized as follows: For 16 ECMO patients, the 90-day and 2-year survival rates were 63% and 50%, respectively. Currently, available data indicate that early (< 24-hour) institution offers a significant survival benefit, and we suggest that ECMO should not be initiated later than 7 days post-transplant. Unless used as a bridge to re-transplant, the duration of ECMO in this setting should not be prolonged, as most of the patients that cannot be weaned off ECMO after 4 to 7 days will not survive. In patients with pulmonary hypertension (PHT), patients with PHT undergoing lung transplantation should be closely monitored for early recognition of PGD, with low threshold toward early installation of ECMO; however, at the moment, we cannot recommend prophylactic institution of ECMO for patients with PHT.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^115eq7X4]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Technical summary

The guidelines for the management of adult patients with ARDS were created by a multidisciplinary writing group constituted by the Joint Standards Committee of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine and the ICS. All group members, including lay members, are coauthors of the guideline. The group first met in 2013 and completed the guidelines in 2018. The guidelines have undergone both independent external peer review and input from stakeholder organisations.

The process for guideline creation adhered to that of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). In brief, the writing group first performed a scoping exercise on the topic, having decided that the focus should be on effective treatment interventions. Ten topics were chosen based on existing guideline recommendations and the experience of committee members. These included:

Corticosteroids.
ECMO.
ECCO 2 R.
Fluid strategy.
High-frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV).
Inhaled vasodilators (iVasoD).
Lung protective ventilation: tidal volume (Vt).
Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA).
PEEP.
Prone positioning.

Each topic was developed into a full protocol using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) formulation. Search strategies for each topic were then developed by the group information expert with a focus on systematic reviews (SR) and meta-analyses (MA). Each topic was assigned to two group members with one acting as topic lead. High-quality MA and SR were selected and the references placed in an Endnote database. Preselected outcome data were extracted from these reviews, using the most up-to-date MA where possible. Data from older MA were used if not all the preselected outcomes could be extracted from the most recent MA.

The guidelines used the internationally recognised GRADE methodology. Group members received training on the GRADE process and were given a resource pack, which included a practical guide which was created in- house. GRADE makes recommendations based on patient centred and predetermined outcomes. It does not judge the quality of individual randomised controlled trials (RCTs) but makes quality assessments on the predetermined outcomes, which, where possible, are extracted from published MA.

### Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (EOLIA) [^113CKbhg]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

Study hypothesis: ECMO, instituted early after the diagnosis of ARDS not evolving favorably after 3–6 hours under optimal ventilatory management and maximum medical treatment, would lower the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Methods: A multicenter, randomized, open trial. Twenty-three centers will participate in this project to be conducted within the REVA network. Experimental treatment arm: ECMO will be initiated as rapidly as possible by venovenous access. The material to be used consists of pre-heparinized cannulae and tubing, a centrifuge pump and a heparinized membrane oxygenator. In the case of refractory hypoxemia, the usual adjunctive therapeutics can be used: NO, prone position, HFO ventilation, almitrine infusion.

A cross-over option to ECMO will be possible in the case of refractory hypoxemia defined as blood arterial saturation SaO2 < 80% for > 6 hours, despite mandatory use of recruitment maneuvers, and inhaled NO/prostacyclin and if technically possible a test of prone position, and only if the patient has no irreversible multiple organ failure and if the physician in charge of the patient believes that this could actually change the outcome. Objective and judgement criteria: The primary endpoint is to achieve, with ECMO, significantly lower mortality on day 60.

Secondary objectives are to show: a benefit in terms of lower ICU and hospital mortality rates at D30 and D90; lower pneumothorax frequency; shortened duration of mechanical ventilation; less need for hemodynamic support with catecholamines; shorter ICU and hospital stays; and more days, between inclusion and D60, without mechanical ventilation, without organ failure and without hemodynamic support. Statistical analyses: The high mortality rate of severe ARDS justifies combining all efforts to reach a rapid conclusion and thus resorting to a sequential analytical plan, with stopping rules based on the triangular test. Thus, with 80% power and a 5% α-risk for the hypothesis of ECMO achieving a 20% absolute mortality reduction, the characteristics of the study, calculated with a triangle test, are the following: a maximum of 331 subjects to be included and a 90% probability of stopping the study before 220 subjects have been included.
