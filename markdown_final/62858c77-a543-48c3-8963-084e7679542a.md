## Question

Lower abdominal cramping with running

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about lower abdominal cramping during running. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about characterizing the pain and its red flags. Then, I should consider exercise-related mechanisms, including ischemia, mechanical factors, and nutrition. Next, I will examine demographic and physiologic risk factors, screen for serious organic disease, and finally synthesize a prioritized differential and a pragmatic management plan with triggers, nutrition, and escalation thresholds.

> Let me first confirm the pain phenotype and red flags. Lower abdominal cramping during or up to three hours after running, often described as sudden, undulating, and lasting seconds to minutes, aligns with exercise-related abdominal complaints and overlaps with functional abdominal cramping pain when no structural disease is present, so I should explicitly screen for weight loss, GI bleeding, anemia, nocturnal pain, fever, and family history of IBD or malignancy to exclude organic disease before labeling as functional [^116mQaX1] [^112MCvSf] [^113JCwPj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check exercise-related mechanisms next. Splanchnic hypoperfusion with GI ischemia during intense exertion is well described, with tonometer studies showing ischemia even at submaximal intensity in symptomatic athletes and lactate correlating with ischemic gradients during symptomatic tests, supporting a physiologic ischemic mechanism in some cases [^112Jejdf] [^1122CJxG]. Mechanically, repetitive bouncing during running plausibly irritates lower GI structures, contributing to bloating, flatulence, and urge to defecate, which explains why lower abdominal complaints are more common than upper complaints in runners [^112Jejdf] [^114CobbV].

> Wait, let me verify the nutritional contributors because they are actionable. Intake of fiber, fat, protein, and high-osmolality beverages shortly before or during exercise is associated with abdominal complaints; in habitual diet, higher fat, tea, and unhealthy choices correlate with lower abdominal complaints, and tea may act as a laxative for some, which can compound urgency and cramping during runs [^112Jejdf] [^115fMnN1] [^112UYexS]. Let me also consider fluid strategy: rehydration with plain water after dehydration may increase muscle cramp susceptibility, whereas oral rehydration solutions containing electrolytes reduce it, implying a potential role for sodium balance in some exertional cramping contexts, although this evidence is stronger for skeletal muscle cramps than for visceral pain per se [^113TZmPo].

> I should double-check risk factors. Younger age and higher training intensity are consistently associated with more abdominal complaints, and women report higher prevalence and severity, possibly related to hormonal modulation of GI function; intriguingly, experienced runners report fewer symptoms, suggesting conditioning or learned mitigation strategies, which I need to ask about explicitly during history taking [^114FHgkV] [^114CobbV] [^115b9UuR].

> Next, I should review serious organic disease exclusions. In patients with bloody diarrhea, fever, or persistent pain, I need to consider ischemic colitis, which classically presents with sudden cramping left lower abdominal pain, urgency, and hematochezia, particularly in endurance athletes; although rare, missing this would be consequential, so a low threshold for urgent evaluation is warranted [^113innnM] [^111rE81D]. I should also keep median arcuate ligament syndrome in mind for persistent side-stitch–like pain despite conservative measures, as surgical release can be curative in athletes; rare abdominal wall entities like rectus sheath hematoma can mimic acute abdomen after strenuous noncontact exercise and require imaging for diagnosis [^117LN12K] [^114JniVo].

> But wait, what if the cramping reflects an underlying FGID such as IBS rather than isolated FACP. Let me consider that FACP is defined by cramping pain without a strong association with defecation or bowel habit changes, whereas IBS requires Rome IV features; notably, among runners with IBS, moderate-intensity running may actually reduce GI symptom severity compared with rest, which can guide exercise prescriptions if IBS is present [^113JCwPj] [^116sFBAB].

> I will now examine the gynecologic differential in those with internal female genitalia. Primary dysmenorrhea presents with cramping lower abdominal pain around menses and is highly prevalent, and although exercise can improve symptoms, exertional cramping that tracks with the cycle should prompt screening for secondary causes like endometriosis or fibroids if pain is refractory or atypical [^1156KeHS] [^113VJKvp]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought dysmenorrhea might directly cause exercise-related transient abdominal pain; let me reconsider and align the mechanism with uterine ischemia and prostaglandin-mediated pain rather than the classic ETAP stitch phenomenon, which is a different entity altogether [^113E7WFv] [^1156KeHS].

> Next, I should review the medication history, because NSAIDs are common in runners and can worsen GI injury during prolonged exertion. While evidence is mixed, combining strenuous exercise, heat, and NSAIDs may increase GI permeability and endotoxin leakage, so I need to counsel minimizing pre-run NSAIDs when feasible and consider alternatives for pain control [^11772E6X]. I also need to ensure we are not dealing with exercise-induced anaphylaxis, which can present with cramping and GI symptoms alongside cutaneous, respiratory, or cardiovascular features and mandates immediate epinephrine and cessation of activity [^115FzZC3] [^115WnXiZ].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise management plan while I keep verifying what is evidence-based. For immediate strategies, I should advise avoiding fiber-, fat-, and protein-heavy meals within two to three hours pre-run, limit high-osmolality drinks, empty the bowel before longer runs, and favor moderate intensity rather than very high intensity when symptoms flare. For fluid replacement, prioritizing electrolyte-containing solutions over plain water after dehydration may reduce cramp susceptibility, although the cramp data are skeletal muscle–focused and extrapolation to visceral cramping is cautious [^112UYexS] [^115b9UuR] [^113TZmPo]. For pharmacologic options, if FACP is suspected after red flags are excluded, antispasmodics are first-line. If symptoms persist, low-dose TCAs or SSRIs can be considered for centrally mediated pain, and simple analgesics like acetaminophen can be added for pain relief while avoiding NSAIDs before hard runs [^114NXQ4S] [^11772E6X].

> Hold on, I should verify when to escalate. Persistent or progressive pain despite conservative measures, hematochezia, nocturnal pain, weight loss, or anemia should trigger evaluation for ischemic colitis, MALS, IBD, or other structural disease. Colon ischemia workup may include colonoscopy, CT angiography, or mesenteric imaging as indicated, and MALS evaluation relies on duplex ultrasound or CTA/MRA for celiac compression with supportive hemodynamics [^113innnM] [^117LN12K]. If IBS is suspected based on Rome IV features, I should integrate standard IBS management principles and consider that moderate-intensity running may be beneficial rather than harmful for symptom burden in runners with IBS [^116sFBAB].

> Let me summarize to ensure internal consistency. Lower abdominal cramping during running is common and multifactorial, driven by ischemia, mechanical bouncing, nutrition, and host factors such as age, sex, and training intensity. After excluding red flags and serious organic disease, most cases reflect functional entities or exercise-related abdominal complaints amenable to trigger modification, diet timing, hydration strategy, intensity pacing, and symptom-directed pharmacotherapy, with targeted testing reserved for refractory or alarm-feature presentations [^112Jejdf] [^112QDC5r] [^114NXQ4S].

---

Lower abdominal cramping with running is common and multifactorial, typically due to **splanchnic ischemia** [^112Jejdf] from reduced gut blood flow during intense exercise [^1122CJxG], mechanical bouncing of viscera, and dietary triggers such as high-fiber, fat, or caffeine intake [^112RFgat] [^115xz1tR]. Risk increases with female sex, younger age, higher intensity, and poor hydration [^112aimew] [^112Jejdf]. Management includes optimizing pre-run nutrition (low-fiber, low-fat, avoid caffeine) [^115xz1tR], hydrating with electrolytes [^113TZmPo], and pacing intensity; persistent or severe cramps warrant evaluation for IBS, ischemic colitis, or gynecologic causes [^112MCvSf] [^113innnM] [^113wXzBg].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **interconnected mechanisms** underlie lower abdominal cramping during running:

- **Splanchnic ischemia**: Reduced splanchnic blood flow during intense exercise causes transient ischemia, leading to cramping and discomfort [^112Jejdf].

- **Mechanical factors**: Repetitive bouncing and jarring during running can irritate the lower GI tract, causing cramping [^114CobbV].

- **Nutritional factors**: High-fiber, high-fat, or caffeine-containing foods/drinks consumed before or during running can trigger cramps [^112Jejdf].

- **Hydration status**: Dehydration or electrolyte imbalance can exacerbate cramping [^113TZmPo].

---

## Prevalence and demographic factors

Lower abdominal cramping is highly prevalent among runners, with studies reporting rates of 30–90% depending on intensity and duration [^112Jejdf]. Demographic factors include:

| **Factor** | **Association with lower abdominal cramping** |
|-|-|
| Sex | Higher prevalence in females [^112aimew] |
| Age | More common in younger runners [^114FHgkV] |
| Training intensity | Higher intensity increases risk [^115b9UuR] |
| Dietary habits | Poor diet quality increases risk [^112RFgat] |

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

Clinical evaluation should include a **detailed history** of the pain's characteristics, timing, dietary intake, hydration, and associated symptoms. Red flags (e.g. weight loss, rectal bleeding, fever) warrant further investigation [^112QDC5r]. Diagnostic tests (e.g. ultrasound, endoscopy) are reserved for persistent or severe cases to exclude organic pathology [^notfound].

---

## Preventive strategies

Effective **preventive strategies** include:

- **Dietary modifications**: Avoid high-fiber, high-fat, and caffeine-containing foods 2–4 hours before running [^115xz1tR].

- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate hydration with electrolyte-containing fluids [^113TZmPo].

- **Training adjustments**: Gradually increase intensity and duration; incorporate warm-up and cool-down routines [^1127EBPy].

- **Defecation**: Empty the bowels before running [^114CobbV].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment depends on severity and underlying cause. Mild cramps may respond to **rest, hydration, and dietary adjustments** [^114NXQ4S]; persistent or severe cramps may require pharmacological interventions such as antispasmodics or antidiarrheal agents. Underlying conditions (e.g. IBS, ischemic colitis) should be treated specifically [^114NXQ4S].

---

## Potential complications

Although typically benign, persistent lower abdominal cramping can lead to **reduced performance**, dehydration, and psychological distress. Rare complications include ischemic colitis or gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in ultra-endurance athletes [^111rE81D] [^11772E6X].

---

Lower abdominal cramping with running is common and multifactorial, driven by ischemia, mechanical stress, and diet; it is also influenced by sex, age, and training intensity. Most cases respond to **preventive measures** and conservative care, but persistent or severe symptoms require evaluation for underlying pathology.

Acute abdomen is a common presentation to the emergency department (ED), accounting for 5% to 10% of ED visits. Of these, 10% require surgery, and 25% go undiagnosed. Usually, most of the cases of undiagnosed abdominal pain are in young women with pelvic etiologies, although occasionally, unusual causes of abdominal pain lead to diagnostic dilemmas and can have adverse clinical outcomes. We present an unusual etiology of abdominal pain in a young man, who presented with acute onset of right lower quadrant pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He was an amateur boxer who had recently intensified his training regimen and admitted to binge drinking for several days before presentation. The initial diagnosis was acute appendicitis, but a computed tomographic scan done revealed a normal appendix. Creatine kinase level was then checked and found to be significantly elevated, and a diagnosis of isolated abdominal wall rhabdomyolysis was made.

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF FACP IN PRIMARY CARE

Recommendations:

Mild, infrequent episodes of FACP may only require reassurance and advice (including avoidance of trigger foods), whereas more intensive and/or frequent episodes usually require therapeutic intervention.
Many patients with FACP who present to primary care may require empirical treatment with an antispasmodic, the choice of which will depend on local availability and individual preference. If the first drug does not provide adequate symptom relief, it might be worthwhile to try an alternative antispasmodic.
Patients who obtain little or no relief from their FACP with an antispasmodic may benefit from additional analgesia, for example, with acetaminophen (paracetamol).
Patients with centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome may respond to low doses of tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or to the neuromodulator pregabalin.
Relaxation training and targeted psychological interventions may be the helpful adjunctive therapies for selected patients who suffer from stress and/or have preexisting psychiatric comorbidities.

Comments

The management of FACP depends on the intensity and frequency of presentation. The occurrence of mild, infrequent episodes often only requires reassurance and advice, whereas the presentation of more intensive and/or frequent symptoms will usually necessitate therapeutic intervention. It should be noted that FACP in patients with IBS (ie, FACP associated with changes in bowel habits or stool form, according to Rome IV criteria) should be managed in line with current IBS guidelines.–

Among all patients presenting with FACP, there are many considerations for determining the optimal approach to symptom management. Patient-specific factors to be considered include age, sex, onset of pain, location of pain, duration of pain, pain variations, quality of pain, concomitant symptoms, lifestyle, aggravators, and relieving factors. Patients with mild FACP can usually be managed by reassuring them that the cause of their pain is not sinister and by advising them to avoid foods or drinks that may trigger and/or exacerbate symptoms and to avoid stress. Patients may be advised to return to their usual diet if a dietary elimination trial is unsuccessful. As recommended for IBS patients, it also seems sensible to provide general guidance on maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle.

SELF-MANAGEMENT OF FACP

Recommendations:

Self-management of FACP using over-the-counter products is appropriate for many patients with mild, nonpersistent symptoms.
To enable better self-care, patients and pharmacists require education and information on signs and symptoms to be aware of, and which treatments to use.

Comments

Self-care of gastrointestinal symptoms that impact quality of life, but which are not associated with a significant impairment in a person's ability to carry out daily activities and are not associated with obvious symptoms of structural disease, is commonplace. Rates of health care seeking, self-care (over-the-counter drug use), and overall medication use among patients with symptoms of FACP do, nevertheless, vary across countries and regions. For example, greater use of medications for managing FACP (comprising mainly over-the-counter products) has been reported in the United States and Latin America than in Europe (90% vs. 72%, respectively). Reasons for preferring self-management approaches among patients with FACP may include cultural differences in the perception of and response to symptoms, and limitations in access to drugs and physician care.

Self-management of FACP typically involves the use of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and/or nonpharmacologic products, with or without consultation with a pharmacist. As self-management of FACP is so common, particularly on first presentation of symptoms, both patients and pharmacists require education and information on signs and symptoms to be aware of (including red flags that may necessitate a health care consultation) and which treatments to use, which will vary depending on local practice and preferences, and product availability.

### Exercise-related abdominal complaints in a large cohort of runners: a survey with a particular focus on nutrition [^116mQaX1]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Assessment of AC and their impact

The general questionnaire not only contained questions about general participants' characteristics and running habits but also included validated and/or previously used questionnaires about tendon injuries (which was the focus of a separate study) and AC. The AC questions were selected from multiple questionnaires that were previously used, mainly in IBS patients. After the initial development of the general questionnaire, it was critically reviewed by the research team and it was circulated among 50 volunteers to receive feedback on, among others, clarity and unambiguous formulation.

Regarding AC, the occurrence of specific symptoms during and/or shortly (ie, up to 3 hours) after running was asked, for nine symptoms independently: nausea/vomiting, reflux, side stitch, bloating, flatulence, urge to defecate, faecal incontinence, diarrhoea and constipation. Runners were instructed to indicate a complaint only if they experienced this as bothersome. No specific time frame was specified for the occurrence of AC, but the questions were formulated so that they would be a present issue when running.

Additionally, runners were asked to rate the severity of the nine symptoms. Each symptom could be scored on a scale from 0 (not bothersome) to 100 points (very bothersome), resulting in a maximum total score of 900 points. If runners indicated that a symptom occurred, but they did not fill in a score, this missing value was set to 0.

Finally, runners were asked about the perceived impact of AC and personal experiences with nutrition and AC.

For the analyses, the nine symptoms were divided into upper AC (UAC) (nausea/vomiting and reflux) and lower AC (LAC) (side stitch, bloating, flatulence, urge to defecate, faecal incontinence, diarrhoea and constipation). Runners with AC during and/or shortly after running were compared with runners without AC regarding personal characteristics, running characteristics and nutritional factors. This was done separately for UAC and LAC. Runners were placed in the group with UAC and/or LAC if the severity score during and/or shortly after running for one or more of the respective UAC and LAC symptoms was indicated to be above 0.

Exercise-induced anaphylaxis (EIA) — features and field approach: Exercise-induced anaphylaxis occurs less commonly than other causes of anaphylaxis, and symptoms occur shortly after the onset of exercise with manifestations including rhinorrhea, pruritus, flushing or urticaria, abdominal cramping with nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Symptoms of EIA (and FDEIA) typically resolve with rest and prompt cessation of activity, but patients who have persistent or worsening signs and symptoms, including respiratory compromise or hypotension, should be treated with the standard therapies discussed later. Activity of any intensity may induce symptoms in the absence of an environmental allergen; however, jogging and aerobic exercise appear to be the most common causes.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) detailed fact sheet… [^113wXzBg]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

1 When present, signs and symptoms of PID are nonspecific, so other reproductive tract illnesses and diseases of both the urinary and the gastrointestinal tracts should be considered when evaluating a sexually active woman with lower abdominal pain. Pregnancy must also be excluded, as PID can occur concurrently with pregnancy. When symptoms are present, the most common symptoms of PID are.
- Lower abdominal pain
- Mild pelvic pain
- Increased vaginal discharge
- Irregular menstrual bleeding
- Fever
- Pain with intercourse
- Painful and frequent urination
- Abdominal tenderness
- Pelvic organ tenderness
- Uterine tenderness
- Adnexal tenderness
- Cervical motion tenderness
- Inflammation. Criteria have been developed for the diagnosis of PID.

7 Presumptive treatment for PID should be initiated in sexually active young women and other women at risk for STDs if they are experiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for the illness other than PID can be identified, and if one or more of the following minimum clinical criteria are present on pelvic examination:

- cervical motion tenderness or
- uterine tenderness or
- adnexal tenderness. The requirement that all three minimum criteria be present before the initiation of empiric treatment could result in insufficient sensitivity for the diagnosis of PID. After deciding whether to initiate empiric treatment, clinicians should also consider the risk profile for STDs. More elaborate diagnostic evaluation frequently is needed because incorrect diagnosis and management of PID might cause unnecessary morbidity.

For example, the presence of signs of lower-genital–tract inflammation, in addition to one of the three minimum criteria, increases the specificity of the diagnosis. One or more of the following additional criteria can be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum clinical criteria and support a diagnosis of PID: N. gonorrhoeaeor C. trachomatis. Most women with PID have either mucopurulent cervical discharge or evidence of WBCs on a microscopic evaluation of a saline preparation of vaginal fluid. If the cervical discharge appears normal and no WBCs are observed on the wet prep of vaginal fluid, the diagnosis of PID is unlikely, and alternative causes of pain should be considered. A wet prep of vaginal fluid also can detect the presence of concomitant infections.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF STATEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Background

Functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) is a common complaint that may present on its own or as a predominant symptom of a functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID). Despite the studies suggesting a high prevalence of FACP in the general population, the Rome classification for FGIDs does not consider it to be a discrete symptomatic entity.

Definition

The expert panel proposes the following definition for FACP, as reported by patients with or without a diagnosed FGID:

"FACP refers to the sudden occurrence of mild-to-moderate, undulating, and recurring cramping pain in any part of the abdomen, lasting for seconds to minutes or up to a few hours, in the absence of any "red flag" signs/symptoms of structural organic disease or any strong association with defecation (which might indicate irritable bowel syndrome [IBS]), and typically not significantly interfering with daily activities".

FACP could be perceived as reflecting part of the IBS spectrum but without a strong association with bowel irregularities. In situations where FACP is tightly linked with abnormalities of bowel evacuation, a diagnosis of IBS should be suspected, provided that patients fulfill the Rome IV diagnostic criteria.

### Skiing and intermittant claudication: an aberrant presentation [^111nuHY6]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease frequently presents with intermittent claudication, typically manifest in lower extremity pain or cramping associated with exercise, generally walking. Occasionally early onset of disease can be associated with running. This report describes the unusual presentation of leg pain associated with skiing and relieved by cessation of skiing immediately caused by focal iliac artery stenosis.

### 2017 WSES guidelines for the management of iatrogenic colonoscopy perforation [^116QhL6j]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Which are the minimum biochemical and imaging investigations that should be requested in the case of a suspected ICP?

A delay in the diagnosis of ICP is a critical issue for therapeutic outcomes; when the diagnosis is delayed more than 24 h, the chance increases that more invasive treatments (e.g. surgery) will be required. Physicians should therefore search for this potentially life-threatening complication and run clinical and biochemical tests if an ICP is suspected.

An ICP can be appreciated by direct visualization of the parietal defect or the view of intra-abdominal tissues through the colonic wall during the endoscopy. Otherwise, the diagnosis of ICP is based on clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings. The clinical presentation of an ICP can vary widely, depending on the size of the perforation, the type of etiologic agent, the affected colonic location, the degree of intra-peritoneal contamination, and the patient's general status. In the majority of patients (91–92%), symptoms develop within the first 48 h following the completion of the endoscopy. The most common symptom is abdominal pain associated with distension, although painless cases of ICP or cases with severe cramp-like pain have been described. In two large clinical series, the most consistent symptoms were abdominal pain (from 74 to 95%), guarding/rebound tenderness (82.5) with diffuse peritonitis, tachycardia (62.5%), leukocytosis (40%), fever (38%), rectal bleeding (15%), and isolated abdominal distension (6.6%). Only a small number of patients with ICP (5%) remained asymptomatic. An unusual clinical sign (1/55 patients with ICPs) was a delayed subcutaneous emphysema and an ongoing necrotizing infection of the abdominal wall. It is a common belief that patients with diffuse peritonitis can be diagnosed and treated for perforation on a clinical basis, but peritonitis-like clinical scenarios can also occur in the absence of perforation. For instance, a transmural thermal injury after polypectomy with serosal irritation without any obvious perforation produces localized peritonitis that is amenable to non-operative management. Thus, biochemical and imaging studies are always indicated when an ICP is suspected.

### Transversus abdominis and multifidus asymmetry in runners measured by MRI: a cross-sectional study [^1137Cej3]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

In the USA, running is the most common moderate-vigorous physical activity in adults, with 13% of the nation reporting regular participation. However, this is substantially lower than the 72% of high school students regularly undertaking this activity in the USA. Given the potential health benefits associated with running, such as improved cardiovascular functionand improved intervertebral disc morphological profiles, there is a need to facilitate long-term participation into adulthood, which may in part reduce due to health-related issues. One potential barrier to long-term running is the development of low back pain.

Low back pain (LBP) is a multifaceted condition, with a range of previously proposed nociceptive drivers. From a tissue perspective, the structure and function of the transversus abdominis (TrA) and lumbar multifidus (MF) muscles are commonly associated with low back pain. The TrA is the deepest abdominal muscle with a horizontal fibre orientation. It arises from the iliac crest, the inner surface of the lower six costal cartilages and the thoracolumbar fascia and inserts into the linea alba. When it contracts concentrically, it tensions the abdominal fascia anteriorly and the thoracolumbar fascia posteriorly. This decreases the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the trunk, increases intra-abdominal pressureand thus enhances spinal stability. The TrA is activated during restful breathing and forced expiration, becoming more active as walking and running speed increase. The lumbar MF muscle originates on the spinous process, mammillary process and superior articular process and inserts into the facet capsule and mammillary process two to three levels further caudal. Its action is ipsilateral side bending and contralateral rotation when contracted unilaterally and extension of the spine when contracted bilaterally. In concert with the TrA, it stiffens the spine. The MF and TrA are part of the 'core muscles'. The core is commonly viewed as a muscular cylindrical structure that is made up of the abdominals anteriorly, MF and other paraspinals as well as the gluteals posteriorly, the diaphragm cranially and the pelvic floor and hip girdle musculature caudally.

### Exercise for dysmenorrhoea [^116PyuVh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Dysmenorrhoea is characterized by cramping lower abdominal pain that may radiate to the lower back and upper thighs and is commonly associated with nausea, headache, fatigue and diarrhea. Physical exercise has been suggested as a non-medical approach to the management of these symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the effectiveness of exercise in the treatment of dysmenorrhoea.

Search Strategy

A search was conducted using the methodology of the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (August 2009). CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched. Handsearching of relevant bibliographies and reference lists was also conducted.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing exercise with a control or no intervention in women with dysmenorrhoea.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trials were independently selected and data extracted by two review authors.

Main Results

Four potential trials were identified of which one was included in the review. The available data could only be included as a narrative description. There appeared to be some evidence from the trial that exercise reduced the Moos' Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ) score during the menstrual phase (P < .05) and resulted in a sustained decrease in symptoms over the three observed cycles (P < .05).

Authors' Conclusion

The results of this review are limited to a single randomized trial of limited quality and with a small sample size. The data should be interpreted with caution and further research is required to investigate the hypothesis that exercise reduces the symptoms associated with dysmenorrhoea. Brown J, Brown S. Exercise for dysmenorrhoea. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2010, Issue 2. Art. No.: CD004142. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004142.pub2.

### Measuring pelvic floor disorder symptoms using patient-reported instruments: proceedings of the consensus meeting of the pelvic floor consortium of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, the international continence society, the American Urogynecologic Society, and the society of urodynamics, female pelvic medicine and urogenital reconstruction [^115VaX9h]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Constipation symptoms — patient-reported assessment begins with the screening item "Do you sometimes have symptoms of constipation?" and instructs respondents to "Please SKIP if you do not have constipation". If constipation is present, respondents rate how severe symptoms have been "during the past 2 weeks" using the scale "Absent Mild Moderate Severe Very Severe". Symptoms queried include "Discomfort in your abdomen", "Pain in your abdomen", "Bloating in your abdomen", "Stomach cramps", "Rectal burning during or after a bowel movement", "Bowel movements that were too hard", "Bowel movements that were too small", and "Feeling like you had to pass a bowel movement but you couldn't (false alarm)".

### Magnesium biology [^116F7wvg]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Bone and liver have been demonstrated to act as major Mg²⁺ stores in the body. Indeed, in vitro and in vivo studies showed that osteoclast activity is increased upon decreased extracellular Mg²⁺ concentrations. Moreover, recent data demonstrated that defects in liver Mg²⁺ homeostasis directly affect serum Mg levels. Together these results point towards an involvement of bones and liver in the overall body Mg²⁺ homeostasis, which is why there has been a long-running discussion around the ideal determination of whole-body Mg²⁺ levels. Since only about 1%–2% of the whole-body Mg²⁺ is present in serum, it has been suggested that soft tissues and bones can be depleted of Mg²⁺, even if serum Mg²⁺ is normal. However, the clinical relevance of these lower tissue Mg²⁺ contents is unclear.

Consumption and supplementation of magnesium in health and disease

The daily recommended dietary allowance for Mg²⁺ in adults is about 400 mg for males and 310 mg for females, which increases to 350 mg during pregnancy. According to a report from the European Food Safety Authority combining data from 13 dietary surveys conducted in the European Union, the average Mg²⁺ intake in these studies ranged from 232 to 439 mg/day for adults, which suggests that the majority of the population ingests sufficient Mg²⁺. Nevertheless, a trend towards the use of Mg²⁺ supplementation can be observed in recent years. Many claim that Mg²⁺ supplementation helps with sleep, muscle cramps and anxiety. Several meta-analyses and reviews conclude that there is not enough scientific evidence to prove that these claims are true in healthy individuals. However, Mg²⁺ supplementation can be of therapeutic use in patients suffering from hypomagnesemia. In healthy individuals, increased ingestion of Mg²⁺ poses little risk. In the case of increased ingestion, the intestinal absorption is decreased, while the renal excretion rate can increase up to 100% to balance Mg²⁺ levels. Still, it should be noted that extremely high doses of Mg²⁺ supplementation can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and abdominal cramping, but will resolve once the Mg²⁺ has been digested.

A 34-year-old woman reported abdominal cramp on topical application of travoprost ophthalmic solution. Satisfactory dechallenge and rechallenge procedures were performed.

Results

Abdominal cramp occurred approximately 30 minutes after topical application of travoprost on 3 consecutive days. No abdominal cramp developed after substitution of travoprost with latanoprost or normal saline (in the Travatan bottle). Abdominal cramps recurred on rechallenging with travoprost, either in the original Travatan bottle, a latanoprost bottle, or in a Rescula bottle.

Conclusions

Flu-like symptoms (abdominal cramps, malaise and URI) were reported in 4% of patients participating in clinical trials of travoprost but seldom reported postmarketing. Based on the findings of dechallenge and rechallenge procedures, abdominal cramp should be considered a certain adverse effect of travoprost according to the WHO classification.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^1138ALj2]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 2
Algorithm for the symptomatic management of FACP, designed for use by physicians. FACP refers to the sudden occurrence of mild-to-moderate, undulating, and recurring cramping pain in any part of the abdomen, lasting for seconds to minutes or up to a few hours, in the absence of any "red flag" signs/symptoms of structural organic disease or any strong association with defecation (which might indicate IBS), and typically not significantly interfering with daily activities. FACP indicates functional abdominal cramping pain; IBS, irritable bowel syndrome; SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; TCA, tricyclic antidepressant.

In view of the prevalence of self-care among patients experiencing FACP, we propose how this algorithm might be adapted for pharmacists and patients to help support improved self-management of FACP, raise awareness of "red flag" signs/symptoms that should referral to or consultation with an appropriate physician, and highlight alternative approaches that patients might not consider intuitively (Figs. 3, 4). These algorithms could form the basis of the pharmacist and patient education needed to facilitate the recognition and effective self-treatment of FACP.

### Functional abdominal pain: time to get together and move forward [^116i2Awn]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Intestinal motility and abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) involve strong contractions of the intestinal circular muscle causing intestinal power propulsion that underlie the sensation of cramping abdominal pain, and power propulsion occurs more frequently in patients with IBS than in healthy subjects with contractions significantly stronger than normal. Moreover, postprandial power propulsion is more prevalent in the colons of patients with IBS than in normal individuals and is often associated with their diarrheal state. The pain and discomfort of patients with IBS during powerful contractions may be explained in 3 ways, either separately or in combination: exceptionally powerful contractions activating high-threshold mechanoreceptors; mechanoreceptor sensitization with erroneously coded input to spinal and brain processing centers; and accurately coded spinal afferent information misinterpreted in the spinal cord and central processing centers of the brain.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Exercise-related abdominal complaints (AC) are common in runners.
Intake of fibre, fat, protein and beverages with high osmolalities (> 500 mOsm/L), especially shortly before or during exercise, is known to induce AC during and/or shortly after exercise. However, knowledge about the role of the habitual diet in exercise-related AC is limited.

### Adductor strains… [^115kYHu6]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

The clinical symptoms of osteitis pubis include exercise-induced pain in the lower abdomen and medial thighs. Symptoms are gradual in onset, slowly increasing in severity if activities are not curtailed. One review article 20 noted the following incidence of symptoms in patients with documented osteitis pubis: adductor pain in 80 percent, pain around the pubic symphysis in 40 percent, lower abdominal pain in 30 percent and hip pain in 12 percent. Referred scrotal pain, which is said to be typical, was found in only 8 percent. 22 Sports Hernias Posterior abdominal wall abnormalities causing groin pain include "sports hernias" and groin disruption. Iliopsoas bursitis is characterized by deep groin pain, sometimes radiating to the anterior hip or thigh, often accompanied by a snapping sensation. If severe enough, it may be accompanied by a limp.
8. 4 Compared with isotope bone scan, MRI has a similar sensitivity but an improved specificity, and is becoming the diagnostic procedure of choice in some medical centers. 28 Runners with stress fractures of the inferior femoral neck seen on MRI or CT can be treated conservatively, with good prognosis for uneventful healing. Many clinicians recommend follow-up imaging to ensure healing before progression of activity. Return to running usually occurs in two to three months. 8 It usually occurs in female distance runners and military recruits, and is fairly easily diagnosed. On physical examination, pain may be elicited on palpation directly over the pubic ramus. Pain is also elicited by one-legged standing or jumping. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a bone scan. Treatment is conservative and straightforward: four to six weeks of relative rest followed by gradual return to sport.

Most athletes show complete healing within three to five months. Figure 8). Two recent studies from Australia 29, 30 reviewed 182 cases of obturator-induced chronic groin pain. These athletes experienced deep aching centered on the adductor origin at the pubic bone. With exercise, the pain became more severe and radiated down the medial thigh toward the knee. Some of the athletes also experienced exercise-related weakness in the affected leg, especially when attempting to jump. Paresthesias were rarely present.

### Assessment: symptomatic treatment for muscle cramps (an evidence-based review): report of the therapeutics and technology assessment subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^1127dHHe]. Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Muscle cramps — definition, prevalence, and associated conditions are summarized as follows: Muscle cramps are involuntary, generally painful contractions of a muscle or muscle group. A cross-sectional prevalence study of 365 outpatients aged 65 or older in the United Kingdom reports that 50% of outpatients report frequent cramps, and another review of 515 elderly veterans reports a similar prevalence of 56%, with half having cramps occurring at least once per week. When the motor system is stressed, either by a neuromuscular disease or by a physiologic stress such as dehydration or excessive exercise, cramps become more frequent, and neuropathic conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), peripheral neuropathies, and cramp-fasciculation syndrome are commonly associated. In addition to neurologic conditions, multiple medical conditions such as hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypothyroidism, and renal or liver dysfunction may be the cause, and cramps are also frequent during the last trimester of pregnancy and in athletes such as marathon runners. When no underlying cause of recurrent muscle cramps can be identified, they are referred to as idiopathic muscle cramps, which are usually most prominent in the lower leg and foot muscles and more evident at night.

### Editorial: reflux while running: something to belch about… [^116796Yt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Running is the most popular form of exercise in the United States. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is common during exercise and may affect performance. Previous studies have focused on increased intra-abdominal pressure as a major determinant of acid reflux during physical exertion. In this issue, Herregods et al. examined the mechanisms of GER in healthy volunteers using simultaneous high-resolution manometry and pH impedance testing performed while running. Novel observations afforded by the utilization of state-of-the-art technology include the importance of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation ("belch reflex") and transient formation of hiatal hernia during exercise. The findings are provocative and lend credence to commonsense strategies to minimize the consequences of belching in runners.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^1116h5z7]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

FACP is a common presentation, occurring either alone or in association with FGIDs, which can impact on the quality of life of sufferers and place a burden on health care resources. Here, we have proposed a definition of FACP, which we believe has substantial potential utility to inform the diagnosis and management of this common and under-recognized condition. Although probably falling within the continuum of the IBS spectrum, but without a strong, direct association with bowel evacuation, studies to further investigate the presentation, course, and pathophysiology of FACP are needed. Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of FACP are provided (albeit based largely on the existing literature for FGIDs because of a lack of specific data on FACP), with a focus on primary care management. Algorithms for use by PCPs/GPs, pharmacists, and patients are also presented to aid the recognition and symptomatic management of FACP in the primary care and pharmacy settings.

In many countries across the world, the clinical diagnosis and management of patients with FACP is typically undertaken in primary care practice. Self-care, with the assistance of pharmacists as needed may, however, also serve as a successful handling approach for patients whose condition can be managed adequately with over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and/or nonpharmacologic approaches. This approach is especially relevant in settings where access to health care may be limited.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding in athletes [^114YaMrZ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The positive impact of exercise on the gastrointestinal (GI) system has been well documented, with several studies indicating an inverse relationship between physical activity and the risk of GI-related diseases such as diverticulosis, constipation and cholelithiasis. However, GI symptoms are very common in athletes and perhaps the most common cause of underperformance in endurance events, with studies suggesting that up to 70% of athletes experience such problems. Upper GI symptoms include reflux, chest pain, heartburn, belching, nausea, and vomiting. Lower GI symptoms include abdominal pain, flatulence, urge to defecate, and diarrhea. Runners seem to be more frequently affected than other athletes, such as cyclists.

GI bleeding (GIB), in both the upper and lower GI tract, is another common and potentially serious manifestation of GI distress in athletes. In this review, we aim to analyze the incidence of GIB in athletes of different sports, along with its different ways of manifestation (upper and lower GI tract, occult and overt bleeding). We also try to provide an overview of the current understanding of the pathophysiology of GIB in athletes. Finally, we will talk about possible measures for prevention, along with possible treatments of this condition.

### Mechanics, energetics and implementation of grounded running technique: a narrative review [^116XgJcf]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Can grounded running be recommended for recreational runners?

Individuals seeking a healthier lifestyle and weight control through exercise often choose running, as it is considered low cost and can be easily implemented. Despite the health benefits, running-related injuries (particularly overuse injuries) are common. Naturally, running applies ground reaction forces and loading to the lower extremity — and this biomechanical 'loading' in the presence of other intrinsic or extrinsic risk factors may contribute to the development of running injuries. Adopting a grounded running technique reduces the magnitude and rate of vertical loading during running — and therefore may offer some protective effect from running-related injuries or pain. This approach has been demonstrated by ultramarathon runners. Ultramarathon runners tend to adopt characteristics of grounded running (ie, slower speed, larger duty factor, reduced vertical oscillation of COM, and lower vGRF) towards the end of their events. It is speculated these alterations are made to lower the overall impact and reduce pain during prolonged running. In a similar vein, grounded running may also present a particularly useful option for recreational runners with low loading capacities (eg, individuals commencing impact-related exercise; elderly runners).

### Association between menstrual cycle phase and metabolites in healthy, regularly menstruating women in UK biobank, and effect modification by inflammatory markers and risk factors for metabolic disease [^112o1VW4]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Fitness

A subset of participants in UK Biobank underwent cardiorespiratory fitness testing, 1412 of whom were eligible for inclusion in this study. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using a submaximal 6-min cycle ergometer test with workload adjusted for participant age, sex, height, weight and resting heart rate. Heart rate was measured pre-, during and post-exercise via a four-lead electrocardiogram. Predicted maximal work rate was calculated by extrapolating heart rate and workload before exercise and at the end of exercise to predict maximal heart rate (208 − (0.7 × age year)), assuming a linear relationship. Maximal oxygen uptake was predicted using the standard equation for oxygen utilisation during cycle ergometry (metabolic equivalents (METs): 7 + (workload W × 10.8/body mass kg)/3.5. Grip strength was measured using a Jamar J00105 hydraulic hand dynamometer. Isometric grip force was assessed from a 3-s maximal grip effort of the left- and right-side arms. The mean of the left- and right-side values was calculated and expressed in kilogrammes. Age-specific cardiorespiratory fitness and grip strength z -scores were derived.

Physical activity

Self-reported physical activity was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Data processing guidelines published by IPAQ were followed. Time spent at each level of activity was weighted by metabolic energy equivalent (MET) (walking 3.3 METs, moderate intensity 4.0 METs, vigorous intensity 8.0 METs), then summated to calculate total MET hours per week of physical activity. Participants were assigned to low, moderate and high categories of physical activity based on standard data processing guidelines.

Menstrual cycle symptoms

Physical symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle, known as dysmenorrhea (abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, menstrual cramps or other problems), were assessed via questionnaire responses. "Degree bothered by menstrual cramps or other problem with your period during the last 3 months" was self-reported as "not bothered at all", "bothered a little" or "bothered a lot". Discomfort or pain occurring only during menstrual cycle bleeding during the last 3 months was self-reported as "yes" or "no".

Fasting duration

Time since the last meal or drink, excluding plain water, was self-reported and recorded in hours.

### Exercise-related abdominal complaints in a large cohort of runners: a survey with a particular focus on nutrition [^111s3L5j]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of exercise-related AC in a large cohort of runners and to investigate its association with potential risk factors, particularly nutritional factors in the habitual diet. The majority of runners (57%) reported having AC during and/or up to 3 hours after running. LAC were more common (56%) than UAC (15%), and all symptoms occurred more often, and were perceived as more severe in women than men. In about one-third of these runners, AC negatively affected their running. In both men and women, younger age and a higher training intensity were associated with both UAC and LAC. Regarding habitual dietary intake, certain nutrients and food groups were associated with AC. However, associations were different for UAC and LAC, and for men and women. Most associations were observed for LAC in men. Differences between runners with and without AC that were most consistently present were a higher intake of fat, tea and unhealthy choices for runners with AC.

### Exercise-related abdominal complaints in a large cohort of runners: a survey with a particular focus on nutrition [^111VsAXk]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Methods

The Eat2Run study is an observational study with a cross-sectional design. Participants were runners who completed two online questionnaires: a general questionnaire and a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). The general questionnaire contained questions about general participants' characteristics, running habits, current and past injuries, the occurrence and perceived impact of AC and general health issues. The FFQ was used to assess habitual dietary intake.

Study population

In July 2021, recruitment of runners started by requesting athletics clubs and running event organisations in the Netherlands and Belgium, among which the popular Dutch Seven Hills run in Nijmegen, to help with the recruitment by posting a news item in their newsletter or on their website. In the second stage, social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) were also used for recruitment. Finally, in March 2022, participants of the 2022 edition of the well-known Rotterdam Marathon who indicated a willingness to participate in scientific studies were invited. When the recruitment period closed on 1 June 2022, 3643 runners had expressed interest for the study.

To be included in the present analyses, runners (1) had to be at least 18 years old, (2) had to run at least once a week in the past year, no matter the time or distance, or would usually run at least once a week if they had not been injured, (3) had to complete both the general questionnaire and the FFQ and (4) their reported habitual dietary intake in the FFQ had to be plausible (see below). Finally, 1993 runners could be included in the data analyses (see Results section).

Several organ systems can be affected by marathon running. Acute musculoskeletal injuries are common, but running does not result in increased rates of musculoskeletal disability. Gastrointestinal complaints are also common among runners; some of these complaints are explained by the decreased mesenteric blood flow during exercise. Although cardiac events are rare, they can be devastating. Symptomatic hyponatremia is another serious but mostly preventable problem.

### Low back and hip pain in a postpartum runner: applying ultrasound imaging and running analysis [^114PPmha]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Background

Postpartum low back and hip dysfunction may be caused by an incomplete recovery of abdominal musculature and impaired neuromuscular control. The purpose of this report is to describe the management of a postpartum runner with hip and low back pain through exercise training via ultrasound imaging (USI) biofeedback combined with running-form modification.

Case Description

A postpartum runner with hip and low back pain underwent dynamic lumbar stabilization training with USI biofeedback and running-form modification to reduce mechanical loading. Muscle thickness of transversus abdominis and internal oblique was measured with USI preintervention and 7 weeks after completion of the intervention. Additionally, 3-dimensional lower extremity joint motions, moments, and powers were calculated during treadmill running.

Outcomes

The patient's pain with running decreased from a constant 9/10 (0, no pain; 10, worst pain) to an occasional 3/10 posttreatment. Transversus abdominis muscle thickness increased 6.3% during the abdominal drawing-in maneuver and 27.0% during the abdominal drawing-in maneuver with straight leg raise. Changes were also noted in the internal oblique. These findings corresponded to improved lumbopelvic control: pelvic list and axial rotation during running decreased 38% and 36%, respectively. The patient's running volume returned to preinjury levels (8.1–9.7 km, 3 days per week) with no hip pain and minimal low back pain, and she successfully completed her goal of running a half-marathon.

Discussion

The successful outcomes of this case support the consideration of dynamic lumbar stabilization exercises, USI biofeedback, and running-form modification in postpartum runners with lumbopelvic dysfunction.

### Hereditary angioedema (HAE): a cause for recurrent abdominal pain [^112vfNyr]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 44-year-old Hispanic woman presented to the emergency room with a 2-day history of sudden onset of severe cramping left lower quadrant abdominal pain associated with ∼20 episodes diarrhoea. Abdominal CT scan exhibited bowel wall oedema and acute extensive colitis. On the basis of the preliminary diagnosis of acute abdomen, the patient was admitted under the surgical team and treated for acute colitis. Since her family history was significant for hereditary angioedema (HAE), complement studies were performed which revealed low complement C4 levels and abnormally low values of C1q esterase inhibitor. Thus, the diagnosis of HAE type I was established. This case report summarises that the symptoms of HAE are often non-specific, hence making the underlying cause difficult to diagnose.

### Median arcuate ligament syndrome in athletes [^117LN12K]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Exercise-related transient abdominal pain (ETAP) is a common entity in young athletes. Most occurrences are due to a "cramp" or "stitch", but an uncommon, and often overlooked, etiology of ETAP is median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS). The initial presentation of MALS typically includes postprandial nausea, bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, but in athletes, the initial presentation may be ETAP.

Methods

We present a case series of three athletes who presented with exercise-related transient abdominal pain and were ultimately diagnosed and treated for MALS. Unlike other patients with median arcuate ligament syndrome, these athletes presented with exercise-induced pain, rather than the common postprandial symptoms. These symptoms persisted despite conservative measures. Work-up of patients with suspected MALS include a computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography showing compression of the celiac artery with post-stenotic dilation, or a celiac artery ultrasound demonstrating increased velocities (> 200 cm/s 2) with deep exhalation.

Results

All patients underwent a laparoscopic median arcuate ligament release. Postoperatively, there were no complications, and all were discharged home on postoperative day #2. All patients have subsequently returned to athletics with resolution of their symptoms.

Conclusion

ETAP is common in athletes and often resolves with preventative or conservative strategies. When ETAP persists despite these methods, alternative causes, including MALS, should be considered. A combination of a thorough history and physical exam, as well as radiographic data, is essential to make the appropriate diagnosis and treatment strategy.

### What is known about the health effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use in marathon and ultraendurance running: a scoping review [^11772E6X]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

GI disturbances

Four of the 30 studies focus on GI issues among the ultrarunners, including one prospective observational study, one review and two case reports. Out of the four studies, none of them found a clear correlation between NSAID use and GI issues.

A prospective observational study by Robertson et al focused on gastrointestinal blood loss and found that overall, there was a significant increase in faecal blood loss when participating in marathon running, and this blood loss was exacerbated by analgesic consumption. However, despite the significant blood loss, it was not clinically important. This study did not focus solely on NSAIDs, and the drugs taken were a combination of aspirin, paracetamol and naproxen. Therefore, it is not possible to distinguish if NSAIDs were the cause.

Case reports by Pasternak et al and Grames et al both document cases of runners taking NSAIDs and then developing GI issues during an endurance race. However, neither study puts NSAID use down as the cause of the GI disturbances. The report by Pasternak et al focuses on a 37-year-old male runner competing in the Western States 100 mile ultra-marathon, where he consumed an NSAID and immediately vomited and experienced severe chest and abdominal pain. He was treated for Boerhaave's syndrome (spontaneous rupture of the oesophagus), and even though the pain seemed to start as soon as an NSAID was consumed, the fact that the patient immediately vomited the drug shows it is unlikely that this was a cause. The case report by Grames et al describes a case of a 20-year-old female runner developing ischaemic colitis at mile 12 of a marathon. The runner took 800 mg of ibuprofen thrice daily for 3 weeks before the marathon; however, the study highlights that it is unclear if the ibuprofen could have contributed to the colitis, so future research is needed in this area.

A potential cause for a relation between NSAID use and GI disturbance is described in a review by Guy et al, which found that prolonged exercise in the heat can cause GI injury, and the consumption of NSAIDs may also compromise GI integrity, which can cause leakage of endotoxins. When the two are combined, there can be an even greater risk of endotoxemia (leakage of endotoxins due to increased GI permeability). However, they acknowledge that further research is required in this area to determine the full impact.

### Patient experiences with the role of physical activity in inflammatory bowel disease: results from a survey and interviews [^115cnE1Y]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Difficulties during physical activity

All interviewees reported to have experienced difficulties related to IBD that hindered their physical activity. Most commonly mentioned obstacles were frequent toilet use, pain and fatigue. Nine interviewees explained that the proximity of a toilet is important because they have unpredictable and urgent bowel movements.

"When I was a teen, the disease was such a burden I could not exercise at all. I was very dependent on the presence of a toilet. Physical activity affects my bowel movements. When someone asked me: "Do you want to come over and play soccer?", I could not join because I knew there were no toilets anywhere nearby. Things like that can really have an influence in times of active disease". (Interviewee 10)

Seven interviewees also mentioned that bowel movements can be induced by physical activity. One interviewee said that she would always bring some toilet paper with her when she would go for a run just in case, although her disease was not very active. Pain was also mentioned as a reason to not be physically active. Three interviewees were afraid of exercise-induced abdominal pain, and others already suffered from muscle pain and did not want to aggravate this. Six interviewees reported that they often are too fatigued to exercise. They said they could feel so tired they just wanted to lay down. In this case they found it very hard to gather enough motivation to exercise, so they would not do any physical activity.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^116qok39]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

ALGORITHMS TO AID THE RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT OF FACP

A proposed algorithm for the optimal diagnosis and management of FACP by physicians, considered by the expert panel to be appropriate for use in primary care, is presented in Figure 2. This algorithm is based on the definition of FACP, and the management considerations outlined in the preceding sections. The starting point for the diagnosis is the core symptomatic manifestation of FACP, pain with cramping characteristics, which is generally considered to arise from primary gastrointestinal dysfunction. To establish the diagnosis of FACP, the critical first step is exclusion of a structural organic cause. This can be achieved through the recognition of alarm signals ("red flags") related to other symptoms experienced and/or the patient's family history of disease, and by considering the results of appropriate investigations, conducted as indicated by such signals. The algorithm considers the likelihood of an IBS diagnosis in cases where FACP symptoms are associated with bowel habit alterations, thus emphasizing the distinction between IBS (as defined by the Rome IV criteria) and the definition of FACP proposed here. The algorithm also seeks to rule out abdominal pain of gynecologic or cardiac origin. For first-line treatment, antispasmodics are recommended for patients whose symptoms fulfill the consensus definition of FACP and who lack signals of a potential differential diagnosis or other avoidable explanatory factors. Additional treatment options are suggested for patients who fail to achieve satisfactory symptom alleviation with first-line antispasmodic therapy.

### Efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for primary dysmenorrhoea: a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis [^113VJKvp]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review and NMA including eight non-pharmacological interventions (2826 participants), we concluded that non-pharmacological interventions may result in a reduction or slight reduction in pain intensity compared with no treatment or placebo. Both conventional meta-analysis and NMA revealed significant efficacy of non-pharmacological treatments. This comprehensive NMA put forward the first estimate of the efficacy about the non-pharmacological treatments.

Specifically, in analysis result of ranking probability, exercise therapy displayed the highest rank probability, followed by topical heat and acupuncture, which indicated that exercise was most likely to be the optimal option in PD management. In the previous study, Gemma Matthewman provided reliable evidence that physical activity may reduce pain intensity. Eligible trials of exercise included in our analysis encompassed several types of modified exercise: isometric exercise, relaxation exercises, Zumba exercise and stretching exercise. Synthesis of result showed the range of 1.94–5.1 in pain reduction (generally in one or two menstrual cycles), which exceeded the clinical significance of 2 in the 0–10 scale. Among included studies, participant usually performed the exercise from the third day to the end of treatment, or within non-menstrual period. It was reported that cramp and somatic symptom behaved obviously in first 3 days of menstrual cycle.

With regard to the pathogenesis and therapeutic mechanism of PD, several researches concluded that the increased production of PGs cause uterine hypoxia and ischaemia, thus leading to abdominal cramp. On one hand, exercise motivates uterine blood flow and cyclic metabolism, relieving uterine hypoxia and ischaemia, which results in reduction of pain. Dmitrović reported that the increased blood flow in the uterus would remove the excess level of PGs in the respective region and reduce uterine contractions. On the other hand, female with PD reported significantly lower QOL due to physical pain, psychological and emotional distress. In addition, prevalence research showed that 14.9% of women with PD were suffering from insomnia in their menstrual bleeding period. Another study revealed significant improvement in sleep quality by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index in the experimental group after exercise. Priya Kannan's research showed average variation of 4.8 in the Mental Component Summary score of the SF-12 in follow-up period (7 months).

### An unusual cause of lower abdominal pain in pubertal girls [^111qUAvb]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

A rare cause of acute lower abdominal pain in pubertal girls is described. The diagnosis is often missed at initial presentation and this may result in multiple presentations to the emergency department or general practitioner. The clinical features, diagnosis, management and possible complications of this condition are discussed. The case illustrates the importance of keeping this diagnosis in mind when seeing teenage girls with lower abdominal pain.

### The impact of running on gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome [^116sFBAB]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Physical activity has been suggested to alleviate gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); however, evidence is scarce. Running has become increasingly popular and may be beneficial for patients with IBS. To obtain more insight in the potential application of running as therapy, we aimed to explore the impact of running and its intensity on GI symptoms in patients with IBS.

Methods

Data from a large observational study in runners were used for this nested case-control study, which included 153 runners with IBS and 153 controls. All participants had completed a questionnaire on personal characteristics, running characteristics and GI symptoms. Regarding GI symptoms, the severity of nine symptoms was asked, both at rest and during and/or shortly (up to 3h) after running. Each symptom could be scored on a scale from 0 (not bothersome) to 100 (very bothersome), resulting in a maximum total score of 900 points.

Key Results

The prevalence and total severity score of GI symptoms were higher in runners with IBS than in controls, both at rest and during running. Among runners with IBS, the median (25th-75th percentile) total severity score during/after running was significantly lower than at rest (118 [50–200] vs. 150 [90–217]), while in controls no significant difference between running and rest was observed. Analyses stratified for running intensity revealed that the beneficial effect in runners with IBS was present when their most intensive training session was moderately intensive or intensive but not very intensive.

Conclusions & Inferences

Running, particularly on moderate intensity, could have a beneficial effect on GI symptoms in patients with IBS.

### Water intake after dehydration makes muscles more susceptible to cramp but electrolytes reverse that effect [^113TZmPo]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

The present study showed a possibility that intake of OS-1 ® before and during exercise would reduce EAMC. To investigate this, it is necessary to establish a reliable marker of muscle cramp susceptibility during exercise. It is also important to understand the relationship between TF and actual muscle cramp. Even if the cause of EAMC is more associated with neural especially spinal mechanisms, it is likely that dilution of electrolytes is also involved in the mechanisms directly or indirectly. It is also interesting to know whether the findings of our study will apply to other muscle cramps such as those affecting older people and pregnant women. We conclude that the involvement of electrolytes in EAMC should not be ignored.

What this study adds

Water intake after dehydration with exercise makes muscles more susceptible to muscle cramp.
Oral rehydration solution (ORS) intake after dehydration with exercise makes muscles less likely to cramp.
It seems possible that dilution of electrolytes especially sodium and chloride in the body may increase muscle cramp susceptibility.
Ingestion of ORS instead of water during and after exercise may reduce exercise-associated muscle cramp.

### Exercise-related abdominal complaints in a large cohort of runners: a survey with a particular focus on nutrition [^112aimew]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Objectives

Abdominal complaints (AC) during exercise are a common problem in runners. Nutrition is known to play a role in exercise-related AC, but information on the role of habitual dietary intake is limited. We assessed the prevalence of AC in a large cohort of runners, and investigated its association with potential risk factors, with a particular focus on nutritional factors in the habitual diet.

Methods

A total of 1993 runners completed two online questionnaires: a general questionnaire on, among others, running habits and exercise-related AC and a Food Frequency Questionnaire. Runners with and without either upper AC (UAC) or lower AC (LAC) were compared regarding personal characteristics, running characteristics and habitual dietary intake.

Results

1139 runners (57%) reported AC during and/or up to 3hours after running: 302 runners (15%) reported UAC, 1115 (56%) LAC and 278 (14%) both. In about one-third of runners with AC, these complaints negatively affected their running. Exercise-related AC were positively associated with female gender, younger age and more intense running. Most associations with nutritional factors were observed only for LAC in men, with a higher intake of energy, all macronutrients and grain products in men with LAC. In both men and women, a higher intake of tea and unhealthy choices were associated with AC.

Conclusion

Exercise-related AC were quite prevalent, and in about one-third of the cases, AC impacted their running. Being female, having a younger age and running at higher intensity were positively associated with AC. Some aspects of the habitual diet were associated with AC. Most notable were positive associations for intake of fat, tea and unhealthy choices.

### Effect of running on gastroesophageal reflux and reflux mechanisms [^117WF7gX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Reflux symptoms are common among athletes and can have a negative impact on athletic performance. At present, the mechanisms underlying excess reflux during exercise are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exercise on reflux severity and examine the underlying reflux mechanisms.

Methods

Healthy sporty volunteers were studied using both high-resolution manometry and pH-impedance monitoring. After a meal and a rest period, subjects ran on a treadmill for 30min at 60% of maximum heart rate, followed by a short rest period and another 20-min period of running at 85% of maximum heart rate.

Results

Ten healthy volunteers were included. Exercise led to a significantly higher percentage of time with an esophageal pH < 4 and a higher frequency and duration of reflux episodes. Moreover, exercise resulted in a decrease in contractility and duration of peristaltic contractions. The minimal lower esophageal sphincter resting pressure decreased during exercise, whereas the average and maximum abdominal pressure both increased. Importantly, the percentage of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) that resulted in reflux significantly increased during exercise and all but one reflux episode occurred during TLESRs. In six subjects a hiatus hernia was detected during the exercise period but not during rest.

Conclusions

Running induces gastroesophageal reflux almost exclusively through TLESRs. These are not more frequent during exercise but are more often associated with a reflux episode, possibly due to increased abdominal pressure, body movement, a change in esophagogastric junction morphology, and a decreased esophageal clearance during exercise.

### Bicarbonate unlocks the ergogenic action of ketone monoester intake in endurance exercise [^116CkoW8]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). Medium credibility.

Respiratory gas measurements

Minute ventilation (V̇E), oxygen consumption (V̇O₂), and carbon dioxide production (V̇CO₂) were measured using breath-by-breath indirect calorimetry (Cortex Metalyzer II) at the beginning (t40–t55) and end (t160–t175) of IMT 180′. The reported values for both 15-min periods represent the overall average of the last minute of each 5-min block. Gas analyzers were calibrated before every measurement using a 5% CO₂–17% O₂ gas mixture and a 3-L calibration syringe (Cortex Metalyzer).

Assessment of perceived exertion, gastrointestinal distress and appetite perception

Subjective scores of the RPE were assessed halfway IMT 180′ and immediately after IMT 180′, TT 15′, and SPRINT using a 6–20 Borg Scale. Gastrointestinal discomfort was rated 6 min after the completion of SPRINT by means of a validated 0–8 Likert scale questionnaire. The questionnaire evaluated distress at the systemic (dizziness, headache, muscle cramp, urge to urinate), upper (reflux, bloating, nausea, vomiting), and lower abdominal (cramps, flatulence, abdominal pain, diarrhea) level. Subsequently, "appetite sensations" were determined using a validated 10-point visual analog scale for the following four questions: "How hungry do you feel?" "How full do you feel?" "How satisfied do you feel?" "How much do you think you could eat now?"

### WITHDRAWN: exercise for dysmenorrhoea [^116v3Jjn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Dysmenorrhoea is characterised by cramping lower abdominal pain that may radiate to the lower back and upper thighs and is commonly associated with nausea, headache, fatigue and diarrhoea. Physical exercise has been suggested as a non-medical approach to the management of these symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the effectiveness of exercise in the treatment of dysmenorrhoea.

Search Methods

A search was conducted using the methodology of the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (August 2009). CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched. Handsearching of relevant bibliographies and reference lists was also conducted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing exercise with a control or no intervention in women with dysmenorrhoea.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trials were independently selected and data extracted by two review authors.

Main Results

Four potential trials were identified of which one was included in the review. The available data could only be included as a narrative description. There appeared to be some evidence from the trial that exercise reduced the Moos' Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ) score during the menstrual phase (P < 0.05) and resulted in a sustained decrease in symptoms over the three observed cycles (P < 0.05).

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this review are limited to a single randomised trial of limited quality and with a small sample size. The data should be interpreted with caution and further research is required to investigate the hypothesis that exercise reduces the symptoms associated with dysmenorrhoea.

### The unexpected epidural: a case report [^112RTbge]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 53-year-old caucasian G1P1 otherwise healthy female patient was known for a long history of diffuse right and left colonic diverticular disease, with repeated episodes of abdominal pain due to recurrent diverticulitis.

She presented to the emergency department at our institution with severe left-lower-quadrant abdominal pain, cramping and anorexia. Physical examination revealed a soft abdomen, with localized left lower quadrant sharp tenderness, guarding and moderate rebound on examination. Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed bowel wall thickening and contrast-enhancement along a 45 mm portion of the medium-to-distal sigmoid colon. A marked increase in soft tissue density was also observed within the pericolonic fat, with evidence of a 23 mm paramedian fluid collection in the pre-sacral area. The patient was admitted to the surgical ward and antibiotic coverage was started together with analgesics. Symptoms resolved quickly, she was discharged home a week later with a diagnosis of self-limited diverticular microperforation, and an outpatient follow-up was scheduled for elective surgical planning.

### PHKA1-associated phosphorylase kinase deficiency: a monogenic disorder of exercise intolerance and myalgia [^111saqqH]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

To date, 18 cases of GSD IXα1 have been reported. Our additional 10 cases with pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in PHKA1 and 4 cases with a VUS emphasize the high prevalence of muscle pain and cramping, especially in a limb-girdle distribution, in the setting of moderate intensity exercise. The muscle-specific form of PhK is crucial for breaking down muscle glycogen to provide energy for muscle contractions and thus deficiency of functional muscle PhK can lead to exercise intolerance, muscle cramps, myalgia, and weakness, explaining the clinical presentation of our cohort. Proximal muscles of the lower extremities were unanimously affected in patients of our cohort, with all patients reporting pain in these muscle groups (except for patient 8, who is currently 1.2 years old). Interestingly, when compared to the lower extremities, the upper extremities and other muscle groups (arms, abdominal muscles, shoulders) were less commonly involved and the number of muscles affected did not necessarily correlate with the overall severity or disease morbidity. To improve clinical recognition and comparability across future studies, it is important to develop standardized tools for assessing exercise intolerance in GSD IXα1. Quantitative measures such as the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), forearm exercise test, and cycle ergometry have been effectively used in disorders like McArdle disease (GSD V) and mitochondrial myopathies to assess functional capacity and glycolytic integrity –. For instance, Vissing & Haller demonstrated a marked improvement in exercise tolerance via cycle ergometry following oral sucrose ingestion in McArdle disease. Similar to what is recommended for other muscle GSDs, validated patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and wearable activity tracking could further capture exertional symptoms and fatigue in a standardized way –. Due to similarities in disease presentations, these approaches would potentially enable more accurate phenotyping, longitudinal monitoring of disease burden, and facilitate therapeutic trials by providing reliable outcome measures.

### Tackling an unusual diagnosis [^113y4pWz]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical introduction

A 15-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with a 24-hour history of vomiting and abdominal pain. This was the second such episode after rugby training over the past month. He was doing other exercise regularly with no ill effects.

On clinical assessment, he appeared pale, was vomiting and had tenderness throughout the left abdomen. Observations were within normal limits. In view of this, an abdominal X-ray (AXR) was performed as a first-line investigation (figure 1). The diagnosis is:

### Exercise-related abdominal complaints in a large cohort of runners: a survey with a particular focus on nutrition [^112UYexS]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

A few differences in intake between runners with and without AC were more consistently present, thus in men as well as in women, and/or for AUC as well as for LAC. This was the case for a higher intake of fat, tea and unhealthy choices in runners with AC than in those without AC. The higher fat intake and higher intake of unhealthy choices, which includes for example cakes, cookies, sweets and snacks, and also the reported lower fruit intake in men with LAC, could be a reflection of a slightly lower overall diet quality. A low diet quality could be linked to a higher occurrence of complaints such as reflux, bloating and flatulence. This observation is also seen in patients with AC in rest, such as those with IBS. However, IBS symptoms are generally accompanied with a low intake of fibre and grain products, which was not the case in our population. Finally, tea consumption was higher in runners with LAC. Tea consumption is said to be laxative, at least for some kinds of tea, and higher tea consumption has been linked to symptoms of IBS.

In general, the habitual diet can have an impact on gastrointestinal physiology. For example, dietary factors can delay gastric emptying (eg, fat) and either increase or decrease gut transit time (eg, fibre, laxatives), which could impact the experience of AC during exercise, particularly when food is consumed relatively close to exercise. In addition, diet is known to alter gut microbiota composition (eg, fibre, unhealthy foods), which can be beneficial but may also induce AC. Finally, increased fermentation on consumption of specific foods could potentially also induce AC during running.

Potential practical implications

Although we observed some associations with habitual dietary intake, the nature and design of our study limit drawing conclusion about causality and formulation of practical recommendations. We can imagine that in runners sensitive to dietary triggers, to some extent similar to what is seen in IBS patients, specific dietary strategies such as, for example, following a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, could be of value. But this warrants further research on the impact of dietary habits on AC to develop dietary guidelines and advice aimed at preventing or managing exercise-related AC. In addition, avoiding specific foods or too much food intake closely before running, proper hydration before and during running, and defecating before running are smart strategies to reduce exercise-related AC and were indeed reported as measures to deal with AC in our study population.

### Factors influencing exercise-related transient abdominal pain [^113E7WFv]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Exercise-related transient abdominal pain (ETAP) is a widely experienced but poorly understood problem. This study examined the influence of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), training status, and sporting activity on the experience of ETAP and shoulder tip pain (STP). STP may occur as a result of referred pain from tissues innervated by the phrenic nerve; these tissues are implicated in theories proposed to explain ETAP.

Methods

A total of 965 regular sporting participants were surveyed from six sporting activities: running, swimming, cycling, aerobics, basketball, and horse riding.

Results

The prevalence (r = -0.28, P < 0.01) and severity (r = -0.17, P < 0.01) of ETAP decreased with age. Gender, BMI, and training status had no affect on the prevalence or severity of ETAP, but respondents who trained more frequently reported experiencing ETAP less often. Younger respondents were more inclined than the older respondents to report ETAP on the left side of the abdomen (P < 0.05). The prevalence (r = -0.11, P < 0.01) and severity (r = -0.37, P < 0.01) of STP decreased with age. STP was described as more severe (r = 0.23, P < 0.05) by respondents with high BMI values. Gender and training status had no influence on the experience of STP. Controlling for all other factors, ETAP was respectively 10.5 and 9 times more common (P < 0.01) in running and horse riding than cycling. STP was 13 times more common in running than cycling.

Conclusion

Training status alters the frequency of occurrence of ETAP but has little effect on the incidence or severity of the pain. Further, ETAP and STP decrease with age but are not related to gender or BMI.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^1152gkiH]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study design and data source

This study analyzes retrospectively collected, repeated cross‐sections of ED visits using data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) for years 2007 to 2019. NHAMCS is a nationally representative sample of visits to nonfederal, general, acute care hospitals in the United States conducted annually by the National Center for Health Statistics. For descriptive statistics comparing change between the beginning and end of the study period, we combined 3 years of data for additional power, 2007–2009 and 2017–2019. Of note, coding changed from ICD‐9 to ICD‐10 in 2016 and diagnosis trees were used as opposed to specific diagnoses.

Participants

NHAMCS records a primary reason for visit (RFV) for each sampled ED visit. Following our prior work, we considered ED visits for abdominal pain to include primary RFVs of lower or upper abdominal pain, abdominal cramps or spasms, abdominal distention or fullness, hernia of abdominal cavity, abdominal swelling, change in abdominal size, and abdominal mass or tumor. The majority of patients reported an RFV of "abdominal pain, cramps, spasms, not otherwise specified". Data were aggregated into three age categories; age groups were based on clinical and management characteristics. Visits from patients aged 18–45 were classified as young adults, 46–64 as middle‐aged adults, and 65+ as older adults. We excluded pediatric demographics because of differences in management and imaging practices for pediatric care in the ED.

### Objective evaluation of small bowel and colonic transit time using pH telemetry in athletes with gastrointestinal symptoms [^115VY7vJ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances are often reported by long distance runners and are more common in women, particularly after prolonged high intensity exercise.

Objectives

To determine whether these symptoms could be associated with alterations in GI motility.

Methods

Small bowel and colonic transit were measured using pH telemetry in a group of 11 female athletes (age 22 to 53 years), six of whom experienced lower GI symptoms during exercise. Subjects participated in two experimental sessions: a control measurement, where small bowel transit was estimated during a rest period (R) of six hours; and an exercise session (E), where small bowel transit was measured during a one hour period of high intensity exercise (cross country running) at > 70% VO₂max. Colonic transit was estimated indirectly from determinations of whole gut transit time by radio-opaque marker.

Results

Small bowel transit time was 3.5 to 10.6 h (R) and 3.0 to 8.7 h (E) in asymptomatic athletes, versus 4.0 to 6.6 h (R) and 4.6 to 7.3 h (E) in symptomatic athletes (NS). Colonic transit time was 35.0 to 62.5 h (R) and 30.5 to 70.9 h (E) in asymptomatic athletes versus 20.4 to 42.9 h (R) and 21.5 to 67.2 h (E) in symptomatic athletes (NS).

Conclusions

Small bowel and colonic transit times were similar in the two groups in the rest and exercise sessions. The diarrhoea seen in this study did not result from accelerated colonic transit. Other mechanisms must be sought.

### Exercise-related abdominal complaints in a large cohort of runners: a survey with a particular focus on nutrition [^116UqxES]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Conclusion

In this population of runners, exercise-related AC were quite prevalent. The majority of runners (57%) reported having AC during and/or shortly after running, and in about one-third of these runners AC negatively affected their running. LAC were more common (56%) than UAC (15%), and all symptoms occurred more often in women than men. Younger age and higher training intensity were associated with AC, as well as intake of certain nutrients and food groups in the habitual diet, of which a higher intake of fat, tea and unhealthy choices were most notable. In men only, LAC were associated with a higher intake of energy and food consumption, including a higher intake of grain products, but with lower fruit consumption. These results warrant further research on the impact of dietary habits on AC to develop dietary guidelines aimed at preventing or managing exercise-related AC.

### Exercise-related abdominal complaints in a large cohort of runners: a survey with a particular focus on nutrition [^115b9UuR]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

An important aim of this study was to investigate the association of AC with potential risk factors, with a particular focus on nutritional factors in the habitual diet. We observed positive associations between AC and training intensity and the running distance covered per week (the latter in women with LAC only), which seems likely to be explained by the higher running load and increased exercise stress. Exercise stress is both via circulatory-gastrointestinal and neuroendocrine-gastrointestinal changes linked to AC. The redistribution of blood flow to working muscles and the peripheral circulation reduces splanchnic perfusion and can induce local ischaemia affecting the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract, while an increased sympathetic activation during exercise reduces overall gastrointestinal functional capacity.

Furthermore, we observed negative associations between AC and age and running career (the latter in women with UAC only). Fewer AC in older runners could be explained by physical conditioning to withstand the effects of exercise on the gastrointestinal tract, or simply said they could have learnt to deal with AC. At the same time, runners who experience AC when they start to run could have quit running before they were able to build up a long running career, explaining the negative association with running years.

### Conservative interventions for managing exercise-related musculoskeletal groin pain [^111N6yy7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Groin pain refers to symptoms in a complex anatomical region, making terminology, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment challenging. Despite ongoing efforts, terminology remains controversial. Accurate diagnosis is challenging due to overlapping symptoms and the need to exclude other conditions, such as any type of hernia, sacroiliac dysfunction, piriformis syndrome, nerve entrapments, lumbar spine issues, gynecological or urological diseases, and hip pathologies. This systematic review will focus specifically on exercise‐related musculoskeletal groin pain (i.e. not groin pain from gynecologic, urologic, or neurological causes). This is commonly observed in those who engage in physical activity or sports, due to the high tension in muscles, tendons, and ligaments, and the stress on the pubic bone during activities, such as running and kicking, especially in sports such as soccer and hockey. Exercise‐related musculoskeletal groin pain represents 8% to 18% of soccer‐related injuries. Contributing factors include hip and core muscle imbalances and excessive loads. Exercise‐related musculoskeletal groin pain also has a complex prognosis, which often means that the affected person may wait over six months to return to full sports participation.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

The management of exercise‐related musculoskeletal groin pain is challenging, as the expanding literature on groin pain has increased the range of conservative treatment options. Because factors associated with exercise‐related musculoskeletal groin pain include muscle imbalances and decreased hip range of motion, recommended interventions involve strengthening muscles, stabilizing the pelvis and hip joints, and stretching hip muscles. Exercise interventions targeting hip and abdominal muscles appear to be effective for symptom remission, return to sport, and reduced risk of reinjury, because they address modifiable contributors to the development of groin pain.

The use of a multimodal treatment approach, which includes heat, manual therapy, stretching, and exercises, is justified because these modalities reduce the viscoelastic stiffness of the adductor muscles, thereby decreasing the load on the insertion points and the pubic bone. Evidence suggests that the mechanisms underlying the effects of manual therapy involve a complex model with multiple interacting factors, resulting in systemic neurophysiological responses that lead to pain inhibition. Pharmacological and passive modalities are often used to address the inflammatory components observed in imaging. Due to the complexity of this condition, a multi‐component treatment approach is generally recommended, with surgical procedures reserved for people for whom nonoperative management has failed.

### Dysmenorrhea [^1156KeHS]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dysmenorrhea:

- **Definition**: Dysmenorrhea refers to painful menstruation, characterized by cramping lower abdominal pain that occurs before or during menstruation, and is classified as either primary or secondary based on underlying etiology.
- **Pathophysiology**: Primary dysmenorrhea occurs in the absence of identifiable pelvic pathology and is associated with increased endometrial production of prostaglandins, particularly prostaglandin F2α, and leukotrienes, which induce intense uterine contractions, ischemia, and pain. In contrast, secondary dysmenorrhea results from structural or inflammatory pelvic disorders that contribute to pain through mechanisms such as nerve infiltration, chronic inflammation, or distortion of pelvic anatomy. Symptom severity in both forms often correlates with prostaglandin levels and other local inflammatory mediators.
- **Epidemiology**: Dysmenorrhea is highly prevalent and commonly undertreated, affecting 50–90% of adolescent girls and women of reproductive age. It is a leading cause of school and work absenteeism and significantly impacts QoL.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for primary dysmenorrhea include early menarche, long or heavy menstrual cycles, smoking, alcohol use, high stress levels, nulliparity, premenstrual syndrome, a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, and a family history of dysmenorrhea. Increasing age and increasing parity are protective factors. Secondary dysmenorrhea is associated with identifiable pelvic pathology such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, ovarian cysts, Müllerian anomalies, pelvic adhesions, or pelvic inflammatory disease.
- **Disease course**: Symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea typically begin within a few years of menarche, presenting as cramping suprapubic pain that peaks during the first 1–2 days of menstruation and is often accompanied by nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, dizziness, and headache. Severe cases may also cause sleep disturbances. Secondary dysmenorrhea tends to present later in reproductive life with progressive or atypical pain patterns and is generally less responsive to first-line therapies. Both forms can become chronic and significantly impact QoL, academic performance, and work productivity.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Primary dysmenorrhea often improves with age, childbirth, or hormonal therapy and generally responds well to NSAIDs or hormonal contraceptives. Secondary dysmenorrhea may persist or worsen without appropriate treatment, especially in conditions like endometriosis or adenomyosis. Unless adequately treated and followed, dysmenorrhea may progress to a chronic pain syndrome with significant long-term consequences.

### Exercise-related abdominal complaints in a large cohort of runners: a survey with a particular focus on nutrition [^112u4yXQ]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Prevalence, severity and perceived impact of AC

Prevalence rates and severity of exercise-related AC and specific symptoms are presented in table 1. In total, 1139 runners (57%) reported having AC during and or shortly after running, and AC were significantly more often reported by women (67%) than by men (45%). A total of 302 runners (15%) reported UAC, 1115 (56%) reported LAC and 278 (14%) reported both. Reflux was the most common symptom of UAC (11%), and flatulence was the most common symptom of LAC (36%). Also, all individual symptoms were significantly more often reported by women than by men.

Table 1
Prevalence and severity of abdominal complaints during and or up to 3 hours after running

The median (25th–75th percentile) total score for the severity of AC was 75 (30–145). Generally, women perceived the symptoms as more severe than men, although not all differences between men and women reached significance.

Table 2 presents the perceived impact of AC and personal experiences with nutrition and AC. Between 23% and 35% of runners indicated that AC sometimes caused disruption, interruption or avoidance of running training; 4%–11% indicated that this occurred often or always. AC caused less often disruption, interruption or avoidance of running in competitions, although 5%–9% indicated that this occurred sometimes and 1%–3% indicated that this occurred often or always. Women more often reported these consequences of AC on running training and running in competitions than men.

Table 2
Perceived impact of AC and personal experiences with nutrition and AC

The majority of runners with either UAC or LAC (67%–88%) reported that eating before or during exercise increases AC, and women more often reported this than men. Eating increased AC mostly by eating too much or shortly before running, but eating too little before running, eating during running and eating specific food products were also reported. Drinking before or during running was less often reported to increase AC than eating, although it was still quite common (25%–45%). This was also mostly due to drinking too much before running. Between 33% and 54% of runners reported taking measures to reduce AC. The most common measure was not eating (too much) just before running, followed by avoiding specific foods or drinks and defecating before running.

DIAGNOSIS AND INVESTIGATION OF FACP IN PRIMARY CARE

Ruling Out Organic Pathology

Recommendations:

When evaluating FACP in primary care, the first step is to rule out "red flags" (alarm signals) of structural organic disease, which necessitate referral to a specialist.

Comments

When a patient first presents to primary care with symptoms of FACP, the first step is to rule out potentially serious organic disease. Key red flag signs and symptoms that could indicate structural disease are summarized in Table 1. Patients presenting with any indicators of organic disease require referral to a specialist for further investigation.

TABLE 1
Red Flag (Alarm) Signs That May Be Present in Patients With Functional Abdominal Cramping Pain (List Not Exhaustive),–

Investigations and Diagnosis

Recommendations:

A detailed evaluation of family history, medication, characteristics of pain, and eating/bowel habits should be undertaken in all patients presenting to primary care with FACP symptoms.
In selected cases and at the discretion of the doctor, a physical examination (including bowel sounds and digital rectal examination), laboratory tests, and psychosocial assessment may also be appropriate. Abdominal ultrasound investigations may be helpful.

### Sumatriptan succinate [^111LCRbK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

What should I avoid while taking sumatriptan injection?

Sumatriptan injection can cause dizziness, weakness, or drowsiness. If you have these symptoms, do not drive a car, use machinery, or do anything where you need to be alert.

What are the possible side effects of sumatriptan injection?

Sumatriptan injection may cause serious side effects. See "What is the most important information I should know about sumatriptan injection?"

These serious side effects include:

- changes in color or sensation in your fingers and toes (Raynaud's syndrome)

- stomach and intestinal problems (gastrointestinal and colonic ischemic events). Symptoms of gastrointestinal and colonic ischemic events include:

- sudden or severe stomach pain

- stomach pain after meals

- weight loss

- fever

- nausea or vomiting

- constipation or diarrhea

- bloody diarrhea

- problems with blood circulation to your legs and feet (peripheral vascular ischemia). Symptoms of peripheral vascular ischemia include:

- cramping and pain in your legs or hips

- feeling of heaviness or tightness in your leg muscles

- burning or aching pain in your feet or toes while resting

- numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs

- cold feeling or color changes in 1 or both legs or feet

- medication overuse headaches. Some people who use too many sumatriptan injections may have worse headaches (medication overuse headache). If your headaches get worse, your healthcare provider may decide to stop your treatment with sumatriptan injection.

Chronic idiopathic constipation — senna recommendation: In adults with CIC, the panel suggests the use of senna over management without senna (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Implementation considerations state that trials were conducted for 4 weeks and longer term use is probably appropriate but needs data on tolerance and side effects; the dose evaluated in trials is higher than commonly used and the panel suggests starting at a lower dose and increase if there is no response; and abdominal pain and cramping may occur with a higher dose of senna.

### Runner's diarrhea: what is it, what causes it, and how can it be prevented? [^115xz1tR]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Runner's diarrhea is an acute exercise-induced diarrhea. Usually, this is not a pathological situation but it can affect performance. This review focuses on the discussion of the main causes of runner's diarrhea and nutritional recommendations to prevent it.

Recent Findings

Although based on limited data, multiple transportable carbohydrate intake during exercise instead of glucose alone can be recommended for preventing the urge to defecate and (possibly) diarrhea. Additionally, avoiding ingestion of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) is related to a lower incidence of reported gastrointestinal problems. There is, however, still no study that associates FODMAPs and runner's diarrhea. Gluten-free diets seem to have no impact on exercise-induced intestinal damage and there is no evidence to recommend this diet for the prevention of diarrhea in nonceliac athletes.

Summary

The main causes of diarrhea in runners are ischemic, mechanical, and nutritional factors. For the prevention of diarrhea, it has been recommended that dehydration and the ingestion of fiber, fat, protein, high concentrated carbohydrate beverages, FODMAPs, caffeine, bicarbonate, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs be avoided. However, the causes of diarrhea and nutritional strategies to prevent it are based on limited research and more studies are definitely needed.

### Patient experiences with the role of physical activity in inflammatory bowel disease: results from a survey and interviews [^113sNCkQ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

When looking into the nature of the association between physical activity and disease activity, interviewees reported that IBD-related complaints limit their physical activity for various reasons. Most commonly mentioned barriers were fatigue, exercise-induced pain, irregular and unpredictable bowel movements, and no proximity of a toilet; barriers that were also mentioned in previous studies. Several interviewees also mentioned immediate effects of physical activity on their symptoms. Inducement of bowel movement was mentioned the most, which could also result in cramps and abdominal pain. Similar exercise-induced symptoms were described in other studies, although these studies specifically focussed on high-intensity exercise. In the current study, not all interviewees defined the intensity of the exercise that caused symptom exacerbation but rather the mode of exercise. For example, running was mentioned to aggravate symptoms, whereas swimming was mentioned as an exercise mode that patients could endure for a long time without symptom aggravation. However, based on the MET scores, both are qualified as vigorous intensity exercise. This indicates that not only the intensity of physical activity might influence symptoms, but the mode of exercise plays a crucial role. This is supported by, for example, runner's diarrhoea, which is a common phenomenon in the general population, and this type of diarrhoea can also be present in IBD patients.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^114bfdyR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Comments

As with FGIDs in general, a comprehensive patient assessment is needed to rule out red flags and to characterize the FACP. We recommend that the assessment includes an evaluation of family history (especially for malignancy, gastrointestinal diseases, and other conditions that could affect their management), current and recent medication, characteristics of pain (nature, location, duration, quality, frequency, and severity), and eating/bowel habits (including known food allergies, intolerances, and triggers). In selected patients and at the discretion of the doctor, a physical examination (including bowel sounds and digital rectal examination) and limited laboratory tests may be appropriate, and psychosocial assessment may also be helpful, particularly if the patient has preexisting psychiatric comorbidities or there are indicators of significant psychological stress. The physical examination should assess the pain location and whether there is a palpable mass, abnormal or absent bowel sounds, rebound tenderness, rigidity/resistance, distension, and/or guarding. Experience in IBS shows that relevant laboratory tests might include complete blood cell counts and other targeted blood tests (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and/or celiac serology), thyroid and liver function tests, and stool studies (eg, fecal calprotectin and/or occult blood test), as indicated. Abdominal ultrasound investigations can sometimes be helpful and are cheap and simple to undertake in most settings. There are also certain other signs and symptoms that may require additional evaluation. For example, for pain in women that seems to be related to the menses, a gynecologic evaluation should be considered. Similarly, for pain brought on by physical exertion, a cardiology assessment should be sought. If the initial investigations raise concerns or are equivocal, referral for a computerized axial tomography scan might be considered.

Assuming none of the red flag signs/symptoms are present and no abnormalities are identified at the physical examination, laboratory tests, or other investigations, a diagnosis of FACP may be considered if the symptoms are described by the present definition. If the FACP is tightly related to changes in bowel evacuation, IBS is the most probable diagnosis and should be confirmed using the Rome IV criteria.

### Abdominal pain in long distance runners: case report and analysis of the literature [^115xFEVw]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common complaint among participants in endurance sports. It may be severe, recurrent, and resistant to treatment. There is no direct evidence of the cause of this phenomenon. This report is of a long distance runner who had severe pain in the upper right abdominal quadrant during strenuous exertion. The symptom had been present for several years and did not respond to conservative treatment. Laparoscopy showed congenital supernumerary ligaments binding the gallbladder to the abdominal wall. The complaint resolved after cholecystectomy and resection of adhesions. There was evidence of chronic cholecystitis on histopathological examination. Two years after the operation, he remains free of symptoms. The differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in athletes is discussed.

Factors associated with AC

Table 3 presents personal and running characteristics in runners with and without UAC or LAC. In both men and women, runners with both UAC and LAC were younger and trained at a higher intensity. In men only, runners with UAC were more competitive than runners without UAC. In women only, runners with UAC had a shorter running career than those without UAC, and runners with LAC had a lower body mass index and ran more kilometres a week than those without LAC.

Table 3
Personal and running characteristics in runners with and without abdominal complaints during and/or up to 3 hours after running

Energy and macronutrient intake, as well as intake of foods categorised into food groups in runners with and without UAC or LAC, is presented in table 4. In general, similar differences in dietary intake between those with and without complaints were reported for UAC and LAC, but differences tended to be stronger in LAC due to a larger number of cases. Men with UAC had a higher intake of total fat, sweetened beverages and fruit juices, and unhealthy choices than men without UAC. Men with LAC had a higher intake of energy, total carbohydrates, total fat, total protein, fibre, whole grain and refined grain products, nuts, tea, and unhealthy choices, and a lower intake of fruit than men without LAC. Women with UAC had a lower intake of wholegrain products than those without UAC, while women with LAC had a higher intake of tea and unhealthy choices than those without LAC.

### ACG clinical guideline: epidemiology, risk factors, patterns of presentation, diagnosis, and management of colon ischemia (CI) [^116Ga8RX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — clinical presentation evidence for CI describes common symptoms and timing: in a retrospective study of 401 patients admitted with CI, the most common symptoms were abdominal pain (78%), rectal bleeding (84%), diarrhea (56%), and nausea (38%); in 22 Korean biopsy-proven CI patients, abdominal pain (77.8%), hematochezia (58.3%), bloody diarrhea (34.7%), and nonbloody diarrhea (19.4%) were common; vomiting (30%), dizziness (10%), and syncope (6%) occur less frequently; in IRCI, only 25–46% have rectal bleeding and physicians should entertain the diagnosis of IRCI for patients with acute, severe abdominal pain who lack hematochezia and/or diarrhea; in a Swiss cohort of 49 biopsy-proven CI patients, 57.1% presented within 24 h and 75.5% within 3 days of symptom onset; CI generally manifests with sudden cramping, mild, left lower abdominal pain; an urgent desire to defecate; and passage within 24 h of bright red or maroon blood per rectum or bloody diarrhea.

### Abdominal symptoms during physical exercise and the role of gastrointestinal ischaemia: a study in 12 symptomatic athletes [^1122CJxG]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms during exercise may be caused by GI ischaemia. The authors report their experience with the diagnostic protocol and management of athletes with symptomatic exercise-induced GI ischaemia. The value of prolonged exercise tonometry in the diagnostic protocol of these patients was evaluated.

Methods

Patients referred for GI symptoms during physical exercise underwent a standardised diagnostic protocol, including prolonged exercise tonometry. Indicators of GI ischaemia, as measured by tonometry, were related to the presence of symptoms during the exercise test (S+ and S- tests) and exercise intensity.

Results

12 athletes were specifically referred for GI symptoms during exercise (five males and seven females; median age 29 years (range 15–46 years)). Type of sport was cycling, long-distance running and triathlon. Median duration of symptoms was 32 months (range 7–240 months). Splanchnic artery stenosis was found in one athlete. GI ischaemia was found in six athletes during submaximal exercise. All athletes had gastric and jejunal ischaemia during maximum intensity exercise. No significant difference was found in gastric and jejunal Pco(2) or gradients between S+ and S- tests during any phase of the exercise protocol. In S+ tests, but not in S- tests, a significant correlation between lactate and gastric gradient was found. In S+ tests, the regression coefficients of gradients were higher than those in S- tests. Treatment advice aimed at limiting GI ischaemia were successful in reducing complaints in the majority of the athletes.

Conclusion

GI ischaemia was present in all athletes during maximum intensity exercise and in 50% during submaximal exercise. Athletes with GI symptoms had higher gastric gradients per mmol/l increase in lactate, suggesting an increased susceptibility for the development of ischaemia during exercise. Treatment advice aimed at limiting GI ischaemia helped the majority of the referred athletes to reduce their complaints. Our results suggest an important role for GI ischaemia in the pathophysiology of their complaints.

### Trail running injury risk factors: a living systematic review [^1127EBPy]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review and frequently update the available evidence on injury risk factors and epidemiology of injury in trail running.

Design

Living systematic review. Updated searches will be done every 6 months for a minimum period of 5 years.

Data Sources

Eight electronic databases were searched from inception to 18 March 2021.

Eligibility Criteria

Studies that investigated injury risk factors and/or reported the epidemiology of injury in trail running.

Results

Nineteen eligible studies were included, of which 10 studies investigated injury risk factors among 2 785 participants. Significant intrinsic factors associated with injury are: more running experience, level A runner and higher total propensity to sports accident questionnaire (PAD-22) score. Previous history of cramping and postrace biomarkers of muscle damage is associated with cramping. Younger age and low skin phototypes are associated with sunburn. Significant extrinsic factors associated with injury are neglecting warm-up, no specialised running plan, training on asphalt, double training sessions per day and physical labour occupations. A slower race finishing time is associated with cramping, while more than 3 hours of training per day, shade as the primary mode of sun protection and being single are associated with sunburn. An injury incidence range 0.7–61.2 injuries/1000 hours of running and prevalence range 1.3% to 90% were reported. The lower limb was the most reported region of injury, specifically involving blisters of the foot/toe.

Conclusion

Limited studies investigated injury risk factors in trail running. Our review found eight intrinsic and nine extrinsic injury risk factors. This review highlighted areas for future research that may aid in designing injury risk management strategies for safer trail running participation.PROSPERO registration numberCRD42021240832.

### Exercise-related abdominal complaints in a large cohort of runners: a survey with a particular focus on nutrition [^114CobbV]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The high prevalence rate of AC in the current study confirms earlier observations, although prevalence rates of AC are highly different between studies because of different methodologies, the use of different definitions for exercise-related AC and the different types of events and athletes studied. In earlier studies among distance runners, prevalence rates of 30%–90% have been reported. The higher prevalence among women than men is also in line with earlier observations, as well as the higher prevalence of LAC than UAC. The higher prevalence in women could be explained by ovarian hormones known to modulate gastrointestinal function. The higher prevalence of LAC compared with UAC could be explained by the mechanical bouncing during running, which affect the lower gastrointestinal tract more than the upper gastrointestinal tract.

Quite a few studies on the prevalence of AC have been published. However, the perceived impact of AC is less often reported. In this study, we also evaluated this impact as well as personal experiences with nutrition and AC. About one-third of runners with AC indicated that these complaints sometimes or often/always negatively affected their running training or running in competitions. Although this is a subjective finding, this indicates that AC have a substantial impact on running. Most runners recognised that nutrition could provoke the occurrence of AC. An observation that shares some similarities with dietary triggers reported by IBS patients. Eating before or during exercise was often reported to increase AC; drinking before or during exercise was less often reported to be related. Around 40% of the runners reported taking measures to reduce AC, for example, not eating (too much) just before running, avoiding specific foods or drinks and defecating before running. However, no clear dominant measure was reported and this seems to be very personal. Note that we only asked runners with AC whether they take measures to reduce AC. It could be that runners without AC take measures as well, which can totally prevent AC, and that prevalence rates of AC would be higher and AC would be experienced as more severe if runners do not take measures at all.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^112owug1]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) is a common complaint, which may present either on its own or in association with a functional gastrointestinal disorder. It is likely caused by a variety of, probably partly unknown, etiologies. Effective management of FACP can be challenging owing to the lack of usable diagnostic tools and the availability of a diverse range of treatment approaches. Practical guidance for their selection and use is limited. The objective of this article is to present a working definition of FACP based on expert consensus, and to propose practical strategies for the diagnosis and management of this condition for physicians, pharmacists, and patients. A panel of experts on functional gastrointestinal disorders was convened to participate in workshop activities aimed at defining FACP and agreeing upon a recommended sequence of diagnostic criteria and management recommendations. The key principles forming the foundation of the definition of FACP and suggested management algorithms include the primacy of cramping pain as the distinguishing symptom; the importance of recognizing and acting upon alarm signals of potential structural disease; the recognition of known causes that might be addressed through lifestyle adjustment; and the central role of antispasmodics in the treatment of FACP. The proposed algorithm is intended to assist physicians in reaching a meaningful diagnostic endpoint based on patient-reported symptoms of FACP. We also discuss how this algorithm may be adapted for use by pharmacists and patients.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^113JCwPj]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

DEFINITION OF FACP

The latest Rome IV criteria focus on the diagnosis and overall management of FGIDs rather than on the specific presentation and symptomatic treatment of FACP (Supplemental Digital Content Table 1). Furthermore, although FACP has been reported in the literature without association with a particular disorder,–there is no standardized definition. We, therefore, propose the following definition for FACP:

Definition of FACP:

FACP refers to the sudden occurrence of mild-to-moderate, undulating, and recurring cramping pain in any part of the abdomen, lasting for seconds to minutes or up to a few hours, in the absence of any "red flag" signs/symptoms of structural organic disease or any strong association with defecation (which might indicate IBS), and typically not significantly interfering with daily activities.

FACP could be perceived as reflecting part of the IBS spectrum but without a strong association with bowel irregularities. In situations where FACP is tightly linked with abnormalities of bowel evacuation, a diagnosis of IBS should be suspected, provided that patients fulfill the Rome IV diagnostic criteria.

### Study quality on groin injury management remains low: a systematic review on treatment of groin pain in athletes [^114Wr1Mr]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Level of evidence

The four high-quality studies showed a significant improvement after intervention at the final follow-up or predefined primary outcome time. Table 2 shows the outcomes of the high-quality studies, which all included football players.

There is moderate evidence that:

Active physical training (consisting of adductor and abdominal strengthening, and coordination exercises) is superior to passive physical therapy modalities (consisting of laser, transverse frictions, adductor stretching and electric nerve stimulation) for long-standing adductor-related groin pain.

Multimodal treatment (consisting of adductor warming, a specific manual adductor stretch, static adductor stretches and a return to running programme) enables a quicker return to sports than active physical training (consisting of adductor and abdominal strengthening and coordination exercises, and a running programme) for long-standing adductor-related groin pain.

Partial adductor longus release reduces pain and enables RTP over time for athletes with long-standing adductor-related groin pain.

Laparascopic inguinal surgery (totally extraperitoneal repair) with or without surgical adductor release is more effective than conservative treatment (consisting of various types of adductor and abdominal strengthening and coordination exercises, corticosteroid injections and oral anti-inflammatory analgesics) for long-standing sportsman's hernia with or without 'adductor tendinitis'.

There was limited evidence for all other treatment options that were evaluated in the included studies, as all low-quality studies showed an improvement in time in the intervention groups.

Assessment of perceived exertion, appetite, and gastrointestinal discomfort

RPE values (6–20 Borg scale) were assessed immediately after completion of the WU, TT 30′, and SPRINT. Perceptions of appetite and gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort were rated 6 min after completion of the SPRINT by means of a validated 10-point visual analog scale and a 0–8 Likert scale questionnaire, respectively. Appetite scores were assessed using four questions: "How hungry do you feel?" "How full do you feel?" "How satisfied do you feel?" "How much do you think you could eat now?" GI distress was quantified at the systemic (dizziness, headache, muscle cramp, urge to urinate), upper (reflux, bloating, nausea, vomiting), and lower abdominal (cramps, flatulence, abdominal pain, diarrhea) level.

### Exercise-related abdominal complaints in a large cohort of runners: a survey with a particular focus on nutrition [^112Jejdf]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Exercise-related abdominal complaints (AC) are very common among athletes. Prevalence rates are highly different between studies because of different methodologies, the use of different definitions for exercise-related AC and the different types of events and athletes studied. AC are, in particular, highly prevalent among runners and more common and more severe with high exercise intensity compared with low exercise intensity and with long exercise duration compared with short exercise duration. Prevalence rates of AC in distance runners range from 30% to 90% with the highest rates reported in ultramarathon runners, most likely due to a very high running load, but also due to limited fluid and nutrient intake. Exercise-related AC include among others nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. AC are considered the most common cause of underperformance in endurance events. Besides, AC can also impair subsequent postexercise recovery.

The aetiology of exercise-related AC is multifactorial, with physiological, mechanical and/or nutritional causes. The main physiological factors contributing to AC during exercise are gastrointestinal ischemia due to splanchnic hypoperfusionand reduced overall gastrointestinal functional capacity due to increased sympathetic activation, with increased gastrointestinal permeability and inflammation as a likely consequence. Other physiological factors include alterations in motility, absorption and immune function. Mechanical bouncing may explain the higher prevalence among runners compared with other athletes. Nutritional factors are also known to induce AC during and/or after exercise. Studies have shown that intake of fibre, fat, protein and beverages with high osmolalities (> 500 mOsm/L), especially shortly before or during exercise, is associated with multiple AC. Fluid restriction during exercise and/or dehydration is known to increase gastrointestinal permeability, and as such is also associated with AC. Interestingly, research on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) reveals that regular or habitual dietary factors could trigger AC. Not only cereal-based foods, predominantly bread or its components, but also greasy foods, onions, cabbage and spicy and fried foods are often mentioned. However, the impact of regular or habitual dietary factors is not explored in running-related AC, in contrast to food intake shortly before or during exercise. Knowledge of the role of nutrition, and especially habitual dietary intake, in inducing exercise-related AC is relevant for developing nutritional guidelines and advice aimed at preventing or managing exercise-related AC.

### Non-drug therapies for the secondary prevention of lower limb muscle cramps [^113vNeye]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lower limb muscle cramps are common and painful. They can limit exercise participation, and reduce quality of sleep, and quality of life. Many interventions are available for lower limb cramps; some are controversial or could cause harm, and often, people experience no benefit from the interventions used. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012. We updated the review to incorporate new evidence.

Objectives

To assess the effects of non-drug, non-invasive therapies for lower limb muscle cramps.

Search Methods

In August 2018 and May 2020, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of included studies. We imposed no restrictions by language or publication date.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of non-drug, non-invasive interventions tested over at least four weeks, for lower limb muscle cramps in any group of people, except pregnant women. The primary outcome was cramp frequency. Secondary outcomes were cramp pain severity, cramp duration, health-related quality of life, quality of sleep, participation in activities of daily living, proportion of participants reporting lower limb muscle cramps, and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, and cross-checked data extraction and analyses according to standard Cochrane procedures.

Main Results

We included three trials, with 201 participants, all 50 years of age and older; none had neurological disease. All trials evaluated a form of stretching for lower limb muscle cramps. A combination of daily calf and hamstring stretching for six weeks may reduce the severity of night-time lower limb muscle cramps (measured on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) where 0 = no pain and 10 cm = worst pain imaginable) in people aged 55 years and older, compared to no intervention (mean difference (MD) -1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.74 to -0.86; 1 RCT, 80 participants; low-certainty evidence). The certainty of evidence was very low for cramp frequency (change in number of cramps per night from week zero to week six) comparing the stretching group and the no intervention group (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.8 to -0.6; 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Calf stretching alone for 12 weeks may make little to no difference to the frequency of night-time lower limb muscle cramps in people aged 60 years and older (stretching group median number of cramps in the last four weeks (Md) 4, interquartile range (IQR) 8; N = 48; sham stretching group Md 3, IQR 7.63; N = 46) (U = 973.5, z = -0.995, P = 0.32, r = 0.10; 1 RCT, 94 participants; low-certainty evidence). This trial did not report cramp severity. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of a combination of daily calf, quadriceps, and hamstring stretching on the frequency and severity of leg cramps in 50- to 60-year-old women with metabolic syndrome (N = 24). It was not possible to fully analyse the frequency data and the scale used to measure cramp severity is not validated. No study reported health-related quality of life, quality of sleep, or participation in activities of daily living. No participant in these three studies reported adverse events. The evidence for adverse events was of moderate certainty as the studies were too small to detect uncommon events. In two of the three studies, outcomes were at risk of recall bias, and tools used to measure outcomes were not validated. Due to limitations in study designs that led to risks of bias, and imprecise findings with wide CIs, we cannot be certain that findings of future studies will be similar to those presented in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

A combination of daily calf and hamstring stretching for six weeks may reduce the severity of night-time lower limb muscle cramps in people aged 55 years and older, but the effect on cramp frequency is uncertain. Calf stretching alone compared to sham stretching for 12 weeks may make little or no difference to the frequency of night-time lower limb muscle cramps in people aged 60 years and older. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of a combination of daily calf, quadriceps, and hamstring stretching on the frequency and severity of leg cramps in 50- to 60-year-old women with metabolic syndrome. Overall, use of unvalidated outcome measures and inconsistent diagnostic criteria make it difficult to compare the studies and apply findings to clinical practice. Given the prevalence and impact of lower limb muscle cramps, there is a pressing need to carefully evaluate many of the commonly recommended and emerging non-drug therapies in well-designed RCTs across all types of lower limb muscle cramps. A specific cramp outcome tool should be developed and validated for use in future research.

### Exercise-related abdominal complaints in a large cohort of runners: a survey with a particular focus on nutrition [^115fMnN1]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Specific nutrients, foods or drinks are known to induce AC when consumed shortly before or during exercise, such as fibre, fat, protein and beverages with high osmolalities. We, however, investigated the association of AC with the habitual diet, and not the effect of specific foods consumed before or during running. We observed a few associations between AC and the intake of certain nutrients and food groups. More associations, or differences in intake between runners with and without AC, were observed for LAC compared with UAC, particularly in males. This could be related to the fact that LAC were much more prevalent than UAC, but also to the fact that the habitual diet has likely more impact on (bouncing induced) LAC such as bloating, flatulence, urge to defecate and diarrhoea than typical UAC such as nausea/vomiting and reflux. Remarkably, more associations were observed for men, while complaints were more prevalent and perceived as more severe in women. Typically, men with LAC had a higher intake of energy and all macronutrients, including fibre and food groups such as grain products, nuts, tea and unhealthy choices, while fruit intake was lower than in men without LAC. These higher intakes could be a reflection of a generally larger food consumption, as overall energy intake was also significantly higher. However, body weight was not different between men with and without LAC, but men with LAC were younger and ran at a higher intensity than men without LAC and may therefore have a higher energy expenditure, and hence a higher energy intake to obtain a good energy balance. Food consumption was also higher in men compared with women. So it could be speculated that the amount of food consumed could explain some of our observed associations.

### Dysmenorrhea in adolescents [^1158wHyq]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Studies show that between 41% and 91.5% of young women, school-aged and university-aged, are affected by dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea, which is caused by the production of prostaglandins, is defined as cramping pain in the lower abdomen and/or pelvis occurring just before or during menstruation, in the absence of other diseases such as endometriosis, and typically lasting 1–3 days and with a negative physical examination. Secondary dysmenorrhea presents with similar signs and symptoms but is a result of underlying pelvic pathology, for example endometriosis or uterine fibroids. Dysmenorrhea most typically presents as abdominal cramping; however, it can also present with headaches, nausea, vomiting or other generalized symptoms. The diagnosis is mainly clinical, but other tests such as a pelvic examination, a pregnancy test and STI screening may be helpful in ruling out other sources of pain. Although the mainstay of treatment for dysmenorrhea is NSAIDs and hormonal therapy, lifestyle changes and complementary/alternative medicine can also be helpful approaches. Lifestyle changes include aerobic exercise and stretching, while complementary alternative medicine include peppermint, cinnamon, ginger and other herbs and supplements. Finally, endometriosis must be considered as a potential cause for secondary dysmenorrhea and would warrant a prompt referral to gynecology.

### Physical activity and the gastrointestinal tract [^112SG3z9]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Physical exercise is probably both beneficial and harmful for the gastrointestinal tract, depending partly on the training intensity. On the one hand, gastrointestinal symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, side ache and diarrhoea are common during heavy exercise. On the other hand, physical activity seems to protect from colon cancer, cholelithiasis and diverticular disease. Constipation has been shown to be related to inactivity. Despite this, no overwhelming evidence exists for a positive effect of physical exercise as a treatment option for chronic constipation. The reasons behind these somewhat discrepant effects are not understood fully. Altered gastrointestinal blood flow, effects on gastrointestinal motor function, neuroendocrine changes and mechanical effects are probably involved. Conflicting results exist regarding the effects of physical activity on gastrointestinal motility. Modern technologies now make motility studies in various parts of the gastrointestinal tract possible. More studies are needed to understand better the effects of physical exercise on the gastrointestinal tract. In particular, the relationship between the training intensity and duration and positive and negative alterations in gastrointestinal physiology needs to be addressed further.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of heat illness: 2019 update [^1156dCaX]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Heat illness definitions — 2019 Wilderness Medical Society guidelines categorize hyperthermia, heat edema, heat cramps, heat syncope, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke with explicit features and temperature thresholds. Heat exhaustion is defined as mild to moderate illness due to high environmental heat or strenuous exercise with symptoms including intense thirst, weakness, discomfort, anxiety, dizziness, and syncope; core temperature may be normal or slightly elevated > 37°C (98.6°F) but < 40°C (104°F). It results from exposure to high ambient temperature or strenuous exertion and may progress to heat stroke in a hot environment if untreated. Heat stroke is severe heat illness characterized by a core temperature > 40°C (104°F) with central nervous system abnormalities and is traditionally defined as a core temperature above 40°C (104°F) with central nervous system involvement; it is divided into classic heat stroke from passive heat exposure and exertional heat stroke during strenuous exercise. The guideline cautions that absolute temperature thresholds should not be routinely applied to asymptomatic individuals because studies of asymptomatic runners found 15 to 56% with core temperatures ≥ 40°C and 11% ≥ 42°C. Additional category definitions include hyperthermia as a rise in body temperature above the hypothalamic set point when heat-dissipating mechanisms are impaired or overwhelmed, heat edema as dependent extremity swelling due to interstitial fluid pooling, heat cramps as exercise-associated painful involuntary muscle contractions during or immediately after exercise, and heat syncope as transient loss of consciousness with spontaneous return to normal mentation.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^116UPRpu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for emergency department visits, with many patients not receiving a definitive diagnosis for their symptoms. Non-gastrointestinal causes need to be considered in the workup of abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion is needed in order to develop a broad differential, and a thorough history and physical examination is paramount. This article will discuss some of these diagnoses, including can't miss diagnoses, common non-abdominal causes, and rare etiologies of abdominal pain.

BURDEN OF FACP

Statement:

Health care professionals, including specialists, PCPs/GPs, and pharmacists, should be aware of FACP, the impact it can have on sufferers, and how to manage symptoms.

Comments

FGIDs, many of which may be associated with FACP, are extremely common and can have a negative impact on the quality of life of sufferers and incur a substantial health care burden in terms of an increase in the consumption of medical therapies, a greater requirement for abdominal surgery, and additional medical consultations/referrals.–The recently published global Rome Foundation epidemiological study of 73,076 people, based on the new Rome IV classification, found that 40.3% of respondents who completed the internet survey and 20.7% of those who completed the household survey met the criteria for at least 1 FGID. The prevalence of FGIDs was 1.3 to 1.7 times higher in women than in men.

FACP is frequently reported by patients either on its own or in conjunction with FGIDs. The true prevalence of FACP, in isolation from bowel movement irregularities, is difficult to ascertain because, up until now, there has been no uniform definition of FACP. Although definitions do vary, survey data suggest that the prevalence of FACP in the general population may range from 10% to 46%. In an internet-based, observational study of 720 women with abdominal pain, cramping, and discomfort, symptoms of FACP were reported to interfere with some respondents' daily activities (44% reported disruption very often/often), work and sleep quality, and social activities. Furthermore, in a large survey of IBS sufferers conducted by the American Gastroenterology Association, abdominal pain was identified as one of the most bothersome disease symptoms and a symptom that should be addressed. As well as impacting on patient quality of life, abdominal pain is also a most common reason for primary care consultation, with a mean consultation prevalence of 2.8% reported in a systematic review of 14 symptom-evaluating studies on abdominal pain in the general practice setting.

### Exercise-related abdominal complaints in a large cohort of runners: a survey with a particular focus on nutrition [^114DnjWp]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Results

Study population

A total of 3643 runners expressed their interest for the study. From these, 2118 runners completed both questionnaires. Five runners were excluded because they were younger than 18 years or did not report their age. A total of 69 runners were excluded because they did not run, or would not have run if not injured, at least once a week in the past year. Finally, 51 runners were excluded because they reported implausible dietary intake. A total of 1993 runners (891 men, 1095 women, 5 gender neutral, 2 who did not fill in their gender) were included in the study.

The median (25th–75th percentile) age for the total population was 44 (34–54) years. Most runners (76%) considered their running level intermediate, and about half of the runners (49%) ran for at least 10 years. The median number of running sessions per week was 3 (2–4), and the median distance covered per week was 30 (20–42) km. A more detailed overview of personal and running characteristics is presented in online supplemental table 1.

The median energy intake in the total population was 2095 (1700–2538) kcal. Energy and macronutrient intake were higher in men than women. Regarding intake of food groups, men consumed more grain products, legumes, dairy, fats and oils, meat, sweetened beverages and fruit juices, alcohol and unhealthy choices (eg, cakes and cookies, sweets, snacks), while women consumed more vegetables, fruit and tea. A detailed overview of energy, macronutrient and food group intake is presented in online supplemental table 2.

### Rectus sheath hematoma caused by non-contact strenuous exercise mimicking acute appendicitis [^114JniVo]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

A healthy 26-year-old man visited the Emergency Department due to right lower quadrant pain of 2 days' duration that developed after wakeboarding. There was no history of direct trauma to the abdomen. Physical examination revealed tenderness and rebound tenderness on the right lower quadrant area. There was no palpable abdominal mass. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen was undertaken to discern the causes of acute abdomen, including acute appendicitis. CT revealed a small-size rectus sheath hematoma beneath the lower end of the right rectus muscle. The patient was admitted for supportive care including pain control and was discharged with improvement after 5 days. Rectus sheath hematoma can be caused by not only a direct blow but also non-contact strenuous exercise, for example, wakeboarding in this case. Although the majority of rectus sheath hematomas are self-limiting, some can cause peritoneal irritation signs, mimicking acute abdomen, and eventually lead to unnecessary laparotomy without clinical suspicion and ancillary tests including CT scan and ultrasonography.

### Exercise for dysmenorrhoea [^115vfXS8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Dysmenorrhoea is characterised by cramping lower abdominal pain that may radiate to the lower back and upper thighs and is commonly associated with nausea, headache, fatigue and diarrhoea. Physical exercise has been suggested as a non-medical approach to the management of these symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the effectiveness of exercise in the treatment of dysmenorrhoea.

Search Strategy

A search was conducted using the methodology of the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (August 2009). CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched. Handsearching of relevant bibliographies and reference lists was also conducted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing exercise with a control or no intervention in women with dysmenorrhoea.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trials were independently selected and data extracted by two review authors.

Main Results

Four potential trials were identified of which one was included in the review. The available data could only be included as a narrative description. There appeared to be some evidence from the trial that exercise reduced the Moos' Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ) score during the menstrual phase (P < 0.05) and resulted in a sustained decrease in symptoms over the three observed cycles (P < 0.05).

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this review are limited to a single randomised trial of limited quality and with a small sample size. The data should be interpreted with caution and further research is required to investigate the hypothesis that exercise reduces the symptoms associated with dysmenorrhoea.

### American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: pharmacological management of chronic idiopathic constipation [^114rMMwy]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults — senna: Recommendation 6 states that in adults with CIC, the panel suggests the use of senna over management without senna. Implementation considerations state that while the trials were conducted for 4 wk, longer term use is probably appropriate, but data are needed to better understand tolerance and side effects; the dose evaluated in trials is higher than commonly used doses in practice, the panel suggests starting at lower dose and increase if no response; and abdominal pain and cramping may occur with a higher dose of senna.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^115WnXiZ]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

WMS CPG on anaphylaxis — clinical manifestations and diagnostic criteria are summarized with World Allergy Organization (WAO) 2020 guidance: Anaphylaxis is a systemic reaction, usually of rapid onset, that progresses to affect multiple organ systems. The World Allergy Organization proposed that anaphylaxis be diagnosed when 1 of 2 criteria is met in the context of known or highly probable allergen exposure: cutaneous or mucosal signs that occur suddenly, progress within minutes to hours, and are accompanied by respiratory compromise, hypotension, or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms; or acute onset of hypotension or respiratory compromise, including severe bronchospasm or laryngeal involvement, even in the absence of skin involvement. As exceptions, the diagnosis of exercise-induced anaphylaxis does not require exposure to an environmental allergen, and symptoms of α-gal allergy typically develop 3 to 5 h after ingestion. Cutaneous or mucosal involvement is the most frequent sign of anaphylaxis, but skin involvement is not required for the diagnosis; up to 10 to 20% of anaphylaxis cases have absent or unrecognized skin and mucosal findings. Respiratory involvement can present as sneezing, nasal congestion, cough, hoarse voice, angioedema, bronchospasm, wheezing, stridor, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, while common gastrointestinal and cardiovascular features include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramping, diarrhea, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, syncope, chest pain, and hypotension.

### Lower limb myalgias in a man who used to "climb the stairs": an atypical abdominal aortic aneurysm [^11442Qpj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Atypical presentation of emergency abdominal aortic aneurysm comprises a wide spectrum of symptoms. Lower limbs' involvement is infrequent, usually monolateral and with clear vascular features. We report the case of a 58-year-old patient who complained exclusively about symmetric lower limb myalgias without vascular features, after having repeatedly climbed the stairs of the school he worked in. The surprising final diagnosis was of rupturing abdominal aortic aneurysm; the patient was sent to emergency surgery and survived.
